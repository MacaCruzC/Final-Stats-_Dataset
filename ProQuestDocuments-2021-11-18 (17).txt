Texto completo: When Bill Buckner died last week, I mentioned on Twitter that he had handled his fielding-error-induced infamy with class and also that it was a good thing social media had not been around for the flub. Outrage pile-ons and shame-storms used to be a dry heat: often excessive, but you could still find shelter in the shade. Now they’re more like humid summer climes: The air itself is saturated with the stuff, no matter where you stand.
Everyone understands that it’s unfair for an athlete to be known for his worst moment, but that’s life. What happened to Buckner is an order of magnitude worse, because the reputation he developed after flubbing a ground ball in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series isn’t merely “not who he is.” It’s the opposite. The Buckner flogging is the best example of the worst instincts of fandom and celebrity culture.
“Buckner” became a sort of synonym for unreliability. Yet the truth is, if anything characterized Buckner’s career, it was an almost preternatural reliability. “On Sunday, the last full day of Bill Buckner's life, 16 major leaguers struck out at least three times. Buckner played 22 seasons and never did it once,” tweeted New York Times baseball writer Tyler Kepner. Jayson Stark from the Athletic added: “What a shame that Bill Buckner is only remembered for his worst moment as a baseball player. What he really was, was a pure hitter,” one of only five players who had 5,500 at-bats from 1972 to 1982 with a batting average of .300 or better. Two of the others: Pete Rose and Rod Carew. Buckner’s “4.5 percent career strikeout rate ranks third among the 237 players who have batted at least 7,500 times since 1950. The only players with a lower rate are Hall of Famers Nellie Fox and Tony Gwynn,” wrote MLB.com’s Matt Kelly.
It didn’t matter. “ESPN, the AP, and the Washington Post all led news of Bill Buckner’s death with his World Series error,” read a headline on one popular sports blog. In this respect, MLB.com had it right. The headline on Kelly’s piece? “Batting champ, All-Star Buckner dies at 69.”

Trump's two-front attack on climate change science faces challenges

Texto completo: The Trump administration is fighting on two fronts to help justify its deregulatory agenda in court, downplaying both the damage from climate change and the public health benefits of environmental rules.
This month, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to propose new rules for regulatory cost-benefit analysis that critics fear could undermine the agency's regulation of climate pollution by saying it costs too much.
At the same time, the agency plans to reexamine how government scientists study the consequences of climate change by potentially limiting consideration of worst-case projections.
Legal experts critical of the Trump administration’s deregulatory approach say the maneuvers together are designed to weaken legal and public scrutiny of the damages from its pro-business, hands-off approach to climate change.
“This is an across the board effort to find a way to sideline facts and science that are inconvenient to the administration’s thesis that any regulation has some cost to industry,” said David Hayes, executive director of the State Energy and Environment Impact Center, a coalition that assists state attorneys general contesting President Trump’s deregulatory agenda. “They are playing games to obscure the reality of how serious the climate situation is, and how damaging their pro-fossil fuel agenda is.”
The Trump administration has justified its review of cost-benefit analysis and climate change modeling by arguing previous administrations have overstated the cost of carbon emissions and underestimated the impact of regulations to state and local economies.
When making major regulations, the EPA must weigh the public health benefits of a rule and its cost to society at large.
The Obama administration, in writing major regulations such as the Clean Power Plan that aimed to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, relied heavily on counting “co-benefits” resulting from the rule reducing other pollutants. The Trump administration argues co-benefits overstate the intended impact of a rule directed at a specific pollutant, such as carbon.
“The Obama administration misused cost-benefit analysis as a way to promote their regulatory agenda on climate change,” said Jeffrey Holmstead, a former deputy administrator of the EPA in the George W. Bush administration who represents energy industry clients at the Bracewell law firm. “If the Trump administration does a careful job to change the analysis, it will make it harder for future administration to claim unrealistically high benefits or low costs.”
Other experts said the Trump administration’s effort would be challenged and blocked in court.
Democratic attorneys general have already successfully challenged the Trump administration, with judges finding the government has not always followed proper legal procedures and laws to unwind environmental regulations and has failed to justify its actions.
“This fraudulent attack on co-benefits is also very unlikely to succeed in court,” said Richard Revesz, an environmental law professor at New York University. “It's totally crazy to promote a rule that says the indirect consequences of a regulation must be taken into account if they are negative, but can be ignored if they are positive. That seems like the textbook definition of arbitrary and capricious conduct.”
John D. Graham, dean of the Indiana University O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, agrees with Revesz.
Graham said the Trump administration must prove its weaker regulations do enough to fulfill a government legal finding, upheld by the Supreme Court, that says carbon dioxide is a pollutant endangering public health and the EPA must regulate it under the Clean Air Act.
“There are no shortcuts here,” said Graham, a former head of regulatory affairs in George W. Bush’s Office of Management and Budget. “The Trump EPA will have to supply a strong cost-benefit justification for the deregulatory actions on climate change, regardless of what happens down the road.”
Critics say the Trump administration has an uphill battle in proving the cost savings of its weaker regulations outweigh the public health damages.
A report produced by the State Energy & Environment Impact Center in March found the savings to industry of some of the key Trump administration deregulatory moves “are minuscule in comparison to the public costs of these rollbacks.”
Legal experts said the Trump administration could encounter similar problems with its review of climate change modeling.
The Trump administration, the New York Times reported this week, is seeking to ensure worst-case scenario projections “will not automatically” be included in scientific reports produced by the government projecting the impacts of climate change.
The administration is primarily targeting the National Climate Assessment, a report required by Congress and produced every four years by scientists from 13 government agencies.
Trump administration officials have sought to downplay the findings of the latest version of the report released last year, which included scenarios showing that global warming will impose hundreds of billions of dollars of damages on the U.S. economy.
James Hewitt, an EPA spokesman, denied the agency is currently undertaking a “specific effort” to block worst case scenarios from future climate assessments, but he confirmed the agency is concerned about how the reports are developed.
“The previous use of inaccurate modeling that focuses on worst-case emission scenarios, that does not reflect real-world conditions, needs to be thoroughly reexamined and tested if such information is going to serve as the scientific foundation of nationwide decision-making now and in the future,” Hewitt said.
Legal experts say EPA’s scrutiny of worst case scenarios reflects a desire by the agency to minimize the consequences of its pro-fossil fuel deregulatory agenda, which could worsen climate change.
“The term ‘worse case scenario’ suggests it is highly unlikely to happen, but this is an administration that is hawking fossil fuels left and right," Hayes said. “They want to take out from the National Climate Assessment the scenario that assumes a continued reliance on fossil fuels.”
Graham also predicted efforts to limit the scope of the National Climate Assessment would backfire.
“Until they have a well-argued position, dropping those scenarios is more likely to hurt rather than help the administration in judicial proceedings, since pro-regulation advocates will point to the dropping as additional evidence that the administration has its head in the ground on climate science,” Graham said.

Heisler: Lakers’ ongoing comedy shows organization built on nepotism, cronyism

Texto completo: Oh yeah, the Finals.
The NBA season is supposed to lead dramatically to this point but was widely believed to be over before it started with the Warriors coming off three titles in four seasons … having lost the one in 2016 after leading the Cavaliers 3-1… with no LeBron James-led contender arising in the East to worry about.
Instead, it’s the Toronto Raptors with their star/upcoming free agent, Kawhi Leonard, and trash-talking rapper/co-owner, Drake, representing the East and, in an upset, taking a 1-0 lead.
Unfortunately, Leonard played hurt last series as his uncle/adviser, Dennis Robertson, told Yahoo’s Chris Haynes (“You could clearly see he was in pain.”)
Nor did Kawhi look too bouncy in Game 1, scoring 23 points and shooting 5 for 14 from the field.
So, lead or no lead, good luck, Raptors!
The matchup looked so one-sided, Warriors players were being asked before it started if Steph Curry would finally be the Finals MVP … based, of course, on the assumption that injured Kevin Durant won’t be a major factor and that wouldn’t matter to the team.
Meanwhile, the New York Times’ Marc Stein introduced his plan for the anticipated walkover: multiple postseason tournaments like European soccer teams.
Compounding the absurdity, Commissioner Adam Silver told Stein that a second “cup” was “in the conceptual phase.”
As if the league needs a new attraction with a boffo comedy going as Magic Johnson continued to bash the Lakers while pledging undying love to them?
It was another crazy week with ESPN.com’s Baxter Holmes producing a 6,500-word opus on Johnson’s misbegotten era … while ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith melted down on the air, decrying his own company’s story.
Smith is Magic’s guy at The Wide World of Sports. As Stephen A. actually noted, he was embarrassed to have Johnson coming in the same day Holmes’ piece ran, in which Magic was alleged to be an abusive boss who had several Lakers staffers resigning and/or taking anti-anxiety medication.
Ranted Stephen A. in Johnson’s defense:
“Oh my god! Let’s get the ax! Let’s take Magic Johnson to the guillotine!”
Of course, with Johnson determined to keep going on the air to defend himself, these coincidences in timing are becoming common … like the week before when Magic went on to call GM Rob Pelinka a back-stabber, the same day the Lakers introduced Coach Frank Vogel in their first press conference since Johnson’s resignation 41 days before.
In the part we didn’t know before, Holmes reported James’ agent, Rich Paul, waged a season-long campaign against Coach Luke Walton.
This was confirmed by Silver, himself. In an early-season chance meeting, the commissioner said Paul told him something to the effect of, “Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.”
Assuming that Paul’s opinions followed James’, and Johnson’s followed LeBron’s, this explains why Magic went off on Walton at the seven-game mark, turning Luke into a lame duck.
LeBron knows he’s held to the highest standards and has done this before, trying and failing to get Erik Spoelstra fired in Miami, succeeding in getting David Blatt fired in Cleveland.
In this, James was joined by Johnson, feeling exposed after his controversial decisions to forego shooters and sign eccentrics such as JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley.
Not that Magic was supposed to take orders from James. With LeBron locked up for three seasons, it was the other way around.
It was Johnson’s job to make James understand they might have to sacrifice this season to finish rebuilding after saving a maximum salary slot and bringing in so many veterans on one-year deals.
What Magic wasn’t supposed to do was go off on Walton before Thanksgiving on LeBron’s behalf, undercutting what little stability they had.
Of course, conveying that message meant realizing it, himself. By all accounts, Magic didn’t, talking of building for the future while challenging Golden State at the same time.
A Lakers staffer told Holmes he didn’t know if Johnson had a plan. Actually, Magic did … or LeBron did … and it was a dilly: Trade for Anthony Davis, off-loading enough salary to save their max slot for another star free agent to put alongside James.
Unfortunately for Magic, it proved impossible with New Orleans blaming the Lakers for their heavy-handed, obviously LeBron-driven, wooing of A.D.
Worst of all for Johnson, he wasn’t working at the Lakers job full-time and couldn’t live it down when it got into the press.
“And last but not least, lazy?” Magic told Stephen A. last week, re-framing the charge into one he could lampoon.
“I have built a $600 million business. You can not be lazy going from basketball and winning five championships. … I wasn’t lazy as a player and I’m not lazy as a CEO and a business owner. That’s never going to happen.”
Of course, no one said he was lazy. The charge was that he wasn’t often in the Lakers’ office, which he hasn’t addressed.
Holmes, noting Johnson’s many business interests, suggests he was in their office “once a week or every two weeks.”
Infrequent as that was, it could have been OK if Johnson had a smooth working relationship with an experienced No. 2 man who assigned all the detail work.
Imagine if Jeanie Buss had kept GM Mitch Kupchak, who had all the qualifications, instead of lumping Mitch in with her brother, Jim, when she fired him.
The No. 2 man became Pelinka, an agent, hired at the suggestion of his client, Kobe Bryant, neither of whom had front office experience.
As for Johnson’s inconceivable charge of being stabbed in the back … still unspecified aside from citing “little things that bothered me” … he had more than two seasons with Pelinka. If loyalty was an issue, Magic should have been able to tell long before.
Unfortunately for the Lakers and Jeanie, who kept Pelinka, Rob is now lumped in with Johnson in the press, as if he was Magic’s partner in crime … setting up Pelinka as the scapegoat for the next thing that goes wrong.
Actually, Pelinka looks more like another of the staffers Magic ran roughshod over.
Pelinka, reported Holmes, survived with the avid support of Jeanie’s best friend and new Lakers power player, Linda Rambis.
Now to see how long any of them, Rob and/or Linda, last.
If there’s a silver lining for Lakers fans, it’s that the heat in the press is exposing an organization run on nepotism and cronyism, which Jeanie might finally be obliged to recognize and professionalize.
Of course, that suggests more misadventures await in the meantime so buckle up.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In 1968, a young sportswriter named Brent Musburger wrote a column for a newspaper called The Chicago American on the protests of John Carlos and Tommie Smith, who raised their black-gloved fists on the podium after winning medals in the 200-meter sprint in the Summer Olympics in Mexico City.
The headline on Musburger's story, according to The Nation, was "Bizarre Protest by Smith, Carlos Tarnishes Medals." The notable line from Musburger, 29 at the time: "Smith and Carlos looked like a couple of black-skinned storm troopers."
Fifty-one years later, during a panel discussion Thursday about athletes and activism hosted by The Atlantic, Carlos was asked by moderator Jemele Hill whether he ever received an apology from Musburger for that column. Musburger, of course, went on to become a renowned sports commentator for ABC and ESPN, among others.
"Well you know, Brent Musburger doesn't even exist in my mind. So I don't even know," Carlos said to applause. "He didn't mean anything to me 51 years ago. He doesn't mean anything to me today. Because he's been proven to be wrong."
Musburger, 80, could not immediately be reached for comment. In a 1999 interview, he told The New York Times his column was "a bit harsh" while continuing to question the effect of the protest.
"Did it improve anything?" Musburger told the Times. "Smith and Carlos aside, I object to using the Olympic awards stand to make a political statement."
Musburger, who works for sports gambling network VSiN and is the radio play-by-play voice of the NFL's Raiders, referred to Carlos' and Smith's protests in his 1968 column as "a juvenile gesture by a couple of athletes who should have known better."

Texto completo: Maybe it was a presidential epiphany. More likely, it was a Twitter miscue.
Either way, President Trump appeared to concede for the first time Thursday that Russian intelligence agents tried to help him win the 2016 election, as the U.S. intelligence community has concluded -- a reversal of his long-held claims.
Trump later reversed himself again, but the episode highlighted the difficulty he faces rejecting the official assessment, backed up by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's recent investigation and two grand jury indictments, that the Kremlin deployed a combination of fake news stories, phony social media accounts and hacked Democratic Party documents intended to damage Hillary Clinton and help Trump.

Speaking to reporters, Trump also claimed Mueller was "totally conflicted" and a "true never-Trumper" who led a biased probe -- a curious claim since he has repeatedly praised Mueller's 448-page final report for, in his own eyes, fully exonerating him of any wrongdoing.
He added that Mueller -- who was FBI director from 2001 to 2013 -- wanted to lead the bureau again but the president told him no. "He's somebody who didn't get a job that he wanted very badly," Trump said. No evidence suggests that is true.
Trump is loath to acknowledge that the Kremlin put its thumb on the scale in 2016, insisting against all independent evidence that the story was made up by sore losers in the Democratic Party to discredit his victory.
But he seemed to acknowledge reality in his tweets Thursday, a day after Mueller warned of "multiple systematic efforts to interfere in our election" and urged Americans to do more to protect future elections.
Amid angry tweets about Mueller's inquiry, Trump wrote, "I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected. It was a crime that didn't exist."
Reporters and Democratic lawmakers immediately seized on the phrase "helping me get elected."
"The president is acknowledging that a foreign power helped get him elected," tweeted Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.). "This isn't a joke."
She then urged Trump to sign onto a bill intended to shield elections from foreign interference, something Trump has resisted.
Trump deleted the uncharacteristic tweets minutes after posting them, suggesting he had misspoken. But then he reposted them, fixing a misspelling of the word "accusation," but leaving the phrase "helping me get elected" intact.
So did he really mean it?
Later, talking to reporters outside the White House, he was asked to clarify.
"Russia didn't help me at all," Trump said, returning to his old talking point. "Russia, if anything, I think, helped the other side."
There is no evidence that Russia tried to help Clinton's campaign.
Trump didn't stop there. He raised prior claims that Mueller had a conflict of interest because of an old dispute over membership fees at Trump's golf club in Virginia. His advisors have told him that Mueller's request for a refund on his club dues did not amount to a conflict.
Mueller is a registered Republican and his views of Trump are unknown beyond his refusal to clear him of a crime. "If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so," Mueller said Wednesday at the Justice Department.
Trump also confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that the White House had tried to keep the John S. McCain, a Navy destroyer, "out of sight" when he toured Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan on Tuesday. The president said he did not direct his aides to conceal the ship's name, but didn't seem bothered that they did.
"John McCain -- I wasn't a fan, but I would never do a thing like that," Trump told reporters. "Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him, OK? And they were well-meaning, I will say. I didn't know anything about it."
Meghan McCain said on ABC's "The View" that Trump's attacks on her late father, a longtime Republican senator from Arizona and the GOP's 2008 presidential nominee, "creates a culture" in which service members are "clearly fearful" to wear hats or display banners with McCain's name. "The president's actions have consequences," she said.
Trump remains furious at House probes into his finances and businesses, and apparently by the growing number of Democrats, including several running for president, calling for his impeachment. He said impeachment was a "dirty, filthy, disgusting word."
Much of Trump's newest frustration stemmed from Mueller's statement on Wednesday. Saying he didn't intend to speak again on the matter, Mueller reiterated that his report did not exonerate Trump on obstruction charges and said he declined to weigh in on whether Trump committed a crime only because Justice Department rules prevented it.
Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, blamed the confusion over Trump's Russia tweets on the media, lashing out at the New York Times for posting a story suggesting Trump now agrees with Mueller's view of the 2016 election.
"The editors at @nytimes want nothing more than to take one typo and have it redefine 10,000 on the record comments," Parscale wrote on Twitter. "Disgusting and unprofessional!"
But it's hard to say it was just a typo. If anything, it's a reminder that Trump's unfiltered tweets, often written as he watches Fox News, can be hard to interpret. Administration officials have at times called them official policy, while former Chief of Staff John F. Kelly said the only way to perform his job was to ignore them.
Not only are they rife with spelling and grammatical errors, they often veer into political commentary or momentary reactions to news and opinion segments.
Asked last year to explain how seriously to take the tweets, Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said, "You know by the result."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In the afternoon on Oct. 25, Jason Stallman received a text message: "I have a potential story for you."
It was Katie Benner, who covers the Justice Department for The New York Times, alerting Mr. Stallman, the editor of "The Weekly," a new TV show from The Times, about an education fraud investigation that Ms. Benner and Erica L. Green were trying to break before a competitor.
They were writing an article about a Louisiana school accused of submitting fraudulent college applications for its students and even of abusing them, and Ms. Benner wondered if it would make a compelling video narrative for "The Weekly." They met that same day, "and we were off and running," Mr. Stallman said.
Eight months, three trips to Louisiana, dozens of interviews and 60 hours of filming later, the story became the first episode of "The Weekly," premiering Sunday on FX and Monday on Hulu.
In the episode, viewers will watch the story of the school, T.M. Landry College Preparatory, unfold as Ms. Benner and Ms. Green meet with students who risk their futures to tell the truth, often in emotional interviews in their homes. The episode also depicts something that often does not make it into conversations about investigative journalism: the behind-the-scenes turmoil of reporters who worry that their coverage will do more damage to the victims of abuse than to its perpetrators.
"I'm not going to lie," Ms. Green says onscreen as she sits at Ms. Benner's dining table, with her face in her hands. "Over the weekend, I had a few moments where I was like, 'Can I do this? I don't know if I can do this."'
The reporters' experiences are not the central focus of the show, which tells stories that include original reporting for "The Weekly," follow-ups on Times journalism and more. But the show does elevate their expertise to center stage.
"We think that one of the distinguishing features of this show will certainly be the reporters and how they navigate these stories," Mr. Stallman said. "These reporters are not robots. They're human beings who are torturing themselves to be as careful and conscientious as possible."
There is no host of "The Weekly," a choice its creators debated for months. Instead, different reporters who know their beats well lead audiences through the reporting process, the meaning of a story and the debates behind it.
"The Weekly" was sold to FX in May 2018, and it came as a natural follow-up to The Times's runaway-hit podcast "The Daily," said Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor who helped to create both. "We've got people who are on the ground all over the world," he said, "and we should show our audience what it's like there and what our reporters do."
"We spent a long time thinking about what we wanted to achieve with this show," Mr. Dolnick added. One thing was clear from the beginning: It would not be a traditional news show, running through the week's major headlines.
Instead, Mr. Dolnick said, each episode aims to tell "a story that we're putting on the map that our newsroom found," often with investigative aspects and subject matter that touches on the biggest conversations of the moment. Episodes in the first season follow New York's taxi medallion bubble, terrorism in Tajikistan, the separation of two parents from their infant at the United States' southern border and President Trump's inauguration, among other things.
And although the show is deeply rooted in Times journalism, not every compelling print article translates to video. In a narrative documentary, audiences "want to see something happening and unfolding in front of the camera," typically with access to the story's major characters, said Liz Day, a senior story editor.
In the case of the T.M. Landry episode, those characters are the parents and students who spoke out against the school -- like Nyjal Mitchell, who said that when he was 14, Michael Landry, who runs the school, assaulted him. He filed a police report, and said he and his family were the victims of a smear campaign by Mr. Landry. This time, he was not alone in going public, and his voice traveled farther than it had before.
"Getting to watch him speak his truth and come forward and try to clear his name was so powerful, and it was so special that we got to capture it on camera," Samantha Stark, a producer, said. "It's a whole different thing to watch the expression on the child's face when they're telling the story."
The T.M. Landry story was also a way to chip away at larger topics -- in this case, education, race and the myths of meritocracy. The show's producers aim to touch on complicated themes with each episode. "This is exactly the sort of story we want to tackle," said Mat Skene, one of the show's executive producers, "because you think you know something" -- in this case, an inspiring school sending its predominantly black, working-class students to the nation's most elite universities -- "but it's actually something else."
In the end, no former T.M. Landry student in college that The Times knows of was punished or dismissed over the article's revelations. And for some of them, publication was a proud moment or represented the lifting of a burden.
Around 5 a.m. on Nov. 30, the crew of "The Weekly" collected about 10 copies of that day's New York Times in Breaux Bridge, La., and visited students' homes as they saw the article in print for the first time. That night, they headed to the Mitchell family's home, camera in tow, as Nyjal and his sister Sanaa were getting ready for bed.
To the family's surprise, the article had made the front page -- along with Nyjal's picture.
Sanaa looked at her brother in their living room as he scanned the paper in shock. "I'm proud of him," she said.
Reflecting on that moment, Alexandra Garcia, a senior story producer, said: "The way she looks at him, you don't even need to have words. You just feel it."

Here's my billionaire's guide to saving money

Texto completo: Frugality is in my bones.
From attending a community college before public university to living with my wife in a stunning tree house that I built from salvaged materials to driving my 15-year-old Volvo – I've always avoided expensive stuff.
Here are my sometimes silly cheapskate tricks I've collected from a long life of adventures, at home and abroad.
At home and work: A 1/2-inch binder clip beats any wallet. It holds cash, credit cards, and the rest. It's smaller – takes less pocket space so it's more comfortable – and costs basically nothing.
New suits and dress shirts? I've always gotten the cheapest machine washable available, these days via Amazon. Saving here never stopped me from becoming wealthy. You'll never get rich via looks – unless it's Hollywood or by marrying rich.
I'm a compulsive walker. By visiting a good cobbler before they're shot, dress shoes last virtually forever. Over the decades, you'll save big by avoiding buying shoes repeatedly. Good cobblers can handle leather and luggage repairs; so my classic briefcase looks 5 years old but is now over 25.
I haven't suffered a barber in over 40 years. Cutting your own hair saves money and time, big time. I use scissors and comb, like barbers. But self-cutting kits are easy and cheap online.
Anyone can save hundreds to thousands via energy savers like dropping your thermostat five degrees at night while using an electric blanket. (Google: "home energy savers.")
Things I never leave home without: Paper clips can multitask. When a zipper pull-tab breaks, on pants, suitcase, whatever – the clip threads through the zipper's hole. Works for months. I've never, ever replaced it on one pair of pants. I have large clips permanently zippering my beloved old suitcase. They're as comfortable as manufacturer's tabs.
But $15 buys enough zipper repair gear online for permanent fix-its. Paper clips also make temporary fasteners (like a chain link or key chain). With one end straightened, they make great pokers – or a hook to pull – when things get stuck in small awkward places. Safety pins make great fasteners, too.
Duct tape fixes almost anything. Stuck inside clothing it patches most rips temporarily – avoiding embarrassment. Learn to sew and carry traveler's kits. They're tiny and cheap. These fix-its salvage clothes, otherwise destroyed, and lets you keep truckin'. I learned sewing via my Boy Scout merit badge days. It has paid off endlessly. And one tiny super glue is super useful and indispensable for so many breaks.
Online $3-to-$12 buys a foreign made metal nail clipper with a 2-inch knife blade hidden inside – which makes it through airport security. A blade is oh-so handy traveling.
Finally, wherever you are: Google the phrase, "learning to sleep well anywhere, anytime." It's an art form. Makes life comfier. Saves money, too. How? Get the very cheapest, clean, safe hotels – and only be in them for sleeping and hygiene. Get out and do stuff. You're not traveling to stare at fancy, expensive hotel walls. Motel 6? OK, but Motel 5 1/4 will do.
My biggest, best money saver and cheapskate trick? Never get divorced. Commit to learn to fix each other when broken. My boss and I almost killed each other repeatedly when young. Fix it; you'll be glad later you did.
Pay up for quality where it really counts; like top-tier health care. Otherwise, it's just blowing money down some rat hole. You won't become a multibillionaire by saving money. But saving a little along the way never hurts.

Airbnb looks set to come off Florida blacklist

Texto completo: TALLAHASSEE  Florida officials are scheduled to remove Airbnb from a log of blacklisted companies roughly two months after the company reversed itself over allowing listings in Israeli settlements.

State officials will recommend next month that Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Cabinet remove Airbnb from the Floridas list of scrutinized companies, corporations that are banned from entering into agreements with state agencies or local governments.

DeSantis has already said he supports removing Airbnb from the list, mentioning it multiple times during his high-profile trip to Israel this week.

I dont want to penalize a company for doing the right thing, DeSantis said. They made a bad decision but they rectified the error and thats what we want to see.

The Airbnb flap comes at a time of heightened partisanship on the issue of Israel. DeSantis, who is describing his Israeli trip

as a trade mission, is expected to sign a bill that would require schools to prohibit anti-Semitism and broadly define what the offense is by including accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel.

Meanwhile, Democratic senators have accused President Donald Trump, who endorsed DeSantis, of fomenting hatred that has led to shootings at two synagogues in the last year.

And while Democrats and Republicans have accused Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota of using anti-Semitic tropes, anti-Semitism is rising on the far right in America and in Europe, most notably during the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, where men wielding tiki torches shouted Jews will not replace us.

But why was Airbnb on the list in the first place?

DeSantis led the charge to add the home-rental company to the scrutinized companies list in January, after Airbnb in November announced it would remove 200 listings from Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

The company was urged to delist in the contested territory by both Palestinian officials and the nonprofit Human Rights Watch, which had written a report accusing the company of helping make West Bank settlements more profitable and therefore sustainable.

Airbnb said it was removing the listings because the settlements were at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.

Airbnbs decision drew opposition from Israeli leaders and conservative politicians, including DeSantis, who equate criticism of Israel or its foreign policy to anti-Semitism. They accused Airbnb of taking part in the boycott, divestment, sanctions movement, known widely as BDS, which seeks to end international support for Israels oppression of Palestinians, according to the movements website.

The company clarified its stance, pointing out that its not taking part in the boycott movement because it still offered its service in Israel. It was only in the settlements, company officials said, that it was removing its service.

But that explanation didnt dissuade DeSantis, who has made championing Israel a priority in his early governorship. In January, he quickly moved to add the company to Floridas list of scrutinized companies.

What other companies are on the states scrutinized list?

In addition to companies that boycott Israel, the ban also applies to companies that have various dealings with Cuba, Syria and Iran.

Thats led to more than 60 companies making into the list, many based in China and Russia. But most of them are obscure, with the possible exception of the Russian oil and gas giant Gazprom.

Airbnb is by far the best-known company on the list.

Was Airbnb hurt by being on Floridas scrutinized list?

It appears not, beyond a little bad publicity.

Being on the list didnt prevent Airbnb from operating in Florida.

It did prevent state agencies from investing in Airbnb. But Airbnb isnt publicly traded, so that issue was moot.

If anything, Airbnbs placement on the scrutinized list was more of an inconvenience for state officials than the company. Because its on the list, the company cant enter into agreements worth $1 million or more with state or local governments.

That posed a serious problem for the Florida Department of Revenue and various local counties that have contracts with Airbnb to collect bed taxes. Whether state Revenue officials had to stop collecting taxes from Airbnb is unclear  department spokespeople didnt respond to questions about it Tuesday.

Airbnb had 90 days to reverse its policy before state agencies had to react to the listing. The company changed about a month later.

On April 9, the company announced it wouldnt carry out its policy of removing listings from the settlements. Instead, it would allow listings in Israeli settlements but would donate profits from those listings to humanitarian aid organizations that are not located in Israel or Palestine.

Airbnb recognizes that there are many other disputed territories around the world, the company said in a statement. The company will rely upon our previously identified framework to evaluate these areas.

Did Florida cause Airbnb to reverse itself?

We dont know. A spokesman for the company declined to comment.

But its more likely that international outrage and high-profile lawsuits against the company had more to do with Airbnbs decision than the actions of Floridas Cabinet.

According to a New York Times story about Airbnbs decision, which didnt mention Florida, the company had just settled four lawsuits in the United States and Israel claiming the companys new policy was discriminatory.

One of the lawsuits, for example, was filed by 12 American Jewish families living in the West Bank who claimed the policy discriminated against them based on their religion, according to the newspaper.

What happens next?

Since Airbnb gave up on its policy in April, Floridas State Board of Administration is going to recommend at the June 4 Cabinet meeting that Airbnb be removed from the list.

The Cabinet is likely to approve it.

WikiLeaks' Julian Assange is a spy

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called WikiLeaks a "nonstate hostile intelligence service." Apparently Julian Assange agrees. In its new 18-count indictment of Assange for multiple violations of the Espionage Act, the Justice Department notes that Assange told former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning that WikiLeaks had originally described itself as an "intelligence agency" for the people.

Now, at long last, the head of that enemy intelligence agency is facing a possible 175 years in a federal penitentiary for his theft of American secrets.

The damage Assange has done is unfathomable. In 2010, he exploded what he called his "thermonuclear device" -- releasing a tranche of more than a quarter of a million classified State Department diplomatic cables, all unredacted. According to the indictment, those cables "included names of persons throughout the world who provided information to the U.S. government in circumstances in which they could reasonably expect that their identities would be kept confidential.

These sources included journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents who were living in repressive regimes and reported to the United States the abuses of their own government, and the political conditions within their countries, at great risk to their own safety."

The indictment cites specific examples of sources WikiLeaks burned inside China, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Moreover, Assange's decision to release 90,000 Afghanistan war-related activity reports also revealed the identities of at least 100 Afghans who were informing on the Taliban. The indictment quotes a New York Times interview with a Taliban leader who told the paper, "We are studying the report. We knew about the spies and people who collaborate with U.S. forces. We will investigate through our own secret service whether the people mentioned are really spies working for the U.S. If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them."

Assange's stolen classified documents didn't just find their way to the Taliban; the indictment points out that WikiLeaks copies were also found in Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. During the raid that killed the al-Qaida leader, U.S. forces recovered "a letter from bin Laden to another member of the terrorist organization al-Qaida in which bin Laden requested that the member gather the DoD material posted to WikiLeaks" as well as a response from that al-Qaida operative providing him with the secret U.S. government documents Assange had provided.

Indeed, Assange's disclosures nearly blew the bin Laden operation. Just one week before the raid, Assange released his "Gitmo files "which contained information that could have tipped off bin Laden that the CIA was closing in on him.

One of Assange's stolen documents -- the file on Abu Faraj al-Libi, al-Qaida's captured operational commander -- revealed that Faraj had "reported on al-Qaida's methods for choosing and employing couriers, as well as preferred communications means"; that he had "received a letter from UBL's designated courier" who was "the official messenger between UBL and others in Pakistan"; and that "in mid-2003, [Faraj] moved his family to Abbottabad, and worked between Abbottabad and Peshawar," Pakistan. The CIA tracked bin Laden down to Abbottabad by following his courier, thanks, in large part, to information provided by Faraj.

Had bin Laden read that document detailing what Faraj had told the agency, he could have known that the United States had made the connection between his courier and his Abbottabad hideout. Fortunately, U.S. Special Operations forces did not give bin Laden time to figure it out.

The indictment leaves out much of the damage Assange did, such as his 2014 release of classified CIA documents exposing how CIA operatives maintain cover while traveling through airports; his 2016 release of documents detailing European Union military operations to intercept refugee boats traveling to Europe from terrorist-infested regions along the Libyan coast; and his 2016 exposure of top-secret documents describing NSA intercepts of foreign government communications.

Some are concerned that the newest Assange indictment will help set a precedent to go after investigative journalists who publish classified information. But as I wrote in 2010, unlike "reputable news organizations, Assange did not give the U.S. government an opportunity to review the classified information WikiLeaks was planning to release so they could raise national security objections." So responsible journalists have nothing to fear.

Regardless, Assange is not a journalist. He is a spy.

The Justice Department is right to indict him for his crimes.

Texto completo: Last week’s Associated Press photograph of Mount Everest shows a long line of hundreds of climbers in brightly colored gear inching their way to the peak as if they were waiting in line for Space Mountain at Disney World.
"How do they get down? There’s an elevator, right?" quips Joel Schauer, 58, of Hawthorn Woods. Schauer didn’t have to share his Everest moment with hundreds of fellow climbers when he scaled the peak in 2016. He and a guide left the South Col at 25,938 feet at 7 p.m. and arrived at the summit at 6:45 a.m. by themselves.
"There were two people who turned around in front of me when I was making it to the top," Schauer remembers.
Exhausted after the last 12-hour climb, his zipper frozen by the condensation from his breathing mask in the below-zero temperatures, and with a dwindling oxygen supply at 29,029 feet, Schauer didn’t even remove his face mask for the photo of him displaying his "On The Top: Fairchild Automotive" flag from his Lake Zurich business.
"This is nice," Schauer remembers thinking during the hour he spent on top of the world before others arrived and safety became his top concern. "How long can I live here? Look around, enjoy it and get down."
More than 300 people have died climbing Everest since 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the top. So far this month, at least 11 climbers have died while scaling the world’s tallest mountain, the latest a 62-year-old Colorado attorney who had reached the peak and was starting his descent, which can be just as dangerous.
"On the way down, I was trying to suck oxygen, and there wasn’t enough there," remembers Schauer. At one point he slipped and found himself dangling from a rope. "I’m looking out at the Himalayas upside-down," he says. He somehow managed to get a grip with the crampons on his boots digging into the ice, pulled himself up and made it safely back to base camp.
A climber at crowded Everest last week told CNN about having to step over dead bodies on the path. Schauer, whose first Everest attempt in 2014 was canceled after an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas, says he didn’t see any bodies during his successful climb two years later. Some critics have blamed the deaths during this climbing season, which ended this week, on the growing number of climbers. Many are unprepared, and the crowding is caused by an increase in the number of companies leading the expeditions.
"Is it hubris? Might be. Is it bad preparation? Might be. Is it the line? Might be," Schauer says, adding that changing the protocol to call for more oxygen for the trip down from the summit might help. A story in The New York Times on Wednesday says Nepalese officials are considering changes that would bar inexperienced climbers and make it more difficult to get a permit.
Whether going up or down, the process is slow and tedious and climbers have to maneuver past each other. "You have to do the Everest dance," Schauer says, describing the process of moving along the guide rope. "You unclip, move, reclip, move. You’re clipping and unclipping 10,000 times."
And when you are exhausted, dealing with the altitude, short on air, and numb from the cold, it’s difficult to improvise.
"It’s really hard to get off that line. There’s nowhere to go," Schauer says. "You’re limited to the slowest person in line."
Schauer and his wife, Kathy, parents of three grown children, Jennifer, Melissa and Jake, became grandparents a week ago with the birth of Addison Grace to Jake and Elizabeth Schauer. Earlier in the year, Joel Schauer reached another milestone when he climbed to the top of Aconcagua in Argentina, making him just the 48th person to climb the highest mountains in all seven continents and ski to both the North and South poles.
The lessons he learns from climbing about building strong teams, planning well and taking "intelligent risks" help him run his business, Schauer says. Everest will always be one of his major accomplishments, but he doesn’t see the need to climb it again. His daughter Jennifer is going to run a not-for-profit for abused girls in Kathmandu, the Nepal city where most Everest climbers embark on their adventure. But Schauer says, "you can climb an equally beautiful mountain without so many people on it."
Considering all his world-famous climbs, ask him about what he is most proud of, and Schauer breaks into a big smile.
"That’s easy," Schauer says. "My granddaughter."

As Barr mulls declassification, a familiar tune from critics

Texto completo: In February 2018, the House Intelligence Committee released the so-called Nunes memo. In four pages, the document, from the committee’s then-chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, revealed much of what the public knows today about the FBI’s reliance on the Steele dossier in pursuing since-discredited allegations that the Trump campaign and Russia conspired to fix the 2016 election. Specifically, it revealed that the FBI included unverified material from the dossier in applications to a secret spy court to win a warrant to wiretap Trump foreign policy volunteer adviser Carter Page.
All that was classified. To release it, the committee appealed to President Donald Trump, who made a declassification order. That is the only way Americans know about the Page warrant. From that knowledge came later revelations about the FBI’s use of confidential informants and undercover agents to get information on Trump campaign figures.
It is good that the public knows such things, just as it is good that the public knows what is in the Mueller report. But in the days before the Nunes memo was declassified, many of the nation’s top current and former intelligence officials, members of Congress, and analysts in the press warned that declassification would do grave damage to American national security.
It didn’t happen.
Now, some of the same people are issuing somber warnings of the damage that will be done if Attorney General William Barr declassifies documents showing what else the nation’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies did in the 2016 Trump investigation.
In 2018, former CIA Director John Brennan said of the Nunes memo, "I never witnessed the type of reckless partisan behavior I am now seeing." In 2018, Rep. Adam Schiff, the current chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the Nunes memo "crosses a dangerous line." In 2018, former Attorney General Eric Holder called the Nunes memo "unheard of," "dangerous" and "irresponsible." Many others echoed Brennan’s and Schiff’s and Holder’s sentiments. The problem is, they were wrong then, and they are likely wrong again now.
The revelation that the FBI used the Steele dossier — the collection of unconfirmed anti-Trump dirt compiled for the Hillary Clinton campaign by the former British spy Christopher Steele — set off a tremendous argument about the dossier’s reliability. But there was no doubt that the Nunes memo was correct, that the FBI had indeed cited the dossier as evidence in its argument that Carter Page should be wiretapped. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that some of the loudest voices denouncing Nunes were angry about the exposure of the FBI’s questionable actions, and not the fact that the FBI’s actions were indeed questionable.
Now, there is another fight about declassification. Nunes himself has heard this all before. "These people simply use national security as a false justification to hide information that would reveal their abuses," he said in a text exchange.
Nunes summed up with one more line: "Democracy dies in darkness."
The resistance to declassification is likely to be ferocious. Almost immediately after President Donald Trump ordered intelligence agencies to cooperate with Barr and gave the attorney general "full and complete authority" to declassify information from the Trump-Russia investigation, the intelligence world struck back when The New York Times reported that Barr’s project could endanger one of the CIA’s most prized sources.
Attributing its story to "former officials," the Times said the source was someone "close to (Vladimir) Putin" who gave the CIA "information about (Putin’s) involvement" in U.S. election interference, and specifically turned over evidence to support the conclusion that "Putin himself was behind the Russia hack." The source had been "long nurtured" by the CIA and was highly valued by Brennan when he was director. All of that work might be at risk if Barr moves ahead, the Times suggested.
Now, if anything might endanger such a source, it would be exposure in The New York Times. But the story showed that the intelligence world will push back hard against this new effort to investigate its record. The fight could be messy. But Barr, like Nunes, has heard such threats before. It’s time to find out what the CIA, FBI and other agencies did in those difficult days of the 2016 campaign.

Texto completo: Alonzo "Lonzo" Williams has strong opinions about the birth of West Coast hip-hop, back when he was a young DJ and club owner in Compton, crossing paths with Dr. Dre, Eazy-E and other future members of a soon-to-be notorious group called N.W.A.
"We all were key players in the early stages of West Coast hip-hop. I probably was the most keyest of all," Williams says with a chuckle, not exactly making a joke.
As owner of the club Eve's After Dark in the 1980s, Williams was a neighborhood impresario, with a recording studio on the premises and his own electro-R&B-hip-hop group called the World Class Wreckin' Cru. (Dre was a member.) Williams was even depicted briefly in the acclaimed 2015 N.W.A biopic "Straight Outta Compton," of which he says, "My life has not been the same since."

An impressive feat
The rise of the West Coast is just one slice of the exhibition "Contact High: A Visual History of Hip-Hop," now at the Annenberg Space for Photography through Aug. 18. Curated by Vikki Tobak and inspired by her 2018 book of the same name, it is the most comprehensive survey of pictures documenting hip-hop culture ever collected, stretching from the pioneering Bronx DJ Kool Herc to Compton's Pulitzer-wining Kendrick Lamar.
Not surprisingly, Williams would have loved even more representation of West Coast rap music in the show, which already includes striking images of Snoop Dogg, DJ Quik, Nipsey Hussle and Tupac Shakur. But Williams will make his case at the Annenberg during a July 20 panel discussion, "California Love: A Hip-Hop History," joined by radio DJ Greg Mack and music journalist Sheena Lester.
"We had a consistent flow of West Coast superstars that influenced the younger generations," says Williams. "Everybody has a sense of pride when it comes to our musical legacy."
The panel is one of several special events, screenings, live podcasts and field trips scheduled in the exhibition. On Saturday, photographer Barron Claiborne will be at the Annenberg to re-create his iconic image of a crown-wearing Biggie Smalls, inviting visitors to step into the frame and wear the rapper's original royal headgear.
In the beginning
In its earliest form, hip-hop was almost exclusively a street-level mode of expression, embraced quickly by other underground scenes, while the mainstream kept the sound and culture at arm's length.
"I always like to describe it as adolescent teenage activity going on in the streets to amuse ourselves -- the graffiti, the whole thing," says Fab 5 Freddy, a consultant on "Contact High" who was a charter participant in the interconnecting worlds of rap and graffiti art in the late 1970s and is now an artist and filmmaker.
Joe Conzo Jr., whose work is featured in the exhibition, started taking photos of the hip-hop scene while he was a junior at South Bronx High School, with his friends the Cold Crush Brothers and Kool Herc. Conzo was among the very first to shoot that scene in the late '70s with a good 35mm camera rather than a Kodak Instamatic.
Another featured photo-grapher, Janette Beckman, took photos for the influential U.K. music magazine Melody Maker. Beckman discovered hip-hop in 1982 when the first tour of American rappers, DJs, graffiti artists and break dancers arrived in Europe. Led by Afrika Bambaataa, the tour, says curator Tobak, was "the first time people in Europe got a full dose of the culture."
Beckman recalls that other music journalists and photographers at the time were not interested.
"The main journalists wrote, 'Oh, this rap thing is never going to last,' " Beckman says with a laugh. "I was just like, 'These people are amazing.' "
After years of shooting the early years of punk rock, she recognized hip-hop as another revolutionary cultural movement and moved to New York to explore it further.
"Most press thought it was a passing fad," says Fab 5 Freddy. "They didn't understand the cultural significance and relevance. Joe Conzo and Janette Beckman felt it and pointed their cameras."
Gangsta rap
On the West Coast, photographer Mike Miller was a fifth-generation L.A. native whose repertoire ranged from Stan Getz and latter-day Lynyrd Skynyrd to the first generation of L.A.'s gangsta rappers. His pictures from that era, some of which are seen in the Annenberg show, included portraits of former N.W.A members Arabian Prince and Ice Cube, and a scene-setting album cover for Warren G's 1994 multi-platinum debut, "Regulate... G Funk Era."
"To bring the artists down to the neighborhoods that they grew up in was a no-brainer for me," says Miller, who photographed Warren G and others close to home. "The way I approached the photographs gave it a real feel. It looked journalistic."
As usual at the Annenberg, the exhibition is accompanied by a new documentary, including footage of legendary Life magazine photographer Gordon Parks shooting a panoramic group photo in New York of a 1998 summit of rappers and DJs from across the country.
Attention, vinyl fans
"Contact High" has an onsite record shop where visitors can buy the same vinyl that was sampled to create some of the great works of hip-hop, and on the wall is a new hand-painted graffiti mural created by Cey Adams, the first creative director at Def Jam Records.
The exhibit's pictures document a movement of diverse artists right up to the current decade, among them ASAP Rocky, XXXTentacion -- in his only formal portrait session before he was killed last year -- and Nicki Minaj.
"It continues to be a platform for young people around the world to figure out ways of expressing themselves," says Fab 5 Freddy. "Seeing Travis Scott at Coachella two years ago, I wasn't prepared for the intensity. Oh, my God, I know what this is! I saw that stuff in the beginning."

Texto completo: Julie Brown Neu sat at her sewing machine, meticulously embroidering letters onto fabric. The finished material poured out of the other side, forming a puddle of names on the ground: Ryan Clark, Ross Alameddine, Jocelyne Couture-Nowak. They were the names of victims in the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech.
Neu had to take a breather at that point. The weight of all those interrupted lives was simply too much. She shut off her machine and walked away. But she'd be back — she had a project to complete.
For almost three years, Neu has created quilts to commemorate the victims of mass shootings in the United States, as well as “protest" quilts to call attention to the issue of gun violence. The exhibit, “Disarming: Memorial Quilts for Mass Shooting Victims," is on display at the Arlington Center for the Arts until June 10.
“It's my hope that seeing the quilts all hanging together will help sort of show the scale of the violence," Neu said. “That it will be difficult to look at 14 quilts with 309 names on them without feeling impacted by the number of people affected."
Neu, an Arlington resident, 43, began her project in the months after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. Requests spread through her quilting community for blankets to comfort the victims' families and loved ones. Neu had a different idea.
“Any time there is any sort of catastrophe, quilters start sending quilts. It's something quilters have done since the Civil War," she said. “I decided instead to make quilts for the victims of the shooting."
There are 16 pieces on display in the final exhibit. Fourteen of the quilts are part of Neu's “Victims" collection, which represents the victims of mass shootings during which 10 or more people were killed. Each block on the “Victims" quilts represents a person killed. The colors of the pieces reflect the state flag of the location where the shooting took place (except for the Virginia Tech quilt, which is outfitted in the university's colors).
“Quilts are a particularly effective medium for addressing this topic. Quilts come imbued with a very specific meaning of home and family and motherhood," Neu said. “Because they are a comfortable medium, people interact with them as art in a different way. They draw viewers in deeper."
The other two quilts in the exhibit are from Neu's “Protest" series, a collection of pieces that reflect social and political issues. One of the quilts, “Bullet Holes," has strips of fabric for each year between 1990 and 2020. For each strip, there are a number of holes representing each individual killed in a mass shooting that year.
There are 809 holes in “Bullet Holes," which is updated as of February this year. Neu will add more holes if there are any more mass shootings in 2019 and 2020.
The second “protest" quilt, “In Our Sights," is crafted from real New York Times newspapers from the week of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. The papers are sandwiched between two swaths of mesh black fabric, and a neon green gun sight is appliqued over the top.
“I chose to use the actual pages because I wanted the quilt to show the passage of time. As the quilt gets handled more, the pages tear a bit and wrinkle," Neu said. “Time continues to pass without us really making any changes to our gun control laws in this country. Without those changes, nothing is going to change in this epidemic of gun violence we have."
The pieces in the exhibit were not easy for Neu to create. Tears were frequently shed during the process. She saved creating the quilt for the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting until last, trying to build up the willpower to face the names of the 20 children, ages 6 and 7, and six educators who were killed.
“I've probably touched each name half a dozen times. I've found they have sort of imprinted themselves in my heart in a way," Neu said. “At the exhibit reception, I met the mother of a victim from the Virginia Tech shooting. She walked up and introduced herself as Ross's mother. I knew exactly who she was talking about."

Assange charges are an attack on press freedom; Editorial

Texto completo: The freedom of the press to publish information of public importance - even if it has been classified as secret by the government - is a vital check on official wrongdoing and deception. However grudgingly, presidential administrations of both parties have accepted that reality by declining to prosecute media organizations under the Espionage Act.
Now the Trump administration has departed dangerously from that policy, bringing new charges Thursday against Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, in connection with the thousands of secret documents he obtained from former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning and then published on his site.
Assange is an unsympathetic figure, to put it mildly, and WikiLeaks is not a traditional journalism organization. (In addition to publishing the military and diplomatic documents obtained from Manning, WikiLeaks is best known for having posted emails from the Democratic Party that U.S. officials said were hacked by Russia.)
But in prosecuting Assange for soliciting classified information from Manning and then disseminating it, the Justice Department has adopted a legal theory that could potentially make criminals of many conscientious reporters who cover defense and national security. After all, journalists routinely urge their sources to divulge official secrets, and they routinely publish them, as part of their mandate to report truthfully about what happens behind the closed doors of government. Criminalizing that behavior would be an affront to the First Amendment, which singles out the press for special protection from intrusion and censorship.
The charges announced Thursday replaced an earlier - and more restrained - indictment that was unsealed in April. The previous indictment accused Assange not of Espionage Act violations but of conspiracy to violate a law against "computer intrusion." It alleged that Assange conspired with Manning to crack a government password in search of secret material.
At the time, there was some relief that the indictment focused mostly on the allegation that Assange conspired to facilitate the theft of information rather than that he received it or published it.
The new, more sweeping indictment goes much farther. It says that Assange "repeatedly encouraged sources with access to classified information to steal and provide it to WikiLeaks to disclose." The indictment also accuses Assange of violating the law by "publishing (documents) on the internet."
The indictment acknowledges that part of WikiLeaks' mission is to "disclose ... information to the public." That was also the reason the New York Times published the Pentagon Papers, a classified history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, almost half a century ago. It's also the reason many newspapers reported on some of the information provided to WikiLeaks by Manning, including a video of an Apache helicopter attack that killed 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007.
In announcing the new indictment, Assistant U.S. Atty Gen. John C. Demers insisted that the department "takes seriously the role of journalists in our democracy" and doesn't target journalists for their reporting. He maintained, however, that "Julian Assange is no journalist." That was clear, Demers said, from the allegation in the indictment that Assange published, without redaction, the names of individuals in war zones who had provided information to the U.S.
It's true that a responsible news organization generally wouldn't publish the names of informants who might face danger. For example, the New York Times in publishing material from WikiLeaks withheld the names of informants and operatives. But the issue isn't whether Assange is a journalist (or a responsible one); it's whether the government is setting a precedent in which it criminalizes those who publish classified information rather than merely those who leak it. If it uses this new legal theory against Assange today, it can use it against Seymour Hersh or the Los Angeles Times or any other legitimate news organization tomorrow.
As Bruce Brown, executive director of Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, put it: "Any government use of the Espionage Act to criminalize the receipt and publication of classified information poses a dire threat to journalists seeking to publish such information in the public interest, irrespective of the Justice Department's assertion that Assange is not a journalist."
The decision to prosecute those accused of publishing classified information would be troubling regardless of who occupied the White House. But the current president has relentlessly railed against "fake news," called journalists "enemies of the people" and suggested he might have to "get involved" in the operation of the Justice Department. That makes this unnecessary change of course especially unsettling.

McDonald's complaint: UC student groped by co-worker forced to resign

Texto completo: Editor's note: Information included reflects this article's original publication date: May 21.
A University of Cincinnati student said she thought she'd found a decent job that would allow her to continue working toward a degree in business while paying the bills.
But in less than a month working at a McDonald's on Montgomery Road in Sycamore Township, Carole Stahl was followed to her car one night by a male co-worker, according to a complaint filed Tuesday with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Inside her car, the co-worker grabbed her breast and rubbed the inside of her legs as she tried to deter him, according to her complaint, one of dozens filed nationwide by workers aiming to address what they deem a systemic problem of sexual harassment within the company.
She said in the filing that the co-worker persisted during the late February incident, talking about his penis size and then licking her face and earlobe. She said in the complaint she reported what had happened to a manager, who told her to either continue working with the man on the higher-paying night shift or be demoted to a less desirable shift.
The man wasn't disciplined, according to her complaint.
"I felt very unheard," Stahl, 30, said in a phone interview Tuesday. "Once you go through something like that, especially at a workplace, you always have that in the back of your head. 'It's dark now, closing time. Am I going to be OK?' "
She was forced to resign, the complaint states, and as a result of the lost income, dropped out of college.
Her story parallels that of others' who came forward Tuesday in the coordinated filing of 25 sexual harassment charges and lawsuits against McDonald's.
A New Orleans worker reported to the EEOC she'd been groped, only to have her manager tell her she was "probably giving sex appeal" and should "take it to the next level with him."
In Kansas City, McDonald's corporate office gave one worker the "run-around" after she reported a co-worker solicited sex for cash and asked her for a "quickie," according to another complaint.
The workers are demanding McDonald's leadership meet with them to work toward ending "sexual harassment at the company's restaurants."
"Every day, workers are forced to choose between getting a paycheck or speaking up about their abuse," said Sharyn Tejani, the director of the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, in a statement.
The fund, formed last year to help extend the #MeToo movement beyond Hollywood, is defraying costs of the legal filings. The American Civil Liberties Union has provided legal assistance and the effort has been spearheaded by the Fight for 15, a labor group.
Protesters marched outside McDonald's corporate headquarters in Chicago on Tuesday, days before the company's annual shareholder meeting.
Padma Lakshmi, a television host and actress, was among them.
"I'm in awe of the brave cooks and cashiers who are standing up to McDonald's and speaking out to put an end to widespread sexual harassment at one of the world's most powerful companies," Lakshmi said.
In a letter addressed to Lakshmi, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook outlined new measures, such as a third-party hotline to report complaints, new bias and harassment training and new posters stating new policy sent to the roughly 14,000 McDonald's locations in North America.
But Time's Up, in a letter to McDonald's leaders sent two days later, wrote that the company has failed to adequately respond to complaints.
In the past, the company has claimed it is not responsible for employees' behavior at franchise locations, according to The New York Times.
That's a stance that Gillian Thomas, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Women's Rights Project, rejects.
"This is a company that has especially used the franchise model as a shield," Thomas told The Times.
Sexual harassment is common in the fast food industry, with 40 percent of women reporting being subject to unwanted sexual behavior on the job in a 2016 survey by Hart Research Associates.
Stahl, who received a loan from her parents to help maintain her housing, hopes to soon re-enroll in school. She is optimistic her activism will help contribute to more accountability from the burger giant. As for the co-worker who she says groped her, Stahl believes he should be fired.

Texto completo: The Democrats running the House of Representatives have gone insane — and they prove it every day.
Despite the conclusions of the Mueller Report, Nancy Pelosi and her Deranged Democrat underlings in the House have not given up their fight to depose President Trump. They have six kangaroo committees in the House subpoenaing anyone who ever played golf with the president and looking everywhere they can for whatever financial or personal dirt they can find to use against him and his administration.
The Mad House Democrats don't care what irresponsible charges they make. When it comes to Trump, all's fair in hate and war.
Meanwhile, while they make fools of themselves and waste time trying to over-ride the Mueller Report, the Deranged Democrats refuse to do a single thing about the invasion of migrants on our southern border.
No Democrat would be caught dead calling it "an invasion." Neither would any journalist or pundit employed by CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times or the Washington Post. But when you have thousands and thousands of Central American asylum seekers over-running our border every day and overwhelming our ability to process and properly care for their families, it's an invasion.
Overcrowding is so bad now at the Texas border that the Border Patrol has had to fly or bus migrant families to processing centers in towns like Santa Fe, Denver, San Diego, San Bernardino and Murrieta, a city of about 100,000 between LA and San Diego.
No one is quite sure where they go after they are processed, but it could be anywhere. And they have little or no money, no food, no place to stay — just a slip of paper telling them to show up at their asylum hearing two years from now.
There's nothing planned.
The mainstream liberal media are especially at fault because they have done such a biased, half-butted job of covering the migrant invasion. They've shown us every misery suffered by the poor migrants after they get to American soil. And they've made sure the whole country knows the details about the separated families and the tragic deaths of six kids in U.S. custody — all of which, of course, are entirely the fault of a man named Trump.
They have consistently underplayed the scope of the invasion problem, its economic and social costs, its causes (bad immigration laws and a chicken Congress) and ignored its many other victims — the American ones.
The migrant invasion has hurt the overworked border patrol officers, the people and property owners in the towns at the border, American taxpayers and the poorest citizens of the USA whose unskilled jobs are most likely to be taken by migrants.
Now we have cities and towns far from the border becoming the latest victims of Washington's failure to fix immigration. It's their citizens who are going to have to pay for a lot of the food, housing, policing, education and healthcare of the migrants.

Texto completo: Headnote Questions follow gift to Morehouse grads
Days after a billionaire pledged to pay the collective student debt of the entire 2019 Morehouse College graduating class, euphoria was not the only emotion in the air.
On Morehouse's Atlanta campus and beyond, administrators, students and parents - and no shortage of tax and philanthropy experts - have spent the last few days wondering how, exactly, Robert F. Smith, a titan tech investor, would fulfill his promise to 396 graduates. The surprise announcement was both an extraordinary gift - and a complicated one.
At the end of a graduation celebration, Shaquille Lampley returned to his dorm room on campus, opened the computer and stared at his student loan estimates. They totaled more than 5200,000 in loans taken out by his mother, covering six years in school.
"I just kept looking at the number and thinking to myself, this would cripple me for life," said Lampley, 24, who earned a degree in sociology. "I am so grateful and still in shock about this gift and now I have so many questions about how this will be processed."
Among the questions: Are all student loans included? Does the pledge include loans taken out by the graduates' parents? What about gifts from home equity loans?
Expected to run well into the millions of dollars, the pledge will not benefit those who never made it to graduation because their crushing debts forced them to withdraw before they earned a degree.
"I felt a level of survivor's guilt," said Myles Washington, 21, one of the graduates expecting to receive tens of thousands in debt relief from Smith. "There were students that were here that were just as smart and just as talented as us that didn't have the opportunity because they had to leave early."
The college president, David A. Thomas, who had no idea of Smith's plans to make the pledge, said the college would work out the logistics of the grant soon.
"We know that Mr. Smith is going to erase the debt of the 396 students who received diplomas," he said. "What we have not determined yet is the form or mechanism and the details on how this will happen. We will be meeting in the coming days."
The generosity of Smith - the richest Black man in America - highlighted the systematic problems of debt in American college education.
Overall, the majority of seniors at four-year colleges - about two-thirds - are carrying student loan debt. In 2017, that average was nearly $29,000, according to an analysis of federal data from the Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit advocating affordable higher education. Adjusted for inflation, that same average was about $13,000 in 1996.
"This generation of students is the most debt burdened ever and it's a huge problem for them," said Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of Georgia and author of "The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap."
"I do think you're going to have a generation of students whose main concern, instead of finding a partner they love and coming up with a career, they have this huge part of their psychological and emotional toll being about the servicing of these debts," she added.
The picture for recent African-American graduates of four-year colleges is worse: These students owe, on average, $7,400 more than their white peers, according to research from the Brookings Institution that examines all graduates, including those who did not borrow. And over the next few years after graduation, that debt gap, including new graduate school loans, widens to about $25,000.
Students attending historically Black colleges like Morehouse are also more likely to take out loans compared with other students, in part because of the racial wealth gap.
"This is due to the compounding effect of a history of housing segregation that's created a racial wealth gap," Baradaran said. "If you have lower wealth, you're going to have to borrow more. And if you have to borrow more, you're going to get charged with higher interest."
The type of debt students and families carry beyond traditional educational loans varies widely.
One study that private lender Sallie Mae and market research firm Ipsos publishes, "How America Pays for College," measures the range of loans that family members take out to pay the education bills. The federal parent PLUS loans represent 7% of total costs, on average, for families that borrow. Private loans, like the ones that Sallie Mae offers, represent 4% of the total. Credit cards, retirement plan loans and home equity debt make up 1% each.
For Washington, who earned a degree in psychology, the gift of his newly acquired financial freedom, he believes, will affect three generations.
"Not only does it affect me or affect my parents, it also affects my kids," Washington said. "If I'm still in my 30s and my 40s still having to pay off student loans, the opportunities are limited for them as well."
Sixty-eight percent of undergraduates at Morehouse borrow at least some money. The students who get degrees end up with a relatively manageable $26,000 of federal student loan debt, or $276 in monthly payments on a standard repayment plan, according to federal data. These figures do not include private loans, PLUS loans or other debt.
But only 53% of full-time, first-time students finish their undergraduate studies at Morehouse within six years. People who leave before graduation tend to struggle financially, according to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data that measures the entire population. They get little economic benefit from completing some college, earning just 8% more than high school graduates. Yet they are still saddled with whatever debt they took on to get as far as they did with their studies.
Jordan Long, 22, was one of those students - and would have been a recipient of Smith's pledge had he stayed at Morehouse. He arrived on the campus from Oakland, California, in the summer of 2015.
"I loved the idea that I was walking on the same campus as Martin Luther King Jr.," he said. *
Long paid for the first two years through a combination of help from relatives and federal student loans, accumulating more than $60,000 in debt. But by the end of his sophomore year, he had packed his bags for good.
"I didn't have enough scholarship money and I didn't want to have to put that kind of a burden on my family," he said.
Long, who is now a community college student, learned about Smith's gift on social media. Then he took to Twitter: "I left Morehouse class of 2019 to avoid debt and this billionaire just paid the graduating class's debt off. Kill me."
In a subsequent interview, he added: "I am so happy for all my friends who graduated and I texted them, but sad for myself. Somebody told me to do a GoFundMe to see if I could get help with the loans. I figured, my luck couldn't be any worse."
Morehouse's Office of Business and Finance and the Office of Enrollment Management are now working to calculate the student loan debt and other details of the gift.
"As soon as we have a final figure," the college said in a statement, "we will share it."

SUPREME COURT MAKES A DECISION ON LONG-WATCHED ABORTION CASE: The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued an order that will allow Indiana to enforce a law mandating the burial or cremation of fetal remains following an abortion.
The justices also decided they will not take up a separate part of the law banning abortion on the basis of race, sex, or disability, meaning that those restrictions won't go into effect. Both abortion laws were signed in 2016 by Vice President Mike Pence, who was governor of Indiana at the time.
The order on the fetal remains case marks the first instance under the more conservative Supreme Court makeup to challenge the parameters of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. The Indiana case was closely watched since the Supreme Court began discussing it in January. The justices met about it more than a dozen times.
The Supreme Court in its opinion said the plaintiffs hadn't argued that the Indiana law posed "undue burden" preventing women from accessing abortion, which is the standard the court has applied since its 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision allowing states to regulate abortion to a certain extent. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a dissent asserting she believed the law did pose an undue burden, and said she wouldn’t have taken up the case.
Abortion rights advocates have opposed burial and cremation laws because they say they make abortions more expensive, while proponents of such laws argue that aborted fetuses should not be treated like other medical waste.
The justices said they would let lower courts continue to weigh in on the other part of the law banning abortion on the basis of race, sex, or disability, but Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurrence in which he laid out ways that abortion could be used for eugenics.
"Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever," he wrote.

SUPREME COURT DECLINES TO TAKE UP TRANSGENDER RIGHTS CASE: The U.S. Supreme Court said Tuesday it will not take up a high-profile dispute over a school policy that allows transgender students to use the locker rooms and restrooms of their choosing.
At issue in the case is a policy adopted by the Boyertown Area School District in Pennsylvania in the 2016-2017 school year that allows some transgender students to use school facilities based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex. In deciding not to hear the case, the school district's policy remains intact.
HOLLYWOOD’S BOYCOTT OF GEORGIA OVER HEARTBEAT BILL COULD SQUEEZE STATE’S ECONOMY: A boycott of Georgia spearheaded by actors and producers in the wake of the state’s new abortion restriction threatens to upend its position as the Hollywood of the South.
Known as “Y’allywood,” Georgia ranks as the country’s third-largest production hub and has drawn big-name projects like AMC’s “The Walking Dead” and Marvel Studios' “Black Panther” with its generous tax incentives of up to 30%. But after GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed the abortion ban, some production companies and actors are vowing to steer clear of the state.
The standoff pits Hollywood and its progressive views against a conservative state where the television and film industry — attracted to Georgia with the promise of tax breaks — has become entrenched. Film productions are leaving the state, and actors are pledging not to work there or have pledged donations to the ACLU, which is challenging the ban in court.
FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS MISSISSIPPI 6-WEEK ABORTION BAN: A federal judge blocked the Mississippi six-week abortion ban that was set to go into effect in July. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves, an Obama appointee, issued the injunction Friday, writing that the law "prevents a woman’s free choice, which is central to personal dignity and autonomy." Reeves previously blocked a law in Mississippi that would have banned abortion past 15 weeks into a pregnancy.
MISSOURI GOV SIGNS BILL BANNING ABORTIONS AFTER EIGHT WEEKS: Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed legislation Friday to ban access to abortions after eight weeks. The law does not make exceptions for instances of rape or incest, and only allows an exception when a pregnant woman’s life is at risk. Physicians guilty of performing abortions could face up to 15 years in prison.
POPE WEIGHS IN AS STATES DEBATE ABORTION: IT’S LIKE HIRING A ‘HITMAN TO SOLVE A PROBLEM’: Pope Francis affirmed the Catholic stance against abortion Saturday, not long after multiple U.S. states passed bills restricting abortion. “Is it legitimate to take out a human life to solve a problem?” Francis asked attendees at a Vatican conference on abortion, according to the New York Times. “Is it permissible to contract a hitman to solve a problem?” Francis also voiced opposition to aborting an unhealthy fetus, calling it "inhuman eugenics."
COLORADO CAPS INSULIN COPAYMENTS: Colorado is capping copayments on insulin medications at $100 per month, becoming the first state to impose a limit for those with private insurance. “We declare that the days of insulin price gouging are over in Colorado,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said Wednesday after signing legislation approving the cap, according to CBS Denver. Prices of insulin used to treat Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes doubled between 2012 and 2016, according to the Health Care Cost Institute.
MEASLES CASES REACH NEW HIGH: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday that the number of measles cases across 26 states has reached 940, the greatest number since the outbreak of 1994.
MAINE ELIMINATES PHILOSOPHICAL, RELIGIOUS VACCINE EXEMPTIONS: Maine’s Democratic Governor Janet Mills signed a bill into law Friday that outlaws all religious and philosophical exemptions from the state’s otherwise mandatory vaccine laws. Maine’s vaccination rate is among the lowest in the country, and personal objections are the primary cause. Medical exemptions are still permitted. The new law goes into effect September 17, 90 days following the end of the legislative session.
TRUMP PLEDGES TO COMBAT HIV WITH NEW SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT: The Trump administration plans to work closely with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, sworn into office Saturday, on his efforts efforts to combat HIV in South Africa. The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria said the U.S. is ready to work with the country to eradicate AIDS and the HIV virus through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which is managed by the State Department.

Texto completo: Corrections and Clarifications: A previous version of this story misidentified the editor-in-chief of the South Florida Sun Sentinel.
Student journalists from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, site of the tragic mass shooting that claimed the lives of 17 students, teachers and coaches a year ago February, attended one of journalism’s most prestigious awards ceremonies Tuesday, a luncheon at New York’s Columbia University honoring winners of the Pulitzer Prizes.
The students’ presence set an emotional tone at the awards luncheon whose honorees included the South Florida Sun Sentinel, which earned a Pulitzer in the “public service” category for exposing failings by the school and local law enforcement ahead of and after the Parkland shooting.
Sun Sentinel editor-in-chief Julie Anderson told Parkland students during the luncheon that, "We did this for you guys. "
Marjory Stoneman Douglas senior Rebecca Schneid, 17, who is co-editor-in-chief of the school's Eagle Eye student publication, told USA TODAY that, "Obviously the work that we did after the shooting was the hardest thing that we ever had to do but it was also the most important thing that we've ever done and that I've ever done as a student journalist. "
Schneid said that the reason the Parkland students wanted to attend the Pulitzer ceremony was to "show that student journalism has a place in society and that it deserves to be recognized if it's exemplary. Whether you've gone through something as traumatic as we have or you are just in a student journalism program that's working really hard to make an impact in your community you deserve to be recognized for that and you shouldn't be held back by your age. . . . No matter what we do we always are very aware of the fact that we are here in memory of the people that we've lost. "
The staff of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was also recognized, for its “breaking news” coverage of yet another unthinkable act, the massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.
And a special Pulitzer citation was given to the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, where last June a shooter murdered five employees, the largest killing of U. S. journalists in their newsroom in history. The Pulitzer Board citation came with a $100,000 bequest to be used to further the newspaper’s journalistic mission.
WHO says: Burnout is officially a medical condition, according to the World Health Organization
Who's the largest employer in your state: Walmart top in nation with Amazon second.
Also in attendance at the luncheon were two journalists from Reuters who were recently released in Myanmar after being jailed there for more than 500 days. The Pulitzer winners, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, had been imprisoned for exposing the systematic mass killing of Muslims in the country. Reuters maintained their innocence throughout the ordeal while calling for the men’s release.
Among other winners:
Matt Hamilton, Harriet Ryan and Paul Pringle of the Los Angeles Times, took the top investigative reporting prize for their coverage of a University of Southern California gynecologist accused of violating hundreds of young women over more than 25 years.
Hannah Dreier of ProPublica was honored in the feature writing category for what the Pulitzer committee wrote was “for a series of powerful, intimate narratives that followed Salvadoran immigrants on New York’s Long Island whose lives were shattered by a botched federal crackdown on the international criminal gang MS-13. ”
Local reporting honors went to the staff of The Advocate in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, for their “damning portrayal of the state’s discriminatory conviction system, including a Jim Crow-era law, that enabled Louisiana courts to send defendants to jail without jury consensus on the accused’s guilt. ”
Coverage of President Trump led to separate reporting honors (and some the biggest cheers among the journalists attending the luncheon): David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner of the New York Times won for an 18-month investigation of the President’s finances that debunked his claims of self-made wealth.
And the staff of the Wall Street Journal was recognized for uncovering payments then-candidate Trump made to two women who claimed to have an affair with him.
The late singer Aretha Franklin also received a Pulitzer citation, highlighted by a moving performance in her honor by Jennifer Hudson.
This the 103rd year of the Pulitzer Prizes, which are issued for achievements in print, online and multimedia journalism, as well as in literature and the arts.

Texto completo: The New York Times travel department is rife with parents. We love travel, we love our children and we love traveling with our children.
Until we don't. We know as well as any that even the best-intentioned child can wreck havoc on the most thought-out travel plans, a dream vacation turned into a horror show thanks to a small creature nearest and dearest to your heart.
Collectively, we have experienced hundreds of travel trips and have learned a thing or two, through the good times and the not-so-good. Here are a few of our favorites that have helped us and our children have happy, healthy and enlightening adventures.
On the road and rails
When traveling on a train with a child, make use of Amtrak's Red Cap service. It made my train trips a breeze, lowering the stress level of navigating the train station and the crowds. Red Cap service is offered at 12 of Amtrak's busiest stations, including New York's Penn Station. These Amtrak employees, wearing red caps, not only provide free help to get your baggage on and off trains, but perhaps even more important board you on the train before the "All Aboard" announcement. I liked how the red cap porters on our trips had a key to the escalators, which they used to change its direction and take us to the platform early. All you do is tip them. -- Lynda Richardson
On a road trip, there's nothing like a good audiobook to keep your kids entertained. And if you, like me, have an ulterior motive -- to introduce your children to a few timeless classics -- a road trip presents the perfect opportunity. "Dracula" had us all delightfully frightened as we drove through the dark forested hills of North Carolina. The late 19th-century British sleeper, "Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)," by Jerome K. Jerome is so hilarious we nearly had to pull off the road. A sure hit is the timeless "D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths," with readings by, among others, Paul Newman, Kathleen Turner and Sidney Poitier. -- Suzanne MacNeille
In the air
When my son was 2 1/2, we flew cross-country from New York to San Francisco. I bought about six little (and cheap) toys and wrapped them each separately, with a lot of wrapping paper and invisible tape. I would give him one every hour and each took him a while to open. -- Phaedra Brown
During a long day of air travel, carrying a baby strapped in a baby carrier gets heavy fast. As soon as he was old enough, I much rather preferred using an inexpensive umbrella stroller for our son. Like other strollers, you can check it at the gate but umbrella strollers snap open with one arm and they are usually very light-weight. If it's lost or damaged in flight, you aren't out hundreds of dollars. -- Elisabeth Goodridge

You made it there
After a trans-Atlantic flight from New York to Copenhagen, my 11-month-old son was so grumpy and jet-lagged that he -- of course -- refused to nap. By a miracle, I had booked us in a hotel next to a park with the most wonderful playground. We took him there and he was happy and engaged for hours. When we got back to the hotel, he slept for 12 hours. I will now only book hotels within a block or two of a park or playground. It's the perfect antidote to hours on a plane. -- Danielle Pergament
For older children, let them do things they want to do -- without you. (Do you spend every minute of the day together when you're not on vacation?) The summer my son was 15, we went to Stockholm. He really wanted to go to the Grona Lund amusement park. I really didn't want to go to the Grona Lund amusement park. So he went to the park, and my husband and I went to Waldemarsudde, originally the home of Sweden's Prince Eugen, and now a lovely art museum. My son was by himself in a foreign country where he didn't speak the language, and he loved every minute of it. On the same trip, while we went out to the restaurant Amass in Copenhagen he stayed back and streamed "Breaking Bad." It's one of his favorite memories of vacation, ever. -- Amy Virshup
While traveling, you can find yourself in an Airbnb or rental house with no shades or sheer curtains at best. It's terrible for everyone. Amazon and Home Depot sell paper-accordion blackout shades online and they worked like a miracle. I bought dozens and took them on every trip. Whenever it was time for the kids to take a nap or go to sleep for the night, I'd just unclip them, they'd fall down, and the room was instantly dark. My kids are older now and don't need them, but I'm still tempted to use them. They're basically like melatonin. -- Danielle Pergament
At the Beach
My favorite beach is one known for strong currents and stronger waves, not particularly the ideal place to relax with a baby or toddler who loves the water. Then one summer day I saw another family who had brought a small baby pool along with all their beach toys. It's a brilliant idea. With a few buckets of seawater, the baby pool creates a safe, contained space. Your kid will play happily. They won't miss the waves and you won't miss the worry. -- Elisabeth Goodridge
Anywhere
When your baby or child is wailing inconsolably, and inexplicably, on a plane, train or in a public space offering no escape, just remember that you will never, ever see these people again. Relax. -- Lynda Richardson

Study shows female workers are more productive when it’s warmer -BYLN- Jena McGregor The Washington Post WP Bloomberg

Texto completo: Women have a new weapon they can use to make their case against the chilly office conditions many experience each summer, as their sleeveless summer work clothes do battle with cranked-up air-conditioning systems. A new study shows women tend to perform better on certain skills when the temperature is a little warmer, making them more productive, while men tend to perform better when the temperature is a bit cooler.
In a paper released Wednesday by the journal PLOS One, researchers at the University of Southern California and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center reported that in experiments, tests scores on verbal and math skills improved for women as the temperatures rose, and were better for men when they declined (though to a lesser effect), opening a new front in the office thermostat wars.
The paper’s release set off yet another round of attention and headlines to what’s been called the "thermostat patriarchy," or the gender divide on where to set the thermostat in the office. A few years ago, a scientific paper in the journal Nature Climate Change turned up the dial of the debate when it offered physiological data for why women and men are comfortable at different indoor temperatures and spelled out how office temperatures may be based on the needs of a 40-year-old, 154-pound man.
Then last summer, it flared up again when Cynthia Nixon, Andrew Cuomo’s Democratic primary opponent for New York governor, asked a TV station to set the debate hall thermostat to a warm 76 degrees, calling workplaces "notoriously sexist when it comes to room temperature," the New York Times reported.
When the PLOS One article prompted its own furious round of headlines and social media attention - "tweeting this while wrapped up in the blanket I keep at my desk," wrote one woman on Twitter as she shared a headline on the paper - researcher Tom Chang, an associate professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California’s business school, wasn’t surprised.
Not only did the Nixon-Cuomo flap break out when they were wrapping up the paper last year, "but for the past 10-plus years, I’ve been arguing with my wife about the thermostat at the house," Chang said. And at USC’s business school, he said, "the female faculty have illicit space heaters under their desks; they wear sweaters; they have blankets," he said. "This is relevant for anyone who works in an office space."
What Chang was surprised by was the magnitude of his study’s results. Chang and his co-author, Agne Kajackaite, tested verbal and math skills in tests of college students in Berlin. They found that for every one degree increase in Celsius, the number of math questions answered correctly by women went up by 1.76 percent. Put another way: Even within normal indoor temperature variations - increasing the temperature from the 60s to the 70s in the room - female performance on the math tests increased by 15 percent.
"This was a really large effect," Chang said. Performance by males, meanwhile, dropped by about 3 percent, on average, when the temperature rose over the same variance.
Chang said the explanation for the difference isn’t entirely clear, but some research suggests the effect may be biological, or based on size - average surface area to body volume comparisons for men vs. women. "I haven’t seen anything definitive," he said.
What’s not likely to be the explanation, at least in this case, was clothing. Because the test was run in college students, he said, there weren’t the same kind of sartorial differences between male and female participants. Rather than button-down shirts and pants or sleeveless blouses or dresses, both male and female students dressed in relatively similar ways, he said: "They were all coming in in shorts and a T-shirt."
Chang acknowledges that it’s also unclear whether the same productivity effects would be seen in a workplace environment as the student participants, but suggests the results are still a reminder employers should be more mindful that indoor temperatures aren’t just about making employees comfortable, but making them more productive.
What can employers do in response? The ubiquity of open office plans makes it more challenging, but Chang doesn’t rule out the idea of having different temperature settings in different spaces. Most important, he said, is to recognize that something should be done if people are complaining or actively making their own accommodations to cold temperatures.
"Everybody is latching on to the battle of the sexes, but I don’t think that’s the right lesson to take away from our work," Chang said. "I think the two lessons are first, that these environmental factors matter more than people think they do when it comes to productivity. The other is one size doesn’t fit all. ... If half of the people in your office are sneaking space heaters under their desk or talking about how it’s hot all the time, you should take that more seriously."
In places with good climate like Los Angeles, some fresh air might even be something to consider. His own office, Chang says, is in a modern building designed by the recently deceased architect I.M. Pei with beautiful glass windows overlooking a rose garden. But some issues with the air conditioning have meant temperatures have fluctuated, at times, between 55 and over 90 degrees. "If we had windows that would open, it would be 73 degrees all the time."

Texto completo: 'Human Archipelago'
By Fazal Sheikh and Teju Cole, Steidl, 256 pages, $45
"Who is the stranger?
Who is kin?
What do we owe each other?
What, in the inferno, is not infernal?"
Thus opens "Human Archipelago," a quietly powerful collaboration between writer Teju Cole and photographer Fazal Sheikh. Created in response to the inferno of the current global political moment, the book intersperses Sheikh's photographs of displaced people and sites of trauma across the globe with short, textual responses by Cole, himself a photographer, writer and photography critic for The New York Times Magazine. The result is a poetic, episodic meditation on nothing less than what it means to be human.
In other, less fraught political times, this ambition might have come across as pretentious. The appeal to a universal humanity would have seemed naïve, or worse, reductive, reminiscent of Edward Steichen's much-criticized 1955 exhibition and book, "The Family of Man." But in these times, when basic human dignity is assaulted in lethal and symbolic ways every day, it feels wholly necessary to return to first principles.
Sheikh's portraits are frank, beautifully framed and lit; they give the dignity of portraiture -- traditionally reserved for aristocrats and the wealthy -- to refugees, homeless people and orphans. For the most part, the subjects' gazes are direct, unflinching. They look back at us, person to person. By contrast, the landscapes and aerial views are dispassionate, atmospheric, often bordering on abstraction. Their beauty belies the fact that many are records of violence, ruins of aggression, sites of imprisonment. Both people and places bear the scars of a human pact that has been broken.
Cole's short textual responses -- none longer than a page, most barely a paragraph -- read like prose poems. They draw on multiple, far-flung sources, from Homer and Shakespeare to Martin Luther King Jr., postcolonial theory and recent news stories on racial profiling. They proffer meditations on the bounds of our common humanity: the stranger and the obligations of hospitality; the bonds between mothers and children; who speaks and who is silenced. Throughout, the texts return in fugue-like fashion to these concepts, building in a slow crescendo to a quiet rage against racism, torture, war, environmental degradation and our own blindness. "We've tried to tell you in every different way and can only now conclude you'd rather not know," he writes, despairingly.
The alternating texts and images feel almost cinematic, illuminating one another or creating unexpected juxtapositions. Commenting on a suite of portraits of older people, Cole compares their wrinkled faces to the folds of cloth draped around their heads: "We are folded beings. Our skin, which is our interface (the word is carefully chosen) with the world, is a zone of folds." It's a touching conceit, that a person might be a collection of folds, of unknown depths that might one day unfurl before you.
Another particularly lovely sequence takes advantage of the bilateral symmetry of the book. It's all images, pairing portraits of Palestinians and Israelis on opposite pages. When one closes the book, it's as if they kiss.
There's only one problem. You wouldn't know they were Palestinians and Israelis unless you looked for the captions in the back of the book. Similarly, it was only by flipping back and forth that I learned what looked like a pockmarked wall was actually an aerial view of the remains of a WWII Japanese American internment camp.
Footnote chasers like me will find our enjoyment of the book's lyricism hampered somewhat by the compulsion to know at whom and what we're looking. (Cole's texts are also copiously annotated.) To be sure, a stream of notes would have interrupted the book's clean design and our ability to regard its subjects simply as people, apart from racial, ethnic, national, class, religious, gender or geographical associations. However, their absence turns the subjects into generalized symbols of human suffering, dangerously unmoored from specific historical and contemporary realities. It makes it easy to extend our sympathy without having to confront very real differences of circumstance, background and belief.
Yet this appeal to something larger is Cole and Sheikh's point: Why should the ruins of an American internment camp be any more affecting than the ruins of a bombed-out Palestinian town? Both are evidence of disregard for our shared humanity. As Cole writes, "There are no refugees, only fellow citizens whose rights we have failed to acknowledge."
In "Human Archipelago" this truth unfolds page by page, plain as day.

Texto completo: I enjoyed reading your recent column about the 1947 Freedom Train. Didn't we have a similar one in 1976? I seem to remember going to a railroad siding in Fredericksburg to view documents. Perhaps it was in conjunction with the nation's bicentennial?
- Scott Walker, Fredericksburg, Va.
Many strange things happened in the 1970s - Pet Rocks, leisure suits and disco music among them - but it was also the decade in which America threw itself a huge birthday party. And what better way to celebrate turning 200 than by filling a train with historical and cultural artifacts and taking it across the country?
The Freedom Train was the brainchild of a man named Ross Rowland who fell in love with steam engines as a 3-year-old living in Albany, N.Y. His aunt and uncle used to take him every weekend to that city's Union Station. As little Ross stood on the platform watching trains come and go, he dreamed of being the guy who pulled the cord that sounded the whistle.
While working as a Wall Street commodities broker in the 1960s, Rowland indulged his love of trains by organizing steam locomotive excursions in the Mid-Atlantic. In 1969, he was instrumental in wrangling a vintage steam train for the celebration that marked the 100th anniversary of the completion of the first transcontinental railroad - and in getting John Wayne to participate in the festivities.
It was the cowboy actor who suggested Rowland do something similar for the country's 200th anniversary. Rowland was able to secure million-dollar donations from five corporations - Pepsi-Cola, Atlantic Richfield, General Motors, Prudential Insurance and Kraft Foods - to seed the $18 million cost of the project.
On Dec. 19, 1974, President Gerald Ford traveled to the railroad station in Alexandria to announce the American Freedom Train. He ignored hecklers who chanted "Win what?" - a reference to Ford's "Whip Inflation Now" initiative - and praised the train as "one of the focal points of our bicentennial celebration."
Organizers promised the train would promote old-fashioned patriotism and "demonstrate the qualities that have made this nation great."
There were some early stumbles. Train officials used the term "wetback disguises" to describe artifacts loaned by the FBI that included footwear used by migrants to cross the U.S. border undetected. The Smithsonian was slow to agree to donate artifacts from its collection - it cited legal, security and insurance concerns - but eventually it came around.
Hundreds of artifacts were collected for the train, including: George Washington's personal copy of the Constitution, NBA star Bob Lanier's size-20 sneakers, the Louisiana Purchase agreement, Thomas Edison's first working lightbulb, a lunar rover, John F. Kennedy's rocking chair, Hank Aaron's baseball bat, a dress worn by Judy Garland in "The Wizard of Oz" and the Stanley Cup. The American Legion donated $100,000 to fabricate a copy of the Liberty Bell twice the size of the original.
The train made its debut on April 1, 1975, in Wilmington, Del. The New York Times called the train a "kind of traveling multimedia, mechanized, historical Disneyland." Of the kickoff event in Delaware, a Times reporter wrote that it "fell somewhere in the middle-American terrain bounded by the Fourth of July, a county fair, a branch library in Dubuque and a technically sophisticated science and history exhibit."
Admission was $2, $1 for seniors and those under 18 - about the cost of a movie ticket in 1976. One of the unique aspects of the Freedom Train was how visitors experienced it: via a moving walkway. Guests stood on a conveyor belt as it whisked them through the 10 cars that held displays, an experience enhanced by recorded narration and music.
Petr Spurney , president of the American Freedom Train Foundation, called it "a kaleidoscope of our heritage."
This human conveyor belt irritated some visitors, who wished to examine the displays at their own pace. Organizers decided to slow the walkway down, so the 15-minute journey took 21 minutes, later lengthened to 25.
Linda Epstein's father, Howard , served as the project's general counsel, allowing him to combine two loves: trains and the law. "I remembered I loved the car that had all the celebrity stuff in it and yawned at the historical stuff," Linda said. "Typical 9-year-old, right?"
For its Washington-area appearance in September 1976, the train was parked on a side track next to the Pentagon parking lot.
By the time the Freedom Train wrapped up its journey in Miami on Dec. 31, 1976, it had traveled 25,833 miles across the continental United States, stopping in 138 cities and attracting 6,762,965 people. Many of the crew members agreed small towns gave the train its most enthusiastic receptions.
Its mission completed, the American Freedom Train was purchased by the National Museums of Canada. The exterior was repainted, the galleries were filled with items of Canadian cultural significance, and in July 1978 it made its debut as the Discovery Train, or, in the French-speaking part of our northern neighbor, Train de la Découverte.

Texto completo: Amanda Eller fractured her leg and ate insects in 16 days before rescue
Amanda Eller ventured into a dense forest in Hawaii on May 8, confident her three-mile hike would finish so quickly that her phone and water were unnecessary. She left behind her wallet and her keys, hidden in her car's tire well for when she returned.
A physical therapist and yoga instructor who lives on Maui, Eller knew the terrain from a previous hike and veered off the trail for a quick rest.
But when she got up to resume, she was turned around, and in a quixotic search for the trail, Eller fractured her leg. She ate insects for the 16 days she was missing in the Makawao Forest Reserve - a disappearance that triggered a massive search drawing hundreds of volunteers, even after authorities scaled back their efforts early on.
Eller was found alive Friday, sunburned and smiling. A helicopter search team, contracted by her family, spotted her from the air four miles from her car, gaunt after surviving on plants and water, a friend told KITV. She was airlifted to a hospital.
"She figured it out, she was smart, she was strong, she was prepared," said her father, John Eller, KITV reported. "We said that in the beginning and it was absolutely true."
Eller said his daughter "took a good fall" and got lost after looking for a way back, he told reporters outside a hospital in a video posted by Maui 24/7. "They found her in a deep ravine, basically unable to get out, as I understand it," he said.
"The rescuers had to be airlifted out as well, because it was so tumultuous," he added.
Eller detailed her survival to the New York Times in an interview. She fractured her leg and tore her meniscus on the third day, her friend said, as rescue efforts ramped up in the jungle thick with creeks, ravines and brush. Eller used ferns and leaves for warmth when the temperature plummeted, and one night, slept in a wild boar's den.
She ate moths and wild strawberry guavas, her mother, Julia Eller, told Maui News. Those she could identify. Other plants were risky and unknown meals. A flood took her shoes, leaving her barefoot and crawling.
"I wanted to give up," she told the Times. "But the only option I had was life or death."
A battalion of searchers worked day after day to bring Eller back, repelling from cliffs and combing streams for signs of life.
Aggressive boars were killed and their intestines inspected for human remains.
Her family offered a $50,000 reward, up from $10,000 in the days after Eller's disappearance, and hired a helicopter crew to search for her by air.
That effort was Eller's salvation Friday. Searchers Troy Helmer, Javier Cantellops and Chris Berquist spotted Eller from the air, foraging for food.
"It was unbelievable, dude," Cantellops told CNN. "Seeing her for the first time in a long time was just unbelievable. It was nothing short of elation."
Julia Eller said her daughter's injuries were all treatable, including severe sunburn.
"She lost quite a bit of weight, as you can imagine, being lost for that amount of time," Eller said, Maui News reported. "But she was able to survive it. She had the right skills and did the right things to buy time so that we had a chance to find her."
Photos posted to Facebook show her ankles swollen and covered in large, blistered wounds.
Cantellops's photograph with Eller - eyes wide, lips severely sunburned - triggered waves of relief for volunteer searchers.
"Amanda Eller you are one tough a-- woman!!!" Cantellops wrote on Facebook. "We are all blown away at your barefoot resilience!!!"

Texto completo: Two Naperville natives recently took a dive into the "Shark Tank" and came out with a big bite.
Brothers Anthony and Nick Pucci took their product, Cubicall, to the popular ABC-TV program, where budding entrepreneurs pitch their business to a panel of celebrity executives with the hope of getting one of the panel members to invest.
Cubicall is a custom phone booth that the brothers created out of necessity a couple of years ago, Anthony Pucci said in a news release.
The booth has a simple and efficient design that fits into an office space, providing a quiet, private space for workers to make calls or hold private conversations.
"We started this company when we created our own solution to the problems we experienced when working in an open office," said Nick Pucci. "After selling two phone booths the very first weekend we put our phone booths online. We knew we werent alone with our frustrations."
The Puccis sought a $350,000 investment for a 10% stake in the company.
While they were initially met with skepticism from the panel, they got offers from panelists Kevin OLeary and Barbara Corcoran. Both offered $350,000 for a 25% stake in the company, but OLeary also sought a $100 royalty for each product sold to a certain point, then a $50 per item royalty afterward.
The duo chose to accept Corcorans offer.
"We knew going into this that Barbara Corcoran was the best Shark for Cubicall," Anthony said. "Her expertise and experience in commercial real estate and contract furniture dealers makes her the perfect partner for Cubicall. We couldnt be more thrilled with the outcome."
Nick said appearing on the show was a great experience.
"Going on Shark Tank was surreal. Weve been watching the show since the first season," he said. "We thought we had a pretty good chance at striking a deal.
"We were thrilled to get two offers," he added. "While Mr.
Wonderfuls (OLeary) may have been tempting, we knew Barbara was the perfect partner for Cubicall."
The brothers, who now live in Los Angeles, launched Cubicall in 2017. They realized their potential when they began selling the booths to companies like IBM, SAP, Lyft and Cisco and educational institutions like the University of Wisconsin Madison.
The phone booths have been featured on Fox Business Channel, The New York Times, Interior Design, Fast Company Inc. and was called "an efficient privacy solution to open-plan distractions" by Forbes, according to the Puccis.
While the brothers business is fairly new, entrepreneurship runs in the family.
Their great grandfather opened Cicero Macaroni, a pasta factory in Cicero, in 1922. Their grandfather eventually sold the business to Riviana Foods Inc., the maker of No Yolks and Wacky Mac noodles.

The Frat Party Is Over. And Vice Has Matured.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- Danny Gabai was used to being ignored. For years, he ran what may have been Vice Media's most uncool business -- the production of feature films, made to be shown in theaters.
Whatever, dude. We do digital stuff here.
"We were seen as a redheaded stepchild," Mr. Gabai said, "if our existence was acknowledged at all."
But that was the old Vice, the one that functioned less as a company and more as an out-of-control frat party. The new Vice, which started to take shape last year, with the arrival of a new chief executive, Nancy Dubuc, has decided to turn Mr. Gabai's operation into an anchor division, one she hopes can help Vice overcome difficulties elsewhere in its empire.
Ms. Dubuc, who has vowed to stop the flow of red ink at Vice by next year, named Mr. Gabai the head of Vice Studios U.S. in January and gave him a mandate: Drastically increase the number of television shows the company produces for outside buyers while continuing to make a smattering of sharp-edged feature films.
"It's a tremendous opportunity for us," she said, noting the proliferation of streaming services and their "more, more, more" need for original movies and series.
In some ways, Vice's heightened focus on its studio is an acknowledgment of the shifting tides in media. Upstart online media companies like Vice and BuzzFeed that became darlings during the digital advertising boom have lately been retrenching. Online-ad spending has become increasingly controlled by Facebook, Google and Amazon.
"Vice has found itself dependent on a terribly difficult advertising environment," said Mike Vorhaus, a longtime digital media consultant.
Vice laid off 10 percent of its work force this year and recently folded a half-dozen sites into its core Vice.com, a streamlining the company explained as benefiting both advertisers and audiences. Last week, the Walt Disney Company, which owns about 27 percent of Vice, revealed in a securities filing that it had taken a $ 353 million write-down on its stake. Disney had previously written off $ 157 million.
But the studio business is thriving. Companies that make films and television shows -- old media -- have been awash in money from streaming services. Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Apple and Disney Plus will spend roughly $ 15 billion combined on original content next year, according to Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research.
Vice Studios, which includes a British production company, Pulse Films, has had five shows premiere this year, including "1994," a docuseries about a pivotal year in Mexican politics, on Netflix . Vice has 15 additional shows in production, including the scripted "Gangs of London," a big-budget action drama commissioned by HBO's Cinemax and Sky, the British pay-television service.
Mr. Gabai said the studio had more than 60 series in development worldwide. Many are unscripted, and some are based on Vice articles. Vice Studios employs 69 people and has overseas production hubs in London and Singapore.
Vice-produced films include documentaries like "Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened," which was a recent hit for Netflix, and the coming "AKA Jane Roe," described as an exposé about Norma McCorvey, the anonymous plaintiff in Roe v. Wade. It will roll out at fall festivals.
Scripted movies from Vice Studios include "The Report," a political drama involving the torture of terrorism detainees in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. Amazon paid $ 14 million for rights to the film, which stars Annette Bening as Senator Dianne Feinstein. It arrives in theaters on Sept. 20.
Vice is far from the only company going after streaming money. The field includes Viacom and NBCUniversal, which are coping with cord cutting by shifting their channel-centric business models to studio-centric strategies. Viacom's MTV, for instance, started a studio last year to produce series for outside buyers; its first effort is a reboot of "The Real World" for Facebook. Universal Content Productions has expanded to make shows like "Homecoming" (Amazon) and "The Act" (Hulu).
Vice has its own cable network challenges. Its three-year-old channel, Viceland, which is in 66 million homes in the United States (170 million worldwide), has struggled to find an audience. Last year, Viceland attracted an average of 88,000 prime-time viewers, an 8 percent decline from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. One of Ms. Dubuc's first attempts to find a hit, "Vice Live," a nightly show, was canceled in April after two months on the air.
Viceland recently announced a pair of summer shows and said four additional series had been ordered, including "Donkmaster," about street racing. Ms. Dubuc said Viceland remained a "tremendously valuable" part of the company.
Vice's partnership with HBO, where "Vice News Tonight" runs on weekdays, has been more fruitful. The show, aimed at young adults, attracts about 560,000 viewers per episode. HBO is expected to make a renewal decision this year, however, and some of the program's advocates at HBO are no longer there -- namely Richard Plepler, the channel's former chief executive, who decamped in February.
Asked to assess her turnaround efforts at Vice, Ms. Dubuc said: "We've made quite a bit of progress in a short amount of time. The last two quarters have been very strong." She noted that the company's in-house advertising agency, Virtue, brought in 20 new clients last year, including Google Chrome and Marriott Rewards.
Vice raised $ 250 million in debt financing this month from a group of investors including the Soros Management Fund.
Ms. Dubuc said Vice Studios had not been on her radar before she started, even though she was a Vice board member. "Let's just say that we weren't getting regular updates," she said dryly.
On her first day, Mr. Gabai sent her a text message inviting her to the set of "The Report," which was filming near Vice's Brooklyn headquarters. "I was like, 'What the hell is going on?"' she said.
Mr. Gabai quickly impressed her. "I trust his taste," Ms. Dubuc said, adding that she liked his "very patient, slow-and-steady-wins-the-race demeanor."
Such qualities used to prompt frowns at Vice. But this is most definitely not the same out-of-control, testosterone-fueled company where Ms. Dubuc's predecessor, Shane Smith, once set the tone by wandering nearly naked through the office. He stepped down as chief executive last year, several months after a New York Times investigation detailed a culture of sexual misconduct at the company. He is now executive chairman of Vice's board.
Over lunch at the Avalon Hotel in Beverly Hills, Mr. Gabai came across as bookish and a bit introverted. When asked how he had first come to work at Vice, he responded, "I got hit by a car."
That was 2011, and Mr. Gabai was working as an agent at William Morris Endeavor, where he represented auteurs like Roman Coppola. The accident left him with cracked vertebrae and a new outlook on life. So the button-down Mr. Gabai -- who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in economics -- went to work for Vice in its Los Angeles office in late 2012.
"It was a free-for-all, but a fun one," he said.
By 2017, when Vice Studios was officially formed, Mr. Gabai had pushed through films like "Fishing Without Nets," a foreign-language drama set in Somalia, and the well-reviewed documentary "Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond." It looked at Jim Carrey's transformation into the comic Andy Kaufman in the biopic "Man on the Moon."
Ms. Dubuc wants Vice Studios to focus more on television and less on risky art films. Vice's most recent movie, "The Beach Bum," directed by Harmony Korine ("Spring Breakers") and starring Matthew McConaughey, took in a feeble $ 3.5 million at the box office.
"We're really proud of that film, though," Mr. Gabai said. "It's exactly the Vice brand -- audacious, bold, not dictated by algorithm."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is planning to use a different method to estimate the "future health risks of air pollution" in an analysis of a proposed new rule, which could "drastically" decrease the projected number of premature deaths from air pollution, The New York Times reported Monday.
Citing conversations with a handful of people familiar with the plans, the Times said the EPA's new technique could change a 2018 estimate by the Trump administration that said there could be 1,400 premature deaths each year due to a new agency rule on pollution from coal plants.
The methodology, according to the paper, is notable "because it discards more than a decade of peer-reviewed E.P.A. methods and relies on unfounded medical assumptions."
The agency's new order, called the Affordable Clean Energy rule, is intended to roll back an Obama-era rule in order to "slightly improve the efficiency of coal plants. It would also allow older coal plants to remain in operation longer and result in an increase of particulate matter."
The Times noted that the estimate derived from the new technique would make it easier to defend the new Trump administration rule as it would "assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires." The change would mean that "on paper," a potential increase in air pollution could still mean there would be "far fewer deaths from heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease," the Times said.
The five people who spoke to the Times, all of whom are current or former agency officials, said the new technique "would be used in the agency's analysis of the final version of the ACE rule, which is expected to be made public in June." The inclusion of the new technique in the agency's final analysis of the rule was also confirmed to the paper by William L. Wehrum, the EPA's air quality chief.
Last fall, CNN reported that after then-acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler appointed five new members to the agency's independent committee that provides advice to the EPA on national air quality standards, some scientists became concerned that the committee would not be able to properly advise the EPA on its policies and procedures regarding national air quality standards. - (CNN)

Texto completo: When he was a National Guard soldier serving in Afghanistan, Derrick Miller loomed over a civilian who was being interrogated and fired a bullet into the man's head. Then Miller turned to another soldier and said, "I shot him. He was a liar. "
Miller was sent to prison eight years ago for that premeditated murder after a prosecutor urged a military court to make "a statement about how soldiers should behave. "
President Donald Trump will also make a statement about how soldiers should behave — one utterly misguided and corrosive to military order and good discipline — should he follow through on tentative plans reported by The New York Times to pardon, on or around Memorial Day, troops accused or convicted of war crimes.
"Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of moral responsibility," a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, declared on Twitter.
Miller, since released on parole, hopes to be among those pardoned. Others include:
REP. HUNTER: Commander in chief Donald Trump's pardon is warranted
►Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused by platoon members of wanton violence, including stabbing to death a teenage boy, and gunning down a girl and an old man from a sniper's nest. Gallagher is said to have boasted about his kills and labeled as traitors those who reported his alleged crimes. In a March tweet, Trump moved him to less restrictive confinement in "honor of his past service to our country. "
►Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, a Green Beret charged with summarily executing a man suspected of being a Taliban bomb-maker who had been ordered released after an interrogation. Golsteyn admitted the crime only after undergoing a polygraph while trying to join the CIA. Trump called him a "U. S. military hero" in a tweet last year.
►Former Blackwater contractor Nicholas Slatten, convicted of instigating the slaughter of 14 Iraqi civilians and the wounding of 17 with a cadre of Blackwater gunmen at a Baghdad intersection. Trial evidence revealed that Slatten viewed Iraqis as "animals. "
Holding these men accountable for wartime barbarities has somehow been misconstrued by elements of Trump's base as justice gone awry. Trump, who trafficks in a culture of pseudo toughness that endorses torture or the killing of terrorist families, has caught their drift.
Pardoning a convicted war criminal is not out of character for Trump. Earlier this month, he pardoned a former Army first lieutenant serving time for "unpremeditated murder in a combat zone. " He had been convicted of ordering an Iraqi prisoner to strip naked before shooting the man to death.
War by its nature is brutally dehumanizing. The U. S. military copes by working to instill order and discipline, and it has been largely successful in a human history of armies that have ruthlessly slaughtered civilians and defeated combatants alike.
"Although military necessity justifies certain actions necessary to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible," reads the Defense Department's Law of War Manual, "military necessity cannot justify actions . . . such as cruelty or wanton violence. "
Trump would turn this military maxim on its head if he chooses to issue these pardons, with the added blasphemy of doing it on a holiday honoring all that Americans cherish about the sacrifices of those in uniform.

Warren did a wide array of legal work while a professor

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren worked on about 60 legal matters during her prior career as a law professor, advising people with asbestos disease, a corporation facing possible liability over ruptured breast implants and the former directors of Getty Oil as they monitored the Texaco bankruptcy in 1987.
Warren's presidential campaign released a list of 56 cases on the Massachusetts Democrat's website late Wednesday, a far higher number than she had previously disclosed. The Washington Post had requested a detailed accounting of her outside work and has separately identified several additional cases that appeared to involve Warren.
Warren's legal consulting work has received little scrutiny over the course of her political career, and the new list may offer her opponents fresh avenues for attack. Many of the cases pitted "sympathetic interests against each other," according to Warren's campaign.
Since her first campaign for the Senate in 2012, Warren has cast herself as a fighter against overbearing corporate interests and criticized policymakers and experts who have accepted money from large companies.
During that election, Warren came under pressure from her Republican opponent and the news media to discuss her legal work. At the time, she released a list of 13 cases without saying whether it represented a full accounting; at least one other case came to light during the race.
A spokeswoman for Warren's presidential campaign said that it had always planned to make records of Warren's legal work public and that the documents were released Wednesday night because that was when they were ready.
"Elizabeth was one of the nation's top experts on how to make sure victims hurt by bankrupt companies eventually got paid," Warren's website said Wednesday night. "Throughout her career, she worked to help set up trusts and other mechanisms to return $27 billion to victims and their families."
The list includes work going back to the 1980s, but the bulk of her consulting occurred when Warren was a professor at Harvard Law School and at the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1987 to 2012.
Legal experts who reviewed the list of cases said that most appeared to be consistent with Warren's liberal politics. Several were groundbreaking bankruptcy cases, they said.
"These are cases where the court is struggling with unresolved issues and she is trying to convince the court how she thinks the bankruptcy code should be interpreted," said Robert K. Rasmussen, a professor at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law who was familiar with many of the 12 amicus briefs that Warren listed and consulted with parties on the opposite side of at least one case.
"She looks like she was pretty selective in what she did," he said. "With most of them she is consistent with her positions. In none of them is she contrary to them."
The Post found that a wave of Warren's legal work came in the early 2000s as manufacturing companies whose products contained asbestos were forced into bankruptcy by waves of personal injury claims.
A nationally recognized expert in bankruptcy law, Warren consulted for more than a dozen committees representing claimants and creditors in these cases, often in partnership with the law firm Caplin & Drysdale.
Warren did legal work related to major U.S. corporations. In 1987, she advised the former directors of Getty Oil on "Texaco's bankruptcy and the settlement negotiations between Texaco and Pennzoil," the list stated. In 2003, she served as an expert witness for the Fuller-Austin Insulation Co. in a case against insurers. In 2005, she provided testimony that bolstered the case of the private-equity firm Platinum Equity in a contractual dispute.
One of her most controversial clients was Dow Chemical, which she advised in the mid-1990s. A subsidiary that manufactured silicone-gel breast implants faced hundreds of thousands of claims from women who said their implants caused health problems. Dow Chemical denied that it played a role in designing or making the implants and sought to avoid liability as its subsidiary, Dow Corning, declared bankruptcy.
"In this case, Elizabeth served as a consultant to ensure adequate compensation for women who claimed injury from silicone breast implants who otherwise might not have received anything when Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy," Warren's list of cases said. "Thanks in part to Elizabeth's efforts, Dow Corning created a $2.35 billion fund to compensate women claiming injury from Dow Corning's silicone breast implants."
Warren did not release information about how much time she spent on each case. A set of guidelines adopted in 1991 required Harvard Law School faculty members to limit their outside activities to 20 percent of their "total professional effort."
One Harvard Law professor and former colleague of Warren's questioned the practice of outside consulting by legal academics. "I think it's potentially corrupting," said Bruce Hay, who specializes in legal procedure. "It creates conflicts of interest if you have a financial interest in taking one position that conflicts with your settled scholarly judgment."
Hay said he was surprised by the volume of Warren's work. "One of the things that troubles me is nobody knows about this," he said. "It's all kept completely under wraps, but they're using the Harvard name in everything they do."
Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who worked with Warren on one matter that went to the Supreme Court, wrote in an email that Warren's outside work "always reinforced (rather than ever detracting from) her highly successful teaching and her exemplary role as a mentor."
In a 2001 affidavit, filed in the bankruptcy proceedings of chemical company W.R. Grace, Warren wrote that she "sharply limit[s] the time I spend on paid consultation, spending the remainder of my time either on my university work or on uncompensated writing, research, lecturing and various pro bono activities."
Warren's $675-per-hour rate of compensation to consult on several asbestos-related cases, as described in court documents, was at or below market rate for her level of experience and was less than what some law firm partners charged to work on the same matters.
Trustees in several asbestos cases initially objected to or raised questions about Warren's qualifications and proposed hourly rate. In an affidavit replying to one such objection in 2001, she defended her expertise.
"I have been working, writing, lecturing, and consulting in the bankruptcy field for twenty-two years," she wrote. "My fee is commensurate with other professionals of similar experience. I do not share in [law firm] partnership profits."
In summarizing many of her cases, Warren's campaign cast her as advocating for victims or saving jobs by representing the interests of a company.
For example, Warren's work on behalf of Fairchild Aircraft, a case that arose after a plane crash in which the manufacturer was not found at fault, was described as protecting "hundreds of jobs." When she represented the interests of asbestos claimants, her work was described as advocating for victims.
Warren's roles in these cases varied. At times, she served as an expert witness or filed briefs; at other times, she advised fellow lawyers or represented clients directly. She worked in more than 20 courts, including the Supreme Court, where she participated in at least eight cases.
The asbestos cases included work on behalf of Travelers Insurance. In that case, which the Boston Globe first reported on in May 2012, Warren helped the company fight for immunity from asbestos litigation by forming a $500 million trust for current and future victims. But after she was no longer involved, Travelers was able to temporarily avoid paying the $500 million, an outcome that Warren told the Globe she had not foreseen. In July 2014, a federal appeals court ordered Travelers to pay the $500 million.
Warren did not release details about her compensation, and that information was scant in court records. Documents reviewed by The Post showed that she made at least $462,322 from her work on 13 cases. Warren has released her tax returns since 2008, and much of her legal consulting work is not reflected in those documents.
A spokeswoman for Warren's campaign said there are no plans to release additional returns.
Tax returns show that in the five years before Warren became a senator, she made a total of $753,929 on "consulting, lecturing, writing, investing." This income included book royalties and consulting for clients such as Travelers Indemnity and the Fuller-Austin Asbestos Settlement Trust.
At $846,394, Warren's adjusted gross income for 2018 was the second-highest of the 11 presidential candidates who have released tax returns, according to an analysis this month by the New York Times. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) had the highest income, at $1,889,156. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who came in third after Warren, made $561,293.

Texto completo: Poor Mr. Ambrose. The faculty adviser to the Fitchburg High School class of 1994 had what seemed like an easy side gig lined up: Get the seniors pumped to graduate!
But his charges that year were no ordinary clatch of teens. 
We were grown-up bicentennial babies with zero interest in rallies or field days. We were staunchly anti-pomp, anti-circumstance, and held a deep disdain toward institutions, obligations, expectations, and anything that forced us to look up from whatever we were scratching into our literal desktops with long-dead pens. If there was anything we shared as a “class," it was a borderline antagonistic indifference toward just about everything — your dumb prom included.
We liked Mr. Ambrose more than most of his colleagues, so it wasn't like we were trying to turn him bright pink. We weren't trying to do anything.
Nor were we clawing at the walls of good old FHS (again, too much effort). It was more like we were unconsciously drifting through its halls like bored ghosts, and our dour presence haunted our assigned adult, who blasted us through a distorted PA at optimistically regular assemblies for sucking so bad (and yet so dutifully), eventually throwing his hands up and dubbing us the “Who Cares?" class — it's even emblazoned on the cover of our yearbooks. 
Mr. Ambrose's frustration was understandable — not just because his primary audience spent more time texting one another (i.e. passing notes) than tuning into his hopes for us. Imagine the ennui of “The Breakfast Club" multiplied by the epidemic chaos of “Gremlins." He had no reference point, no plan of attack against this army of the dead. We were peak Gen-X. Whatever.
I think about the plumes of steam firing from Mr. Ambrose's ears a lot lately, as Gen-X itself appears to be joylessly enjoying a moment of recognition. (Which, irony registered, is the only thing we wanted all along!)
A sprawling recent New York Times package — “This Gen-X Mess" — was true to its name, offering a virtual Trapper Keeper stuffed with the “tech, music, style, books, trends, rules, films, and pills that made Gen-X . . . so so-so." (In a well-executed design nod to the restless malaise of it's subject, an invisible hand doodles ambivalently over the screen if it sits still too long.)
A Washington Post piece by Petula Dvorak declared “time's up" for baby boomers, making the case that while Gen-X is small (just 25 percent of the population because you didn't want two kids) we occupy a generational sweet spot that predisposes us to solving big problems. (Like the ones we have now.)
The cycle of generations, she argues, synchronizes Gen-Xers with “Heroes" like Eisenhower, Grant, and (“the Gen-Xer of his day") George Washington. “Our parents were both the hippies and the wolves of Wall Street," Dvorak writes. “And we are experts at surviving both. It made us the repairers, the fixers, the uniters."
Hmm. That sounds a lot like caring. 
Dvorak's impulse may be part of a larger cultural fantasy about waking the oversleeping giant of Gen-X, which has found a comfortable place in the discourse high up on the bleachers, listlessly observing the battle between the millennials and the boomers like goths smoking cloves and watching a football scrimmage.
It's hard to say why, beyond the odometrics of a quarter century, this reappraisal of Gen-X is taking place. This “early onset nostalgia" feels thick in the pop-cultural air right now (the brazen Gen-X bait that is the lineup of the recent Just Like Heaven festival makes for a nice Exhibit A). It's hard to say how long we'll hang out in this feedback loop. (“Bill and Ted Face the Music" won't arrive for another year, if that's any indication.)
Can a generation united only by its shrugging consensus that reality bites truly be called on to repair anything? As the steadily graying area between more vocal generations, we find ourselves back in a familiar state: both neutral and neutralized. And as the generation weaned by worn-out VHS copies of “The Never Ending Story," losing Artax to the Swamp of Sadness taught us stubborn and valuable lessons about the efficacy of struggling against the quagmire.
So what wisdom can be wrung from Generation X's chronically Ringwaldian ennui? Mr. Ambrose may not approve, but I'm going to suggest an old tradition that now counts as a radical idea: Not Caring.
We Gen-Xers were raised in a vastly different attention economy, one where the currency of actually caring was primarily exchanged in person (and had to be worked for). Those eye-rolls we fired at Mr. Ambrose's plea for someone, anyone, to run for class president were the very same eye-rolls we shot across at the neo-Nazi losers poorly skateboarding around the parking lot of our Denny's. 
The sneer, the groan, the sigh, the knowing look, the labored silence, the mastery of “whatever" — this retired arsenal of antique social weapons still seem more effective to me than the Facebook argument, the furious Tweet, the one-star Yelp review, and the myriad “cancellations" of social media. 
If Gen-X has one thing to offer those who come behind us (even you Gen Y weirdos who insist you're not millennials) let it be the power of targeted, weaponized apathy. 
He may not have known it at the time, but Mr. Ambrose struggling so earnestly to engage us was actually a teaching moment. I'll have to thank him at our 25th reunion. 
Oh wait, I missed it. Whatever.

Texto completo: SHEBOYGAN - It's hard to believe Memorial Day weekend is already here. Here's a sampling of upcoming Sheboygan County events to check out over the long weekend.
Downtown Sheboygan to host Memorial Day parade On Monday, downtown Sheboygan will host its annual Memorial Day parade. Kicking off at 9 a.m., the route will begin at 7th Street and Erie Avenue and head to Fountain Park, where a ceremony will take place. The ceremony will honor America's service men and women with a guest speaker, performances and a moment of silence. There will also be a brat fry with the proceeds going to Stars and Stripes Honor Flight.
'The Big Cheese' returns to Osthoff Resort The Osthoff Resort in Elkhart Lake is doing its part to pay homage to the Wisconsin cheese experience at its 2019 "The Big Cheese" event, set for Memorial Day weekend, with pleasantly surprising pairings of all sorts filling the schedule.
There will be sessions dedicated to pairings of cheese and microbrews, cheese and bourbon, cheese and tea, cheese and cocktails, and of course cheese and wine. Cheesemaking workshops will have attendees making their own ricotta and mozzarella cheeses. There will be a cheese and cocktail cruise each day of the event. Also included on the schedule are an Italian cooking class at the resort's L'ecole de la Maison cooking school Saturday morning led by New York Times-published chef Adam Weisell of Chicago, a nine-course artisan cheese dinner Saturday evening hosted by Osthoff chef and culinary director Patrick O'Toole, and a cheese marketplace on Sunday.

Texto completo: Austin Kleon didn't mean to write a trilogy of best selling self-help books, he swears.
"It's been a complete accident," Kleon laughed. "I joke with people that if you'd told me when I was 19 that my books were shelved in self-help, I might have cried."
The New York Times Bestselling author of "Steal Like an Artist" is far from tears, though, as he wraps up his tour for his most recent book, "Keep Going" in Iowa City on Friday. Kleon will appear at Prairie Lights at 7 p.m. to read from the new book and advise audience members on how to stay focused on their artistic aims.
When the first book in his impromptu trilogy, 2012's "Steal Like an Artist" went viral, he knew there had to be a sequel. That manifested in 2014's "Show Your Work," based on his experience being on book tour following the success of his first book.
Now, he wraps up his trilogy of self help with "Keep Going." Coming five years after his last book, he felt "Keep Going" gave him the opportunity to write the book he most wanted to see in the world; a book written for people struggling with the creative process, by someone still struggling with the creative processes.
"I try really hard to tell my readers, 'Look, I am no guru, I am no expert, I am a fellow student,'" Kleon said. "I'm letting you copy over my shoulder. I'm trying to let you along on this studying that I'm doing ... I'm really interested in the idea that a student can teach more than a teacher can."
The lesson for his fellow students is how to stay motivated and how to make a structured schedule. This is advice Kleon himself has been able to follow over the past few weeks, while touring the book. Though the daily difficulty of maintaining structure on the road is a challenge, Kleon says he tries to treat it like a checklist.
There's three things he tries to do everyday: write in his diary (private writing), post on his blog (public writing) and finding time to take a walk. Even if the writing he does isn't an opus and even if the walking is just "in circles around the Richmond Airport" it's about making confronting creativity a daily manageable thing.
"People think they need to go away for like a decade, but what they really need is like an hour a day over a decade," said Kleon. "Treat the days like Lego bricks, and eventually build a castle."
Having completed this set of three, Kleon is still considering what to do next. And while he's hesitant to write a book on parenting, he's fascinated by the unbridled creativity of his children.
"Every day my son Owen will record an album in an afternoon," Kleon said. "He'll sit down and say, 'I'll do an album about the solar system. OK, we'll start with Mercury.' My son Jules, who's 4, just draws the way every artist wishes they could. He fills the page with everything he has, looks at it and throws it on the floor."
It's that unashamed, unfiltered creativity Kleon thinks people loose around puberty, when they become self-conscious and more sensitive about what others think. After years of having explored the creative process, the most valuable thing his books have given his readers is permission; specifically, the permission to create the way they did as kids.
"That's a strange word for me because it makes me feel like a teacher handing out bathroom passes," Kleon said. "When I was a kid, I had a few of those permission experiences where it suddenly dawned on me, that, hey I can do [creative work], too.'"

Whitney Houston Hologram Tour Is Planned Along with New Album

Texto completo: Seven years after Whitney Houston's death, the sister-in-law of the late music icon is set to reinvent the diva's brand by planning a hologram tour and release of a new album in the near future.
According to The New York Times, Pat Houston has revealed plans for a global concert series using advanced technology to bring the singer's likeness to the stage. A compilation of previously unreleased tracks from the 1985 album "Whitney Houston" is also in the works.
"The hologram has taken precedence over everything," Pat told the Times, adding that the hologram will perform several of the late singer's hits, including "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)" and "The Greatest Love of All." Original band members and backup singers (including Whitney's brother and Pat's husband, Gary) will provide background support.
As estate executor, Houston told the Times that there are also potential plans for a Broadway musical, and a Vegas-style show.
"Everything is about timing for me," Houston confirmed. "It's been quite emotional for the past seven years. But now it's about being strategic."
Houston's estate has inked a deal with Primary Wave Music Publishing, which "will acquire 50 percent of the estate's assets, including Houston's royalties from music and film, and merchandising, as well as the right to use her name and likeness," the outlet writes.
"Whitney was America's sweetheart," said Larry Mestel, the founder of Primary Wave. "And the idea now is to remind people that that is what her legacy is."
Mestel also noted that Primary Wave will be careful and considerate of how they present the singer and the branding opportunities they accept.
"For Whitney Houston, who had an elegant voice and an elegant way about her, we wouldn't do a fast-food brand relationship, for example," Mestel said.
"Before she passed, there was so much negativity around the name; it wasn't about the music anymore," Houston said of her late sister-in-law. "People had forgotten how great she was. They let all the personal things about her life outweigh why they fell in love with her in the first place."

THE NATION; Democrats divided on impeachment; Frustrated by Trump's resistance, more lawmakers are calling for House action.

Texto completo: Numerous House Democrats on Tuesday demanded immediate impeachment proceedings against President Trump amid White House resistance to their investigations, a marked increase in support for launching an effort to remove the president from office.
The calls came in response to former White House Counsel Donald McGahn's refusal to attend a congressional hearing, despite a House subpoena. The snub served as a final straw for several Democrats who were already leaning toward starting an impeachment inquiry.
There are still many Democrats -- chief among them House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who are reluctant to pursue impeachment, worried about the political risk of appearing too eager to oust Trump and aware that the GOP-controlled Senate is all but certain to refuse to convict Trump and remove him from office.

But the move toward impeachment puts Pelosi in the middle of a divided House Democratic caucus. She has advocated for a cautious approach, arguing that she would only support impeachment if it is bipartisan and amid overwhelming evidence. She has called a closed-door speaker's meeting with her members for Wednesday morning to discuss where the House's many investigations and lawsuits stand.
Several Democrats came out publicly in support of an impeachment inquiry for the first time. Among them were prominent Democrats such as Reps. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Pramila Jayapal of Washington, co-chairs of the influential Congressional Progressive Caucus; freshman Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, vice chair of the Judiciary Committee; and Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, who is also on the panel.
Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who is chairman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said Monday night that McGahn's refusal to testify would push him to call for impeachment.
"What people have realized is it's not just everything detailed in [special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's] report. It's the administration's continuing refusal to cooperate with Congress and attempt to continue to obstruct justice," said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who called for impeachment proceedings. "That's why I think more and more people are frustrated, because we've never seen anything like this."
Jayapal, who sits on the Judiciary Committee at the center of the investigations, says the support is growing among both progressives and centrists.
Democrats "are coming up to me saying: We were elected to do a job. We were sworn to uphold the Constitution," she said. "A situation in which the president and the administration can completely -- not just undermine, but actually destroy -- the foundation of checks and balances is something we can't" ignore.
While centrists may have spoken to Jayapal privately, those who have publicly called for impeachment proceedings are, for the most part, the House's most progressive members, those who are most likely to have long supported impeachment.
"I don't feel the numbers [of impeachment supporters] are increasing, but the megaphone is getting bigger," said one senior Democratic aide. "The amp is going up, but the chorus is not growing."
Pelosi's job now will be to prevent the dam from breaking. She has forged a winding path of congressional investigations and subpoenas that may prolong a final decision on impeachment until election day 2020, when the president will be on the ballot and the question could be moot. Pelosi and other senior Democrats don't want to begin impeachment proceedings unless they know it will be successful, according to Democratic aides.
But senior Democratic leaders acknowledge that it may be hard to hold lawmakers back for 18 months. There is unlikely "any Democrat who probably wouldn't in their gut say: 'You know, he's done some things that probably justify impeachment,'" said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). But "this is the important thing. I think the majority of the Democrats continue to believe that we need to continue to pursue the avenue that we've been on, in trying to elicit information, testimony, review the Mueller report [and] review other items going on. And if the facts lead us to broader action, so be it."
Some Democrats are worried about losing focus on the issues "we were elected to" work on -- things such as healthcare policy, immigration reform and infrastructure, said Rep. Scott Peters (D-San Diego).
But he acknowledged that he expected Congress to pursue impeachment proceedings.
"It just wouldn't surprise me if that's where it ends up," he said. "I don't know what the alternatives are if he's going to stick his middle finger up to Congress and pretend he's a king."
The House's pace of investigations shows no sign of slowing. The Judiciary Committee on Tuesday subpoenaed former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks as well as a former White House counsel's office aide, Annie Donaldson.
Earlier Tuesday, the panel convened to hear testimony from McGahn, who was a pivotal witness for Mueller's team but said that he would abide by the Justice Department's instruction to not testify before Congress.
He was directly involved in some of the most explosive incidents detailed in the Mueller report, such as Trump's effort to fire the special counsel. McGahn prepared to resign rather than pass along Trump's directive that Mueller needed to be removed, and he told former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus that Trump had asked him to do "crazy shit," according to the report.
After the New York Times revealed the incident, Trump tried to persuade McGahn to release a statement disputing the report. He also wanted McGahn to write a letter "for our records" to say it wasn't true. McGahn declined to take either step.

Joe Scarborough compares Trump to ‘short, fat, little man behind the curtain’

Texto completo: As the "Morning Joe" panel was discussing how people who voted for President Trump in 2016 are still planning on voting for him in 2020 despite some of his economic promises have not come through on Tuesday, host Joe Scarborough compared Trump to the Wizard of Oz.
"Willie brings up evangelical voters. Obviously so many evangelical leaders are just rank hypocrites. If you take what they said about Bill Clinton in 1998, 1999, 2000 and now what they're saying about Donald Trump in 2017, 18, 19, they are rank hypocrites," Scarborough said.
"But with these workers in Youngstown, Ohio, we have seen it time and again, people voting against their economic self-interest. The manufacturing jobs in Youngstown are not coming back. The other jobs that— mining Jobs that Donald Trump is talking about, not only are they not coming back, they’re going away. The few high profile examples, whether it's Carrier, or Ford, even Foxconn that Donald Trump talked about, they’ve all blown up in his face," he said.
"The question is, will those voters discover that this billionaire, that this plutocrat is nothing more than the short, fat, little man behind the curtain in 'The Wizard of Oz,'" Scarborough said, asking if voters will realize who Trump is before the 2020 election.

The New York Times story the panel referred to reported on how voters in Ohio, who were once Democrats, will still vote for Trump, even though they haven't experienced an economic boom.
"What I want from a president is the rest of the world to look at him and go, ‘Don’t mess with that guy, he will get even,'" Darrell Franks said. “I don’t want kinder, gentler. I don’t want some female that wants her agenda."

Now most are accomplices with their silence. Good luck in 2018, boys. #ByeBye," Joe Scarborough tweeted Saturday. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump's lawyers on Tuesday notified a federal judge that they have appealed "all aspects" of a Monday ruling that the president's accounting firm must turn over his financial records to Congress.
The two-page notice filed in federal court in Washington marks the latest move in a gathering legal battle over Congress's oversight powers.
US District Judge Amit P. Mehta, in a 41-page ruling Monday, flatly rejected arguments from the president's lawyers that the House Oversight Committee's demands for the records from Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, were overly broad and served no legitimate legislative function.
"It is simply not fathomable," the judge wrote, "that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct — past or present — even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry."
It was not immediately clear how quickly the Appeals Court would schedule briefings and oral arguments. The court's calendar lists only one argument through the summer. But the court can add cases as needed before a three-judge panel "if the case is important enough or requires quick disposition," DC Circuit Clerk Mark Langer said Tuesday.
It also would be up to circuit judges whether to put the committee subpoena on hold pending consideration of Trump's appeal.
Mehta denied Trump's bid to block the subpoena while his lawsuit filed April 22 continues, and went further by rendering a final decision to speed consideration by the Appeals Court.
Mehta had refused to stay his order to comply with the subpoena beyond seven days to allow time for an appeal, but Trump's lawyers acted within hours. Speaking to reporters on Monday after the ruling, Trump called the opinion "crazy" and said he would appeal, adding, "We think it's totally the wrong decision by, obviously, an Obama-appointed judge."

Longtime Fed critic vetted by the Trump administration
The Trump administration is vetting Judy Shelton, a conservative economist and former Trump campaign adviser, for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board, according to people familiar with the matter, putting the longtime Fed critic one step closer to a leadership role at an institution she would like to drastically change.
Shelton, 64, was recently interviewed by Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, but has yet to meet with President Trump.
If nominated and confirmed, Shelton would take one of two open positions on the seven-member board of governors in Washington. Two of Trump's would-be nominees, Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, were withdrawn from consideration after Republican lawmakers made clear they would not support their nominations given concerns about their past treatment of, or statements about, women.
Shelton, now executive director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, previously advised Trump during his presidential campaign and served on his transition team.

Ex-Va. attorney general to join Homeland Security
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will hire conservative firebrand and former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli to buttress its immigration efforts, according to three administration officials.
Cuccinelli will work at the Department of Homeland Security in a senior role, a senior White House official said, declining to specify what Cuccinelli's duties will entail, what his job title will be or if he will report to Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan.
The hiring appears to come in response to Trump's desire for an immigration "czar" to help coordinate border policies across agencies, officials said, although the job will be more limited in nature.
Cuccinelli was at the White House on Monday, officials said. He could not be immediately reached for comment. News of Cuccinelli's expected hiring was first reported by The New York Times.
The former Virginia attorney general is deeply disliked by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who has vowed to block Cuccinelli from any Senate-confirmed post after Cuccinelli helped lead efforts in 2014 backing insurgent candidates that hurt the Senate GOP majority, McConnell advisers said.
At the Republican Party convention in 2016, Cuccinelli protested the "petty, tyrannical rules" and threw his convention badge on the floor in protest of Trump's nomination. He was a strong supporter of the presidential bid by Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican.
Washington Post
IRS tax return memo rebuts administration stance
WASHINGTON — A confidential Internal Revenue Service legal memo says tax returns must be given to Congress unless the president takes the rare step of asserting executive privilege, according to a copy of the memo obtained by The Washington Post.
The memo contradicts the Trump administration's justification for denying lawmakers' request for President Trump's tax returns, exposing fissures in the executive branch.
Trump has refused to turn over his tax returns but has not invoked executive privilege. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has instead denied the returns by arguing there is no legislative purpose for demanding them.
But, according to the IRS memo, the disclosure of tax returns to the committee "is mandatory, requiring the Secretary to disclose returns, and return information, requested by the tax-writing Chairs."
The 10-page document says the law "does not allow the Secretary to exercise discretion in disclosing the information provided the statutory conditions are met" and directly rejects the reason that Mnuchin has cited for witholding the information.

Texto completo: ATLANTA - A billionaire technology investor and philanthropist says he will provide grants to wipe out the student debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse College - an estimated $40 million.
Robert F. Smith, this year's commencement speaker, made the announcement Sunday morning while addressing nearly 400 graduating seniors of the all-male historically black college in Atlanta. Smith is the Founder and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that invests in software, data, and technology-driven companies.
"On behalf of the eight generations of my family that have been in this country, we're gonna put a little fuel in your bus," Smith told the graduates. "This is my class, 2019. And my family is making a grant to eliminate their student loans."
The announcement elicited stunned looks from faculty and students alike, before the graduates broke into the biggest cheers of the morning. Morehouse said it is the single largest gift to the college.
Smith, who received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony, had already announced a $1.5 million gift to the school.
The pledge to eliminate student debt for the class of 2019 is estimated to be $40 million.
In the weeks before graduating from Morehouse on Sunday, 22-year-old finance major Aaron Mitchom drew up a spreadsheet to calculate how long it would take him to pay back his $200,000 in student loans - 25 years at half his monthly salary, per his calculations.
In an instant, that number vanished. Mitchom, sitting in the crowd, wept.
Report: Trump, Kushner bank transactions raised red flag
NEW YORK - Multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner aroused the suspicion of anti-money laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank in 2016 and 2017, according to The New York Times.
The specialists recommended the matter be referred to a unit of the Treasury Department that polices financial crimes, but bank executives rejected their advice, the newspaper reported on Sunday.
As a result, the "suspicious activity reports" about the transactions were never filed with the government, the New York Times reported.
The report didn't give specifics about the nature of the transactions but said some of them involved money being transferred back and forth with foreign entities or individuals.
Report: Navy submariners kept list rating female crew, sex acts
Sailors aboard a U.S. Navy submarine circulated sexually explicit lists that ranked female crew members, an investigation found. The lists, first reported Friday by Military.com, were uncovered through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The 74-page investigative report reveals two lists - one with Yelp-like star ratings on the women and another containing "lewd and sexist comments" beside each woman's name, according to Military.com.
In February 2018, the USS Florida became the second to integrate female members. The misconduct came to light four months later, when two sailors aboard the Florida brought the lists to a superior officer, reporting that they were stored on an internal computer network and updated regularly, Military.com reported.
In oil-rich Venezuela, mile-long lines to buy gas in major city
MARACAIBO, Venezuela - U.S. sanctions on oil-rich Venezuela appear to be taking hold, resulting in mile-long lines for fuel in the South American nation's second-largest city, Maracaibo.
Some drivers said they'd had to wait almost 24 hours to fuel up, and people have been grabbing catnaps on the hoods of cars or in truck beds.
Nearing empty and stuck in line, infectious diseases doctor Yoli Urdaneta said she couldn't make her shift to treat patients.
"I've spent four days trying to get gasoline," Urdaneta said. "But I couldn't."
Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets, said Sunday that stiff U.S. sanctions on top of Venezuela's decaying refineries has begun to hit home.
Man charged in abduction of girl, 8, from street
FORT WORTH, Texas - A man has been charged in the abduction of an 8-year-old girl who was snatched from a street in Fort Worth, Texas, as she walked with her mother.
Fort Worth police say the girl was found safe Sunday, about eight hours later, at a hotel in nearby Forest Hill.
Police say 51-year-old Michael Webb was arrested on an aggravated kidnapping charge. He is being held without bond.
Officer Buddy Calzada says a man grabbed the girl Saturday evening, and sped away with her in a car. Police released surveillance video of the car. Police found Webb and the girl at the hotel after witnesses reported seeing the car there.
She was taken to a hospital.
Online records don't show an attorney representing Webb who can speak on his behalf.
Plane crash in Honduras kills 4 Americans,
1 Canadian
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras - Four Americans and a Canadian pilot were killed when a small plane went down off the coast of Roatan island in Honduras, officials said Sunday.
Armed Forces spokesman Jose Domingo Meza confirmed the nationalities of those who died in Saturday's crash.
The Piper Cherokee Six plummeted into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from the popular tourist destination of Roatan en route to the port of Trujillo. The military said in a statement that rescue boats with police divers and firefighters recovered four bodies within minutes of the crash, and transported another to a hospital, where he later died.
The U.S. State Department also confirmed the deaths of four U.S. citizens. They did not release names.
In Indiana: An explosion leveled a home in southern Indiana early Sunday, killing one person, injuring two others and leaving several nearby homes uninhabitable, authorities said.
Hours after the explosion shattered windows across a Jeffersonville neighborhood and sent debris flying onto roofs, lawns and cars, officials had not said what they believe caused the explosion.
Indiana State Police, Jeffersonville police and firefighters were at the scene, along with crews from Vectren, a natural gas provider.
Jeffersonville police Lt. Isaac Parker told The Courier-Journal that the house exploded just before 5 a.m. Sunday in the Ohio River city.

Texto completo: My colleague David Bornstein points out that a lot of American journalism is based on a mistaken theory of change. That theory is: The world will get better when we show where things have gone wrong. A lot of what we do in our business is expose error, cover problems and identify conflict.
The problem with this is that we leave people feeling disempowered and depressed. People who consume a lot of media of this sort sink into this toxic vortex - alienated from people they don't know, fearful about the future. They are less mobilized to take action, not more.
Bornstein, who writes for The New York Times and also co-founded the Solutions Journalism Network, says that you've got to expose problems, but you've also got to describe how the problems are being tackled. The search for solutions is more exciting than the problems themselves.
But many of our colleagues don't define local social repair and community-building as news. It seems too goody-goody, too "worthy," too sincere. It won't attract eyeballs.
That's wrong.
I've spent the past year around people who weave social fabric, and last week about 275 community weavers gathered in Washington, for a conference called #WeaveThePeople, organized by the Weave project I've been working on at the Aspen Institute.
The people at this gathering are some of the most compelling people I've ever met. Charles Perry was incarcerated for nearly two decades and now connects community members to health care systems in Chicago. Dylan Tête was an Army ranger who served in Iraq, suffered from PTSD and has built communities in New Orleans for vets. Sarah Adkins came home one Sunday to find her husband had killed their kids and himself, and she now runs a free pharmacy and leads a life of service in Appalachian Ohio.
Pancho Argüelles works in Texas, accompanying workers who have suffered spinal cord injuries on the job. He helps find the diapers, wheelchairs and other things that will allow them to live with dignity. Pancho radiates a deep wisdom, almost a holiness. As he and the others spoke about their values, the same thought kept pounding in my head: How is this not a story? Why don't we cover these people more?
At most conferences people lead with their bios, but at this gathering people led with their pain.
A prominent researcher described how she was abused as a child, and how this led her into her research into children's emotional development. A woman from South Carolina talked about loved ones she had lost and the time she tried to talk a man out of jumping off a bridge, finally confessing: If you jump, I'm going to jump, too. A man admitted that all the people he had loved had left him, and that he had lived with the trauma believing that his wife will leave him, too. In the atmosphere created this week he felt free to let go of that trauma.
It was emotionally gripping through and through. The weavers know how to open relationships with vulnerability and they know how to build connections and move to action. Their defining feature is that they are geniuses at relationship.
Martha Welch, a professor and researcher at Columbia, pointed out that our emotional health is dependent on connection with others. We don't just regulate emotions ourselves. We co-regulate with others and need connection with others to keep from spinning out of control.
Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out that associational life is the central feature of American life. But somehow we in the media under-cover this sector. We barely cover the most important social change agents. These people are not goody-goody. They are raw, honest and sometimes rude.
How did we in our business get in the spot where we spend 90% of our coverage on the 10% of our lives influenced by politics and 10% of our coverage on the 90% of our lives influenced by relationship, community and the places we live in every day?
George Will writes for the Washington Post. His syndicated column appears Sundays and Thursdays.

Texto completo: Not everyone is having a great summer in the Hamptons. Or so it seems in three new novels set on the East End.
Corey Halpern, the recent Southampton High School grad who centers Jason Allen's debut thriller, "The East End" (Park Row Books, 304 pp., $26.99), may have pranked once too often. This likable but troubled kid from a blue-collar family taunts the super-rich summer visitors he disdains by sneaking into their mansions and pulling stunts like dumping salt into their milk.
His latest sortie, though, may ruin more than a bowl of cereal. Prowling a lakeside mansion, Corey spies on billionaire owner Leo Sheffield, poolside with a suicidal boyfriend 30 years his junior. Anguished that closeted Leo won't openly declare his love, the boyfriend "snorts coke as if in a solo competition for the most fiendish dope fiend of all time." He loses his balance, topples into a swimming pool and drowns.
While a wife with "the forceful personality of a rooster" heads out from Manhattan, Leo desperately needs to bury the corpse and the case. Corey, meanwhile, decides to extort a million from Leo in return for his silence. The stash will spring Corey from Southampton and set him off to college.
Corey heads a slate of desperate characters. His mother, a maid at Leo's estate, is hooked on klonopin and cheap red wine. She's menaced by a physically abusive husband who's trying to cut debts by peddling pills. And the father of Corey's girlfriend has been in prison since she was 12.
The book jacket bio says author Allen "grew up in a working-class home in the Hamptons, where he worked a variety of blue-collar jobs for wealthy estate owners." Clearly he knows whereof he writes so well in "The East End." The book resonates with Allen's empathetic, affecting look at the struggles of some yearlong residents of the Hamptons - the ones who don't make the Styles section of The New York Times.
As Jamie Brenner's amiable if predictable "Drawing Home" (Little, Brown; 358 pp., $28) opens, Henry Wyatt, 83, a successful minimalist painter and longtime resident of Sag Harbor, drops dead in the bar of the American Hotel. Thirty years earlier, Wyatt had moved from Manhattan to the village, where he built on Actors Colony Road a "house called Windsong [that] sat like the jewel in a crown."
Wyatt's will stuns his survivors. He bequeathed his cottage and his paintings, worth millions, to 14-year-old Penny Mapson, a budding artist he'd mentored. In Manhattan.  Art patron Bea Winstead simmers. A diva you love to hate, Winstead worked with Wyatt to build his career; she's convinced he meant to leave his estate to her. She charges out to Sag Harbor to challenge the will, leading to a face-off with Penny's mother.
As their battle plays out by the village's familiar landmarks - the boat dock, the Whaling Museum, the American Hotel - Sag Harbor emerges as a revered, venerable character. Waiting for the jitney to Manhattan, Penny watches passengers "stand right in front of the burned-out pit [of the Sag Harbor Theater, victim of a fire] and just check their phones, not giving it a second glance. ... People who lived in town knew exactly what was missing."
"The Better Sister" (Harper, 311 pp., $26.99), Alafair Burke's observant thriller, kicks in when U.S. attorney Adam Macintosh is stabbed to death in his East Hampton beach house. Was the motive robbery? Or did someone or some group want him dead? Or was he murdered by his 16-year-old son, Ethan, with whom he'd had a turbulent relationship?
The plot focuses on these questions, but "The Better Sister" is more than a standard-issue whodunit. The underlying mystery becomes the mystery of character. In crisis, Burke's men and women pivot in startling ways.
Chloe Ann Taylor, Macintosh's widow, gained renown by writing a series of articles about rank-and-file women who had suffered sexual abuse - "the women who worked in factories and on sales floors ... waitresses and bartenders."
She also appears to be a valiant stepmother who rescued Ethan from his abusive, alcoholic mother, Nicky, Adam's first wife and Chloe's sister. But when Ethan is jailed to await trial for murdering Adam, Nicky turns sensitive and compassionate while Chloe, it turns out, is compromised. Who, indeed, is the better sister?
Burke, a professor at Hofstra University School of Law, caps her story with a keenly detailed trial taut with suspense. The case spins with reversals - it isn't over even when it's

Texto completo: A few things I care about . . .
■  With every passing night of hockey, the Bruins move closer to a championship. If the Black and Gold can earn the final five victories necessary for a Stanley Cup and drape themselves in the gold already glittering around those Red Socks and Red-White-and-Blue Patriots, local fans will celebrate in some rare air.
As the rest of the sporting nation gags, Boston will hold three of the four major sports championships simultaneously. The Celtics are the odd men out, an ignominious playoff flameout killing Boston's grand slam dream.
But there is another sporting grand slam still very much alive, and the quest for the second leg begins Thursday morning in New York.
Tiger Woods, reigning Masters champion, will hit the tee box at the PGA Championship at 8:24 a.m., his first tournament since resurrecting himself from the golfing grave last month at Augusta. And while it's unlikely that the 43-year-old will win all four majors this year, the fact that we can even dream about it is enough reason to turn our attention to golf, to root for the once-fallen hero to continue this amazing second chapter.
The evolution of Woods is compelling because of what it represents about the reasons we love sports so deeply. His is a comeback story for the ages, born not simply of debilitating injury (though a surgically repaired back certainly makes it that) but also of hubris, of Woods's precipitous fall from grace as one of the world's most admired athletes to one of its most ridiculed after a series of personal embarrassments from infidelity to public inebriation.
But for any of us to be invested in a comeback, we have to have been invested in the original story, and in that regard, Tiger was peerless. His immediate dominance in golf, his single-minded focus on being the best in the game, his open pursuit of Jack Nicklaus's all-time major record, and his disdain for anyone who dared get in his way, well, that's the stuff that made him a can't-miss phenomenon.
That was the stuff that was resurrected across four magical days in Augusta, when Woods showed a whole new generation of golf watchers— including his own children, who witnessed him winning a major for the first time — what the game is like when he's on top.
It's like nothing else I've ever seen.
This year's Masters was the 11th one I've covered, but the first one won by Woods. I saw everyman Phil Mickelson win all three of his green jackets, watched young buck Jordan Spieth win one (and nearly two others). I witnessed the Australian breakthrough of Adam Scott and watched Patrick Reed bring the jacket back to US shores after a four-year overseas voyage. I saw the unlikely two-time glory of Bubba Watson and the even-unlikelier victories of Danny Willett and Charl Schwartzel.
But what I saw on the Sunday of Tiger's win dwarfed them all. The scope of his influence was impossible to ignore, rivaling any of the most compelling scenes I've ever witnessed. Be it one unbelievable Patriots Super Bowl loss (to the Giants) or one remarkable Patriots Super Bowl win (over the Falcons), one historic Red Sox baseball comeback (against the Yankees) or two unforgettable Olympic gold medal moments (a women's ice hockey shootout and a men's curling team gold), the emotion surrounding Woods's second-act breakthrough was more visceral, more intense, and more contagious than any of it.
“I'm not going to say it was just like old times, no. It was very different," Woods told reporters this week at Bethpage Black, site of the PGA. “I hadn't won in a long time there. I've been in contention numerous times to have gotten it done, but I haven't. And just the way it played out, I mean, it was so different as a whole."
Trying to cover it was different, too. Watching the Masters is different than any other tournament to begin with, what with the ban on cell phones and the lack of technology anywhere on the grounds. Walking the course is like entering a time warp, with the only updates on how the tournament is going arriving via manually-adjusted wooden scoreboards.
When I committed to walking Sunday's back nine with Tiger, I knew it would be tough to see everything (I only knew how great his tee shot on 16 was thanks to the roar that erupted from below where I stood between the 15th and 17th fairways), but I also felt it was the best way to understand his appeal.
I was right, though making my way back toward his eventual winning putt was almost impossible, with crowds thicker and more focused than any I'd ever seen. With no chance of getting near the 18th green, I headed toward the clubhouse, only to find the pathway for Woods's exit from the green already roped off by security, ropes that usually go up just as the golfers walk by. Woods hadn't even yet hit a shot on 18.
With all of that mind, I will be watching the PGA for sure, to see if Woods make another run at a grand slam, one that would top even his own Tiger Slam.
Woods held all four major titles concurrently, winning the final three majors in 2000 and the Masters in 2001, but now he has a shot at doing it all in the same calendar year. He also needs three more majors to tie Nicklaus's mark — why not do it all at once?
■ Can't fault John Beilein one iota for bolting Michigan for the NBA's Cavaliers. Any honest college coach will tell you they dream of working in a league that pays more and doesn't involve recruiting. It's one step away from retirement. But his departure is a definitely loss for the college game, which is desperate for leaders with his integrity . . .
■  . . . because we sure can't rely on the NCAA to provide solid leadership, even if it reportedly is softening somewhat on the notion of allowing athletes to be compensated for their names and likenesses. Though the idea is only in the exploring stage, and in their words is in no way to be viewed as paying players, it's hard to imagine there's no room in the billion-dollar industry for college players to earn money for autographs or appearances.
■ Still crickets from the NFL offices on the status of Tyreek Hill, currently on hold with the Chiefs while authorities investigate abuse involving his child. As usual, Roger Goodell & Co. will be reactive instead of proactive, and just sit and wait while they hope we all forget about their worst issues.
■ While I polish off my latest Steve Berry novel (“The Malta Exchange"), next on my list is “Chumps to Champs, How the Worst teams in Yankees History Led to the '90s Dynasty," by the great New York Times reporter Bill Pennington.
Red Sox fans may wish otherwise, but the revival of the Yankees allowed for the revival of the best hatred in sports as well, and Pennington has some great Sox-Yanks anecdotes, including a favorite on how Don Mattingly had to be talked into bringing Wade Boggs onto the team.
■  Color me intrigued by Bruce Arena's arrival to the Revolution. Does he have any alchemy left in those soccer fingers, or will he just be another chapter of ineptitude for the floundering MLS franchise?
■  On a personal note, tough news out of my alma mater this week when the fully incorporated, student-run newspaper The Daily Targum revealed it had failed in its efforts to continue getting funding from student fees, its referendum vote falling short because not enough of the student body voted.
When I was a history major at Rutgers, it was The Targum that gave me my journalism start, and being independent from the university was the root of the pride we took in our jobs and felt in our work.
To list all of the great Targum alums in the industry would fill this column, but here's hoping support from all of us can help get this right.

The NRA in disarray

Texto completo: It's a long-standing joke among journalists that the go-to political headline in a pinch is: "Democrats in disarray." Somewhere, somehow, it's probably true.
So it's a change of pace that a slew of reports in recent weeks amply justify the headline "NRA in disarray." Accounts about the organization's financial crisis and internal dysfunction confirm what many of us have always suspected: The National Rifle Association is a racket that stokes fear, aggravates our country's divisions and blocks reasoned debate about gun violence to feather the nests of the conservative elite. A self-dealing class exploits the anxieties of Americans far removed from power and turns the Second Amendment into a money machine. No wonder President Trump loves the NRA so much.
The most revelatory detail in the latest of these stories, a helpfully extensive investigation this week by Danny Hakim in the New York Times, concerns the fashion habits of Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's longtime chief executive. Hakim reports that LaPierre billed the organization that claims to speak for the heartland $275,000 "for purchases at the Zegna luxury men's wear boutique in Beverly Hills."
Beverly Hills?
Unlike LaPierre, I'm just an unsophisticated real American because I have never even heard of the Zegna luxury menswear boutique. Must be nice to have your lifestyle financed by the people you spend your time scaring to death. The biggest falsehood: shameful claims that high school students and grieving parents who plead for more effective gun laws pose a dire threat to the way of life of our country's small towns and rural areas.
Yes, it will be delightful in the coming months to watch this pack of hypocritical demagogues gag on their counterfeit anti-elitist rhetoric as their organization faces fiscal and reputational embarrassment. It will also be useful to learn more about why they seemed so eager to seek the favor of Russia and Vladimir Putin, how they funneled income to favored insiders, and why so many conservative politicians and activists have prostrated themselves before this golden calf erected to hallow high-capacity weapons.
That last reference comes straight from a thoughtful Midwestern soul. It was invoked in 2018 by the Rev. Peter Marty, senior pastor of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Davenport, Iowa. "More than a hunting or safety device, the gun has become an object of reverence," he wrote in the Christian Century. "We bow in devotion at its altar." False gods usually serve profane purposes.
As often happens with racketeers, the NRA gang has had a falling-out. That's why we are getting so much new information as one bunch leaks against another. Quite a crew they have over there! And we will be learning more about the organization's sketchy internal workings because New York Attorney General Letitia James is investigating the NRA's tax-exempt status.
People abroad who wish our country well are mystified about why we seem so unable to legislate sanely on guns. Countries that have a lot in common with ours - most recently New Zealand and, in 1996, Australia - responded to gruesome killings by changing their weapons statutes with cross-partisan support.
We are paralyzed by two things. First, the conservative movement and the Republican Party have been the NRA's willing agents. The organization's board has been a who's who of conservative glitterati. The anti- government right knows it can't sell Americans of modest incomes on its opposition to minimum wages, corporate regulation or more progressive taxes. So they channel their arguments through the gun issue and pretend that this is really a culture war between, well, Beverly Hills elitists and the good folks of Middle America. It's a big lie.
Let's start asking the GOP's politicians how they feel about being allied with a crowd that looks more and more like a bunch of swindlers.
And then there is the U.S. Senate, one of the most unrepresentative bodies in any democratic nation. Fact: The two Dakotas (population 1.6 million) have equal representation with New York and California (population 59.1 million). The House easily passed two bills in February strengthening background checks for gun purchasers, but they face a blockade in a GOP-led Senate where rural states have outsize power.
The NRA's implosion should be an occasion for a new conversation between metropolitan and small-town America that is, in any event, much needed. The high-living gun lobbyists do not have rural America's interests at heart. Advocates of gun safety do not disrespect fellow citizens who use guns responsibly. The real insult to them comes from the leaders who buy fancy clothes on their dime.

The danger of Republican voter suppression across the U.S.

Texto completo: Voter suppression had its roots in the South, and was aimed at disenfranchising the black community. In 1890, the Mississippi Plan instigated poll taxes, literacy tests, understanding clauses, complicated voting registration laws, and "good character" clauses, all in order to disqualify black voters.
This roadmap for voter suppression spread like wildfire in the former slave-holding states. It took 75 years for the federal government to rectify this national disgrace in 1965. The Voting Rights Act (VRA) stipulated that southern states, and portions of northern states that had a discriminatory history, could not change voting laws without permission of the federal government.
The VRA had overwhelming support, 328-74 in the House and 79-18 in the Senate. In 2006, the law was extended for another 25 years by a House vote of 390-33, and in the Senate by an amazing 98-0.
Then in 2013, in a landmark decision (Shelby County v. Holder) the conservative Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts eviscerated the VRA by cancelling the section requiring pre-approval by the federal government - on the basis that racial discrimination in our country was no longer a major problem!
The Shelby decision opened the floodgates to voter suppression, not only in the south but throughout Republican-controlled states. But a new premise was required for suppression, namely that voter fraud was so prevalent that state laws were required to stop this epidemic. This miasma from the political marshes spread quickly, despite statistics proving the opposite.
In 2014, Loyola Law School, Los Angeles, showed that in the previous four years there were only 34 incidents of voter fraud out of hundreds of million votes. In a study of the 2000 election in Missouri, there were only four cases of voter fraud out of 2.3 million votes cast. Yet in 2016 the New York Times reported that "nearly half of Americans believe voter fraud happens at least somewhat often, and at least 70 percent think it happens at least occasionally."
Emory University professor Carol Anderson in her new book, "One Person, No Vote," examines the two major tactics used in our current wave of voter suppression: Voter ID laws and Voter roll purging.
By 2017, 33 Republican-controlled states had passed essentially identical voter ID laws that suppressed voting. These laws were supplied to them by a relatively unknown conservative action group, American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). It is well funded by Republican sources, having an income in 2016 of over $10 million. ALEC first came to my attention in 2013 when it distributed to the states pre-packaged, bogus anti-Sharia laws, that are now a part of Trump's Islamophobic campaign.
Anderson highlights the success of voter roll purging: In 2016-17, Virginia purged 41,637; Florida, 182,000; Indiana, 481,235; Georgia, 591,549; and the mother of them all, Ohio, purged two million voters from the voting rolls.
In our home state of Florida in 2000, Secretary of State Katherine Harris (Republican Florida chairperson for the George Bush campaign) purged 20,000 names from the voting rolls, mostly black and Hispanic voters. If they would have been able to vote, no doubt the Bush victory margin of 537 votes would have been wiped away, and Al Gore would have been President. Voter roll purging does change history.
The Interstate Crosscheck program is a data-base purging tool that tracks persons who are registered in more than one state. As one database expert commented: "God forbid if your name is Garcia, of which there are 858,000 in the U.S. and your name is Joseph or Jose. You're probably suspected of voting in 27 states."
There is no denying that the Republican Party has concluded that if it can't sell its platform to most Americans, it will win by fraud, by suppressing potential Democratic voters from voting. This is a diabolical, anti-democratic tactic that starts us on the road to dictatorship. This is not hyperbole. It's not ordained by a Higher Authority that our country will be a democracy until the Meshiach (Messiah) comes. Democracy is always fragile.
As a Democrat, I have my own biases, but since I am not the repository of absolute truth, I have respected the Republican Party and its counter-arguments; especially as part of a vibrant two-party democracy. But I sincerely wonder how anyone can now feel comfortable being in a Republican Party that represses democracy, Trump aside.

Kamala Harris goads William Barr to reveal any improper order by Trump to open investigations

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., put Attorney General William Barr on notice after it was revealed he tasked a U.S. attorney with examining the origins of the federal Russia investigation.
"Over the past few weeks, I've tried repeatedly to get to the bottom of whether the White House has inappropriately ordered or pressured the Justice Department to open investigations. Attorney General Barr: I'm still waiting for an answer," the 2020 candidate tweeted Tuesday evening.
Tweet
Harris, the former attorney general of California, has dogged Barr ever since a viral exchange during a May 1 hearing on special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
Harris asked Barr if Trump or anyone else at the White House suggested to him that he open an investigation into anyone. Barr struggled to answer, saying at one point that he was "trying to grapple with the word 'suggest.'"
iFrame Object
Harris moved on with her line of questioning, telling CNN afterward that Barr was "clearly" not going to cooperate and probably was worried about exposing himself to perjury.
She followed up that exchange with a letter to the Justice Department inspector general, asking that he investigate whether Barr "received or acted upon pressure from the president or the White House to open up investigations into any individuals."
Harris didn't stop there, seizing on President Trump saying on Thursday that former Secretary of State John Kerry violated the Logan Act by speaking with the Iranian government and should be charged with a crime. “What I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me. John Kerry, he speaks to them a lot. John Kerry tells them not to call. That is a violation of the Logan Act. And frankly, he should be prosecuted on that,” Trump said. Kerry quickly denied the accusation.
Harris wrote another letter, this one addressed directly to Barr.
“Today, the President all but confirmed that he has made such a request when he called publicly for the prosecution of a former cabinet secretary and then stated that his ‘people’ disagreed with him,” Harris wrote. “In light of the President’s deeply troubling statements, I request that you supplement your testimony and clarify your answers to my question.”
The letter, which included a transcript of their May 1 exchange, requested that Barr answer a slew of questions by May 23.
Harris' tweet Tuesday evening, which mentioned "investigations," suggested Barr had yet to comply and followed what might be another thread the senator could follow. This week it was revealed that Barr enlisted U.S. Attorney John Durham with reviewing the genesis of the Russia investigation, which Trump often called a "witch hunt" and his allies believe may have been started on politically motivated pretenses.
While not a front-runner, Harris is a top-tier candidate for president. She sits in fourth place, according to RealClearPolitics' latest average of polls, with 7.7% support. Harris trails former Vice President Joe Biden and fellow Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
After the Barr hearing, the New York Times reported Harris sought to reset her campaign with a more adversarial approach towards Trump, and by extension the attorney general.
Their confrontation on May 1 has already provided Harris with a tougher image, exemplified by the Rev. Wendell Anthony, the head of the Detroit NAACP, who introduced her at an event in the Motor City. “Don’t try to cover up because Kamala will sure enough make you choke up,” Anthony said.

Texto completo: When Pete Buttigieg joined Facebook as a Harvard undergrad in 2004, he was the 287th user registered on the site. The social network’s founders were friends of friends, and it felt like an insular message board for Harvard classmates, he remembered in an interview in San Francisco last week.
“I don’t think any of us could have guessed what implications that technology would have in the long run,” Buttigieg said.
Fifteen years and 2.4 billion users later, as Facebook wrestles with cascading scandals over data privacy, misinformation and election meddling on its platform, Buttigieg has become one of several presidential contenders calling for tougher regulation of the company and Silicon Valley’s other biggest tech firms.
The debate over Facebook’s future took on new resonance last week as one of the company’s co-founders, Chris Hughes, published a New York Times op-ed calling for the tech giant to be broken up. Buttigieg said Hughes, his former Harvard classmate, “made a very convincing case” that no company “should have the type of power that… these tech companies have.”
But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he hasn’t endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting “a spectrum” of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies. That’s attracted criticism from some on the left who want the candidates to take a strong stance on issues of corporate power.
Buttigieg’s vaguer position comes as the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has courted support from Silicon Valley, attending a packed schedule of fundraisers around the Valley and San Francisco on Friday.
In the first three months of 2019, Buttigieg received at least $27,250 in donations from employees of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, the fifth-highest total among the Democrats running for president. Hughes also gave him $2,700 (while donating to several other 2020 Democrats as well). Meanwhile, his campaign has spent about $181,000 on Facebook ads, less than a fifth of the amount spent by Sens. Kamala Harris or Warren.
“Here in the Bay Area, we’ve been waiting for a new generation that is going to redefine politics, and I think Pete’s going to do it,” said Adam Hundt, a tech worker who met Buttigieg in college and co-hosted one of his fundraisers. “Tech is all about change, and the way Pete has an open mind and embraces change makes him a natural fit.”
Buttigieg was two years ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the Ivy League school, and was a senior when Zuckerberg, Hughes and their co-founders launched the site from a dorm room. Buttigieg’s account is the 287th on the network (although a few of those before him were created as tests) — if you go to facebook.com/287 while signed into Facebook, the Harvard grad’s original page, which he still updates, will pop up.
At the time, following his friends on Facebook felt like “a curiosity,” and an improvement over services like MySpace, Friendster or AIM, Buttigieg said. In recent years, he’s used his page to share photos from his deployment to Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve and post pictures and videos of life in South Bend. (He has separate pages for his presidential campaign and mayor’s office.)
When Zuckerberg embarked on a cross-country trip to see more of the U.S. in 2017 — attracting rumors about his own presidential ambitions — he stopped by South Bend to meet with Buttigieg, connected by a mutual Harvard friend. The mayor drove the tech mogul on a tour of the city, as Zuckerberg streamed live video from his cell phone on the dashboard of Buttigieg’s car.
Zuckerberg and Buttigieg stayed in touch, and they last spoke earlier this year, his campaign said.
As Buttigieg explained to Zuckerberg on the tour, he’s also worked to attract tech investment to his Rust Belt hometown, helping open a data center on the site of an abandoned Studebaker plant and transforming other old factories into glassy work spaces for startups.
“What they’ve done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable,” marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart home company Nest and an investor who’s been to the city multiple times at the mayor’s invitation. “You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you’re in San Francisco.”
Rogers, who’s hosted fundraisers for Buttigieg, said he found the candidate to be “literate, fluent and deeply knowledgeable” about tech issues.
Buttigieg has suggested that that tech know-how is missing in D.C. He criticized the congressional hearings featuring Zuckerberg and other tech executives last year, which he called “political theater where very little actually got achieved.”
“What we saw was a spectacle of people in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing — which is incredibly dangerous,” Buttigieg said, arguing that political leaders “need some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly.”
“This is not necessarily an age thing, although I think it helps to have grown up with these technologies at your fingertips,” he added.
Meanwhile, Buttigieg has toed the line between criticizing tech companies and voicing a more sympathetic perspective.
He said Friday that “a lot of people here in the tech sector still have a David mentality when they’ve increasingly turned into Goliath.” But he added that he believes tech companies are making policy decisions “perhaps, not necessarily with bad intentions,” and said he was struck by how many of Silicon Valley’s executives have “become very introspective” and are “really reflecting on what they wrought.”
That more diplomatic approach — and Buttigieg’s avoidance so far of calling for breaking up companies like Facebook — “has been a personal sigh of relief for a lot of people in the tech industry,” said Jacob Helberg, a tech policy advisor who’s hosted fundraisers for the candidate.
While most of the other top Democrats are also playing coy on the issue, Buttigieg’s refusal to be pinned down has frustrated tech critics who see it as a defining debate in the party.
“He is going for Silicon Valley money and he wants to express some nod to the problems but he doesn’t want to offend anyone powerful,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and an advocate of splitting up the tech giants. “Take a position.”
------------
WHAT OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SAY ABOUT BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES
Support it:
Sen. Elizabeth Warren: “Today’s big tech companies have too much power — too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else… That’s why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition — including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.”
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: “Absolute power corrupts absolutely. I agree with Senator Warren on the need to break up big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon. Will be introducing similar legislation in U.S. House.”
On the fence:
Former Vice President Joe Biden: Breaking up Facebook is “something we should take a really hard look at,” he told the Associated Press, saying Warren “has a very strong case to be made.”
Sen. Kamala Harris: “We have to seriously take a look at that… [Facebook] is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. And as far as I’m concerned, that’s got to stop.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders: “We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives — including our government. It’s time to take that power back.”
Voiced concerns about it:
Sen. Cory Booker: “I don’t think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here. It’s not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, ‘I’m going to break up you guys.’”
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke: “I’m not sure if having five more Facebooks — if you broke up Facebook into five component parts, or any of these other large social media or technology companies — makes as much sense as regulating them.”

Texto completo: El vicegobernador de Louisiana, Billy Nungesser , sorprendió el martes al presidente Donald Trump al vestir unos calcetines con el rostro y peinado del mandatario.
Nungesser dio la bienvenida al presidente Trump al Aeropuerto Internacional de Chennault en Lake Charles, Louisiana.
El fotógrafo del New York Times, Doug Mills, tomó una imagen foto de Nungesser levantando su pantalón para revelar los calcetines, que tienen tela extra para imitar el mechón de cabello de Trump, los cuales señaló el presidente.
En redes sociales la imagen desató miles de comentarios y seguidores de Trump incluso buscan comprarlos, pero también hubo muchas bromas.
“En caso de que alguien no lo sepa, esta persona que le muestra al presidente Trump que no solo tiene calcetines Trump, sino que también tiene el pelo de imitación de Trump, es el vicegobernador de Louisiana”, escribió David Freedlander.

Name the counties hacked by Russians

Texto completo: A Times editorial

So now it turns out the FBI says Russians hacked into election systems in 2016 in two Florida counties. And Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday he has been told the names of the two counties. But he cant tell Floridians because its some sort of national secret. Thats ridiculous, and its this kind of failure to be candid with voters that undermines public confidence in government and in the integrity of elections.

DeSantis revealed at a news conference that he met with officials from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security last week in Tallahassee to discuss the hacking. He said he was told the names of two counties where the local supervisor of elections office had experienced intrusion into the voter database before the 2016 election. But he said they asked him to sign a nondisclosure agreement and not release the names of the counties to the public. Thats unacceptable and an insult to Floridians. The governor should ask whoever they are to release the information or let him release it.

Remember, it was DeSantis who reacted so strongly following the release of Special Counsel Robert Muellers report that indicated the FBI believed Russians hacked into at least one Florida countys election system. The revelation was reinforced by Sen. Marco Rubios confirmation that Russian hackers were in a position to change voter roll information. The governor promised to get answers, and he apparently did. Yet Floridians remain in the dark.

DeSantis news conference also raised other questions that need answers. For example, he said he was told by federal officials that an elections security task force that included state officials was told in 2016 that county elections systems were hacked by Russians. Yet he doesnt believe then-Gov. Rick Scott or the head of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement knew it. But curiously, DeSantis has not talked about the issue with Scott, who defeated incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in November after criticizing Nelson for asserting during the campaign that hackers had breached a voter registration system. Somebody is engaging in revisionist history, and DeSantis ought to find out who and why. Hint: It was never Nelson, who has been vindicated several times over by the Mueller report, Rubios recent comments and now the secret meeting between the feds and the new governor.

Second, DeSantis said Tuesday the Russian hacking is something the counties knew about and the FBI was working with them before the election. Thats odd. Many county supervisors of elections have consistently said they do not know whose voter data base was hacked by Russians. Rubio recently told the New York Times that the local elections officials who were the target or targets were never told and only a general warning was issued. Which is it?

DeSantis and Rubio say there was no manipulation of any voter information by the hackers. They say election results were not compromised. Trust us, they are suggesting to Floridians. Everything is fine. Nothing to see here.

Blind trust is what contributed to the vulnerability of the elections system in the first place. Reality set in only as the bigger picture of Russian interference in the 2016 election became clearer, reinforced by the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers, 13 Russians and three Russian companies. Add that to the vote counting issues in 2016 in South Florida and the scars from the 2000 presidential election recount. Its understandable why so many voters in this state are skeptical about the fairness of elections and reluctant to take public officials at their word.

Just remember how exasperated the governor was when he did not know where Russians hacked into Florida voting data bases.

They wont tell us which county it was, DeSantis responded earlier this month. Are you kidding me?

Now the governor knows the names of the counties and thinks they should be publicly revealed, but he just cant because he signed a nondisclosure agreement with the federal government.

Are you kidding us?

Texto completo: TALLAHASSEE -- Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that he met with FBI officials who confirmed that Russian hackers gained access to voter data in two Florida counties during the 2016 election, but that election results were not compromised.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in 2016 said that "spearfishing" emails were sent to more than 120 e-mail accounts used by Florida county elections officials and employees of a technology vendor in advance of the Nov. 8 election.

"There was no manipulation or anything, but there was voter data that was able to be got," DeSantis said. "But I think that voter data was public anyway. Nevertheless, those were intrusions."

He added: "It did not affect any voting or anything like that."

DeSantis said he signed an agreement with the FBI not to identify the counties, but added that elections officials in those counties were made aware of the intrusions before Election Day that year.

The spearfishing emails,

when opened, allowed hackers to gain access to the online elections network. An election equipment manufacturer, VR Systems of Tallahassee, has been named in other reports as the vendor hacked.

The Mueller report says that malware also was planted in the manufacturer's systems. VR has since hired private and federal analysts to assess its security efforts, the New York Times reported last month.

The governor said he recently met in Tallahassee with FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials from Washington, who were joined by representatives of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and Secretary of State Laurel Lee, the state's top elections official.

At the time the Mueller report came out, the FBI declined to give DeSantis further detail on the finding that "at least one" Florida county had been targeted.

"It's important that if there is a threat, it's important that we know at the state level," he said.

While DeSantis said that officials in the targeted counties were informed before the election, agencies under his predecessor, Gov. Rick Scott, apparently were not told of the intrusion and "they did not know this was going on."

Scott during last year's campaign against U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson accused his Democratic rival of being irresponsible when he said the Russian hackers had penetrated county elections systems in Florida two years earlier.

Nelson said his comments were based on his exchange with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Scott, who narrowly defeated Nelson last November, said last August, "Either Bill Nelson knows of crucial information the federal government is withholding from Florida election officials, or he is simply making things up."

White House in talks over confronting Iran

Texto completo: The Trump administration is discussing a range of options for using military force against Iran, officials said Tuesday, as lawmakers from both parties complained that the White House has not fully briefed them on the escalating tensions.
Top advisers to President Trump met at the White House late last week to consider possible steps, including military action, as officials spoke of "credible threats" by Iran or Iranian proxy forces to U.S. personnel. The Pentagon already has moved an aircraft carrier, strategic bombers and other military assets to reinforce U.S. forces across the Middle East.
Officials said the options include increasing the number of troops in the region, currently between 60,000 and 80,000, to more than 100,000, in the most dramatic scenario were Iran to attack U.S. interests or make clear moves to develop a nuclear weapon.
The New York Times on Monday reported that acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan, in response to a request for updated options from national security adviser John Bolton, put forward several proposals, including one to deploy 120,000 troops.
Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump characterized the article as inaccurate but said he would be prepared to authorize an even more muscular approach if needed.
"Hopefully we're not going to have to plan for that," he said. "And if we did that, we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that."
Trump's views on the proposals were not immediately clear. In general, he has sided with ending U.S. military involvement in wars overseas, although he has identified Iran as a chief adversary and sought to demonstrate a tough stance on nations challenging the United States. He is surrounded by officials with hard-line views on Iran led by Bolton, who has advocated for regime change in Iran.
Iranian and American leaders say they do not want a war but warn that they are prepared to use military might if provoked. Speaking during a visit to Sochi, Russia, on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had made clear "that if American interests are attacked, we will most certainly respond in an appropriate fashion."
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a series of messages on Twitter, warned that the United States would be forced to withdraw from a confrontation with Iran. "We don't seek a war nor do they," he said. "They know a war wouldn't be beneficial for them."
Nevertheless, the increasing tension has fueled concern that the two countries might accidentally slide into conflict. The comments from Khamenei and Pompeo came several days after ships belonging to U.S. allies were attacked near the Persian Gulf, an act for which U.S. officials suggested Iran may be responsible. The incident followed a series of U.S. steps designed to isolate Iran, including the designation of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization and a raft of new sanctions after the White House decision to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal.
Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the Rand Corp., said those steps fueled suspicions between the United States and its allies on one hand and Iran on the other, raising the risk of a small incident snowballing into a larger confrontation.
"It's fairly common to have Iranian patrol boats harass U.S. carriers and other ships in the strait," she said, referring to the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway off Iran that is key to global commerce. "You can imagine, with some of the heightened tensions, that there could be a greater risk of that exploding into something larger."
"In different times, an accident or a mistake could be resolved because of open lines of communication between Iran and the United States," she added. "Now it could lead to the United States and Iran accidentally stumbling into some form of escalation."
Typically a range of options is presented by military officials when requested by civilian leaders. Sometimes, policymakers select one course of action. Other times, they decide to do nothing.
U.S. Central Command maintains a host of contingency plans that are updated periodically, especially when policy or threat information changes.
Military officials, who have privately voiced a strong desire to avoid conflict with Iran, have nevertheless described the recent intelligence as sobering and say they believe that Iran is actively planning attacks on U.S. forces.
Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said the alert level for forces in Iraq and Syria had been increased in response to the recent intelligence, pushing back against a statement by a British general serving in Baghdad as part of the U.S.-led coalition that there was no amplified threat from Iranian-backed forces there. That operation "is now at a high level of alert as we continue to closely monitor credible and possibly imminent threats to U.S. forces in Iraq," Urban said.
More than 5,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq, and less than half that are in neighboring Syria. The U.S. military has troops at a constellation of small and large bases across the region as well as ships that regularly circulate nearby.
Pentagon and congressional officials said the elements that contributed to the worrisome intelligence picture included Iranian military and other threats against diplomatic facilities in Baghdad and Irbil, Iraq. Officials also said they believed that Iran may be preparing to mount rocket or missile launchers on small ships.
Military officials say they do not know why Iran appears to be embracing a more hostile stance but say it is probably a result of mounting economic and diplomatic pressures.
Since the United States withdrew from the nuclear agreement a year ago, it has penalized almost 1,000 Iranian individuals and entities. U.S. sanctions on financial transactions and oil exports, in particular, have had a devastating effect on the economy.
International nuclear monitors have said that Iran has continued to meet its commitments under the 2015 agreement but that it has threatened to resume the stockpiling of enriched uranium unless the European Union finds a way to facilitate sanctions relief. The Europeans, while striving to keep the nuclear accord alive, are stuck between the hard-line positions staked out by Washington and Tehran.
The uptick in tensions has also rattled the State Department's top officials in charge of diplomatic security, who on Tuesday postponed a major forum of regional security officers from most embassies and consulates worldwide. The event, which was scheduled to include Pompeo; Rep. Michael McCaul (Tex.), the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), was postponed because of "increasing tensions with Iran" and the need for senior personnel to "remain in the field to assess and respond to potential threats," according to a State Department memo obtained by The Washington Post.
The event is scheduled every three to four years and involves 300-plus people, said a State Department official who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal logistics. "It's no small potatoes that Diplomatic Security chose to cancel this," the official said.
The situation has set off alarm bells on Capitol Hill, where Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is attempting to bring in senior administration officials to brief senators next week on Iran and other issues in the region, according to three congressional officials apprised of the discussions.
The effort comes as many lawmakers are voicing their frustration with the Trump administration for not keeping Congress more fully aware of its plans concerning Iran.
"I think all of us are in the dark over here," Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Tuesday.
Democrats on that committee in particular have accused their Republican counterparts of dragging out efforts to demand more information from the White House.
"It is hard to justify the administration's actions thus far since they insist on stonewalling Congress from receiving any specifics about what these increased threats actually are and our strategy to confront them," Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement Tuesday.

James Clapper: Premature for Barr to task US attorney with reviewing Russia investigation origins

Texto completo: Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Monday the U.S. is "losing sight" of the threat posed by the Russians.
Attorney General William Barr's decision to task a U.S. attorney with examining the origins of the federal Russia investigation is one Clapper said he would not have made, at least not yet.
"First of all, there's already an investigation well under way, in fact nearing completion which is by the department of justice inspector general," Clapper said on CNN, where is a contributor. "I don't quite get the involvement of these state attorneys general, and I hadn't heard that before."
He was reacting to news that Barr assigned U.S. Attorney John Durham from Connecticut with reviewing the genesis of the Russia investigation, which a source told Fox News started "weeks" ago. Durham's effort is the third known federal investigation dedicated to unearthing information about the genesis of the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, which was later wrapped into special counsel Robert Mueller's effort. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating alleged FISA abuse and is expected to wrap up in late May or June. U.S. Attorney John Huber is also conducting an investigation into allegations of misconduct atop the Justice Department and the FBI.
Clapper said all this is a distraction from what he views is the main takeaway from Mueller's investigation.
"So I — you know, if I were king, I would prefer to wait until the outcome of the Department of Justice investigation about the origins of the investigation," he said, adding that "we're kind of losing sight here of" Russian interference.
"The big deal in my mind is the threat posed by the Russians," he added. "We don't discuss volume one of the Mueller report very much, which to me is the issue at hand for the country, the threat posed by the Russians and we've gotten all consumed with collusion or not, obstruction or not, when to me the big deal here is the threat posed by the Russians."

This comes on the heels of reporting from the New York Times that former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was warned not to bring up in front of Trump preparations to fight against Russian interference targeting the 2020 election.
Still, the Trump administration has signaled it is taking election security seriously. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in Russia on Tuesday, where he met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Sochi. Pompeo said in a news conference that he told Lavrov that he made it clear the U.S. would not "tolerate" 2020 election interference.

Senado de Alabama aprueba el proyecto de ley de aborto más restrictivo de Estados Unidos

Texto completo: El Senado de Alabama aprobó el martes una medida que prohibiría casi todos los abortos en el estado, estableciendo un desafío directo a Roe v. Wade, el caso que reconoció el derecho constitucional de una mujer de interrumpir un embarazo, reporta The New York Times.
La legislación prohíbe los abortos en todas las etapas del embarazo y criminaliza el procedimiento para los médicos , que podrían ser acusados de delitos graves y enfrentar hasta 99 años de prisión. Incluye una excepción para los casos en que la vida de la madre corre un grave riesgo , pero no para los casos de violación o incesto, un tema de feroz debate entre los legisladores en los últimos días
Ahora se traslada al escritorio del gobernador Kay Ivey , un republicano. Aunque el gobernador no se ha comprometido públicamente a firmar la legislación, muchos legisladores republicanos esperan su apoyo.
Hasta ahora, no había posibilidad de revertir a Roe “, dijo a NYT Eric Johnston , quien fundó la Coalición Pro-Vida de Alabama y se desempeña como su presidente, y ha pasado más de 30 años tratando de prohibir el aborto.
Johnston, quien redactó el proyecto de ley de Alabama y se considera un purista en el tema del aborto, dijo que no apoyaba la serie de leyes restrictivas que otros estados han promulgado en los últimos meses, incluidas las llamadas cuentas de latidos fetales. Estos proyectos de ley esencialmente prohíben los abortos a partir de las seis semanas posteriores a la concepción, un momento en el que muchas mujeres aún no saben que están embarazadas.
Los demócratas y los defensores de los derechos de aborto dicen que la medida de Alabama conduciría el procedimiento a la clandestinidad, poniendo en peligro las vidas de mujeres y niñas y afectando de manera desproporcionada a los residentes pobres y de minorías de Alabama.

In the introduction, Stern, 65, explains that lifelong OCD and the pressures of other gigs - the Sirius radio program, his former role as host of "America's Got Talent" - had ruled out another book. Then, in the spring of 2017, he writes, "Simon & Schuster handed me a finished copy. Tricky bastards."
The publisher's idea was this: dozens of interviews from "The Howard Stern Show" over the years, each with a Stern-written preamble. Stern didn't like the interviews S & S had selected, so he chose his own - 39 of them, most from Sirius, which he joined in 2006, and a handful from the old terrestrial radio days. Some interviews with Donald Trump - there were dozens over the decades - are included as part of a recurring segment called "And Now a Word from Our President." Other interview subjects include Madonna (2015), Harvey Weinstein (2014), Joan Rivers (2014), Jay-Z (2010), Billy Joel (2014) and David Letterman (2017).
One revelation will surprise longtime fans: Stern writes that he had a cancer scare in 2017, although subsequent surgery revealed that he had a benign cyst on one of his kidneys.
I spoke recently with Stern about the book, that colorful past and the immediate future. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
Nothing in your life is particularly secret, so why keep the health scare from fans until now?
There's this whole internet culture [where you say], "Hey, my nose is running," and the next thing they're doing is telling you stories about a friend's nose which was also running and how he ended up dead two weeks later. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and worrier, so the real reason is that I didn't want to hear from anybody who had a similar operation. I [thought] I had cancer. It was 95 percent [certain]. I was in shock.
One of the more interesting reveals is the interview that never happened - Hillary Clinton - and how aggressively you pursued her.
I never pursued a guest [until her]. I really felt I could have made a difference with Hillary. As I explain in the book, I think there's a simple lesson in life - not to tighten up to the point where you close yourself off. She needed to appeal to a segment of my audience, a male part of my audience, that just [expletive] couldn't stand her. I don't know what it was, but as was pointed out [in a New York Times profile], I am able to present people in such a way on the radio where you strip away whatever it was that bugged people about them and get to hear the [real] person.
You argue that she made a mistake by not coming on.
Well, look at how the election turned out. It came down to a few thousand votes in a few key states. I could have made a difference. I'm not implying I could have changed the election, but I could have made a dent. It may have had an impact.
You certainly helped "humanize" Trump over the decades.
That is my goal - to humanize people. He wasn't running for president, remember, at the time, he was a New York businessman. And he was one of those guests who came on and knew how to play. A lot of the media now are trying to use those [old] interviews politically, like when he agreed that maybe his Vietnam - his personal Vietnam - was STDs. But it was a joke, and he wasn't saying it in a serious way.
You express regrets about the old Howard, but are you ashamed of him?
Ashamed? No, absolutely not. I think I'm a better performer now and like the way I sound now more than then. But no - that radio show was groundbreaking and was right for the times.
You get wistful in the interviews with Jon Stewart and David Letterman, both in semiretirement when you talked to them. Ever think about when you'll hang it up, too?
I honestly don't know. I got two more years on the contract. I'll certainly honor that. But it is getting harder and harder to do [the show]. Sometimes I think - I don't know - part of myself says to keep doing this, and there's a part that says to walk away. I've been hustling my whole life, but to sit back and relax? I don't have a definitive answ

Losing income tax privacy is a real danger: Ron Paul

Texto completo: Last week the New York Times published some of President Trump’s 1980s and 1990s tax return information.
The information detailed President Trump’s financial difficulties during that time. While you would not know it from reading some media reports, this is old news. In fact, President Trump openly discussed his financial difficulties on his popular reality television show.
What should be of great concern is the possibility that the person who leaked the returns — who the paper says has legal access to President Trump’s tax records — is an IRS employee seeking to undermine the president. This would hardly be the first time an IRS employee has leaked confidential information because he disagreed with the taxpayer’s politics. In 2014 the agency had to pay the National Organization for Marriage $50,000 dollars after an IRS employee gave names of the group’s donors to the group’s opponents.
In 2014-2017, my Campaign for Liberty group was repeatedly threatened by the IRS because it refused to give the agency the names of and other information about its top supporters. Fortunately, the IRS rescinded the regulation forcing groups like Campaign for Liberty to violate supporters’ privacy or face legal penalties. However, campaign finance reform legislation that recently passed in the House of Representatives would require the IRS to resume collecting this information, and the New York attorney general is suing the IRS to force the agency to reinstate the regulation.
The right of groups like Campaign for Liberty to protect their supporters’ privacy was upheld by the Supreme Court in NAACP v. Alabama. As Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, “Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.”
Traditionally, presidents have used the IRS to harass their political opponents instead of presidents’ opponents using the IRS against them. Franklin Roosevelt audited people critical of the New Deal and supportive of the America First movement. Lyndon Johnson ordered audits of opponents, and John Kennedy shared tax return information with Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.
During the Obama administration, the IRS targeted groups opposing Obamacare. The agency went after anti-Iraq War groups during the George W. Bush years.
If the Times did obtain Trump’s tax returns information from an IRS employee, that employee is not in the same category as whistleblowers like Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning who exposed government wrongdoing. The leaker or leakers of President Trump’s information are releasing private tax information.
The IRS regularly violates the civil liberties of taxpayers. In fact, the income tax system forcing taxpayers to reveal potentially incriminating information on their tax returns violates the principles of a free society. Americans’ liberty and prosperity will never be secure until Congress repeals two great mistakes of 1913: the income tax and the Federal Reserve.
Dr. Ron Paul is a former member of the House of Representatives. This article was written for and published by the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha hecho, en varias ocasiones, un nexo entre la inmigración y la delincuencia, pero hay varias investigaciones que han demostrado que no existe una conexión real entre un fenómeno y otro en los Estados Unidos.
Incluso, no hay datos que permitan concluir que la inmigración de indocumentados esté relacionado con el incremento de delitos, como lo demuestra un análisis en conjunto entre The Marshall Project y The Upshot, de The New York Times.
El reporte reconoce que es complicado obtener datos sobre los indocumentados, quienes han sido objeto de pocos estudios, incluidos los relacionados con el crimen, pero señala que el Pew Research Center publicó estimaciones de poblaciones indocumentadas clasificadas por área metropolitana, que el Proyecto Marshall ha comparado con las tasas de delincuencia locales publicadas por FBI por primera vez.
Esto dio la oportunidad de un análisis más amplio de cómo la inmigración de indocumentados podría haber afectado los índices de delincuencia desde 2007.
“La mayoría de los tipos de delitos tenían una línea de tendencia casi plana, lo que indica que los cambios en las poblaciones de indocumentados tuvieron poco o ningún efecto sobre el delito en las diversas áreas metropolitanas que se examinaron”, indican las conclusiones publicadas por el Times. “El asesinato fue el único tipo de crimen que pareció mostrar un aumento, pero la diferencia fue pequeña e incierta (efectivamente cero)”.
Indica que una mayoría de las áreas registraron disminuciones tanto en delitos violentos como en aquellos que afectan contra la propiedad entre 2007 y 2016.
Nuevamente, esa disminución no tiene relación alguna sobre el aumento o decremento de la población de inmigrantes indocumentados.
El reporte señala que los indocumentados se arriesgan poco a ser detenidos, ya que “ser arrestados por cualquier motivo significaría enfrentar una eventual deportación y, para algunos, regresar a cualquier peligro o privación que hayan tratado de escapar en su país”.
Es incierto el número de indocumentados que hay en el país, por lo que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ( DHS ) y otras instituciones utilizan el método residual, es decir, del último estimado realizan uno nuevo. Actualmente es de 10.7 millones de indocumentados.

Texto completo: LONDON -- A Mexican wrestler and actor who appeared in the movie "Nacho Libre" died in the ring during a bout in London on Saturday, according to the venue where the event was held.
The wrestler, César González Barrón, known as Silver King, was facing off against an opponent known as Juventud Guerrera, or Youth Warrior, when he became unresponsive at the Roundhouse, a performing arts and concert venue in Camden.
In footage shared online, Mr. Guerrera appeared to kick Mr. González Barrón during the match and tried to pin him down for the victory. The footage also showed the referee and others trying in vain to revive Mr. González Barrón.
According to the Mexican news outlet Record and other reports, Mr. González Barrón appeared to have died of a heart attack, but officials have not yet released an official cause of death.
Medics from the London Ambulance Service arrived five minutes after being called at 10:21 p.m., according to news reports, but Mr. González Barrón was pronounced dead at the scene. The Metropolitan Police said on Sunday that it was not involved in investigating the death.
Roundhouse confirmed the death in a post on Twitter, saying: "At this stage the details are still being investigated so we don't have more information we can share. Our thoughts and condolences are with his family, friends and all of the Lucha Libre team."
Mr. González Barrón, 51, appeared as the bad guy, Ramses, in the 2006 movie "Nacho Libre," a comedy in which the actor Jack Black plays a priest in training who becomes a wrestler.
Mr. González Barrón was a star in Mexican wrestling, known as lucha libre, in which combatants wear elaborate masks and take on outlandish personas.
At the event in London, called the Greatest Show of Lucha Libre, Mr. González Barrón had reprised his role as the evil Ramses.
He was the son of a famous wrestler known as Dr. Wagner, and he had been wrestling professionally since 1985, according to his profile on the film website IMDB. During his career, he was a CMLL World Heavyweight champion, an AAA World Tag Team champion and had won many other championships.
One spectator at the fight, Roberto Carrera Maldonado, told the BBC that, initially, it appeared as if Mr. González Barrón's collapse was part of the show.
"It felt like it was staged," he said. But when it became apparent the wrestler was imperiled, he said, "all of us were really shocked; it wasn't clear what was happening."
As news of Mr. González Barrón's death spread, tributes poured in from around the word, including from the WWE, which said it was "saddened to learn that Lucha Libre legend and former WCW star Silver King has passed away."
In an Instagram post, Mr. Black, the star of "Nacho Libre," which spoofed the lucha libre culture, shared a photograph of Mr. González Barrón on the set and wrote, "Vaya con dios, hermano," or "Go with God, brother."
Mr. González Barrón, who grew up in Mexico City, according to the BBC, was a star of lucha libre, in which wrestlers body slam and flip one another in epic, choreographed battles for screaming fans in arenas around the world.
According to a New York Times article in 2006, the year "Nacho Libre" was released, the sport is "considered kitsch by some, a unique cultural phenomenon by others." An American promoter introduced the concept south of the border in the 1930s.
"Because masks played a ceremonial role in pre-Columbian Indian cultures, the disguises went over especially well," the article said. "Today their wearers embody a combination of average Joe and working-class avenger."

Texto completo: Last week when former CIA agent Valerie Plame announced she was running for the Northern New Mexico U.S. House seat currently held by Rep. Ben Ray Luján, a former colleague of mine posted an interesting observation on Facebook.
"Be interesting to see her in the same room with Liz Cheney if she wins," he said.
Indeed, that would be interesting.
For those who don't follow Congress that closely, Liz Cheney is a Republican congresswoman who happens to be the daughter of the gruff but (un)lovable former Vice President Dick Cheney.
Plame and Daddy Dick have a history ... which is why we know Valerie Plame in the first place.
In February 2002, the CIA sent Plame's then-husband Joe Wilson -- a former U.S. ambassador to Gabon and São Tomé and Príncipe -- to another African nation, Niger, to investigate a claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had tried to buy enriched "yellow cake" uranium. He concluded the story was false. The next year, he wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times accusing the Bush administration of exaggerating the threat of Iraq to justify going to war.
Soon after, White House officials informed some journalists, including the late right-wing nationally syndicated columnist Robert Novak, that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA and this somehow constituted some sort of conflict of interest. Novack used that information as a basis for a column that basically outed Plame as a CIA agent.
Bush State Department official Richard Armitage eventually admitted that he was the one who told Novak. But the only one convicted of any crime in this case was I. Scooter Libby, Dick Cheney's chief of staff, who was found guilty of four counts, including obstruction of justice and lying to federal investigators. He was sentenced in 2007 to 30 months in prison.
Before he left office, Bush commuted Libby's sentence (though he kept in place the $250,000 fine imposed by the court).
Last year, President Donald Trump granted Libby a full pardon for his crimes.
When I interviewed Plame on the day of her announcement, I told her of my friend's Facebook comment. She laughed, then said of Liz Cheney, "Let's just say I'm not a fan."
Then she pointed out that there's serious scuttlebutt that the Wyoming congresswoman is considering running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Mike Enzi, who recently announced he won't be seeking re-election.
"If that's the case, then I probably wouldn't be running into [Cheney] all that much," Plame said.
Plame certainly isn't bashful about reminding people about the controversy that turned her into a (reluctant) public figure.
Her candidacy announcement started off with a quote from her saying, "My career in the CIA was cut short by partisan politics, but I'm not done serving our country. We need more people in Congress with the courage to stand up for what's right. ..." And the announcement went on to acknowledge that she's "best known as the covert CIA operations officer who was illegally outed by the Bush administration in 2003. ..."
Later in the news release, Plame noted that she and her family moved to Santa Fe the day after Libby was convicted.
"My work with the CIA often took me to Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs, and when my career in national security intelligence was ended prematurely, through no fault of my own, there was only one place my heart wanted to be -- Santa Fe," she said in the news release.
Sure, Plame also talked about the "high cost of health care and prescription medicine" in her announcement. And I have little doubt that Dem cliches about "the working families" and "the children" will creep into her rhetoric as the race wears on. But emphasizing her role in a major Bush-era controversy is only likely to help her in a Democratic primary.
And remember, the Democratic Party in the 3rd Congressional District is where the race is really decided.
There's been grumbling among some Democrats that Plame "isn't from here" and, more specifically, that she's not Hispanic. We haven't heard the word "carpetbagger" yet, but we will. That also was a complaint about Bill Richardson in the early '80s before he went on to win a congressional seat that he held for umpteen terms.
So far, there is no competition for Plame as far as name recognition goes. At this early stage of the game, I'd have to call her the front-runner.
Still, I hope Liz Cheney doesn't run for that Senate seat.

Texto completo: Palms rolling out thick rounds of dough. Fingers flared out in a joyful embrace of the world, poised to come down on the buttons of a shining trumpet. Hands delicately placing a fresh, not-yet-dried chocolate truffle onto a massive baking sheet.
These are the types of images featured in a photo exhibit by Lynn Osborn at the Brookline Public Library. Over the course of six months, Osborn photographed 27 small businesses throughout town. She titled the final set of images “Works of Hand," as each of the locations specializes in handmade items or skills involving hands.
An advocate for the “old town neighborhood life," Osborn mourns the replacement of local shops with larger chains. With this project, she hopes to remind people of the hard work and skill involved in the creation of handcrafted goods. In addition, she strives to preserve history by capturing images of locales that may not remain in the community forever.
“I hope [viewers] say 'Oh wow, look! I didn't know all these people were in our town,' " Osborn said. “I hope they discover a shop to patronize, and I hope they realize how great it is in our neighborhood to have these places."
The exhibit can be found in the Gallery in Hunneman Hall and will remain there through June 12.
Osborn is not a photographer by profession, although she has dabbled at it since she was a young adult. She works in architecture and owns her own firm, Osborn Studio +. Osborn had previously created architecture exhibits at the library with other female architects and was friendly with the woman who organized the exhibits. When asked if she wanted to plan her own photo exhibit, Osborn agreed and got to work.
Her inspiration for the theme of the photo essay partially stemmed from a longtime interest in traditional handworks. She has served for about 10 years on the Board of the North Bennet Street School, a private vocational school in Boston. She also recalls being influenced by a photo piece published in 2012 in the New York Times Magazine that centered on the Steinway piano facory.
“They were just beautiful pictures that captured a little slice of history," Osborn said. “It was almost a reverence to the craft and a reverence to the place captured. It was wonderful."
She began by wandering from storefront to storefront in Brookline, asking if anyone was interested in participating. Toting along examples of her work, she left notes when business owners were too busy at that moment.
Self-described as a bit shy, Osborn had to force herself to approach potential subjects. Most, however, were quite willing to work with her. Just before pulling out her camera, she'd survey the space and break the ice with curious questions about the day-to-day of each business. Finally, she would start clicking away.
“It's a balance of a serious picture that shows respect and some engagement with them and a little bit of soul," Osborn said. “I think that's what makes a good portrait. And then something about their space too."
The photos in the exhibit are accompanied by blurbs detailing the history of each business, the lives of the owners, and a quirky fact. Jazz Shoe Repair, owned by Moscow native Yuriy Arutyunov, has been in business for over 40 years. Von Huene Workshop specializes in recorders and other historical woodwind instruments, as well as sheet music. New Paris Bakery on Cypress Street is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.
“Quite a few people have an immigrant background, which is always interesting to learn about," Osborn said. “There's so many interesting things — the people, the history, the products they make."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The witness rose from her seat, raised her right hand and swore to tell the truth before Congress.
But four words were missing: "So help me God."
In the House of Representatives, to the winner go the spoils, and Democrats, the new decision makers, control everything, including what legislation gets a vote and the minutiae of procedural choices, such as whether witnesses must utter the traditional plea for divine aid. Democratic chairmen and chairwomen of several key committees have deemed no such entreaty is necessary.
"I think God belongs in religious institutions: in temple, in church, in cathedral, in mosque -- but not in Congress," said Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. What Republicans are doing, he continued, "is using God."
"And God doesn't want to be used," he said.
No surprise, Republican lawmakers are staging a form of protest, jumping in when they can to point out each omission in real time.
"I am a sinner, I make mistakes every single day, but I do think that we could use a little more of God, not less," Representative Garret Graves of Louisiana earnestly told his colleagues seated around the dais of the House Natural Resources Committee.
But weak is the hand without the gavel, and the change of phrasing is only one decision of many that the majority gets to make on Capitol Hill, where tradition reigns until it does not and every choice is freighted with subtext.
In 2003, Republicans famously rebranded the French fries and French toast offered in House cafeterias "freedom fries" and "freedom toast" to express dissatisfaction with Gallic opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. When Democrats wrested control of the chamber three years later, they introduced compostable silverware and cups -- a decision Republicans swiftly reversed when they came to power in 2011, arguing that the utensils were too flimsy to properly spear salad fixings.
The Democrats in power now have yet to touch the culinary nomenclature of the House cafeterias. (There appears to be no Russian dressing available for them to snub.)
But they have introduced a number of other changes, each carrying its own symbolism: Free feminine hygiene products are now made available to offices. Several committee leaders have excised the gendered titles of "chairman" or "chairwoman" for the neutral mononym "chair" -- though The New York Times's style remains gender-specific.
And in a bid to become more eco-friendly, the Committee on Natural Resources swapped out single-use plastic water bottles for glassware at hearings. (One defiant Republican on the panel continues to bring in his own plastic bottle because he considers using glassware to be unsanitary.)
The single change that has prompted the most ire, however, is what Republicans contend is a concerted effort to omit the phrase "so help me God" when administering witness oaths. They point to examples on the Judiciary, Energy and Commerce, and Natural Resources committees; each person presiding over the panels has the power to decide to administer an oath as well as what that oath says.
[Video: Representative Mike Johnson calls out the Judiciary Committee's chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, for leaving out "so help me God" in an oath. Watch on YouTube.]
But like most Washington spats, the truth is more complicated. When Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, who heads the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee, conducted a hearing and swore the witnesses in without the phrase, for example, Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, jumped in to point out that "the oath was incorrect and incomplete."
"This is the oath we use," Ms. DeGette replied, "and that's the oath we're going to use today."
No matter how small the teacup, such congressional tempests do get refracted through a partisan prism. The Center for Inquiry, a nonprofit group dedicated to fostering "a secular society based on reason, science, freedom of inquiry and humanist values," cheered Ms. DeGette's "support for the constitutional separation of church and state." Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, scoffed to Fox News that House Democrats "really have become the party of Karl Marx."
But in truth, Ms. DeGette's comment -- "this is the oath we use" -- carried no underlying meaning. She was not making a defiant secular stand, but merely reading from the same committee decorum rule book that her Republican predecessor, Representative Gregg Harper of Mississippi, had used to administer oaths, videos show.
In this case, Ms. DeGette's omission was unintentional.
But some Democrats have mounted ideological defenses of truncating the oath to avoid references to religion. When Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, interrupted Mr. Cohen to ask that witnesses be sworn in again -- or at least be asked if they would prefer to recite the traditional oath, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, who leads the Judiciary Committee, interjected.
"We do not have religious tests," he said, and moved the hearing along.
Such arguments have troubled Republicans like Mr. Johnson, who has been on the front lines of efforts to make the oath invoke God again. He pulled Mr. Nadler aside on the House floor to discuss the issue and directed his office to produce short video montages illustrating it. He believes in the cause.
"The intention behind it was to express the idea that the truth of what was being said was important not just in the moment, but would go into eternity, and someone was watching and would ultimately be our judge," Mr. Johnson said. "Some would call that mere symbolism, but to many of our founders, it was deeper than that."
Mr. Johnson said he would continue his crusade, and he has already seen some results.
"To his credit," he said of Mr. Nadler, "We had a hearing where he used 'so help me God.' I leaned over and winked at him."

Texto completo: The world lost a woman best described as a "happy warrior" when progressive Christian writer Rachel Held Evans died May 4 at age 37, the victim of a rare allergic reaction to antibiotics meant to treat the flu.
Evans leaves behind a husband, Dan, and two children.
Evans was a dominating yet cheerful presence of the progressive Christian world. In the online sphere, she openly grappled with Christian evangelicalism and then became one of its most vocal critics, revolutionizing how difficult issues like gay rights, sexuality, and theology are discussed in Christian communities.
The Atlantic called Evans a "hero to Christian misfits," but her husband saw her more as a mother to those who felt abandoned by mainstream Christianity, sharing her experiences without reservation or fear.
“She put others before herself,” Dan Evans told Slate. “She shared her platform. She always remembered how others had helped her. She enjoyed seeing other people in contexts where they thrived.”
Though she was controversial in Christian circles, and occasionally butted heads with some of the biggest names in Christian writing, Evans seemed to see her role as an evangelical for evangelicals: someone openly and desperately struggling with her faith in a way that inspired others to question their own. Her writing, which includes four bestselling books about religion, focused on reforming refugees from American churches into a church of their own.
Evans was, initially, an evangelical herself, but left her church in 2014 after "wearing out my voice in calling for an end to evangelicalism’s culture wars." She created something of her own church online, holding court among progressive Christians and holding fast against her critics. Eventually, she founded a conference called "Evolving Faith," which describes itself as a home for "wanderers, wonderers and spiritual refugees to help you discover. ... You are not alone.”
Often the best way to understand someone's legacy is to see what their longtime rivals and frequent sparring partners say in the wake of their passing. For Evans, even those she fiercely opposed knew her as little more than that "happy warrior" who treated those who disagreed with her with the same respect she demanded for the refugees she brought into her fold.
Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, one of Evans' frequent targets, told the New York Times that "he was her theological opposite in almost every way, but that she had always treated him with kindness and humor."
“I was on the other side of her Twitter indignation many times, but I respected her because she was never a phony,” Moore said. “Even in her dissent, she made all of us think, and helped those of us who are theological conservatives to be better because of the way she would challenge us.”
Her work will have a long-term effect on the activists and scholars she leaves behind, including those on the conservative side of the argument, who have often acknowledged that her observations gave them greater insight into their own positions and their own journeys, because they and Evans were often headed in the same direction.
“When I left church at age 29, full of doubt and disillusionment,” Evans once told the Washington Post, “I wasn’t looking for a better-produced Christianity. I was looking for a truer Christianity, a more authentic Christianity.”
In her final post on her own website, RachelHeldEvans.com, she seemed to give all people of faith a road map on how to handle her own untimely death, in a reflection on the meaning of Lent, a Christian time of sacrifice, remembrance, and meditation on the fleeting nature of humanity.
“Whether you are a Christian or an atheist or an agnostic or a so-called ‘none,’” Evans wrote, “you know this truth deep in your bones: ‘Remember that you are dust and to dust you will return.’”
“Death is a part of life,” she concluded. “My prayer for you this season is that you make time to celebrate that reality, and to grieve that reality, and that you will know you are not alone.”
Emily Zanotti is the senior editor of the Daily Wire.

Texto completo: El caso de Niels Högel, un enfermero alemán que resultó ser un asesino en serie , continúa inquietando a Alemania y a gran parte del mundo. Högel confesó haber matado a 43 pacientes pero las autoridades calculan que al menos 300 personas fueron víctimas de sus crímenes .
La pregunta que ahora se plantean los familiares de las vícitmas y la sociedad alemana en general es cómo este hombre pudo asesinar ininterrumpidamente a tantas personas en cinco años sin que nadie diera la voz de alarma . ¿No se dieron cuenta sus compañeros? ¿Y los supervisores de lo hospitales?
Niels Högel se enfrenta pronto a su tercer juicio desde 2006. En este está acusado de matar a 100 personas . 36 de ellas las mataría en la clínica principal de la pequeña ciudad de Oldenburg y otros 64 en el hospital de Delmenhorst, una zona residencial a 20 millas de Bremen.
Högel se trasladó del hospital de Oldenburg al de Delmenhorst con una carta de recomendación del primero de ellos que destacaba la capacidad del enfermero para trabajar “de manera independiente y concienzuda” y para afrontar situaciones de crisis “atenta y detenidamente” y con “habilidades técnicas correctas” .
La carta no hacía ninguna mención a las sospechas derivadas de la gran cantidad de muertes que habían ocurrido mientras Högel estaba de servicio. L a misiva de recomendación tampoco citaba que habían prohibido al enfermero estar en contacto con los pacientes .
Sin embargo, las mismas sospechas no tartaron en aparecer en el hospital de Delmenhorst, donde -según The New York Times– varios pacientes murieron bajo la supervisión de Högel en sus primeros cuatro meses como enfermero.
Högel, que ahora tiene 42 años, es considerado en Alemania uno de los asesinos en serie con más víctimas en tiempos de paz. Actualmente el hombre cumple cadena perpetua en la cárcel de Oldenburg.
Frank Lauxtermann, el primer compañero en testificar en su contra habla de la cultura alemana de hacer la vista gorda . Aunque al parecer los compañeros de Oldenburg habían hablado de él, ningunó presentó queja a los jefes. Según declaró una de las testigos, no llevaron el tema más allá por miedo o porque pensaban que no era su asunto en un país en el que mucha gente es muy celosa de su privacidad .
De hecho, Sebastian Bührmann, el juez que lleva el caso, ordenó investigar también a ocho de sus compañeros. Bührmann sospecha que los enfermeros podrían haber mentido a la corte u ocultado evidencia en el juicio actual para ocultar sus posibles negligencias . Ahora mismo dos doctores y dos jefes de enfermería del hospital Delmenhorst ya están acusados. Högel tendrá que testificar en sus juicios cuando haya un veredicto sobre su caso.
Otros antiguos compañeros del asesino en serie confeso dicen que se ganó la fama de poder manejar situaciones de vida o muerte. Por su parte, la acusación dice que esa era su estrategia ya que, en realidad, creaba situaciones en las que la vida y la muerte dependían de él.
321 de las 411 muertes que tuvieron lugar mientras Högel trabajó en el hospital de Delmenhorst ocurrieron en sus cambios de turno , según los registros. Un enfermero de este hospital sí que dio la voz de alarma pero, al parecer, los supervisores no hicieron nada al respecto.
Finalmente, en junio de 2005 una enfermera en prácticas fue más allá cuando descubrió que su compañero había desconectado la máquina que mantenía vivo a un paciente y vio en la basura los envoltorios de unos medicamentos no prescritos para él. Desde que descubrieron lo que había hecho hasta el final de su turno ese día, Högel acabó con la vida de su última víctima.
Karl-Heinz Beine, un neurólogo alemán, dijo a NYT que “Niels Högel forma parte de una minoría extrema”. El doctor, que investiga a asesinos en serie en las profesiones médicas desde 1989, dice que le sorprendió la falta de empatía de Högel incluso delante de las familias de las víctimas. Beine cree que el antiguo enfermero está motivado por el narcisismo y la falta de autoestima .

Don't rush into sales tax vote

Texto completo: Don't rush into sales tax vote

Although I have always supported public schools and believe they are underfunded, I do not believe we should rush into paying for the Duval district's past failures with a sudden half-cent sales tax.

When we moved to Jacksonville 45 years ago we couldn't believe that our children's school wasn't even air conditioned. Later we found that some classes desperately needed equipment, and we started making yearly contributions to help meet the needs.

Because we have the only county with no impact fees, our schools in Duval depend on tax dollars for support. I have supported a progressive property tax for the schools since the tax burden would fall more directly on families with higher incomes; a sales tax is regressive because it falls heavily on families with lower incomes.

I think that the Duval County School Board and City Council should be careful about rushing to pursue a sales tax increase.

Seriously, who cares about President Trump's tax returns?

Some bottom feeders -- clearly lacking scruples -- have provided a history of President Donald Trump's federal income taxes and The New York Times, without shame or embarrassment, has published that arguably stolen material.

The leaked tax history shows that Trump incurred losses of approximately $1 billion dollars over a period of 10 years. But so what? Trump's fortunes in business are of no concern to me.

As president, Trump is keeping America safe and helping Americans improve their fortunes and futures. We entrust a president to keep our country protected and productive, and Trump has surpassed these expectations and more.

Trump has left his naysayers with nothing to "nay" or "say" -- so they have been reduced to acting in ways they will surely feel remorseful about once they regain their senses (if, that is, they do regain them).

Mothers are the first and best teachers

St. Augustine is the home of the oldest schoolhouse in America; built in the 1700s, this building represents the origin of education in America. But a closer look at education reveals that a child's first teacher is actually a mother.

Sidney Ledson -- the author of "Raising Brighter Children: A Program for Busy Parents" -- put it well.

Mothers, Ledson stated, "are and have always been their children's first and most important teachers."

Mothers can look into a child's eyes and see tomorrow. They are the ones who help children recognize that they can achieve the impossible.

There is no way to fully thank our mothers for all of the sacrifices they have made to bring sunshine into our lives.

The Cummer's annual arts festival still warms the heart

Cheers to the Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens for renaming the annual Very Special Arts Festival as "Arts4All."

I love the new name!

I recall how years ago I was astounded to see an art activity for students with disabilities in the gallery amid a Thomas Moran painting valued at $2 million!

Over the years, the Very Special Arts Festival served thousands of K-12 students.

It warms my heart to know that this festival has been in our community for decades -- and that it will continue on under its new name.

A Man Held Up a Blank Sign in Kazakhstan to See if He'd Be Detained. He Was.

Texto completo: To test the limits of his right to peacefully demonstrate in Kazakhstan, Aslan Sagutdinov, 22, stood in a public square holding a blank sign, predicting he would be detained.
He was right.
Mr. Sagutdinov's encounter with the police in the city of Uralsk on Monday, which was filmed and posted on YouTube, came as the country prepares for a presidential election in June, its first transfer of power in decades.
"I want to show that the idiocy in our country has gotten so strong that the police will detain me now even though there are no inscriptions, no slogans, without my chanting or saying anything," Mr. Sagutdinov said in the video.
[Video: Aslan Sagutdinov was detained on Monday. Watch on YouTube.]
After being guided into a police car, Mr. Sagutdinov was questioned in a police station and released, he wrote on Facebook. It was not immediately clear if he had been charged with a crime.
The New York Times could not independently confirm the events as seen on the video. But the video spread rapidly in the local news media and on social media, and some people posted photos of themselves holding blank signs in support.
On Tuesday, a police statement offered an account of events on Monday in which the authorities received a report of an unknown male standing in the square, holding a placard, with a crowd growing around him. He was detained but released a short time later.
The police statement maintained that the authorities "were acting within the boundaries of the law."
Bolatbek Beldibekov, the head of the local police department's press service, told the newspaper Uralskaya Nedelya that the offense was not that he demonstrated with the blank placard. Rather, he said, Mr. Sagutdinov ran afoul of the law by making the political statement that "there is no democracy and free speech in Kazakhstan" in a public place.
The episode stood out to human rights watchers as a particularly vivid example of Kazakhstan's restrictions on expression.
On Thursday, as demonstrations were planned on the country's May 9 Victory Day holiday, several major local and international news publications were blocked, and citizens reported that access to Facebook was restricted. One news publication, Vlast, wrote on Facebook that one of its correspondents, Daniyar Moldabekov, was detained by the police despite showing officers his press badge. He was later released.
Kazakhstan's Constitution grants its citizens "the right to peacefully and without arms assemble, hold meetings, rallies and demonstrations, street processions and pickets." But it also allows for restrictions on those rights, and activists say those restrictions have been extensive.
"These authorities are very, very creative in using these provisions of administrative law," said Yevgeniy Zhovtis, director of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law.
Those seeking to publicly demonstrate, either in groups or by themselves, must apply to local officials 10 days in advance, he said. If approved -- and many applications are not -- the protests will be confined to a few designated areas, he said.
Mihra Rittmann, senior Central Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said at least four other people had been detained in the past month for expressing their views publicly, even when the messages did not oppose the government. In one case, an artist was charged with "petty hooliganism" after hanging a banner over a highway with a quote from the Constitution.
Those detained can face penalties as high as 15 days in prison. One activist was given a 15-day sentence after saying on Facebook he intended to protest before permission had been granted, according to local reports.
Activists say the limits on expression have been in place for decades, but now is a particularly active time politically. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who spent 30 years as president, stepped down in a surprise announcement in March, leading to presidential elections on June 9.
Ms. Rittmann said that the episode "speaks to the sensitivities right now in the government."
"This was an extreme and absurd example of the extent to which the authorities in Kazakhstan undermine the right to peaceful assembly," she said.

Texto completo: Ryan Reynolds is one of the hottest actors in Hollywood.
However, Reynolds said in a New York Times interview that he is not big on the vanity side of celebrity, saying his wife, Blake Lively, jokes about him only needing a drawer for his clothes rather than a closet.
Reynolds, who stars as the voice of Pikachu in the "Detective Pikachu" film opening this weekend, revealed that one of his favorite articles of clothing is a T-shirt — and it happens to be from Michigan.
"I have an old T-shirt that I've had for maybe 18 years," he told The New York Times. "It was black, but is gray now. And on the front it says Zukey Lake Tavern. I don't even know where that is, but it's a real tavern somewhere in the United States. I've had a couple of people say, 'No way! That's from my hometown.'"
Zukey Lake Tavern is in Pinckney, a village in Livingston County. The bar sells various kinds of merchandise in different styles and colors, such as tie-dye hoodies and T-shirts, tank tops, women's V-neck shirts and hoodies with phrases such as, "Zukey Lake Tavern, it's on the way to Hell, Michigan."
Zukey Lake even has a section on its website called, "ZLT Around the World," with people from Pittsburgh to Scotland donning a tavern shirt.
"We're honored and privileged to have our name out there," said Jeff Plante, co-owner of Zukey Lake Tavern. "My partner and I are big fans of Ryan Reynolds. We even have a picture up of him wearing the shirt at the 'Smokin' Aces' premiere in 2007."
The tavern got its name from Zukey Lake, and was built after the end of Prohibition in the early 1930s by Maggie and Baldy Girard. The brothers also built several houses on the north shore of the lake, and the road where the tavern is located would be named after them, Girard Road. In addition to its clothing, the bar is known for its roof deck tiki bar, "Lobster tail Tuesdays" and a Sunday breakfast buffet.

Texto completo: ALBANY – The state Senate on Wednesday passed legislation that would allow the state Tax Department to release a president's state tax returns if any of three congressional committees asks for them.
Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, introduced the measure last month in a bid to aid Democrats who control the U.S. House in their efforts to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns. It passed along party lines, 39-21.
Because Trump is a New Yorker, the state Legislature "has a special role and responsibility to assist Congress in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities," Hoylman said Tuesday after the bill passed a Senate committee.
He added Wednesday, "Simply put, no one is above the law, and we have a situation in Washington where a co-equal branch of government has requested tax information from the White House and it is being stonewalled."
The Democrat-controlled Senate passed another bill Wednesday aimed at Trump.
It would allow New York to prosecute Trump associates even if they are pardoned by the president on the federal level.
What happens next? With the Senate approval, the bills now go to the Democrat-led Assembly, where leaders haven't indicated whether it would pass them.
Then they would need the signature of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who, despite being a harsh Trump critic, has indicated he would back the proposal to let the state release Trump's taxes to Congress if it would apply to more than just the president.
The Trump administration has rejected requests by House Democrats to get Trump's federal tax returns.
Since Trump files his taxes in New York, the bill would allow three congressional committees — the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation — to request the state Department of Taxation and Finance to provide the president's state tax returns.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler praised New York's bill, saying it would aid his investigation into the White House.
"This bill is a workaround to a White House that continues to obstruct and stonewall the legitimate oversight work of Congress," he said in a statement.
Republicans ripped both the tax bill and the so-called "double jeopardy" bill, saying they are politically motivated and set dangerous precedents.
"I truly believe that this is pure and simple a political maneuver to attack a sitting president of the United States to score political points in your individual districts," Sen. Thomas O'Mara, R-Big Flats, Chemung County, said on the Senate floor.
The "double jeopardy" bill would let state prosecutors bring charges — even if a presidential pardon was issued. Attorney General Letitia James, a Trump critic, has pushed for the measure.
The bill appears to have the support of Cuomo and the Assembly.
Changing the law Under New York law, sharing state tax return information is prohibited, except under rare circumstances. The bill would create an exemption when the returns are sought by congressional committees in any investigations.
Democrats dismissed Republicans' concerns that it would open all New Yorkers to tax scrutiny by Congress, saying the measure is limited in scope and the IRS already has access to state tax returns.
The bill is one of three Hoylman has introduced to get at Trump's taxes.
One would require all statewide elected officials, including the president and vice president if they file New York income taxes, to release their taxes publicly each year.
Another would keep Trump off the state's 2020 ballot if he doesn't release his taxes.
Hoylman said the Senate focused on the tax bill passed Wednesday because it appears to be more urgent, since Trump is fighting with the House over release of his taxes to the congressional committees.
Scrutinizing Trump's taxes The bill's passage in the Senate came a day after The New York Times reported on details of Trump's tax returns from 1985 through 1994, saying he lost more than $1 billion through his business dealings over that span.
On Wednesday, Trump blasted the report, saying the tax filings demonstrated "write-offs" and "depreciation."
"Real estate developers in the 1980's & 1990's, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases," Trump tweeted early Wednesday.

Texto completo: PPL Corp. in Allentown reaped a $19 million rebate for 2018, among some 60 profitable Fortune 500 companies nationwide that either paid no federal income taxes or received rebates.
That's thanks in part to 2017 tax changes, as well as earlier tax policy.
A PPL spokesman acknowledged the Allentown company did not pay federal taxes last year, but said the tax policy was enacted to encourage investment in the electric power grid - and the company has done that.
Sixty of America's Fortune 500 corporations paid nothing - or got refunds - for 2018, according to a report released last month by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington, described as a left-leaning think tank by The Washington Post and The New York Times.
In PPL's case, the institute said the company received its refund based on $1.1 billion of U.S. income, for an effective tax rate of minus 2%. Combined, the 60 companies got a rebate of $4.3 billion on $79 billion in pretax income, according to the institute.
Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow with the institute, said companies' receiving favorable tax results means a substantial loss of federal revenue.
"Certainly, in the aggregate, this tax avoidance is harmful to taxpayers and harmful to the nation," Gardner said. "With ongoing government shortfalls, this makes it difficult to fund services we all want to see funded."
President Donald Trump and Republicans argued that the tax changes would stimulate investment and economic growth.
For decades, profitable companies have been able to avoid corporate taxes, but the list of those paying zero roughly doubled last year, according to a recent New York Times story, as a result of provisions in Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That law, adopted in late 2017, expanded corporate tax breaks and reduced the tax rate on corporate income. The law dropped the statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.
Gardner said lawmakers in favor of the law claimed that lowering the federal tax rate would make U.S. corporations more competitive globally, and that the tax cuts would spur innovation and pay for themselves.
But before the tax changes, many profitable corporations - including local Fortune 500 companies PPL and Air Products - already avoided the statutory federal tax rate, he said. And after the 2017 changes, the biggest innovation is record-breaking stock buybacks, which have benefited wealthy investors, he said.
PPL spokesman Ryan Hill said the institute's report paints an "incomplete picture" regarding the energy company's taxes.
Hill said PPL used its savings toward capital expenditures to modernize its grid network and support jobs throughout its territory in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the United Kingdom. In the last three years, he said, the company invested more than $9 billion in improvements.
A significant portion of that investment was eligible for "bonus depreciation," Hill said. Bonus depreciation essentially allows a company to take a deduction for capital expenditures rather than depreciate the assets over time for tax purposes, he said. The company will pay less tax now but more tax in the future, he said.
However, use of bonus depreciation in prior years created net operating losses that PPL is able to carry forward for tax purposes and use to reduce taxable income, Hill said. The company expects to pay "significant cash taxes" once the net operating losses have been fully used, he said.
Hill said the entire liability, including current and deferred taxes, puts the company's effective tax rate at 26% in 2018.
Gardner said the institute found that, over about the last 10 years, PPL reaped about $9.5 billion in pretax income on which its federal income tax has been less than zero.
"So even over the course of the business cycle, PPL appears to be phenomenally successful in zeroing out its federal income tax bills," Gardner said.
Air Products didn't make the most recent list. Gardner said the group could not measure Air Products' taxes in part because the institute research covers companies whose earnings were posted for 2018. Air Products' fiscal year runs November to October.
However, Gardner said among profitable Fortune 500 companies studied between 2008 and 2015, the institute found the Trexlertown industrial gases giant had an eight-year federal income tax rate of 10.7%. He said in two years during the period, the company paid no federal income taxes, despite being profitable those years.
"We always meet our tax obligations and take those matters very seriously," Air Products spokesman Art George said.
"There's no implication that there is anything illegal about this," Gardner said. "But it's fair to say that neither PPL nor Air Products paid anything close to the legal 35% tax rate (before the new Trump law) over the past decade."
Some politicians have decried the situation. But Gardner said, "Congress could fix it tomorrow, but the tax breaks are the effect of lobbying by the very corporations that are benefiting from these tax breaks."
The Fortune 500 is a list of the country's largest corporations based on total revenue. The institute's 2018 tax list includes household names such as Netflix and Amazon, and three other Pennsylvania companies: Aramark, U.S. Steel and UGI Corp., whose natural gas subsidiary serves the Lehigh Valley.
Also making the list: FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, Ohio, the corporate owner of electricity provider Met-Ed.

Acquia buys Medford startup
Acquia, a Boston company that uses open-source software to help clients build websites, applications, and other digital offerings, said on Wednesday it scooped up Mautic, a Medford startup using similar tools to build marketing software. The companies did not disclose the terms of the acquisition, but they said Mautic's staff of more than 40 will be absorbed into the much larger Acquia. Acquia, which has raised $194 million in venture capital, now has about 950 employees globally. Mautic had raised about $9 million before the acquisition, and the company said the deal was a bet on the growth potential for open-source projects. The code for open-source software is maintained by a community of users, and companies that build their business around it often sell services and maintenance for projects built with the software. Acquia cofounder Dries Buytaert also created the open-source content management software Drupal, which is a core part of Acquia's business. — ANDY ROSEN
INDUSTRY
Siemens to cut 10,000 jobs in major structuring
German industrial equipment maker Siemens says it will cut some 10,000 jobs in a major restructuring that will involve spinning off its oil, gas, and power generation business and creating new areas of growth. The company said it would spin off its division that makes power turbines to increase its entrepreneurial freedom, while embarking on a sweeping cost-cutting effort at its remaining operations. The gas and power division has been under pressure due to a broader trend toward renewable energy such as sun and wind power. Competitors in the power business such as Boston-headquartered General Electric and Japan's Mitsubishi have struggled as well. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Walmart to raise age to purchase tobacco products, e-cigarettes to 21
Walmart said Wednesday that it will raise the minimum age for tobacco products and e-cigarettes to 21 in all its US stores in an effort to combat tobacco sales to minors. It will also stop selling solutions and pods for e-cigarettes that are flavored like fruit or desserts. The world's largest retailer said the new rules will take effect in July, and will also include its Sam's Club warehouse stores. Previously, its minimum purchase age was 18, aside from a number of states where the law required a minimum purchase age of 21. Last month, drugstore operator Walgreens also said it would increase the minimum age for tobacco sales to 21 after the Food and Drug Administration accused it of repeatedly selling them to minors. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAXATION
ACLU of R.I. sues over sales tax exemption that covers only fiction books
The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island has sued the state on behalf of nonfiction writers, saying a sales tax exemption for authors is unconstitutional because it only applies to works of fiction. The federal suit filed Tuesday argues that making a distinction between fiction and nonfiction violates the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. A state law enacted in 2013 exempts from the sales tax "original and creative works" sold by writers, composers, and artists residing in Rhode Island. The ACLU says the state's taxation agency has concluded that nonfiction books are not "original and creative works." — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Miniskirts and pillows with photos of Auschwitz draw protests
Museum authorities at the Auschwitz-Birkenau former Nazi German death camp in Poland have protested to an online vendor that was selling miniskirts, pillows, and other items bearing photos of the camp, where around 1.1 million people were killed during World War II. On Twitter, the museum addressed the vending site, redbubble, to say that offering such products with images of Auschwitz is "rather disturbing and disrespectful." Australian-based redbubble, which allows artists to create designs for T-shirts and other fabric items and sell them directly to the public, responded that it was taking "immediate action to remove" the items, which it said are not in line with its guidelines. From 1940-45, around 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, but also Poles, Gypsies, Russian prisoners of war, and others, were killed in the gas chambers or died of starvation, hard labor, and disease at Auschwitz-Birkenau, which Nazi Germany operated in occupied Poland. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Britain doesn't burn coal for a week
Britain has gone a week without burning coal for electricity for the first time since the 19th century. Power operator National Grid says coal hasn't contributed to the UK electricity mix since the afternoon of May 1. The landmark was reached two years after Britain had its first coal-free day since the Industrial Revolution. Fintan Slye, director of National Grid Electricity System Operator, said Wednesday that coal-free power would become the "new normal" as Britain generates more power from wind, solar, and other renewable sources. The ­government says Britain will eliminate coal from its power supply by 2025. It has set a deadline of 2050 to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions altogether. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
RETAIL
Carrefour, French retailer, could be latest company to leave China
Carrefour, the French retail giant, is weighing options including a sale of its Chinese business, mirroring other international consumer firms that have decided to exit the country in recent years, people familiar with the matter said. Carrefour is working with an adviser and has begun reaching out to potential suitors, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Carrefour could seek about $1 billion for the Chinese business, though it may also opt to divest just a stake or decide against a sale, the people said. No final decisions have been made, they said. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
AGRICULTURE
California to ban pesticide linked to brain development problems in babies
The nation's most productive agricultural state moved Wednesday to ban a controversial pesticide widely used to control a range of insects but blamed for harming brain development in babies. The move cheered by environmentalists would outlaw chlorpyrifos after scientists deemed it a toxic air contaminant and discovered it to be more dangerous than previously thought. California's environmental secretary, Jared Blumenfeld, said it's the first time the state has sought to ban a pesticide and the move was overdue. The decision comes after regulators in several states have taken steps in recent years to restrict the pesticide used on about 60 different crops in California, including grapes, almonds, and oranges. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
New York Times subscriptions top 4.5 million
The New York Times Co. on Wednesday reported first-quarter results that were better than expected, as gains in digital advertising and subscriptions outpaced the inexorable decline of its once-mighty print business. The total number of paid subscriptions, including digital and print, topped 4.5 million, a high. More than 3.5 million people pay for the publisher's online products, with the company adding 223,000 customers for its news, crossword, and cooking apps during the quarter, a 29 percent increase over last year. Revenue generated by online advertising was a bright spot. It rose 19 percent, to $55 million, helped by its podcast business, notably “The Daily." The paper's digital subscription and advertising businesses combined rose 16 percent, to $165.4 million. The future of the company hinges on digital growth as the print newspaper becomes a specialized product for an ever-shrinking base of readers. — NEW YORK TIMES

Some former Boston feds agree that Trump would have been prosecuted if he weren't the president

Texto completo: A prominent Boston lawyer said Wednesday that he felt he needed to defend the rule of law when he joined hundreds of other former federal prosecutors in signing a letter asserting President Trump would be charged with obstructing justice if he didn't occupy the Oval Office.
“I thought it was important because the president of the United States needs to understand that he is bound by the same rules" as everyone else, said Bruce A. Singal, a partner at Barrett & Singal who previously handled public corruption and major fraud cases as an assistant US attorney.
Singal said that as someone “who has prosecuted and who has defended corruption cases, when I see the president clearly trying to block and impede an investigation into himself, then I ask myself why he should not be held accountable like the people I prosecuted and defended for doing lesser things."
Other former prosecutors with Boston ties, including Alexandra Leake, Christopher Bator, Bill Sinnott, Despena Billings, David Apfel, Joe Savage, and Ben Clements, were also among the signees of the “Statement by Former Federal Prosecutors" posted on medium.com.
William F. Weld was the highest-profile name on the list, which was posted Monday and has continued to grow. He served as US attorney in Boston before becoming the Republican governor of Massachusetts. He is now waging a long-shot campaign against Trump for the GOP nomination.
“I thought it was important to sign the letter to make it clear that President Trump did in fact commit the criminal offense of obstruction of justice on a number of occasions, as set out in exhaustive detail in volume 2 of the Mueller Report," Weld said Wednesday in an e-mail. “Four hundred federal prosecutors, both Republicans and Democrats, agreed that it was not even a close call."
The initial signee tally of more than 370 has risen to more than 700. The names on the list, according to the medium.com posting, were vetted “to the best of our ability."
Billings, who specialized in prosecuting crimes related to US national security as well as criminal acts of corruption by public officials from 1990-2006 in Boston, said she and hundreds others signed the letter for “a simple reason."
“Even the publicly-available evidence demonstrating attempts by this President to obstruct the Russia investigation is so overwhelming that it's not a close case," Billings wrote.
Billings said Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report “smacks of such a predetermined outcome that it threatens to undermine everything honorable the U.S. system of justice represents around the globe, and flies in the face of our vast collective experience as career prosecutors across this nation."
Singal, who served as a federal prosecutor in the Reagan and Carter administrations, said that “if [Trump is] not held accountable, we start to move perilously close to autocratic or even dictatorial rule."
The letter, released by a nonprofit critical of the Trump administration, said Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report "describes several acts that satisfy all of the elements for an obstruction charge." However, a Justice Department legal opinion says sitting presidents cannot be indicted.
Mueller's report also did not establish “conspiracy or coordination" between the 2016 Trump presidential campaign and Russia.
Singal said the DOJ policy against indicting sitting presidents “allows a president like Trump to act in a lawless fashion without fear of repercussions that everybody should have."
Trump, for his part, has adamantly denied wrongdoing.
“Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President, including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stolen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back," Trump tweeted Tuesday. “The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
He later added, “Also, there are 'No High Crimes & Misdemeanors,' No Collusion, No Conspiracy, No Obstruction. ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE, and that's what the Dems should be looking at, but they won't. Nevertheless, the tables are turning!"
Singal has worked a number of high-profile cases in private practice.
His clients have included Barry Cadden, the former co-owner of a Framingham compounding pharmacy blamed for scores of deaths who was sentenced in 2017 to nine years in prison. In a closely watched trial, jurors convicted Cadden of fraud and racketeering but cleared him of second-degree murder allegations that would have carried a life sentence.

Texto completo: A couple of days ago, I found some photos on my computer of me sitting at my computer. I didn't take them.
Facebook chairman Mark Zuckerberg tapes over his laptop camera. So does former FBI Director James Comey.
So should you.
Hackers trick us into clicking innocent-looking links on our computers that allow remote access. Young women are particular targets of these creeps, but we are all vulnerable.
The expression "the privacy of your home" is outdated. If you have a computer, Alexa, even an Amazon account, it's very possible your personal data has been compromised in some fashion.
I recently abandoned my blog after my virus protector detected it was infected by malware from Russia and other nations.
Do you like to track how many miles you walk or steps you take daily? So do I. So do some life insurance companies.
According to The New York Times, John Hancock recently offered a fitness tracker to customers. If you accept, the company can see how active you are, how much you sleep and whether you live a healthy life. How thoughtful!
Then it can adjust your premiums accordingly. God forbid, you get sick and can't exercise for a while.
Meanwhile, I've heard rumors that a number of men have been known to visit the occasional porn site. Most would prefer that their particular proclivities remain private, and not passed on by hackers to their bosses, friends and relatives.
When your doctor asks you to input your medical history and medications on the office's online portal, it allows you easy access to vital information about your health. Unfortunately, it also allows hackers the same access.
When I saw those eerie photos of me on my computer, I put a Band-Aid over my laptop camera. But Band-Aid solutions don't help when we're bleeding information every moment of our lives. We need leadership that takes this threat seriously. Because it now threatens both our personal privacy and our democracy.
We have a president who doesn't seem concerned in the slightest about Russian hackers disrupting our 2020 election. Congress seems behind the curve on cyberthreats as well.
We are being overrun by cyberroaches, both foreign and domestic - and our exterminator isn't taking any calls.

Texto completo: CORRECTION: This story contains corrected material, published May 9, 2019.
(The headline as published has been corrected in this text.)
Donald Trump reported $1.17 billion in financial losses to the IRS from 1985 to 1994, a massive run of red ink that kept him from paying income taxes during most of that period, according to a report published late Tuesday in The New York Times.
The Times said it had documented those losses by obtaining official IRS tax transcripts for those years, showing the figures Trump reported on his IRS Form 1040 returns. The scope of those losses was such that, "year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer," The Times said.
The Times report comes a day after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would not comply with a request from a House committee to turn over copies of more recent Trump tax returns. A 1924 law gives Congress the explicit power to request such returns, but Mnuchin said the request lacked a "legitimate legislative purpose," a stance that is expected to be challenged in court.
The White House and the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent Tuesday. The Times said a private attorney for the president, Charles Harder, called its report "demonstrably false," but he had not cited any specific errors.
Until now, Trump's early career in real estate was believed to have reached a peak in the late 1980s, when Trump wrote "The Art of the Deal" -- and then collapsed into loss and debt in 1990 and 1991.
The Times story shows, however, that Trump's losses began earlier. In 1985, the future president reported $46.1 million in losses from his casinos, hotels and other businesses, according to the report.
Those losses got worse in 1990 and 1991, as Trump's big bets on casinos, hotels and an airline all went bad.
Trump reported $517.6 million in combined losses during those years, The Times said. Because of his losses, The Times said, that Trump had not been required to pay income taxes for eight of the 10 years it examined.
Trump's most profitable business during this period, The Times reported, was not in real estate but in the stock market. As The Times described it, Trump would buy a company's stock, then make public statements indicating he was contemplating a hostile takeover of that company. The publicity would make the stock price rise, and then Trump -- rather than buying more shares to make good on his takeover threat -- would sell his stocks at a profit.
That sort of faux takeover talk earned Trump $57 million by 1988, The Times reported. But eventually, investors stopped falling for it: When Trump bought stock in American Airlines and talked about a takeover, the market didn't bite. Trump lost $34.9 million on short-term stock trades that year, The Times said.

Making Mom's chicken brings her back to me

Texto completo: Back when my mom would cook chicken, it was an event. For years, she'd made it her mission to cook a new chicken recipe every Friday. As the sun set, she blasted Josh Groban. And, wine in hand, she'd season the meat with the gusto of a conductor rousing an orchestra. Whatever the recipe, she shook in copious quantities of garlic powder and salt. All of it made her smile. Her food contained so much joy that it would have been fine if it had tasted lackluster. But it never did. Because my mother was the poultry whisperer.
At age 10, I wrote her an acrostic poem for Mother's Day that said: "T is for the tasty turkeys you cook." Eating at her table was festive and filling. As my husband likes to remember, "Any time you'd stop to talk, or put down a fork, she'd say, 'There's plenty of food' - after you'd already eaten so much food." Two of my mother's specialties were her turkey matzo ball soup and her Rock Cornish hens a l'orange. As journalist Laura Silver writes in "Knish: In Search of the Jewish Soul Food," "Marcel Proust had his madeleine, Jewish New Yorkers had their knishes." And I, Jewish New Yorker though I am, have my mother's chickens.
To make my mother's Cornish hens, I follow her instructions: Rinse, take out the inside schmutz and dry. I hear my mother's words, feel her anxiety. The hardest part of the recipe is keeping the hens from cooling. Flip them over without ripping the skin, she says. I armor each with foil, as instructed, while I make the sauce. The sauce requires boxed white wine, orange juice, beef bouillon, orange bits, cornstarch and half a cup of Grand Marnier. I don't drink, but the birds do.
When my childhood home in New Jersey was sold after my mother's death seven years ago, I received her cookbooks. I can hold her favorite one, the 1973 edition of "The Good Housekeeping Cookbook," and see her creative process. The front is stuffed with recipes from friends, articles on foods to try, and the invaluable excerpt from Nora Ephron's "Heartburn" with the perfect recipe for artichoke vinaigrette.
Tucked betwixt it all is the newspaper clipping that started it all - a New York Times article from 1999 titled, "From Poussin to Capon a Chicken in Every Size." It calls Rock Cornish hens "celebratory and a bit decadent" and contains a recipe with an orange. Her trajectory is clear. She must have flipped straight to the Good Housekeeping recipe for duckling a l'orange - the page most splattered with sauce, most kissed by her signature dinners - and then tweaked it to make it her own.
Mom's cookbook is so worn that the pages fall in clumps into my hands. In this way, our fingerprints still meet.
In "The Order of Time," theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli writes, "If I observe the microscopic state of things, then the difference between past and future vanishes." At that level, the only difference between past and future is the way we observe the transfer of heat. Molecules move from an ordered state to a disordered one. We perceive this as an ever-increasing blur. And because of that blur, we can no longer distinguish cause from effect, past from future. Our days become a bleary, endless march toward disorder.
But amid the deaths, the disappointments, the joys and the intimacies, you can instead choose to restore order. By applying energy in one moment, in one place, you can increase order for just that moment, and then it is like you are returning to an earlier state.
I like to think that by applying my energy to cooking these chickens, I am, effectively, for that moment, reclaiming the past.
Cooking chicken incites memories of both my mother and what I know of our ancestors. In the eastern European shtetls, and long before, Jewish families planned all week for their Friday Shabbat meal. They'd make chicken soup for that meal that was supposed to give them a taste of The World To Come.
What I want is a taste of The World That Was. I still have keys to my childhood home. But that house has been sold, smashed and turned into someone else's mansion. So I must return by other means. I turn to my mother's help.
While the l'orange sauce thickens, I plate the wild rice and the green beans. They frame the hens like a picture from my childhood. The picture is missing my mom's face, but I feel her warmth. One whiff of that sauce, and it's like she just put that plate in front me. With the smell, I begin to travel. And it's the taste, the taste that brings me home.

Texto completo: A former Goldman Sachs banker charged last year in connection with the looting of billions of dollars from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund pleaded not guilty in Brooklyn federal court on Monday, just hours after being flown back to the United States.
The banker, Roger Ng, had been in custody in Malaysia since he was charged with helping the country's former prime minister and others embezzle at least $ 2.7 billion from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund, known as 1MDB.
The magistrate judge overseeing Mr. Ng's bail hearing, Peggy Kuo of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, said both sides were engaged in plea talks. Marc Agnifilo, Mr. Ng's lawyer, disputed that characterization after the hearing, although he left open the possibility of an agreement with prosecutors.
"Roger has pleaded not guilty and will at least consider all options available to every defendant at the inception of a case," Mr. Agnifilo said.
Mr. Ng, 46, is one of two former Goldman bankers federal prosecutors have charged in the case. Last August, Tim Leissner, Mr. Ng's former boss, pleaded guilty to money laundering and foreign bribery charges.
Mr. Leissner is free on bail while he waits to be sentenced. Mr. Ng was released on $ 20 million bail and ordered to remain in home detention. His next court date is May 23.
The charges against both men relate to an alleged scheme by the country's former leaders to plunder 1MDB, which used Goldman's investment banking services to issue $ 6 billion in bonds meant to finance infrastructure projects in the country. Instead, prosecutors say, the former prime minister, Najib Razak, his family and a young financier, Jho Low, spent a large portion of the money on jewels, jets and artwork.
The authorities contend that Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to help win the bond underwriting work, which generated $ 600 million in fees for Goldman. The deals also earned big bonuses for Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng and enhanced their reputations at Goldman.
The case has prompted a serious criminal investigation for Goldman, which has said it could face a substantial fine in the United States. Malaysian officials also want Goldman to pay up to $ 7.5 billion in damages.
"We continue to cooperate with all relevant authorities as the process continues to move forward," Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, said in a statement.
Mr. Ng still faces charges in Malaysia, where he was arrested in November. Justice Department lawyers and their Malaysian counterparts agreed to bring Mr. Ng to the United States after he said he would not contest an extradition proceeding, but the authorities in Malaysia called his return to the United States a "temporary surrender."
Tommy Thomas, the Malaysian attorney general, said Mr. Ng would be brought back to face charges after American prosecutors had completed their case.
The 1MDB scandal reached halfway around the globe and into the highest reaches of power in Malaysia. It led to Mr. Najib's downfall when he lost his re-election bid last May and was arrested by Malaysian authorities in July.
It also reached Hollywood: Some of the missing money helped pay for the Hollywood blockbuster "The Wolf of Wall Street," according to prosecutors.
Mr. Low, who has been accused of using some of the money to lavish gifts on celebrities, was also indicted in the United States and remains at large. The charges against Mr. Low and Mr. Ng were announced along with the guilty plea of Mr. Leissner, who is married to the model and fashion designer Kimora Lee Simmons.
The terms of Mr. Leissner's bail agreement were sealed by the court in August, and his whereabouts was not known.
Judge Margo K. Brodie of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, who is overseeing the case, denied a request from The New York Times to unseal portions of Mr. Leissner's plea hearing that discussed the terms of his bail. But she recently granted a motion by lawyers for The Times that would allow them to appeal that order.

Finding more nuance in abortion debate

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – While constitutional lawyers, ethicists and theologians — in descending order of importance in the abortion debate — have been arguing in the 46 years since the Supreme Court attempted to settle the debate, some technologists have been making a consequential contribution to it.
They have developed machines that produce increasingly vivid sonograms of fetal development. This concreteness partially explains the intensification of the debate.
Six states have passed "heartbeat bills" to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, approximately six weeks after conception.
Such bills are, indeed, unconstitutional given the court's Roe ukase that abortion cannot be restricted before a fetus is viable outside the womb — which means, presumably, before the fetus is a child.
But why should "viability" be the dispositive criterion? Viable means capable of surviving outside the womb, which no infant can do without constant help that others must give. Must. No infants are "viable" in that all are helpless, and the law requires that help be given by those responsible for the infant.
A New York Times editorial (Dec. 28, 2018) opposing the idea that "a fetus in the womb has the same rights as a fully formed person" spoke of these living fetuses — that they are living is an elementary biological fact, not an abstruse theological deduction — as "clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings."
Now, delete the obfuscating and constitutionally irrelevant adjective "viable," and look at a sonogram of a ten-week fetus. Note the eyes and lips, the moving fingers and, yes, the beating heart. Is this most suitably described as a "cluster of cells" or as a baby? The cluster-of-cells contingent resembles Chico Marx in the movie "Duck Soup": "Who ya gonna believe, me or your own eyes?"
The "heartbeat bills" are wholesome provocations: One of their aims is to provoke thinking about the moral dimension of extinguishing a being with a visibly beating heart. Furthermore, pro-life people are being provoked in different ways.
Last month, Kansas' Supreme Court found in this from the state constitution — "All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" — a reason to overturn the state's ban on D&E (dilation-and-evacuation) abortions that involve dismemberment of the living fetus.
In February, after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order to enforce taxpayer-funded abortions, Democratic legislators decided that not even that was enough. They introduced a bill to create a right to abortion for any reason at any point in a pregnancy, a bill similar to legislation enacted or advancing in other Democratic-controlled states.
In February, all but three Democratic U.S. senators opposed, thereby killing, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse's Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that would have required, in the rare cases in which a child survives a botched abortion procedure, that the survivor receive the standard professional care that would be given to any child born alive at the same gestational age.
The 1850s debates that propelled Abraham Lincoln to greatness concerned not whether slavery should be abolished forthwith, which was neither a constitutional nor political possibility.
Rather, the debates concerned two other questions: Would national policy stigmatize slavery as a tragic legacy and a moral wrong? And: Would policy confine slavery to its existing dominion by banning it from the territories, thereby, Lincoln thought, putting it on a path to ultimate extinction?
Temperate pro-life advocates, practicing Lincolnian prudence, consider the abortion debate akin to the slavery debates for three reasons: Abortion shrinks the scope of the concept of personhood. The issue has been inflamed by judicial fiat (Roe v. Wade as Dred Scott v. Sandford). And confining a morally objectionable practice is a worthy, albeit not fully satisfying, objective.
The changed composition of the Supreme Court, and the supposed imminent danger that Roe will be overturned, is the excuse that pro-abortion extremists have seized upon to do what they want to do anyway: to normalize extreme abortion practices expressive of the belief that never does fetal life have more moral significance than a tumor in a mother's stomach. (Most European nations restrict abortions by at least week 13. France and Germany are very restrictive after 12, Sweden after 18.) The court's new composition has encouraged some pro-life advocates in their maximum hope, that Roe can be overturned, which would not proscribe abortion but would restore its pre-1973 status as a practice states can regulate. This is not a foreseeable possibility; a more nuanced abortion regime is.

Pelosi worries Trump might try to hold on to power if he loses by a close margin in 2020

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she worries that President Trump might not give up power if he is defeated in 2020.
“We have to inoculate against that, we have to be prepared for that,” she told the New York Times.
Pelosi said Democrats need to defeat Trump by a margin so big that he can’t question the legitimacy of the election. The speaker said she worried before the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats picked up 40 seats, that if Democrats didn’t perform as well that Trump might have disputed control of the House.
“If we win by four seats, by a thousand votes each, he’s not going to respect the election,” she recalled. “He would poison the public mind. He would challenge each of the races; he would say you can’t seat these people.”
“We had to win. Imagine if we hadn’t won — oh, don’t even imagine. So, as we go forward, we have to have the same approach,” Pelosi added.
She also said that Democrats shouldn’t indulge the “other exuberances” of some in the far-left of her party but should rather focus on appealing to the mainstream in a bid to unseat Trump.
“Own the center-left, own the mainstream,” she said.
Pelosi has pushed back on some of the more progressive members of her party who are calling for a Green New Deal and “Medicare for all.” She has also publicly rebuffed calls for Trump’s impeachment, despite other members in her party calling for impeachment proceedings to begin.

Texto completo: What a difference five months makes. Until last December, when Donald Trump nominated him for attorney general, Bill Barr was one of Washington's most highly respected attorneys. A conservative Republican, for sure, but one who'd served with distinction in the CIA and the Justice Department, including two years as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. Justice Department lawyers cheered his nomination because, one source told CNN, unlike Jeff Sessions, Barr was "tough, principled and independent."
Well, that was then, this is now.
In just two months on the job, Barr has lost all the respect he once enjoyed. He's proven neither tough, nor principled, nor independent. Instead, he's emerged as the biggest sycophant in a Cabinet full of sycophants. He's sold his soul to Donald Trump. He's no more credible today than Sarah Sanders, Rudy Giuliani or Kellyanne Conway.
Barr's had three opportunities to tell the truth and show he's not just a Trump flunky. He's failed all three. The first was March 24, when he issued what he called a four-page "summary" of the Mueller report which, he claimed, absolved the president of any wrongdoing - based on which he decided not to charge the president with obstruction of justice.
We now know that summary was a snow job, designed to spin the report as exculpatory to Trump. In a letter sent to Barr three days later, special counsel Robert Mueller complained that Barr's letter was so misleading it "did not fully capture the context, nature and substance" of the final report.
Barr's second departure from the truth occurred April 18 when, two hours before release of the final, redacted Mueller report, he held a news conference in which he again summed up Mueller's conclusions in Trumpian terms: "No Collusion. No Obstruction. Complete Cooperation with the Special Counsel. And Complete Exoneration." Which a quick reading of the report proved was nothing but a pack of lies.
Far from "no collusion," Mueller documented multiple contacts between Russian operatives and Trump campaign officials, always eager to get whatever assistance the Russians could provide. And far from "no obstruction," Mueller detailed 10 different occasions on which Trump tried his damnedest to obstruct justice, but was thwarted by refusal of White House staffers to follow his orders.
Barr's third and final effort came last week in his disastrous appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee. As Democrats on the committee noted, his testimony was a combination of "purposely misleading," "masterful hairsplitting" and "lying to Congress."
Again, Barr insisted that Trump cooperated fully with the special counsel, dismissing the facts outlined in the report that Trump tried twice to fire Mueller, urged White House counsel Don McGahn to lie to The New York Times about it, offered a presidential pardon to Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen for not cooperating with Mueller, and refused to sit down with Mueller for an interview.
In his most brazen, and most oft-repeated lie, Barr stood by his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on April 9 that he had no idea whether or not Mueller was comfortable with his four-page summary. In fact, two weeks earlier, on March 25 and on March 27, Mueller had written him two letters accusing Barr of undermining "a central purpose for which the Department appointed a Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigation." The two of them even discussed their differences by phone March 28. In other words, Barr knew first-hand that Mueller was unhappy, but lied about it under oath.
The only way we'll get the truth about the investigation is not from Barr, but from Mueller, who's been invited to appear before the House Judiciary Committee on May 15. Meanwhile, we must accept that we don't have an attorney general heading the Justice Department. We have a stooge for Trump, who was appointed to do everything he could to undermine the report and protect the president.
Mission accomplished.
Barr's accomplished something else too. He's made us look more kindly on Jeff Sessions. For all his faults, Sessions at least recused himself from the FBI investigation - something which, by his own admission, Trump acolyte Barr would never have done.
It's the ultimate irony: Only Barr could make Sessions look good.

Texto completo: Adult video streaming website YouPorn is offering to double the reward for the information that leads to the apprehension of those responsible for killing more than 500,000 bees earlier this week.
According to the New York Times, someone torched, toppled and tossed into a nearby pond more than 20 European honeybee hives in Brazoria County, Texas.
The bees have already had a rough go of it in recent years courtesy of pesticides, poor nutrition and a parasite that shortens their lifespan, according to the Times.
"We are deeply alarmed with the news that 500,000 bees were senselessly burned to death at a Texas bee yard this week. The bee population is very important to us," said YouPorn Vice President Charlie Hughes in a statement.
"We heard of the rewards that are being offered to find the person responsible for this unspeakable crime. We'd like to double what both the Brazoria County Crime Stoppers and the Beekeepers Association are offering, and will be rewarding $12,000 to anyone who turns in this criminal," Hughes added.

What's known about surveillance of Trump campaign aides

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - In a London bar three years ago, a young foreign policy adviser for Donald Trump's campaign told an Australian diplomat something astonishing: Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton.
Within months, the adviser, George Papadopoulos, was proven right as stolen emails damaging to Clinton surfaced online. Alarmed Australian officials tipped off their American counterparts.
For the FBI, the information was worrisome. How did Papadopoulos get advance word of the emails? Was he or anyone else in the Trump campaign working with the Russians?
Those questions led to the Russia investigation that would shadow Trump's presidency for nearly two years. Trump and his supporters have seized on the FBI's use of informants in Papadopoulos' case and surveillance of another campaign aide to accuse the Justice Department and the FBI of unlawfully spying on his campaign.
But both are common investigative techniques for agents trying to determine whether a foreign adversary is trying to compromise American national security. The use of informants and surveillance is not illegal, if proper procedures were followed, a point Attorney General William Barr made this week in congressional testimony.
A look at what we know about the surveillance of Trump's campaign.
Papadopoulos
A few months after Papadopoulos' discussion with the Australian diplomat, a professor named Stefan Halper emailed him offering $3,000 to come to London. Halper said it would be to discuss a natural gas project in the Mediterranean, calling Papadopoulos a "recognized expert in this field.
Unbeknownst to Papadopoulos, Halper was actually a longtime FBI informant, several news outlets, including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and NBC News, have reported.
On Thursday, The New York Times reported that a woman who identified herself as Halper's assistant was a government investigator working for the FBI.
In his book about his entanglement in the Russia probe, "Deep State Target, Papadopoulos wrote that the woman, who identified herself as Azra Turk, asked him about his work with the Trump campaign.
"She wants to know: are we working with Russia? he wrote.
He described her question as "creepy and said he told her he had "nothing to do with Russia.
Papadopoulos was later questioned by the FBI and ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents about his conversations with another professor, who in March 2016 had told him about the Clinton "dirt.
Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days behind bars and was the first Trump aide to plead guilty and agree to cooperate in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
Page
Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page had been on the FBI's radar as early as 2013, when the bureau suspected Russian intelligence agents were trying to recruit Americans.
And when he surfaced during the 2016 campaign as an adviser to Trump - and traveled to Russia - he once again attracted the attention of the FBI as it investigated Russian election interference.
In October 2016, after Page had left the Trump campaign, the FBI obtained a warrant to monitor him under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to conduct surveillance in some of the most sensitive FBI investigations.
In the FISA application, the government said Page "has been the subject of targeted recruitment by the Russian Government and said the FBI believed Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election "are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Trump's campaign.
Some of the since-declassified FISA application relied on a collection of memos authored by former British spy Christopher Steele that contained uncorroborated allegations of ties between Trump and his associates and Russia.
Those documents, known colloquially as the Steele Dossier, contend the Russian government amassed compromising information about Trump and had been engaged in a years-long effort to support and assist him.
Steele's research was funded by Clinton's campaign through a Washington law firm, a fact congressional Republicans have seized on as they criticized the Russia investigation. They argued the dossier was inappropriately used by the Justice Department before the election to get the FISA warrant on Page and claimed the FBI and the Justice Department didn't tell the FISA court enough about the political money behind Steele's efforts.
Trump has repeatedly criticized the use of the dossier, claiming, incorrectly, that it started the Russia investigation.
Was any of this illegal?
Based on available public information, there's no evidence of illegal activity by the FBI or the Justice Department.
The FBI routinely uses informants, also known as confidential sources, in a variety of investigations, from violent crimes to white-collar and counterintelligence investigations.
The FISA warrant the FBI obtained to monitor Page was lawfully obtained from a court in October 2016. A memo released by House Republicans in 2018 showed that a judge agreed four times that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power. Top FBI and Justice Department officials, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, signed off on the FISA application.
What happens now?
Barr has said he's compiled a team to look into the origins of the Russia investigation, a matter that is already being investigated by the department's inspector general.
In his testimony during a congressional budget hearing last month, Barr said he believes "spying did occur on the campaign and suggested the origins of the probe may have been mishandled.
Barr provided no details about what "spying may have taken place but appeared to be referring to Page. Barr has said he doesn't see the word as pejorative and stopped short of saying anything unlawful or improper took place.
For his part, Trump has repeatedly accused the government of committing an illegal, unprecedented act. Senate Republicans have said they will also investigate the origins of the Russia investigation.

With anti-Semitism on the rise, Jews must call out hatred on the left and the right

Texto completo: Es iz schwer tzu sein a yid. It is hard to be a Jew. — Sholem Aleichem
The recent deadly assault on the Chabad temple in Poway — just six months after a bloodier massacre in Pittsburgh — reflects the sad reality that anti-Semitism in all its hoary forms, is back.
This is, if anything, even more the case in Europe, where Jewish populations are under siege and are almost one-third as large as right after the Holocaust.
Sadly, confronted by such incidents, the Jewish community, reflecting the deep fissures of American society, seems divided by political orientation. The conservative faction, sometimes aligned to President Trump, focuses largely on growing anti-Semitism on the political left often downplayed by progressive Jews who focus on the scattered, albeit sometimes deadly, expression of anti-Semitism among scattered white nationalists.
The problem here is that both the far-right and the progressive left represent clear and present dangers to Jews around the world. The proper response to incidents at Poway, as well as those perpetrated by the political left, should not be division, but a common sense of unity in the face of a growing, and, until recently, largely unexpected threat.
The two faces of Jew-hatred
Historically, anti-Semitism has fed on two different, although sometimes aligned, perceptions. The first, dating back to classical times, was based on a notion of “otherness “. In ancient Greece and Rome, that was in large part because Jewish monotheism clashed with the dominant state-sanctioned polytheism. Later this hatred was reinforced by Christian, and later Muslim, intolerance. Jewish ideas may have underpinned both faiths, but the refusal to embrace “the true and only” divine relation infuriated religious zealots of the new religions.
In medieval societies, emerged a conspiratorial strain of anti-Semitism that maintained that a secret cabal of Jews was seeking, or even have achieved, world domination. This melding of the othering and conspiracy was mostly embraced on the right and turned into policy in Nazi Germany.
Even today the far right in Poland and other European countries — where roughly one in four hold anti-Semitic views — retains such memes even if their countries are largely judenrein. The unhinged alt-right of the Charlottesville marchers, as well as the lone wolf shooters in both Pittsburgh and Poway, embraced this particularly virulent ideology.
“The socialism of fools”
America’s progressive Jews, dominant in the non-Orthodox rabbinate, have had a harder time confronting the rise of left-wing anti-Semitism, which focuses on Jews as capitalist exploiters or Israel as a neo-colonialist power. The German social democratic leader August Bebel is widely credited describing this as “the socialism of fools.”
Groups like the Anti-Defamation League like to focus on right-wing hate groups, but their statistics have been roundly criticized in such respected magazine as Tablet, and are widely thought to reflect their predictably progressive bias.
Others accuse President Trump as inciting anti-Semitism. But despite his poorly chosen comments about “good people” on both sides in Charlottesville, Trump has been arguably the most pro-Israel president since Truman and the first president with Jewish grandchildren; for this, he was bitterly denounced by both the Pittsburgh and Poway shooters.
The progressive Jews own sense of moral superiority and desire to push “social justice” as the core of their identity — conflicts with the reality that , in both Europe and North America, the strongest anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel, political movements come from on the left. In Great Britain, for example, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has embraced the virulently anti-Jewish Hamas and attending ceremonies laying wreaths at the graves of such “heroes” as the terrorist killers at the 1972 Munich games.
Anti-Zionist, and anti-Jewish, sentiments are most commonly found in progressive bastions like college campuses, where “third world” oriented academics push “disinvestment” from Israel. Pitched merely as anti-Zionism, these same political warriors rarely favor actions against far more repressive states as China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Worse yet, , for the first time in decades, there are now anti-Semitic members of Congress , led by Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose pronouncements about Jews, money and “dual loyalty” have been tolerated by a party leadership intimidated by the rising left.
Normalizing anti-Semitism
We are witnessing the normalization of anti-Semitism. Democratic Presidential candidates, most recently Pete Buttigieg, seek out the blessings of the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton, a past dealer in anti-Semitic calumnies. The New York Times recently printed, in its International edition, a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu leading a blind, Kippur-wearing President Trump that would not have been out of place in Julius Streicher’s Nazi era Der Stürmer.
In Europe, far more than America, anti-Semitism is also rising on the right. In Belgium, Jewish caricatures have been on display at local festivals despite complaints. And in Germany, one official of the rightist Alternative for Germany party, dismissed the Holocaust as “a speck of birds*** in 1,000 years of glorious German history.”
Faced with what could become a permanent threat, Jews, and their friends in other religious communities, should confront anti-Semitism in all its forms. Divisions about fighting hatred serve to empower the haters, and make us all, of any faith, more vulnerable.

Texto completo: Es iz schwer tzu sein a yid. It is hard to be a Jew. — Sholem Aleichem
The recent deadly assault on the Chabad temple in Poway — just six months after a bloodier massacre in Pittsburgh — reflects the sad reality that anti-Semitism in all its hoary forms, is back.
This is, if anything, even more the case in Europe, where Jewish populations are under siege and are almost one-third as large as right after the Holocaust.
Sadly, confronted by such incidents, the Jewish community, reflecting the deep fissures of American society, seems divided by political orientation. The conservative faction, sometimes aligned to President Trump, focuses largely on growing anti-Semitism on the political left often downplayed by progressive Jews who focus on the scattered, albeit sometimes deadly, expression of anti-Semitism among scattered white nationalists.
The problem here is that both the far-right and the progressive left represent clear and present dangers to Jews around the world. The proper response to incidents at Poway, as well as those perpetrated by the political left, should not be division, but a common sense of unity in the face of a growing, and, until recently, largely unexpected threat.
The two faces of Jew-hatred
Historically, anti-Semitism has fed on two different, although sometimes aligned, perceptions. The first, dating back to classical times, was based on a notion of “otherness “. In ancient Greece and Rome, that was in large part because Jewish monotheism clashed with the dominant state-sanctioned polytheism. Later this hatred was reinforced by Christian, and later Muslim, intolerance. Jewish ideas may have underpinned both faiths, but the refusal to embrace “the true and only” divine relation infuriated religious zealots of the new religions.
In medieval societies, emerged a conspiratorial strain of anti-Semitism that maintained that a secret cabal of Jews was seeking, or even have achieved, world domination. This melding of the othering and conspiracy was mostly embraced on the right and turned into policy in Nazi Germany.
Even today the far right in Poland and other European countries — where roughly one in four hold anti-Semitic views — retains such memes even if their countries are largely judenrein. The unhinged alt-right of the Charlottesville marchers, as well as the lone wolf shooters in both Pittsburgh and Poway, embraced this particularly virulent ideology.
“The socialism of fools”
America’s progressive Jews, dominant in the non-Orthodox rabbinate, have had a harder time confronting the rise of left-wing anti-Semitism, which focuses on Jews as capitalist exploiters or Israel as a neo-colonialist power. The German social democratic leader August Bebel is widely credited describing this as “the socialism of fools.”
Groups like the Anti-Defamation League like to focus on right-wing hate groups, but their statistics have been roundly criticized in such respected magazine as Tablet, and are widely thought to reflect their predictably progressive bias.
Others accuse President Trump as inciting anti-Semitism. But despite his poorly chosen comments about “good people” on both sides in Charlottesville, Trump has been arguably the most pro-Israel president since Truman and the first president with Jewish grandchildren; for this, he was bitterly denounced by both the Pittsburgh and Poway shooters.
The progressive Jews own sense of moral superiority and desire to push “social justice” as the core of their identity — conflicts with the reality that , in both Europe and North America, the strongest anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel, political movements come from on the left. In Great Britain, for example, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has embraced the virulently anti-Jewish Hamas and attending ceremonies laying wreaths at the graves of such “heroes” as the terrorist killers at the 1972 Munich games.
Anti-Zionist, and anti-Jewish, sentiments are most commonly found in progressive bastions like college campuses, where “third world” oriented academics push “disinvestment” from Israel. Pitched merely as anti-Zionism, these same political warriors rarely favor actions against far more repressive states as China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Worse yet, , for the first time in decades, there are now anti-Semitic members of Congress , led by Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose pronouncements about Jews, money and “dual loyalty” have been tolerated by a party leadership intimidated by the rising left.
Normalizing anti-Semitism
We are witnessing the normalization of anti-Semitism. Democratic Presidential candidates, most recently Pete Buttigieg, seek out the blessings of the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton, a past dealer in anti-Semitic calumnies. The New York Times recently printed, in its International edition, a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu leading a blind, Kippur-wearing President Trump that would not have been out of place in Julius Streicher’s Nazi era Der Stürmer.
In Europe, far more than America, anti-Semitism is also rising on the right. In Belgium, Jewish caricatures have been on display at local festivals despite complaints. And in Germany, one official of the rightist Alternative for Germany party, dismissed the Holocaust as “a speck of birds*** in 1,000 years of glorious German history.”
Faced with what could become a permanent threat, Jews, and their friends in other religious communities, should confront anti-Semitism in all its forms. Divisions about fighting hatred serve to empower the haters, and make us all, of any faith, more vulnerable.

Texto completo: Boy, is our political discourse going to the dogs.
The Washington Post reports Donald Trump is the first U.S. president in 100-plus years not to have a dog — though others, including Ronald Reagan, didn't have dogs until their second terms. During a February rally, reports The Post, Trump said "he doesn't have a dog because the idea of getting one seems 'phony' to him." Using presidential pets to score political points is not without precedent. The Hill says "avid dog lover" Herbert Hoover was among the first to do so while running for the nation's highest office.
"Following campaign advice, with hopes of shaping his image into something warmer and more charismatic, he released a photograph of himself with his German Shepherd, King Tut," says The Hill.
King Tut helped Hoover win the White House, but after he presided over the 1929 stock-market crash, Hoover was routed by FDR in the 1932 presidential election. According to The Hill, some suggested Bill Clinton got Buddy, his beloved chocolate Labrador, to help his image at the peak of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Maybe so, but photos clearly show Clinton enjoyed Buddy's company. George H.W. and Barbara Bush had Millie, an English springer spaniel who famously birthed six White House puppies. Millie's book was a huge seller. Their presidential son had a dog, too. "President George W. Bush's Scottish terrier, Barney, became a celebrity in his own right, appearing in more than 10 films while he was at the White House," says The Hill. The Obama family chose Portuguese water dogs Bo and Sunny, in part because Malia Obama required a hypoallergenic breed. The canines brought joy to the Obama family and were a delight at various White House events. But no dog for the Trumps? "Ever since President William McKinley's administration — which began in 1897 — every single occupant of the White House, save for Trump, has had a dog at some point," reports The Post.
Trump said he'd feel odd walking a dog on the White House lawn and just doesn't have the time to do so. And that resulted in a loud negative response, in these over-charged times, that the current occupant of the White House loathes all things canine.
"WHY DOES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HATE DOGS?" asks Newsweek.
"Instead of having dogs, which tend to crave attention and often are scene stealers where photography is involved," Newsday columnist Anne McFeatters tells us, "Trump frequently calls women he disdains 'a dog.'" In a New York Times column, Timothy Egan writes: "We know that Donald Trump, the first president without a pet since James K. Polk, appears to hate dogs." The "Trump hates dogs" narrative got to a point in which it prompted fact-checking website Snopes to investigate whether Trump's critics are barking up the wrong tree. Snopes' conclusion?
"The claim that he 'hates dogs' appears to be based on shaky logic ... and relatively scant evidence ... . It is also contradicted by photographic evidence and first-hand accounts of Trump's cheerful demeanor around dogs."
Like or dislike Trump — goodness knows he evokes powerful passions among supporters and opponents alike — it's troubling to me that so much ink and bandwidth would be spent on so trivial a subject, when so many matters of larger importance are begging for our attention. Just another sign that our political discourse is really going to the dogs.

Texto completo: Woody Allen shopped around a manuscript for his new memoir, but publishers didn't want anything to do with it.
A New York Times report detailed how executives at multiple publishing houses rejected Allen's memoir that he tried to sell late last year largely due to his increasing persona non grata status.
A-list actors, producers and publishers once flocked to Woody Allen projects, but the directing icon's reputation has suffered in the wake of the #MeToo movement. As greater attention has been paid to allegations of Allen molesting his daughter Dylan Farrow when she was 7, Hollywood has distanced itself from the auteur. Amazon has shelved his most recent film "A Rainy Day in New York" and several actors have either expressed regret over working with the director or vowed never to work with him again, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth, Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Timothee Chalamet.
According to the New York Times, some publishing executives described working with Allen as "toxic" in the #MeToo era.
In Europe, Allen's reputation is somewhat less tarnished, and he is in pre-production on a film with a Spanish producer.
Writer and longtime friend of Allen, Daphne Merkin, told the Times that Allen had been working on the memoir for a long time. "He's not one to set the record straight, but presumably, the memoir is his side of things," she said. "He's the kind of person who soldiers on, and someone whose work is his nutrient."

Surgery: Kelly Clarkson had her appendix removed the day after hosting the Billboard Music Awards on Wednesday night. The 37-year-old tweeted she "may or may not have broken down in tears after the show from pain." Despite the pain, Clarkson performed her new song, "Broken & Beautiful," and opened the awards show with a medley of some of the year's biggest hits. Clarkson tweeted she's "feeling awesome" "#TheShowMustGoOn."
Spin-ish: A spinoff of ABC's "black-ish" will focus on a young Rainbow Johnson growing up in the 1980s. ABC said "mixed-ish" will be narrated by Tracee Ellis Ross, who stars in "black-ish" as the adult character with the nickname of Bow. In the spinoff, Bow (Arica Himmel) and her mixed-ethnicity family face the dilemma of assimilation or staying "true to themselves," according to ABC.
Biebs has a secret: Justin Bieber got his start posting cover songs on YouTube and now he's working with the platform on a "top secret project." YouTube announced it is planning a project with the Grammy-winning Canadian pop star, set to premiere next year. No more details about the Bieber special were revealed.

Texto completo: Re "Attacks can't crush American Jewish life," Opinion, May 1
As a 95-year-old Jew, I would love to accept the upbeat assessment about the support Jews have in America despite the April 27 attack on the synagogue in Poway, Calif. But the vicious attacks on minorities lately, including Jews, bring back memories of the not-too-distant past.
When I read about President Trump's edicts on those fleeing their home countries so they can make a better life for themselves and their children in the U.S., I am reminded of the 1930s, when a boatload of German Jews seeking safety in our country were turned away. All of the passengers were returned to Europe, where many of them were murdered in the Holocaust.

People who are ready to kill others out of hate are empowered by the likes of Trump and the groups that support him. It's not just Jews who are at risk; just about anyone who has a different view of the world, people of different colors or ethnic backgrounds and even journalists also face danger.
We must all speak out against hate. When one minority suffers, all minorities are at risk.
June Sale, Los Angeles
::
Eshman fails to mention two threats facing Jews, one internal, the other external.
The internal threat is Jewish secularism. According to a Pew study, 62% of American Jews say that being Jewish is "mainly a matter of ancestry and culture." Also, "79% of married Jews of no religion have a spouse who is not Jewish," and nearly 40% of "intermarried Jews who are raising children say they are not raising those children Jewish at all."
An external danger is the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel permeating our universities. A 2016 study by the AMCHA Initiative found a strong correlation between anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses and the following: the presence of anti-Zionist student groups, the presence of faculty who have expressed support for an academic boycott of Israel, and BDS activity.
Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) spewing historically anti-Semitic tropes and the New York Times publishing an admittedly anti-Semitic cartoon pose greater dangers than a few fringe neo-Nazis.

::
My neighborhood is home to a well-known Jewish temple, which is enclosed by a tall iron fence that, although attractive, serves an obvious purpose.
Eshman may be correct that Jews have more allies than enemies in standing up to hate, but the sight in my neighborhood of a security guard carrying a conspicuous firearm is heartrending.
Babette Wilk
Valley Village
::
As a professor and student of Jewish history, I can list the many differences between the recent attacks on Jews and the Crusades, the Inquisition, pogroms and the Holocaust. The number and ferocity of these attacks do not approach the heinousness of previous institutional acts of anti-Semitism -- except, of course, to the individual victims.
We have a saying in Judaism that can be paraphrased as this: If you save one life, it's as if you've saved the entire world. Similarly, for the family and friends of Lori Gilbert-Kaye, who died in Poway, all historical comparisons are irrelevant.
Circumstances change, but Jews continue to be hunted down.

Not transparent,or just a liar?
Re "A war on transparency," column, May 1
Doyle McManus writes that President Trump's tweets are "unrestrained by facts." Does he mean the president's a liar?
McManus calls it an "odd assertion" that Trump claims his is the "most transparent" presidency in history. So, is he saying Trump's a liar?
We are reminded that Trump "falsely" claimed he couldn't release his taxes while under audit. Does that mean he lied?
Yes, we can say it: The president is a liar.
Among his lies, Trump's most absurd is his latest claim that the Russia probe was an attempted coup and that starting the investigation was tantamount to treason. Seriously? Justice Department special counsel Robert S. Mueller III chronicled a list of crimes the Russians committed to help Trump get elected.
It would have been more treasonous not to have investigated Russia's attack on our democracy.
Robert Fox
Los Angeles
::
McManus detailed the litany of refusals from the White House to comply with fundamental and legal information requests from elected leaders in Congress. Nobody seems to know how to deal with such an overt flouting of the law.
In the same day's newspaper, an article addresses impeachment. Is it really so hard to connect the dots?

The lives taken
Re "Grim toll of life in South L.A.," May 1
In an ideal world, homicide would be so rare that each and every killing would merit a front-page article. We're not there yet.
Still, the L.A. Times could perform a valuable public service by publishing front-page articles about every local homicide, including details about the life of victims and their loved ones.
Readers would complain that they're weary of reading about homicide on a daily basis, but that's the point: Every killing is a big deal and ought to prompt us to demand action from our leaders.

'People of color' favors whiteness
Re "Let's retire the term 'people of color,' " Opinion, April 28
Nadra Widatalla is right that the term "people of color" erases black people and even certain groups within ethnicities, but I would retire it for a different but related reason: It privileges whiteness.
Obviously, the terms "black" and "white" are metaphorical when applied to human skin, whose actual color range is more like pale peach to dark greyish-brown. (And, of course, "black" and "white" are loaded words with deeply ingrained negative and positive connotations, at least in Western languages).
Calling non-Caucasians "people of color" posits Caucasians as colorless, as a default from which other colors are a variation, like the white canvas that other colors are applied to. What it does not do is locate Caucasian skin colors as equal points along the continuum of humanity.
We need to change our thinking and our language to reflect reality, which is why it's time to retire "people of color."
Kay Gilbert
Manhattan Beach
::
I was about to be persuaded by the author's eloquent plea to get rid of the term "people of color," but then I noticed on the same day's op-ed page a piece by columnist Virginia Heffernan, who uses that exact phrase to end her evaluation of former Vice President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign kickoff:
"His savior complex, in particular, is in danger from the women and people of color who are his rivals for the Democratic nomination."
Then I saw a photograph, also in Sunday's newspaper, of Trump supporters greeting him at an April 27 rally in Green Bay, Wis., none of whom appeared to be, well, people of color.
Apparently, the term "people of color" still has some value and is not ready to be retired yet.

Texto completo: BHUBANESWAR, India - Hundreds of thousands of people evacuated parts of India's eastern coast Thursday as an "extremely severe" cyclone moved north through the Bay of Bengal, bringing fears of widespread destruction from heavy rain, powerful winds and storm surge in low-lying areas.
Cyclone Fani, classified by meteorologists as the equivalent of a Category 3 or 4 hurricane, was expected to hit the coast Friday after churning through the bay, which has produced many of the world's deadliest tropical cyclones.
By late Thursday, the World Meteorological Organization said the storm had winds of about 124 mph, making it "one of the most intense storms in 20 years" in the region.
Tens of millions of people are potentially in the path of what the India Meteorological Department called an "extremely severe cyclonic storm." Not long after 11:30 p.m. in Puri, India, satellite data from the department showed outer bands of the storm battering the Indian coastline as the storm's eye moved north.
In the beach village of Chandrabhaga, police helped residents move from thatched-roof homes to a nearby storm shelter Thursday afternoon. By evening, the sea had turned rough and strong winds were lashing buildings along the coast.
The meteorological department warned of the "total destruction" of thatched huts in some districts, major damage to roads, the uprooting of power poles and potential danger from flying objects.
Indian authorities said the storm could be the most powerful to strike India since 1999, when a cyclone killed more than 10,000 people in the same region of eastern India. But authorities in the region have significantly improved disaster preparation and response capabilities in the years since, and subsequent major storms have resulted in far fewer deaths.
Cyclone Fani is forecast to drop as much as 8 inches of rain on northern parts of the state of Andhra Pradesh and on the state of Odisha. The storm is expected to continue north, hitting the neighboring countries of Bangladesh and Bhutan, as well as parts of the Indian states of West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya. Airports in its path were closing and hundreds of trains have been canceled.
Naveen Patnaik, chief minister of Odisha, said that about 800,000 people were expected to be moved to safer places by Thursday evening.

In our opinion: Don't overlook the productivity of idleness

Texto completo: The idea is compelling, but counter-intuitive: Doing nothing is, perhaps, the most productive way we could spend our time. In a globalized world so bent on maximization and efficiency, people should take the emerging science on the value of idleness seriously — using it both personally and in structural reform to create healthier societies.
That may sound like a contradiction to old, tried-and-true wisdom about the value of work, but it’s not. This isn’t a defense of laziness or slothfulness. It’s about regularly taking time out from a noisy, cluttered world to enjoy peace, pondering and playfulness. Your health, mentally, physically and spiritually, may depend on it.
Across cultures and contexts, a consensus is emerging. Overwork, and an over-emphasis on maximizing productivity, is correlated with dangerous health effects. Japan has coined a new word to describe the phenomenon of “death by overwork;” The Deseret News has taken a deep dive into the rise of anxiety disorders among overextended teens; and researchers in Ohio have shown how increased working hours result in heart disease and cancer among women.
Yet tech giants such as Elon Musk continue to insist “nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.” This statement has received the expected backlash, with many citing recent research that has attempted to quantify the health and labor productivity effects of shorter working hours. In 2008, researchers from Brigham Young University revealed that the majority of workers sampled preferred a four-day workweek, citing benefits to their wellbeing and contributions at work. Other studies have shown an increase in worker productivity and even cardiac benefits resulting from reduced working hours.
Reaching the proper balance can be tricky. Other studies contest these claims (Utah enacted a mandatory four-day workweek for all state employees as a result of the BYU study but later returned to a full work week in 2011, arguing the benefits were never proven). And with spare time, as with everything else, what you make of it determines its value. Perhaps the answer lies not in the number of hours worked but instead in the quality of time spent cultivating creativity and presence.
A recent piece in The New York Times challenges readers to prioritize idle time. Going beyond the demonstrated health benefits of mindfulness, a form of idleness defined as carving out time in the day to do nothing at all has been shown to increase creativity by facilitating daydreaming.
Productivity experts say this can enable flourishing in both professional and personal lives. Specifically, they advocate five key steps to unlock creative idleness. Intentionally making time for doing nothing, resisting the culture of busyness, managing expectations (not all idleness is necessarily productive — if you are drowsy, your imaginative capacities are diminished), reorganizing your environment to find a place free of distractions and thinking outside the box to use creativity enabling tools (kinetic sand, Baoding balls or marble runs) can help with the process.
People should collectively reimagine how they work if they are going to shift the structures of production itself — perhaps the right kind of idleness, as opposed to laziness, would help people creatively realize a better, healthier future for work. It also would increase spirituality and an appreciation for the beauty of the world.
The world demands enough attention these days, and often not for things that deserve it. Peaceful pondering and playful creativity deserve a fair share of your time, as well.

Texto completo: James Holzhauer snagged his 22nd "Jeopardy!" win on Friday's edition of the quiz show. But fans will have to wait two more weeks to see if his streak continues.
Holzhauer, a 34-year-old professional sports gambler from Las Vegas, won $82,381 on Friday's show, for a total of $1,691,008. He holds onto a solid second-place title for the most consecutive wins, although reigning champ Ken Jennings has won 74 times, for a $2. 5 million haul. (Champions were limited to five appearances until 2003. )
Monday, the annual "Jeopardy!" Teachers Tournament will sideline Holzhauer for two weeks. He'll return May 20 to compete for his 23rd victory, and more cash.

Holzhauer recently explained his strategy in a Q&A with The New York Times. Unlike most players, he picks the highest-value clues first.
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game, I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said, likening his approach to a poker strategy.
"There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament. You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Eddie Timanus, a five-time "Jeopardy!" winner who compiles the college coaches polls for USA TODAY Sports, describes Holzhauer as "a game-changer. "
Timanus notes Holzhauer's mastery of the signaling buzzer, but says he really stands out in his aggressive bidding.
"While many players, myself included, prefer to play categories from top to bottom and try to stick to them, Holzhauer clears the big-dollar clues first," Timanus says. "Thanks to his ability to ring in first consistently and rarely miss, he usually has a considerable total built up by the time he uncovers a Daily Double. He finds most of them since he’s able to maintain control of the board for long stretches, and, as we've seen, he's not afraid to bet big. "
His overall assessment of Holzhauer the player: "Speed, instinct, confidence and knowledge — pretty SICK, wouldn’t you say?"

ProPublica’s Hannah Dreier Wins MOLLY National Journalism Prize and Is a Michael Kelly Award Finalist

Texto completo: The Texas Observer and the Texas Democracy Foundation announced this week that Hannah Dreier is the winner of the 2019 MOLLY National Journalism Prize for her “Trapped in Gangland” series on MS-13. Dreier was also named on Thursday one of four finalists for the Michael Kelly Award, which recognizes writers or editors whose work exemplifies “the fearless pursuit and expression of truth,” for the series.
Dreier, who has received multiple awards for her work on MS-13 — including the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing, the John Bartlow Martin Award for Public Interest Magazine Journalism and the Hillman Prize for magazine journalism — started reporting on the gang after President Donald Trump seized on MS-13’s violence on Long Island to promote tougher immigration policies. As coverage ramped up, she noticed that we seldom heard from the gang’s mostly immigrant victims. She decided to dig beneath the rhetoric and examine the impact of MS-13, as well as the law enforcement crackdown, on Long Island’s rapidly growing Latino community. The powerful narratives were co-published with New York magazine, Newsday and the New York Times Magazine.
For her first story, Dreier spent months gaining the trust of a teenage informant who helped the FBI catch fellow MS-13 members, believing authorities would offer him a new life. Instead, they handed him over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Another piece told the story of a mother searching for her missing son, whom police had dismissed as a runaway until his macheted body was found in the gang’s “killing fields.” The series’ final article featured an asylum-seeker accused of gang membership and deported for drawing a devil, his school mascot but also an MS-13 symbol.
In response to the series, Long Island police began investigating the mishandling of MS-13 murders and the officers who belittled the distraught mother. The Department of Homeland Security opened a civil rights investigation, ICE changed a practice that jeopardizes informants and several Long Island school districts sought a formal agreement with the police limiting officers’ roles in schools.
“The range of characters and voices explored for each story — victims, families, neglected kids trying to escape the gang — make the series a comprehensive, necessary dose of reality in a conversation dominated by the Trump administration’s fear-mongering,” a MOLLY National Journalism Prize judge wrote. “Dreier’s flawless storytelling weaves in historical context and analysis that tie the big picture to the present day. And her reporting has sparked change — not just in policy but in the lives of the victims she profiled. A remarkable piece of journalism.”
Pamela Colloff, a ProPublica senior reporter and writer-at-large at the New York Times Magazine, along with senior research fellow Leora Smith, received honorable mention for the MOLLY National Journalism Prize. They were honored for their work on “Blood Will Tell,” which investigated the science behind bloodstain-pattern analysis. This forensic practice, and the experts who specialize in it, have helped prosecutors secure convictions across the country — even though it turns out to hardly be science at all.

Texto completo: Los fiscales federales continúan descubriendo nuevos padres que pagaron sumas millonarias para asegurar los estudios de sus hijos en las más importantes universidades de Estados Unidos.
Un nuevo escándalo involucra a la familia de una estudiante de China que presuntamente pagó $6.5 millones de dólares para ingresar a Stanford, una de las universidades más prestigiosas del mundo.
La noticia, que fue reportada inicialmente por Los Angeles Times, asegura que Yusi Zhao, conocida como Molly, ingresó a la universidad de Stanford a inicios del 2017 gracias a la suma millonaria que su familia pagó a William “Rick” Singer, quién fue admitida para hacer parte de un equipo deportivo de navegación de la universidad. Según el New York Times, la estudiante fue expulsada de la universidad en abril de este año, pero no está claro si Zhao y su familia están siendo investigados en Estados Unidos.
En un nuevo artículo publicado hoy, Los Angeles Times asegura que otra familia china pagó $1.2 millones de dólares para que sus hijas fueran admitidas a la universidad Yale.
Mientras las investigaciones continúan, las personas siguen esperando cuál será la próxima celebridad o influyente empresario en caer por participar en este esquema de estafa . Según el New York Times, cientos de padres están buscando abogados defensores para protegerse de esta oleada de destape de sobornos y de humillación pública que se convirtió en el escándalo de admisiones a universidades más grande en la historia de Estados Unidos.

Texto completo: Tareck El Aissami , uno de los líderes más poderosos del gobierno venezolano, cercano al presidente Nicolás Maduro , exvicepresidente y ahora ministro de Industrias y Producción Nacional en Venezuela , está siendo señalado de nueva cuenta por narcotráfico y de tener nexos con el grupo terrorista Hezbolá .
Así lo revela el diario The New York Times, que tiene en su poder un expediente que indica que El Aissami , de 44 años, y su padre, Carlos Zaidan El Aissami , buscaron cómo introducir a Hezbolá en Venezuela .
De igual manera los documentos afirman que su hermano, Feraz El Aissami , tenía negocios con el narcotraficante más famoso de Venezuela , Walid Makled alias “ El Turco “, y que tenía casi $45 millones de dólares guardados en cuentas bancarias de Suiza. Pero no solo eso, si no que además a Tareck se le vincula directamente con “ El Turco “, pues hay documentación que afirma que emitió contratos millonarios para empresas propiedad de Walid .
Y mientras la mayoría de los venezolanos viven entre el hambre y la miseria, Tareck El Aissami ha amasado una enorme fortuna que le permitió comprar un banco en Estados Unidos , parte de una constructora, acciones en un centro comercial panameño, tierras donde se construirá un complejo turístico de lujo y varios proyectos inmobiliarios en Venezuela, entre ellos una costosa mansión hecha para sus padres.
El 8 de marzo pasado Estados Unidos acusó formalmente a El Aissami por narcotráfico lo que lo convirtió en el segundo miembro del gabinete de Maduro señalado de dicho delito luego que se hiciera lo propio con Néstor Reverol , actual ministro del Interior venezolano.
De igual manera detallan cómo almacenes supuestamente abandonados en realidad estaban siendo usados para guardar toneladas de químicos que se utilizan para producir cocaína. Aquí de nueva cuenta suena el apellido de El Aissami : Haisam , primo de Tareck , quien se identificó como representante legal de Makled Investments , la compañía del “ El Turco “.
La última parte del archivo recoge informaciones de testigos que vinculan a la familia El Aissami con Hezbolá , quienes detallan los intentos para reclutar a militantes que buscaban establecer una red de tráfico de información y de drogas a lo largo de América Latina , algo que no se aclara si se logró o no.
* La “bruja” que no pudo predecir que sería víctima de “El Mencho” o “El Marro”
* Le llegan más malas noticias a “El Mayo” Zambada desde Colombia
* Profanación de cuerpos y más atrocidades; la cruel venganza del Cártel del Noreste

Texto completo: Dear Senators,
I am writing on behalf of many of your Taoseño constituents who have concerns about certain activities at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
We greatly appreciate your advocacy on behalf of your constituents in regard to issues of concern at LANL, WIPP (Waste Isolation Pilot Plant) and and Holtec International. And we want to thank you.
We have three other topics of constituent interest we would like you to consider.
1. Plutonium sustainment: In the interest of peaceful and sustainable futures for Taos, we are gathering many petition signatures and business and nonprofit endorsements for an updated nonbinding resolution that we are bringing before our town and county governments.
The resolution requests that our governments strengthen and enforce the revised 2016 DOE-NMED Consent Order governing cleanup at LANL and expresses its opposition to continuing nuclear weapons activities and instead diversify its missions by redirecting nuclear weapons funding to expand nonproliferation activities, cleanup and peaceful and sustainable research and technologies, including climate science.
Funding for nuclear weapons activities dwarfs all other activities at LANL. When your Taoseño constituents learn about and understand what plutonium pits are, how many we already have in storage with reliable lifetimes of 100 years or more; how many nuclear warheads the United States and Russia still possess; that the Trump Administration's Department of Energy along with our senators want to manufacture up to 80 more new "pits" per year, for new smallish "safer to use" nuclear weapons; that senators Heinrich and Udall want all 80 to be manufactured at LANL and that the Lab still has many serious unresolved nuclear criticality safety issues using enormous amounts of their tax dollars: they almost universally say, "No."
2. Cleanup: While the Trump Administration is working to undermine ongoing cleanup efforts at LANL, the NMED /DOE Consent Order was drastically curtailed in 2016, before Trump took office. The revised order allows the lab to delay cleanup at the 63 acre Area G legacy waste dump, claiming that other areas have a more urgent need for cleanup. Further, the order recommends an engineered cover or "cap and cover" remedy, similar to what was done at the devastatingly contaminated Rocky Flats pit factory after it was permanently shut down for committing environmental crimes following a raid by the FBI. While "cap and cover" could be somewhat cheaper than other proven and viable methods which would actually contain the radioactive and toxic waste, it could also permanently threaten the environment, including the subterranean water source.
For the sake of future generations, we urge you to use your powerful positions in the Senate, to do whatever is necessary to obtain sufficient funding from the DOE to begin cleanup at the Area G legacy dump site immediately, concurrently with other cleanup projects, in spite of the weak and unenforceable Consent Order. Real comprehensive cleanup at Area G would create many jobs for poverty-stricken New Mexico and more importantly serve the well-being of future generations.
3. Economy: The last subject we would like you to address on behalf of Taoseños is the idea of LANL's economic impact on New Mexico and Northern New Mexico in particular. Recently, LANL released a widely published statement, claiming that LANL has a $3.1 billion impact on the state of New Mexico. The study was commissioned and funded by LANL to estimate its economic impacts on the State of New Mexico.
The study is flawed, however, as it is not a cost-benefit analysis. It provides information about money going into LANL, or cost, but fails to demonstrate specifically how the people in the state benefit from all of that taxpayer money. In real terms, New Mexico's economy continues to decline or at best, flatline, while hitting a new low in child poverty. Los Alamos County, on the other hand, has gotten richer, and remains one of the wealthiest and healthiest counties in the United States. So, one question is, how can we account for this disparity?
In the interest of a peaceful and sustainable future for all, we thank you and look forward to your responses.
"The atomic weapons race and the secrecy surrounding it crushed American democracy. It induced us to conduct government according to lies. It distorted justice. It undermined American morality," Stewart Udall (in a 1993 interview with The New York Times ).

Texto completo: CHAMPAIGN -- The Champaign Urbana Ballet's production of "Swan Lake" delves into the passion of love -- and its potential for tragedy.
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky composed "Swan Lake" in 1875 and 1876, with its story based on several different tales.
It was not an immediate success, but is now considered one of the greatest ballets of all time.
And it is also one of the most challenging for those dancing on stage, its technical precision and physical demands.
There have been several CU Ballet "Swan Lake" productions in the past.
In this edition, Lauren Frost dances the role of deceptive daughter Black Swan.
Her exhausting schedule means she practices 30 hours a week -- while she's not at Parkland College studying criminal justice.
She may be the first cop ever who could knock down a criminal with a well-placed and graceful kick.
Frost said learning to dance involves first one muscle, then another.
"It all comes together like a puzzle," Frost explained.
Eventually, the entire body is artful in its strength.
She needs her stamina.
"This part is very intense," she said. "It's like a marathon."
Her role requires a sequence of 32 straight turns on one leg, called fouettes.
A New York Times dance writer calls it "the most notorious step in the ballet repertory."
As in the movie "Black Swan," Frost said dancers pay a price for the part, with tortured feet -- sometimes even bleeding.
She performs the dance with Elijah Ochs, the Champaign Central senior who dances the part of Prince Siegfried, whose 21st birthday -- the time of life for him to find a bride -- opens the ballet.
It means that he is on the stage for every act.
Both Frost and Ochs agree they have to learn time management to keep juggling, successfully, school and performance.
All those hours of practice together are probably more comfortable for Frost and Ochs than might otherwise be -- they're a couple in real life.
"I like that the ballet touches on different emotions, love, betrayal ..." Ochs said.
The White Swan Odette is performed by Ashlynn Brown, a junior at Normal Community High School.
She doesn't mind the nearly 60-mile commute.
"What I like most about the CU Ballet is the environment and support and encouragement from the staff," Brown said.
"They want you to be the best you can be as a dancer, but they are also teaching life lessons and how to be responsible, reliable and accountable."
Ochs also dances with this swan/lover.
"Dancing as Odette is a very exciting role that involves lots of partnering work with the Prince, which is very fun but also a lot of hard work. My job as Odette is to portray emotion, so that the audience believes her to be so very soft and delicate," Brown said.
Odette has been enchanted by evil sorcerer Von Rothbart to be a swan by day, with the curse only to be broken by winning a true love, which is where Siegfried comes in.
Certainly for CU Ballet's company of dancers, the technical challenge of Swan Lake's choreography sets it apart from other ballets. Besides the magnificence of Tchaikovsky's music and the skill of the dancers, there are additional visual treats.
Artistic Director Deanna Doty transforms the girls into a flock of swans in custom tutus she designed, as well as crossbows for the prince and his courtiers.

Trump is a liar. Why won't (most) news outlets say so?

Texto completo: 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the referees."
Admittedly, that is not quite how the famous line from Shakespeare's "Henry VI" goes. It was actually the lawyers whose demise was proposed.
But though no one is known to have uttered the words above, they still neatly encompass the strategy long used against the so-called "liberal media." Namely, undermine them - and thus, their ability to act as arbiters of truth - with relentless attacks on their credibility.
No less an authority than conservative pundit Charlie Sykes admitted as much to journalist Oliver Darcy. in 2016. "We've basically eliminated any of the referees, the gatekeepers," he said of himself and his conservative colleagues.
Sykes spoke during the 2016 campaign, when people were still stunned at the barrage of untruths spewing from the Republican candidate.
"We've created this monster," said Sykes, adding that "at a certain point, you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible (news) outlet out there. And I am feeling, to a certain extent, that we are reaping the whirlwind at that."
In related news, Donald Trump told the 10,000th lie of his presidency Friday. This, according to The Washington Post. The paper's Fact Checker team, whose purpose "is to 'truth squad' the statements of political figures," maintains a database of all the times Trump has exaggerated, distorted or misled.
Ten thousand.
There ought to be a statue, or something. And what does Trump lie about? Pretty much everything.
He lies about the border wall, claiming it is now being built. It isn't.
He lies about his tax cut, claiming it was the biggest in history. It wasn't.
He lies about the Mueller report, claiming it exonerates him. It doesn't.
Indeed, the very same weekend he notched his dubious milestone, Trump told a particularly gruesome whopper about supposed legislation empowering a new mother and her doctor to "determine whether or not they will execute the baby."
The New York Times called this flaming canard "inaccurate," which raised something of a stink on Twitter. That's not surprising. Calling that hogwash "inaccurate" is like saying the Titanic was "delayed."
The Times is not alone; most news organizations have resisted calling Trump's lies lies. Their reasoning, it must be conceded, is thoughtful. After all, to call something a lie is to impose judgment. Sometimes, when people are incorrect, it's not a lie, only a mistake.
But 10,000 times in a little over two years? How gullible must you be to believe someone could be that wrong that often by accident? If any other man told you half that many untruths, you'd call him a liar. You wouldn't hesitate. Yet here, we do.
It sets an extraordinary precedent, yes, for a news organization to brand a president a liar. But these are extraordinary times, and a liar, brazen and inveterate, is precisely what Trump is. In their refusal to call him that, in their insistence upon giving him the benefit of nonexistent doubt, news media compromise their prime directive, which is to present a picture of the world as it is.
That's something we can ill afford with the very idea of truth under attack and the need for news media to do their jobs arguably more critical than ever.
This is a time for forthrightness, yet too often journalists are anything but, from coverage of race, to climate change to this, as the newspaper of record dubs a grotesque lie merely "inaccurate."
Maybe all the effort that conservatives put into neutering the referees was a waste of time. Seems the referees have done a fair job of neutering themselves.

Texto completo: "He opened up so much
great music to so many people. He had his finger on the pulse every step of the way."
Detroit filmmaker Tony D'Annunzio, who came to know Russ Gibb while making the 2012 documentary "Louder Than Love," chronicling Grande history
Russ Gibb, the farsighted arts lover and entrepreneur who helped ignite Detroit's live rock scene, died Tuesday in Garden City after a series of medical struggles. The longtime Dearborn resident was 87.
Gibb – a larger-than-life character known to local music fans as "Uncle Russ" – transformed the Grande Ballroom into Detroit's psychedelic-rock palace in 1966, a game-changing move that launched an indelible chapter in Detroit music history. It was just one hallmark in a colorful life that included decades as a beloved video-production teacher at Dearborn High School.
Gibb, who had been battling health issues the past several years, was rushed Tuesday afternoon to Garden City Hospital after suffering respiratory distress while at the Heartland rehabilitation center in Dearborn Heights. He died Tuesday evening at the hospital, said Andy Fradkin, a former student of Gibb who held power of attorney.
The gregarious, quick-witted Gibb was forever a young soul: He was in his mid-30s – notably older than much of his clientele – when he leased the Grande on Detroit's west side and turned it into the city's hippie-era rock mecca, helping nurture the careers of homegrown bands such as the MC5, the Stooges, Alice Cooper and Ted Nugent while putting visitors like Led Zeppelin, Cream, the Who and the Grateful Dead onstage for the city's ravenous rock audience.
He'd been savvy enough to get in on the rock 'n' roll game early, staging sock hops at area schools in the early '60s and working as a disc jockey.
"Detroit has a beat: the pounding out of fenders, the pounding of bumpers, the day-by-day grind that made us," Gibb told the Free Press in 2003. "You had to have the beat, because even on the line, things came through with a rhythm. Every three or four minutes, that line would move and you'd have to pound on the hubcaps. There was always a rhythm to Detroit."
Gibb was on the air at WKNR-FM in October 1969 when a listener called to discuss rumors, then circulating on the underground, that Beatle Paul McCartney had died. Gibb gleefully took up the discussion on his show, pushing the story into the limelight and ultimately helping kick off a cottage industry of "Paul is dead" conspiracy theories based on clues from Beatles lyrics and imagery.
But Gibb's impact in metro Detroit loomed far larger than his role in that prank, as artists and former Dearborn High students attested Tuesday night.
"My dear old friend Russ Gibb has departed this earth. He will be sorely missed. He was one of a kind," tweeted Wayne Kramer of the MC5, the raucous Downriver group that became the Grande's house band.
"He's always been a people person," said Fradkin, a student of Gibb in the '90s and now an executive with Ford Motor Co. "He's grown people, he's developed people, he's helped people. He didn't have a family of his own, but throughout the years, through his teaching and activities, he built a family of people through teaching video at Dearborn High."
The Grande, a ballroom built in the 1920s, was a mattress warehouse when Gibb leased it in 1966. He'd been inspired by a recent trip to San Francisco, where old Detroit friend and fellow disc jockey Jim Dunbar introduced Gibb to that city's budding counterculture epicenter, the Fillmore.
"(We) go into this place, and for the first time in my life I see hundreds of long-haired people, the bell-bottoms. I look up at wall and it's crawling with pictures – projectors and a strobe light. I was totally blown away by this thing," Gibb recounted in 2003. "Somewhere in the evening, Jim says, 'Come meet Bill.' It was (rock impresario) Bill Graham. A very smart man: He knew when you've got the media, you treat 'em kindly. So we were ushered into his office. I told him, 'This is a terrific place. I do sock hops, but Detroit has no place like this.'"
Within months, Gibb had leased the Grande, purchased a strobe light from a California hippie recommended by Graham, and opened the doors with an MC5 show – for "60 or 70 kids," as Gibb recalled.
The Grande Ballroom was soon Detroit's go-to rock destination, and under Gibb's operation through 1969, the venue hosted a mouth-watering array of national acts along with the who's-who of Detroit rock. Gibb's ballroom was hippie flower-power with a flex of Detroit muscle, and it became the scene of landmark moments, including the recording of the MC5's influential debut album, "Kick Out the Jams," and the launch of the Who's "Tommy" tour.
"Before that, we had Motown and the local groups," said longtime friend Steve Kott. "He was bringing in the MC5 and the West Coast bands – people you didn't know about unless you were really hip. He started it all. He really changed the music scene for Detroit."
Detroit filmmaker Tony D'Annunzio came to know Gibb while making the 2012 documentary "Louder Than Love," chronicling Grande history.
"He opened up so much great music to so many people," said D'Annunzio. "He had his finger on the pulse every step of the way."
Gibb's music-industry forays didn't end when he divested from the Grande in 1969. A year after Woodstock, he was a partner in the August 1970 Goose Lake International Music Festival in Jackson County, west of Detroit, where a crowd estimated at 200,000 took in artists such as Bob Seger, the Faces, Jethro Tull and others.
The Grande earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places last year, thanks largely to a campaign by the group Friends of the Grande. Leo Early, who spearheaded the effort, wrote late Tuesday: "It might not have made that list were it not for Russ' dreams realized and the scene that sprouted from them."
While Gibb certainly carved his place in Detroit rock, thanks to a combo of cultural intuition and unapologetic ambition, his real legacy may have been with his students at Dearborn High.
Just as he was in the 1960s, Gibb remained ahead of the curve. The lava lamp in his school office may have been a relic, but he was tuned in and turned on to the latest innovations bubbling up — and as ever, he let young people take the lead. A 1999 New York Times article documented the latest project developed by his tech-savvy students: a mobile webcam that let teens stream their daily activities to classmates.
Many of Gibb's students stayed in close contact through the years – even reuniting each December – after time in his classes, from which he retired in the mid-2000s.
"It started with a simple camera and microphone, and became a world-class program that produced Hollywood directors and people in other industries," said Fradkin. "Ultimately, he thought of himself as a facilitator, where kids ran the class and operations, and he was more of the magic behind the curtain to bring it all together."
Gibb's mark on Detroit rock was "a whole different chapter," Fradkin said. "That's what he was very well known for. But he always preferred to talk about his teaching and the kids. That was always his focus later on."

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand unveiled a plan Wednesday to provide each voter a credit of up to $600 to donate to federal political candidates of their choice in their state.
Gillibrand, a Democratic presidential candidate from New York, said her "Democracy Dollars" program is aimed at getting big money out of politics by making politicians less reliant on wealthy donors.
If enacted, Gillibrand's plan — which is based in part on a program in Seattle — would allow voters to request a credit of up to $200 each for House, Senate and presidential race, with the money equally split between primaries and general elections.
Politicians would only be eligible for the contributions if they voluntarily limit themselves to maximum individual donations of more than $200, well under current federal contribution limits.
"My Clean Elections plan is a critical structural change that gets big money and special interests out of politics, and ensures that elected officials in Washington are beholden only to the people who sent them there," Gillibrand said in a statement.
Gillibrand's plan comes as she struggles to gain traction in the 2020 presidential race.
Public-opinion polls, including a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday, have put her near the bottom of the crowded Democratic primary race.
And she has not yet surpassed the 65,000 individual donors needed to qualify for Democratic debates, though she will likely qualify based on her having at least 1 percent support in more than three polls, according to The New York Times.
The first Democratic debates are scheduled for June 26 and 27.
Gillibrand's election plan calls for allowing voters to spend their credit in $10 increments. She told NBC News the credit could only be used in a voter's home state, though they would be able to spend it on House races in their state but outside their home district.
"It will change who has a seat at the table and who gets elected in this country within one election cycle," Gillibrand told NBC.
Gillibrand was first appointed New York's junior senator in 2009 after former Sen. Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.
She was re-elected to her second full term last year.
Presidential hopeful Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand visited with college students and supporters in Denison, Iowa, on April 19.

Texto completo: Joe Calderone knows a thing or two about pizza.
Calderone has owned Joe Daddy's Pizza on Del Prado Boulevard North in Cape Coral since 2010, and he's scheduled to open a second location in the Publix plaza at Pine Island Road and Veterans Parkway this summer.
Joe Daddy's is famous for its unique style: lighter pies with crisp, airy crusts.
"The technical name of it is Neapolitan pizza," Calderone said. "But most people never heard of Neapolitan pizza. New York is famous for it. Other places around the country will do it if they have the skillset, but most don't."
So, what's it take to make a good Neapolitan pizza?
"There's a process to get the pie to come out light and fluffy and still have substance, where you can actually hold it and it's not just a cracker crust on the bottom," Calderone said.
"It's still got to be brown on the bottom but not burnt."
He should know. Calderon spent three years working in a New Jersey pizzeria as a teenager, watching the pizza makers closely and soaking up their knowledge.
"I worked for a bunch of guys from Italy, and they had the process down pretty well," he said. "I'm pretty sure I've taken what they've taught me, and I've brought it to the next level. That wasn't an easy task."
Though Calderone was destined to make good pizza, he wasn't always in the pizza business. Soon after he started college, his father died, leaving Calderone and his two younger brothers, who were 7 and 11 at the time
"It was like throwing five bags of cement at me and saying: 'Carry them.'"
He dropped out of college and took a job as a meter reader, which he did for the next seven years. Then he became a tool-and-die maker for the next 30 years.
"I got tired of it," he said of reaching the end of his tool-and-die career.
"I figured, people didn't always need their molds made, but they needed to eat."
Calderone wanted his own pizza place, he said, but he never had the guts to pull the trigger. Until he'd finally had enough. That's when he launched Joe Daddy's, right in the middle of the recession.
"We opened at the height of the foreclosure market," he said, "which was a tough thing to do. It was like I stuck a screwdriver straight through my head and could see it come out the other side. But I had this driving confidence that I could make really good pizza."
His confidence was spot-on.
In a market crowded with pizzerias, Joe Daddy's has not only survived, it's thrived.
"We put our customers first," Calderone said.
"We know almost all of our customers on a first-name basis. People want good food, but they also want to be treated kindly and with respect. If you can provide a quality product with an atmosphere that's light and kindhearted, people really don't ask for much more."
Plus, it helps that he has an undeniable passion for pizza.
"I personally think pizza is the most beautiful food in the world. When people eat pizza, they immediately become happy. I don't know any other food that makes people as happy when they eat it."
Calderone has been serving happy customers for nearly a decade, and now with two locations he intends to keep the pies — and that good feeling — going.

Texto completo: Demand better of media Well, the Mueller report is completed and The Washington Post, New York Times, Associated Press, Daily Herald and all Democrats are upset because the findings do not match the incorrect stories they have been publishing for the past almost three years. Now they are scrambling to cherry-pick bits, pieces and phrases from the report in an attempt to justify their false reporting.
The fact is that the report found 25 Russians and three companies were charged with trying to interfere with the 2016 presidential election without the assistance of any Americans. They also found that the Obama administration was aware of this back then but failed to do anything about it.
Perhaps this should have been reported as big news back then as well as now. Perhaps the headline on the Daily Herald Opinion page should be "We must do better" rather than "We must demand better." Our citizens need to demand better of the media.
Daryl G. Pratt Arlington Heights Disney’s executive compensation outrage Kudos to Abigail Disney for making herself heard regarding the compensation paid to Disney CEO Bob Iger.
When the new tax plan was passed giving big business huge tax breaks, it was supposed to enable corporations to raise the salaries of everyone working for them. Instead, some companies gave one-time bonuses, others gave small salary increases to those who kept the business running every day and used the money to provide more dividends for stockholders. When a CEO is paid over 1,000 times as much as the average employee, there is something wrong with our system.
How many millions does one person need to make to feed his ego, while employees struggle to hold their families together? Minimum wage is a farce. It’s time we took a good look at employee compensation, including company medical coverage.
Thank you, Ms. Disney, for having the courage to step forward on this issue. I think your grandfather would be proud.

Texto completo: Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions, which the couple launched last year, has partnered with Netflix for a slate of projects that include scripted and unscripted shows as well as full-length features and documentaries.
"We created Higher Ground to harness the power of storytelling," the former president said. "Touching on issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more, we believe each of these productions won't just entertain, but will educate, connect and inspire us all."
Some of the projects are:
"American Factory," about a Chinese-owned factory in post-industrial Ohio; "Bloom," an upstairs/downstairs drama series set in the world of fashion in post-WWII New York that depicts barriers faced by women and by people of color; a feature film adaptation of author David W. Blight's "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom," for which he won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in History; "Overlooked," an adaptation of The New York Times "Overlooked" obituary column, about deaths unreported by the paper; "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents," a half-hour preschool series; "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," a nonfiction series that will portray the importance of unheralded work done by everyday heroes guiding our government; "Crip Camp," a documentary about a 1970s summer camp for teenagers with disabilities.
Higher Ground has made a point of focusing on stories that reflect a range of "interests and experiences" but are "relevant to our daily lives," Michelle Obama said. "We think there's something here for everyone - moms and dads, curious kids, and anyone simply looking for an engaging, uplifting watch at the end of a busy day."

Women unite: Typically, female country artists only get one or two slots on a tour or festival. But on Carrie Underwood's Cry Pretty Tour 360, six women will be behind the mic throughout the show. Underwood picked duo Maddie & Tae and trio Runaway June to open for her arena tour that starts Wednesday in Greensboro, N.C. The seven-time Grammy winner says it's a great time for women to come together and support each other.
Cave boys: Netflix announced it will join with the "Crazy Rich Asians" production company (SK Global Entertainment) to make a film about last July's dramatic rescue of 12 village boys in northern Thailand who were trapped with their soccer coach in a flooded cave for more than two weeks.
Wango Taylor: Taylor Swift has been added to the lineup of the iHeartRadio Wango Tango concert June 1 in Carson, Calif. She will also open Wednesday's Billboard Music Awards with a performance of her new single, "ME!" Ryan Seacrest hosts Wango Tango, which will also feature the Jonas Brothers, Halsey, 5 Seconds of Summer, Zedd, Ally Brooke, Tyga, Ava Max, Fletcher and TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

Texto completo: Sometimes, New Mexico can't help but snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.
Three years ago, New Mexico won a national competition to bring Facebook to our state. Facebook agreed to build its new data center in Los Lunas, and in exchange, New Mexico promised the company that the state would upgrade its electric grid to power the complex with 100% renewable energy.
The agreement was a victory for everyone involved, especially New Mexico. Facebook would get the best deal possible for its new data center and invest $1 billion in the project. New Mexico would gain millions in tax revenue from the economic activity spun-off from the data center. And everyone would benefit from upgraded transmission infrastructure that would bring more renewable energy online.
Facebook delivered on its side of the deal and more. In 2017, it announced it was tripling the size of the complex, creating hundreds of long-term jobs for New Mexicans and spurring an economic boom in Valencia County.
But being New Mexico, state regulators couldn't let a good thing go untouched. Last week, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission voted 5-0 to force Facebook to pay half the costs for a transmission line to its new data center in Los Lunas. These costs were not part of Facebook's original agreement with the state to build the facility. The future of the entire project is now in jeopardy thanks to the PRC's "gotcha" decision.
Within days of the PRC's action, newspapers across the country, including the New York Times, ran headlines declaring, "New Mexico Panel Blindsides Facebook with $39M Utility Bill."
While I am hopeful that the parties involved will eventually resolve this dispute, it will be too late to take back the negative headlines. The damage is done. Companies and investors across the country have now been warned: New Mexico writes its contracts with erasable ink.
Of course, the blame game began well in advance of the PRC's vote. Both the PRC and the state's largest utility company, PNM, pointed fingers at each other. The reality is that the PRC and PNM have long maintained an adversarial relationship, and now Facebook is caught in the crossfire.
Regardless of the who-what-when-and whys of this decision, the ugliness of the ongoing feud between the PRC and PNM has unavoidably compromised New Mexico's future ability to attract more big projects to the state. What business will want to make a deal with state negotiators knowing that they could be sent a surprise $39 million bill afterward?
If New Mexico is to realize its vision of creating a vibrant economy and good opportunities for our workers, we must rise above these petty squabbles about regulatory technicalities and focus on our larger goals.
We'll never achieve our dreams if we keep repeating the same self-sabotaging actions that have kept us in the economic cellar for decades.
When Facebook announced it was tripling the size of its data center, a local carpenter who had been unemployed for six months before being hired to work on the Facebook project, said, "Facebook has been my oasis in the desert. I was questioning my future in New Mexico."
Now it's Facebook's turn to question its future in New Mexico. The PRC's inflexible attitude in this case misses the forest for the trees. The reputational damage from their action is now part of our state's brand. This is why New Mexico can't have nice things.

Texto completo: Obamas unveil projects for Netflix
Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions, which the couple launched last year, has partnered with Netflix for a slate of projects that include scripted and unscripted shows as well as full-length features and documentaries.
"We created Higher Ground to harness the power of storytelling," the former president said. "Touching on issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more, we believe each of these productions won't just entertain, but will educate, connect and inspire us all."
Some of the projects are:
"American Factory," about a Chinese-owned factory in post-industrial Ohio; "Bloom," an upstairs/downstairs drama series set in the world of fashion in post-WWII New York that depicts barriers faced by women and by people of color; a feature film adaptation of author David W. Blight's "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom," for which he won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in History; "Overlooked," an adaptation of The New York Times "Overlooked" obituary column, about deaths unreported by the paper; "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents," a half-hour preschool series; "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," a nonfiction series that will portray the importance of unheralded work done by everyday heroes guiding our government; "Crip Camp," a documentary about a 1970s summer camp for teenagers with disabilities.
Higher Ground has made a point of focusing on stories that reflect a range of "interests and experiences" but are "relevant to our daily lives," Michelle Obama said. "We think there's something here for everyone - moms and dads, curious kids, and anyone simply looking for an engaging, uplifting watch at the end of a busy day."

Texto completo: The House Judiciary Committee is going "way over the top" with the terms of this week's hearing with Attorney General William Barr, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Monday.
Barr is set to testify about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees this week, but his appearance before the House panel is in jeopardy over a disagreement about the parameters.
In an interview with Fox News, Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said his counterpart in the House, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., is going too far by demanding Barr be subject not only to member questions but also queries from each party's counsel in a second round of questioning.
With the Justice Department warning Nadler that Barr could back out of the hearing, Graham said, "I can understand his concern."
"What the House is doing is way over the top. Mueller is the final word on this," Graham said. "I fought like hell to make sure Mueller could do his job without interference. I introduced legislation so that he couldn’t be fired without cause."
Tweet
Noting how Mueller found no conspiracy between President Trump's 2016 campaign and the Kremlin, Graham added, "This is political revenge. The House is on a witch hunt — truly a witch hunt to try to make something out of nothing."
Trump often called Mueller's investigation a "witch hunt."
Barr released a four-page summary of Mueller's report last month, days after the special counsel investigation came to a close, which said Mueller did not find evidence of conspiracy. The summary also took a partial quote from Mueller that said he did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed justice. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined no such crime had been committed.
Barr's summary has come under heavy scrutiny. Following the redacted release of Mueller's report, the New York Times published an analytical piece comparing excerpts from Barr's summary to Mueller's findings. Critics have slammed Barr's decision to hold a press conference as a ploy to spin the special counsel's findings and pointed to instances in the past in which he wrote summaries they view as obscuring the truth.
Democrats have rallied around the report, which lays out nearly a dozen instances of possible obstruction of justice and signals the question should be left up to Congress to answer, as a cornerstone for more investigations into the president.
Barr is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Despite Barr's opposition to answering counsel questions, Nadler is moving ahead with the plan.
“The witness is not going to tell the committee how to conduct its hearing, period,” Nadler told CNN on Sunday. If Barr does not comply, Nadler said, "Then we will have to subpoena him, and we will have to use whatever means we can to enforce the subpoena."

THE REPERCUSSIONS OF SHUTTING DOWN SOCIAL MEDIA INTERNET BLACKOUTS DO NOT REDUCE VIOLENCE, BUT RATHER FUEL IT

Texto completo: In the wake of a series of coordinated attacks that claimed more than 250 lives on April 21, the government of Sri Lanka shut off its residents' access to social media and online messaging systems, including Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Snapchat and Viber. The official government concern was that "false news reports were spreading through social media."
Some commentators applauded the move, suggesting the dangers of disinformation on social media justified shutting down communication networks in times of crisis. Five years of research on the impact of shutdowns and other information controls on societies worldwide have led me to the exact opposite conclusion.
A diverse community of academics, businesses and civil society groups shares my view. The blackouts deprived Sri Lankans of impartial news reports and disconnected families from each other as they sought to find out who had survived and who was among the dead and injured. Most strikingly, recent research suggests that the blackouts might have increased the potential for protest and violence in the wake of the attacks.
A constellation of control
Sri Lanka's latest social media shutdown was not an isolated incident. The first time Sri Lanka took a similar action was amid violent unrest in 2018. It was one of 188 network shutdowns or large-scale disruptions to digital communication that year all around the world, according to the digital rights advocacy organization Access Now.
Overall, since the Arab Spring began in 2010, governments have carried out at least 400 shutdowns across more than 40 countries. Those include hundreds of ephemeral shutdowns in India, where they first emerged as a localized response to unrest in the northern region of Kashmir and subsequently spread to most other states.
The number also includes so-called "digital sieges," which last for weeks or months at a time. For example, long-lasting, government-imposed blackouts have ravaged burgeoning digital economies such as that of Anglophone Cameroon and have disconnected businesses, relatives and communities in Chad for more than a year.
In study after study, civil society organizations have documented the human rights problems caused by internet shutdowns and the economic damage they produce.
Only recently have researchers begun to ask a more fundamental question: Do massive disruptions to digital communication achieve their intended purposes? Sri Lanka's government is one of many to publicly claim that the goal in severing communication links is to prevent the spread of disinformation and decrease violence based on those falsehoods - but not a single one has followed a shutdown with any sort of evidence that it worked to protect public safety.
Exploring the (dis)connection
Of course, the coexistence of social media and social turbulence does not necessarily imply that one causes the other. Many scholars have tried to figure out if there is a link between access to social media and violence, but it's an extremely difficult task.
For one thing, social media websites and services are always changing how their systems work, making them hard to study over time. Connectivity also advances at a lightning-fast pace: In 2018, for instance, internet penetration in rural India increased at an annual rate of 30%, connecting hundreds of millions of people for the first time. Today, roughly three Indian citizens are introduced to the internet every second.
Shutdowns, however, are fixed in time and space, and their effects blanket large swaths of an area's population. This lets scholars study their effects with more confidence. Paradoxically, then, one of the best methods of evaluating technology's effects on society may be to examine what happens when communications are suddenly cut off.
Research on early blackouts has shown that Egypt's disappearance from the global internet in 2011 backfired spectacularly, spreading protesters away from Tahrir Square and into numerous decentralized pockets of resistance. Coordination of the demonstrations swiftly moved from Facebook event pages to individual efforts in each neighborhood. This proved impossible for security forces to subdue. Ten days later, the Mubarak regime fell.
In the Syrian Civil War, the government used shutdowns as a weapon of war, following up with increased violence against civilians. In Africa, authoritarian governments that own the communication infrastructure and leaders who rule in virtual perpetuity are more inclined to pull the plug, but there is no evidence to suggest that shutdowns are effective in discouraging street protest or violent unrest.
Indeed, official explanations for shutdowns - if the government acknowledges them at all - are often at odds with their likely true motivations, which include silencing opposition figures and ensuring a state monopoly on information during contentious elections. In the midst of a crisis, this leaves the government as the only official gatekeeper of information. That becomes especially problematic when the government itself becomes a conduit for false and potentially harmful news, as was the case when Sri Lankan media circulated police reports that falsely identified a student at Brown University as a terrorist following the recent attack.
What happens withouta connection?
Protests are not monolithic forces, and their participants can adapt to changing circumstances - including a sudden lack of information and even a blockage of communication and coordination. The global proliferation of shutdowns and rapid improvements in data about protests and conflicts enable researchers to analyze not only whether protests continue during internet blackouts, but also how they shift and change.
In India, state governments have faced thousands of peaceful demonstrations, as well as episodes of violent unrest. The country has become by far the world's most prolific executor of deliberate internet blackouts over the last several years.
To find out the role of internet access in these events, I used precise, daily-level data on thousands of protests that occurred in the 36 states and Union Territories of India in 2016, as well as data tracking the location, timing and duration of shutdowns from a variety of cross-referenced news sources and civil society groups.
The results were striking: Under a blackout, each successive day of protest had more violence than would typically happen as a protest unfolded with continued internet access. Meanwhile, the effects of shutdowns on peaceful demonstrations, which are usually more likely to rely on careful coordination through digital channels, were ambiguous and inconsistent. In no scenario were blackouts consistently linked to reduced levels of protest over the course of several days. Instead of curtailing protest, they seemed to encourage a tactical shift to strategies that are less orderly, more chaotic and more violent.
Darkness is a phone call away
Recent events only seem to confirm these dynamics. The regimes of Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Algeria and Omar al-Bashir in Sudan both resorted to shutdowns before imploding. The drastic measures did nothing to rein in the protests in either country. Instead, shutting off internet access may have accelerated their downfalls.
Even if shutdowns are ineffective, they can be tempting for governments that need to be seen taking action. Vague and often antiquated laws let them implement drastic measures like shutdowns easily and quickly, with a written order or even a simple phone call. But every time a government uses the tactic, it makes others more likely to follow suit - in the same country and around the world. The evidence shows that this takes a heavy toll on their citizens, both economically and in terms of human rights, without offering them any additional protection or safety.

HOW NOT TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE TRUMP MADE HAM-HANDED ATTEMPTS TO IMPEDE MUELLER, BUT THEY ALL BACKFIRED

Texto completo: There are many ways to understand Special Counsel Robert Mueller's long-anticipated report. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="6137">
It confirms, for anyone left doubting, that Russia did indeed meddle in the 2016 election. It did not find evidence showing that President Donald Trump and his associates engaged in any criminal conspiracy with Russia in their meddling. And it suggests reasonable legal minds can differ on whether the president could be indicted over obstructing that investigation.
Most of all it paints a picture of a president woefully out of his depth in his first months on the job. Far from being devious, Mr. Mueller portrays Mr. Trump as a bumbling bully, cajoling and pressuring his underlings to no avail.
He asks his deputy national security adviser, KT McFarland, to draft a statement saying he did not order Michael Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador. He orders White House counsel Don McGahn to shut down Mr. Mueller's investigation. My favorite example is an incident where Mr. Trump requests his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, to tell his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to un-recuse himself from the Russia investigation.
When a competent and corrupt boss urges subordinates to cross ethical or legal lines, they comply, sealing a corrupt bond. For Mr. Trump though, the subordinates declined, demurred or flat out refused. Mr. McGahn threatened to resign, and Mr. Trump backed down. Mr. Lewandowski fobbed off his errand to an underling, who ended up ignoring the order. Ms. McFarland made it known that she felt uncomfortable drafting a statement she didn't know to be true.
All of this is relevant to the open questions raised but not answered by Mr. Mueller's report regarding obstruction of justice. Mr. Mueller details 10 incidents that may have risen to the level of obstruction, but makes no judgment on the president's culpability. He is neither indicted nor exonerated.
This obscures the central fact that all of Mr. Trump's attempts to influence the Russia investigation backfired. He dictates a false press release on the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer and his senior campaign team. Then The New York Times publishes the actual emails promising dirt on Hillary Clinton to set up that ill-fated meeting.
Mr. Trump fires FBI director James Comey expecting to take the pressure of the Russia investigation off of himself. The president ends up setting into motion the events that lead deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to appoint Mr. Mueller as special counsel. Mr. Comey himself testified under oath in 2017 that, after his firing, he leaked his personal memos detailing his awkward conversations with Mr. Trump in the hopes that it would prompt a special counsel investigation. Mr. Comey got his wish.
Much of this comes down to Mr. Trump's decision, shortly after taking office, to retain and try to influence the FBI director he had inherited from the Obama administration. In this case, Mr. Trump ignored most of his senior advisers. According to Mr. Mueller's report, at a dinner with Mr. Trump and senior advisers on Jan. 26, 2017, the president asked the room what they made of the FBI director. According to Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, "no one openly advocated terminating Comey, but the consensus on him was not positive." Other sources that worked on the Trump transition team tell me that Flynn urged Mr. Trump to fire him before taking office.
Mr. Coats however had a different view. According to the report, he thought Mr. Comey was a "good director." He encouraged Mr. Trump to "meet Comey face-to-face and spend time with him before making a decision about whether to retain him."
This turned out to be terrible advice for someone like Mr. Trump. The next day, the president invited Mr. Comey to a one-on-one dinner, where - according to Mr. Comey's notes from that time - Mr. Trump proceeded to act like a Tammany Hall boss. He tells Mr. Comey that he needs his loyalty. Mr. Trump asks him if he likes his job. After he fires Flynn, Mr. Trump asks Mr. Comey to go easy on his former national security adviser. All the while, Mr. Comey takes notes on the exchanges and assures Mr. Trump privately that he is not a target of the Russia probe.
Imagine if Mr. Trump had heeded Flynn's advice and fired Mr. Comey instead of clumsily trying to charm and bully him. Back then it would have been a shrewd maneuver. Many Democrats were still seething at Mr. Comey for reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server two weeks before the election. Remember Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer saying he lost confidence in Mr. Comey only days before Americans voted in 2016 for president.
It was only after Mr. Trump announced that he had fired his FBI director because of the Russia investigation that the near two-year probe into his obstruction of justice began. And despite his threats, and even attempts, Mr. Trump never really succeeds at impeding it. The closest he came was to refuse a live interview with Mr. Mueller's team, on advice of his lawyers. And while Mr. Trump rages about "rats" and muses about pardons, every nasty tweet and gaffe-laden interview becomes fodder for Mr. Mueller's lawyers to analyze.
Now that Mr. Mueller has concluded his investigation without showing criminal conspiracy between Mr. Trump and Russia, the folly of Mr. Trump's scheming is apparent. Had he just fired Mr. Comey in January 2017 and kept his mouth shut, Mr. Trump might still have faced an investigation over ties to Russia, but he could have avoided extending and expanding that so it became a nearly-two-year inquest into possible obstruction of justice as well. Instead, through incompetence and vanity, Mr. Trump became an author of his own inquisition and handed Mr. Mueller the most damning evidence against him.

Texto completo: The New York Times recently highlighted a study published by Oxford University Press in the journal of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution that demonstrates the importance of island formation in the diversification of penguins and posits the discovery of two extinct penguin species from New Zealand.

The research was conducted by a diverse team of 19 scholars representing eight countries and 16 research institutions and universities, including Bowling Green State University.

During his sabbatical, Juan L. Bouzat, a professor in Bowling Green State University's Department of Biological Sciences, initiated collaborations at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark alongside a consortium of scholars who are uncovering the genomes of 10,000 species of birds.

This major international collaboration has helped with efforts to complete the genome sequencing of all penguin species. The New York Times article highlights just one of the outcomes of this research. Doctoral student Tess Cole from the University of Otago, New Zealand, coordinated the analysis of the mitochondrial genomes of penguins, which led to the discovery of two new subspecies of penguins in the Chatham Islands: the dwarf yellow-eyed penguin and a new crested penguin.

The appearance of these subspecies is linked to the geologic formation of their native islands, and thus provides evidence for the role of island formation in the diversification of penguins.

The study also showed that early human settlers likely played a role in the disappearance of the newly described penguin subspecies, because fossil evidence suggests these waddling birds were cooked and eaten into extinction.

"These international collaborations expand the impact of BGSU's research activities and raise BGSU's profile as a comprehensive research university in line with the BGSU's Strategic Plan recently presented by President (Rodney) Rogers," Bouzat said.

Closer to home in his lab in the biology department, Bouzat's focal research is on the population genetic diversity and potential hybridization of penguin species from South America, including the Magellanic penguin inhabiting the Patagonian shores of South America, the Humboldt penguin located in northern Chile and Peru, and the Galapagos penguin, which is restricted to the Galapagos Islands.

Using DNA technology, Bouzat's students have assessed the genetic diversity of these species, which allowed detecting signals of past demographic events, identifying breeding colonies of conservation concern, and detecting hybridization.

For example, studies by former master's student Gabrielle Arauco-Shapiro and current doctoral student Katelyn Schumacher showed that Galapagos penguins have lowered levels of genetic diversity compared to the Magellanic penguins. This is because the Galapagos region is highly impacted by variable weather patterns associated with El NiÃ±o effects, which result in the drastic decline of penguin populations.

In contrast, large populations such as those of the Magellanic penguin allow for increased genetic variability, making the species less prone to extinction.

In another research project, master's student Eric Hibbets is studying the genetic makeup of Magellanic and Humboldt penguins in a region where both species overlap. Using multiple genetic markers, Hibbets has been able to document genetic evidence of hybridization in nature, which has both evolutionary and conservation implications.

Thanks to the increasing accessibility of genome technology and the collaborative efforts of multiple research groups, Bouzat and his colleagues are ushering in the genomic era, which is changing the way researchers study the genetic diversity of wild species.

Bouzat hopes to continue hiscollaborations to expand his research program into the use of genomic technology at the population level. The sequencing of complete genomes of single species has expanded to the sequencing of multiple individuals and populations within a species.

This provides a powerful tool to examine levels of genetic diversity, past demographic events, and evolutionary responses of natural populations to anthropogenic impacts on the environment, Bouzat said.

As part of his teaching philosophy, Bouzat encourages collaboration among his doctoral, master's, and undergraduate students, who often work on and contribute to the same body of research despite having independent projects.

Bouzat motivates his students during weekly lab meetings, where updates on research and data analyses are discussed, and also works intensively with his students on the writing of their research for publication, promoting their growth as independent scientists and thus rendering them competitive candidates in their careers after graduating from BGSU.

Texto completo: Even if you’ve never heard of Lizzo, you’ve probably at least heard Lizzo.
Around this time last year, the singer, who also raps and plays the flute (we’ll get back to that in a minute), established an ubiquitous presence in commercials and TV/movie trailers. Listen to her music, and it’s easy to see why — her songs are catchy and self-assured, blending thumping bass and gospel riffs into infectious tracks that are undeniably hers. The Detroit native, who grew up in Houston, has described her music as “church with a twerk.”
Lizzo, born Melissa Viviane Jefferson, has been an underground sensation for years. She performed in indie hip-hop groups before releasing her debut album, Lizzobangers, in 2013, followed by another indie release and several EPs. But she’s courting mainstream success with her latest album, Cuz I Love You, released Friday on Atlantic, a showstopping Coachella run and an ever-expanding catalogue of songs that speak perfectly to everything from a Netflix rom-com to a line of sparkling cocktails.
Lizzo is, as they say, having a moment. She just announced a second leg of her tour, dubbed Cuz I Love You Too, to support her major-label debut.
Lizzo’s songs feel like instant song-of-the-summer contenders. Her confidence is contagious. “If I’m shinin’, everybody gonna shine,” she declares on Juice, the joyful lead single on Cuz I Love You. In Tempo, a club banger featuring Missy Elliott, Lizzo asserts that slow songs aren’t worthy of her curves. “Can’t move all of this here to one of those,” she purrs.
Her lyrics are often playful, but Lizzo has the musical chops to back them up. She’s been playing the flute since she was 10 and has worked the classical instrument into her music and stage presence. She’s a band geek at heart, having played in marching bands from middle school to the University of Houston, where she majored in classical flute performance.
Juice delightfully gave way to a parody of Anchorman’s legendary jazz flute scene.
Many of the songs that have popped into our collective atmosphere predate Cuz I Love You. Lizzo lends her 2017 breakup single Truth Hurts, to a memorable scene in Netflix’s new rom-com Someone Great, starring Jane the Virgin’s Gina Rodriguez.
Lizzo’s 2016 extended play, Coconut Oil, spawned at least two songs that went into heavy rotation. Her self-love anthem, Good as Hell, first featured in Barbershop: The Next Cut, was later heard in A Bad Moms Christmas and I Feel Pretty. A few months ago, Weight Watchers featured the soulful Worship in a campaign announcing the brand’s revamp as WW. (Cadillac has also used the song.)
Lizzo, who has been a champion of body positivity, drew some flack for the Weight Watchers ad. (“I made a commitment to feel-good music. I had to show my belly a lot of attention, a lot of love,” she told the New York Times last year.) Some fans were irked to hear Lizzo’s music being used to promote a brand built around dieting. She addressed the backlash in candid Instagram Live videos and recently called it “a learning experience.”
Lizzo’s body is the centerpiece of her new album’s cover, which features the singer nude, her long black hair cascading down her back. In a recent video, posted to her social media accounts, she smooches a cake version of herself in the stripped-down pose.
She has been open about the times she wasn’t so confident. Her father died in 2010, throwing the singer, then 21, into a deep depression. He had been her music’s biggest champion, and his death almost led her to quit.
“I was like ‘I have no reason to do this anymore because I was doing it for him,’ ” Lizzo recently told Trevor Noah. “But then I realized I have to do this for myself because he was doing it for me.”
Lizzo says she is also doing it for her fans. “I can’t wake up one day and not be black. I can’t wake up one day and not be a woman. I can’t wake up one day and not be fat,” she said in a Teen Vogue interview last year. “I always had those three things against me in this world, and because I fight for myself, I have to fight for everyone else.”
And she remains determined to share her music — and message — with the world. Over the weekend, as her Coachella set suffered from ongoing technical issues, she took matters into her own hands, performing Juice a cappella.
At one point, she reached for her flute. “If they ain’t gonna get the music right, I’m gonna get the music right,” she reportedly told the crowd.

The new breed and the old

Texto completo: HIS IS THE week of Biden and Buttigieg.

It is Joe Biden's week because he has finally declared for president, after much Hamlet-like, or feigned Hamlet-like, contemplation of the race. He is 76 and has been in politics almost all of his adult life (the U.S. Senate much of it). He has twice run for president and failed spectacularly. He served honorably and usefully as vice president under Barack Obama.

Mr. Biden's indecision about running in 2016, partly because he was in a state of deep grief over the death of his son and partly because the Democratic establishment had united behind Hillary Clinton, resulted in the nonrun that actually could have worked out. It is very possible that, had he been nominated in 2016, he would be finishing his first term now. Unlike Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden is likable. And, unlike her, he might have held the union vote in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

Such are the ironies of politics and life.

But it is hard to shake the feeling that his moment has passed and that Mr. Biden is an almost impossible fit for this moment - 2020. He is like an actor who walks on stage for the wrong play. And he keeps apologizing.

That never helps any suitor.

He is also hobbled by something that, in a rational politics, would actually help him - long experience and knowledge of the federal system. Americans like something, and somebody, new. And in a presidential race, being new and having much of the press fascinated by you is the greatest advantage imaginable.

Being the front-runner early is never a safe place to be. Ask Jeb Bush.

And that brings us to Pete Buttigieg. He is new. And the press can't take its eyes off of him. There are good reasons, too.

Mayor Pete has three things going for him. First, he has a brain. He thinks. He even thinks about rock music, the New Testament, and war. He is, for a politician, uncommonly thoughtful. This would be obvious even if he did not play the piano and speak Norwegian. Just listen to him.

Second, he conveys intellect without intellectualism. He comes off more like a soulful Methodist pastor than an Al Gore or Adlai Stevenson.

And third, he seems to be sincerely idealistic. He went from Harvard, Oxford, and McKinsey & Company to the National Guard and service in Afghanistan. (Eight years in the guard and seven months in the war.) Why? He says he simply thought people of his level of privilege should share the burden with the young men and women from the working poor (sons and daughters of deplorables) who normally make up the volunteer Army.

Back in the day, he says, a guy like John F. Kennedy or George Herbert Walker Bush was expected to serve. And that is a good standard.

True enough. But it says something profound about Mr. Buttigieg that he volunteered and that this was his rationale: of whom much has been given much should be required.

A cynic might say, "Well he knew he was going to be a politician and that war service would be helpful." But, think about it: Military service has not mattered, or mattered much, especially in the Democratic Party, for a long time now. It will not help Mr. Buttigieg appreciably in the Democratic presidential primaries. And the mayor of South Bend is nothing if not a rational actor. You do not risk your life in the hellish, unwinnable muck of Afghanistan for a line on a rÃ©sumÃ© or the theme for a 30-second commercial.

No, I believe the guy. He just might be a true servant leader. And at a moment when the nation feels weary and beat up, he is new. His appeal reminds me very much of Jimmy Carter in 1975 and Bill Clinton in 1991 and early 1992. Mr. Carter, in particular, was seen as upbeat, independent, and thoughtful. And, like those two men, Mayor Pete is also a centrist and pragmatist, not a leftist ideologue.

Of course Bill Clinton had fatal flaws, and Jimmy Carter was not prepared for the presidency. Arguably, neither was Barack Obama or JFK - two others with incredible elan and self-possession at young ages.

Being mayor of a small city, or running a failed race for state treasurer or national party chairman, does not qualify a person to be president. Joe Biden is qualified. Few people know more about foreign policy, the judiciary, and the justice system, or Congress than Mr. Biden.

He has also often been wrong. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe his mistakes are behind him. Maybe he has learned. But, mostly, he seems worn.

What a shame that the old and new cannot be combined. Alas, they cannot be. Youth must err with passion and flail and age must rage against the light it knows is dying.

Mr. Biden has a secret weapon. His heart. He has suffered. And this makes his compassion, in a party of fake compassion, real.

The boy mayor has a secret weapon, too. He can talk. He has a Reagan-like talent for direct, witty, and unvarnished communication, as when he said he recognized bait when he saw it and would not take it. He's connecting right now. And he's threatening the assumed narrative. "Rivals are scrambling to dig up dirt on Pete Buttigieg," ran one recent headline.

The New York Times published a story with this headline: "How Pete Buttigieg's Meaningless Erudition Made Him the 'Smart' Candidate."

Can erudition be meaningless?

Never mind. If I am Mayor Pete, running as champion of the heartland, the outsider who is the anti-Trump, I want The New York Times against me.

Texto completo: JOHANNESBURG - A tropical cyclone that is among the most ferocious ever to strike Africa's eastern coast continued to bring heavy rains and fierce winds to Mozambique on Friday, and there are fears that it could lead to the kind of deadly floods that devastated the country last month.
The storm, Cyclone Kenneth, destroyed scores of homes and killed at least one person in Cabo Delgado, the northern province where it made landfall Thursday evening. More than 700,000 people live in the cyclone's path, according to the United Nations, and the government has already evacuated more than 30,000.
The maximum wind speed of the cyclone weakened rapidly overnight after landing and slackened from 140 mph to 85 mph, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, as it moved north of Pemba, the provincial capital, into more sparsely populated districts.
Still, forecasters warned of an elevated risk of flooding because the clone was moving unusually slowly. The cyclone was the first of its magnitude to it Cabo Delgado in model history.
Enrique Alvare the head of the World Foodrogram's office in Pemba;aid that the city had suffered less flooding than expected, although some parts were inundated, promoting the authorities to more affected people to shelters
He praised government officials, saving they appeared to better prepared than the had been when Cyclone that hit the Beira region in central Mozambique 1st month, killing more than 1,000 people there an in Zimbabwe and Mauawi. The response in Pema, he said, was "very well organized by the government.'
Government ad aid officials, however, remained alert to the cyclone's potential to cause destruction in the coming das. Heavy rains after Cyclone Idai last month caused two rivers in the Beira region to overflow, flooding vast area and forcing people to seek helter on rooftops and in trees.

Texto completo: In this Age of Cacophony with smartphones buzzing, beeping and ringing as they relentlessly vie for our attention, it is helpful to be reminded that less can be more.
Dustin Yocum's production of "On the Exhale," a 2017 play by Mart«n Zimmerman, appears to take "less is more" as its motto and employs it to quiet, poignant effect.
The house lights dim in the 50-seat performance space at SoDo Theatre, and when the stage is illuminated, a woman (Kimmy Schofield) stands before us on compact, empty risers that comprise the acting space. For the next hour, Schofield, as the unnamed woman, tells a story that is all too familiar to us in 2019.
She begins with a paradoxically unhurried rush of words that relate an anxiety presumably felt by many teachers today. Schofield describes a man, a student, who has not gotten the grade he feels he deserves in her women's studies course.
The teacher challenges the student to consider the privilege he enjoys as a man, which women, Schofield indicates somewhat acerbically, may not. It is then the woman tells how in a "simple, subtle gesture / graceful even" the man lifts his shirt to display a holstered handgun.
The woman goes on to rhapsodize the weapon's "obsidian stare" as the situation unravels. She reports the muzzle flash, the warm flow of blood, a rusty taste in the mouth. "And then you wake up," she says. It was all a dream, a nightmare. But whose?
If you are a teacher, as many are in our community, it may be your nightmare or, perhaps, the wakeful thoughts you have when taught the strategies of "Run, Hide, Fight," now widely communicated in public institutions as reaction to shooting incidents. In "On the Exhale," however, it is, in fact, "your" nightmare.
Throughout the hour-long monologue, delivered with thoughtful, contained precision by Schofield, the speaker never refers to herself. She never says, "I," "me," "my," or "mine" when telling the story of her actions. Even when speaking about her son, Michael, she says he is the "greatest choice you've ever made."
The second-person narrative is an unusual choice, especially for a one-person play. She is not speaking of an unseen character; she is speaking directly to us. We are all in the room with her. The impact of this technique in "Exhale," however, serves almost as a mantra, drawing "you" into "your" world, even as it artfully holds you at arm's length.
Without emotional histrionics, Schofield draws us into a tale of fear, violence, loss and vengeance. There are occasional moments when direct communication with the audience is undermined by unnecessary movement, but that is a quibble.
Schofield takes us on a journey that is harrowing, at times, and will make you want to hug your children tightly when you return home.
In an era when school shootings appear to be part of the "new normal," Zimmerman's play, which was inspired by the 2012 Sandy Hook shootings, remains sadly relevant. The Center for Homeland Defense and Security, located at the Naval Postgraduate School, tracks data on school shootings at the K-12 level and reports that there were 97 such incidents in 2018.
The Twin City Theatre Company production of "On the Exhale" is not likely to send you whistling out into the evening air. Indeed, you may find it upsetting.
But it is compelling theater that engages with a significant topic facing our culture. It raises important questions and leaves you to consider answers.
If you are interested in a thoughtful, if unsettling respite from the latest Twitter feud, you will find it here.

Texto completo: By Michael Goldman

My very brief recap of the final season of Game of Thrones:

First, the Ice Wall is gone. Then President Donald J. Trump started blaming the Democrats for the Ice Wall being gone. Then someone told Trump that the Ice Wall was never real. Then Trump tweeted that it didn't matter if the Ice Wall was not real because Mexico was going to pay for a new Ice Wall anyway. The end.

My very brief recap of the Mueller report:

Trump forgot a lot. Trump lied a lot. Trump obfuscated a lot. Trump denied a lot. Trump was real angry a lot. The end.

My very brief recap of the annual Easter Egg Roll on the White House Lawn:

First, Trump talked to kids about how much the egg farmers loved him, and that's why they brought him eggs. And, that it is he, and he alone, who decides with whom he shared his eggs. Then Trump also mentioned to the kids how no one ever disobeys him. Ever. Then the kids laughed. Real hard. The end.

My very brief recap of Trump's recent efforts to get the judicial branch of government to overturn the efforts of

the congressional branch of government to oversee issues involving the executive branch of government:

First, Trump bitched. Then he moaned. Then he delayed. Then he obfuscated. Then he roared. Then he sued. Now he is preparing to lose. The end.

My very brief recap of the battle over whether a citizenship question ought to be included in the upcoming census:

First, Sleepy Wilbur Ross lied. Then Wilbur Ross got caught lying. Then judge after judge ruled that because Wilbur Ross lied, the citizenship question was out. Then the Trump administration went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which he had earlier packed with his right-wing flunkies. Now Trump is preparing to win. The end.

My very brief recap of the rise of Mayor Pete Buttigieg:

First, nobody could pronounce his name. Then everyone could pronounce his name. Then his opponents decided to quietly start their research on Pete. Soon the rest of us will know what they found. The end.

My very brief recap of the past week of the White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders:

First, Sanders lied. Then she lied again. Then she got caught lying after being forced to testify under oath to only tell the truth. Then she claimed "the truth" she was forced to admit to under oath was also actually a lie. Then she cashed her weekly paycheck. The end.

My very brief recap regarding the ongoing Trump war with the New York Times:

First, Trump lied. Then Trump lied 9,000 more times. Then the New York Times did its job of questioning many of those Trump lies. Then Trump predicted the New York Times would beg him for mercy. Then each and every employee of New York Times sadly sighed in unison. The end.

My very brief recap of this week's Time 100 magazine cover story:

First, former New Jersey Gov. and Trump quisling Chris Christie wrote that unindicted co-conspirator Trump was a swell president. Then former U.S. House speaker and now pro-pot acolyte John Boehner wrote that Slick Mitch McConnell was just a swell Senate minority leader. Then the aforementioned McConnell wrote that beer-guzzling U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was just a swell justice. Finally, soon-to-be-unemployed Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote that his soon-to-be ex-boss, Lying William Barr, was going to be a swell attorney general. Then nobody with half a brain agreed with any of the things that any of these guys wrote. The end.

My very brief recap of the Red Sox season so far:

They lost their first game. Then they lost a whole lot more games. Then lots of folks decided that it made little sense just yet to plan on seeing the Duck Boats rolling down Beacon Street come November. The end.

Finally, my brief recap of the "five in a single night" pre-primary Democratic debates from New Hampshire on CNN: If you happen to know a single person who sat through all five hours, please don't ever introduce that person to me. The end.

Texto completo: John J. Schurdak
John Jacob Schurdak, 92, of Bethlehem, formerly of Bedford, NY, died April 22 in his home at Kirkland Village. He was the husband of Eleanora Wrinn Schurdak. Born in Alabama, John graduated high school in Ohio, before attending Yale University on a full scholarship. He received his B.A. (Phi Beta Kappa, Hopper College) in 1950, and his PhD in 1958, halting his schooling briefly to ?serve in WWII?.? ?While at Yale, he wrote about the role that technology would play in education, stating that while technology would render certain functions almost obsolete, the computer would never replace the connection between two individuals. Throughout the next six decades, John would credit Yale for an opportunity to inhale the brilliance of vibrant learning, creative, expansive thinking, and smart humor. A pioneer in the world of technology, he worked at IBM and then transferred to Fairfield University where he spent 32 years as Director of Educational Development and Research. He ushered Fairfield University into the technology age, purchasing the university's first computer, and designing an infrastructure for a university-wide computing system. ?He continued to build for a world to come,? sharing with his children the potential benefits when something like a barcode would replace a price tag or sending a birthday card from a computer that could think like a human. Although designing for that future, he taught in the present, working with teachers on the front end of rethinking curriculum enhanced by the use of technology. A lover of learning, John read books, listened to music, watched documentaries, and was an avid reader of ?The New York Times.? He relished trips to museums, where he was known for both the extensive time he would take to view an exhibit in its entirety, as well as his desire to review the exhibit a second time. He loved telling and hearing a good tale, and his big laugh was the gift shared with those in his company. Religion was a constant throughout his life; he served as eucharistic minister and lector and was the head of religious education at St. Patrick's Church in Bedford, NY. He loved to travel the world to see his children and to probe their professional aspirations and forward-thinking thoughts, and he cared deeply about his wife of 62 years.
SURVIVORS: He leaves his children Catherine E. Schurdak, John W. Schurdak, Ellen C. Schurdak and her husband Domenic P. Sbrocchi, Tamara Schurdak and her partner Anne M. Gunning, and two grandchildren, Kai and Julian Schurdak.
SERVICES: Services will be private at the convenience of the family. Cantelmi Long Funeral Home, 500 Linden Street, Bethlehem, PA 18018 has been entrusted with arrangements.
CONTRIBUTIONS: In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be sent to Yale College Annual Fund (go to www.yale.edu/giveyc?; please include details in the Tribute section of the form) or the Carole King-Helbling Kirkland Music Fund (make checks payable to Kirkland Village, 1 Kirkland Village Cir., Bethlehem, PA 18017, designated for the Carole King-Helbling Music Fund).

A look back at what the (BLEEP) happened last week

Texto completo: It's the end of one week and the start of another, and, like most sentient beings, I'm asking the pressing question: What the (BLEEP) just happened?
Joe Biden launches presidential bid
Former Vice President Joe Biden extracted his foot from its traditional home in his mouth long enough this week to announce that he's running for president, joining the current slate of 23,567 Democratic presidential candidates. (Oops, sorry, as I typed that it went up to 23,570.)
While Biden has global name recognition and more legislative experience than anyone in the field, he stands in stark contrast to the diverse array of Democrats vying for the nomination. Simply put: He's a 76-year-old white guy in a country where many have about had it with older white guys running things (into the ground).
Part of that problem was on display last month when a former candidate for Nevada lieutenant governor claimed Biden had kissed the back of her head and touched her shoulders at a 2014 campaign event. Biden responded with a sincere promise to be "more mindful" of people's personal space, then a couple of days later cracked a joke after hugging a man at a conference, saying, "I had permission."
Good one, Uncle Joe! You clearly get why creepy head nibbles and shoulder touching is inappropriate!
Handsiness aside, the avuncular Biden, like the other male candidates in the race, will undoubtedly face many deep, substantive policy questions while the female candidates who have been carefully spelling out sensible policy ideas will be asked why they don't smile more.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker LOVES yanking toilets!
Anyone familiar with Illinois' long and non-proud history of gubernatorial malfeasance should find Gov. J.B. Pritzker's ongoing toilet scandal almost charmingly on-the-nose.
A Cook County inspector general's report released in October accused Pritzer of getting $330,000 in tax breaks as part of a "scheme to defraud" taxpayers. At the heart of that accusation were five toilets that Pritzker's wife had yanked from a Gold Coast mansion the family was rehabbing in 2015. The toilet yanking made the home uninhabitable, which meant it got reassessed at a lower value. That's the kind of forward-thinking lavatory strategy you look for in an elected official.
On Wednesday, WBEZ-FM 91.5 quoted an unnamed law enforcement source saying the feds are now sniffing around Pritzker's toilets. While Pritzker tried to downplay the tawdry toilet talk during the campaign, saying it was all politically motivated, it doesn't seem to be going away.
Pritzker responded to WBEZ's report by saying: "Let me be clear that I'm very confident that any review of this matter will show that all the rules were followed."
As a show of support, I suggest all Illinoisans immediately remove their toilets, cash in on the ensuing tax breaks and take to the streets. To use the bathroom.
R. Kelly misses court date
Frequent defendant (and singer) R. Kelly didn't bother to show up at a Cook County Circuit Court hearing last week to put up a defense against a lawsuit alleging underage sex abuse, presumably because he has so many other cases to attend to.
A judgment was entered against Kelly and, if he fails to have an attorney intervene, he could be ordered to pay damages to the alleged victim as early as next month.
The victim is now 36, but she claims Kelly had repeated sexual contact with her starting in 1998 when she was 16. Kelly has separately been charged with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four victims, three of whom were underage.
If this all seems disgusting to you, then you are a reasonable human being.
Iowa Rep. Steve King totally 'gets' Jesus
U.S. Rep. Steve King (R(acist)-Iowa) said last week that he understands the suffering of Jesus Christ because he too has suffered.
Granted, King hasn't suffered in the "nailed to a cross" kind of way, but he has been accused of being a white nationalist and white supremacist, and that apparently really hurt his feelings.
All King did to deserve such spurious accusations, aside from making racist comments throughout his career, was to say to The New York Times in January: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?"
You see? He's not a white nationalist or a white supremacist. He just doesn't get why those things are bad. Just like Jesus!
On Tuesday, King said this to a small group of people who made the ill-advised decision to come listen to him: "When I have to step down to the floor of the House of Representatives, and look up at those 400-and-some accusers -- you know we just passed through Easter and Christ's passion -- and I have better insight into what He went through for us, partly because of that experience."
Reached for comment via text message, Jesus responded with an eye-roll emoji.
Wisconsin Powerball winner should really give me some money
A 24-year-old man from Wisconsin was revealed as the winner of a $768 million Powerball prize on Tuesday.
Wisconsin law requires that lottery winners' names be made public. That is both dumb and dangerous, so we here at "What the (BLEEP) Just Happened?" will not be using the young man's name. He quickly quit his job and said: "I'm just going to take off somewhere and, honestly, just take my time with it, think it over, talk to my family and make sure I spent it in the right way."
I applaud that decision. It's obvious that "newly wealthy 24-year-old man from Wisconsin" is wise beyond his years, and also arguably the most handsome man in America. I hope he runs for president, because he is exactly the type of person we need running this country. He should also win the Nobel Peace Prize.
And if he needs a highly paid spokesperson, my email is at the bottom of this column. (Did I mention how handsome he is?)

Trump conspiracy theories continue

Texto completo: "Donald Trump broke the brains of a lot of people." That's leftist journalist Glenn Greenwald, talking about the way conspiracy theories have occupied the media despite the absence of any actual evidence.
For over two years, the line among mainstream media, from The New York Times to Rachel Maddow, has been that President Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's stooge. It was suggested that the Russians "hacked" the election by penetrating voting machines. When that was exploded, we were told that they "hacked" the election by arranging for Wikileaks to release (truthful) emails about how the Democratic Party rigged its primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton to ensure that Bernie Sanders wouldn't get the nomination. At some point, the narrative shifted to vaguer references to "collusion."
It was all bogus. As Greenwald notes, Mueller's report didn't just reject the Trump-Russia conspiracy theories, it obliterated them. Not only was no one in Trump's campaign charged with conspiring with the Russians, no American anywhere was so charged, nor did Mueller find evidence along those lines to support criminal charges.
That should put the whole collusion narrative to bed, but of course it hasn't. After two years of what can fairly be described as mass hysteria afflicting a huge portion of our political class, the cognitive dissonance is painful. It would be amusing to watch, if the "broken brains" weren't so widespread among the people who are supposed to be the sober managers and reporters of our society. It's like a doomsday cult whose predicted apocalypse fails to appear on schedule: They just announce that they made a mathematical mistake, and doomsday will actually come next year. Then they ask for more donations. The trouble is, this time it's a cult that's running a significant part of our nation.
Even post-Mueller, the hysteria continues. Ralph Peters, on CNN, referred to President Trump as "slavishly subordinate" to Vladimir Putin. But that's crazy. Trump has sanctioned Russia for its actions in Ukraine, Syria, and Iran, under his command the United States military killed hundreds of Russian mercenaries in Syria, has been sending weapons to Ukraine to resist Russian invasion, and most importantly has promoted U.S. oil production, crushing Russia's main source of money and influence.
As Walter Russell Mead wrote in 2017, if Trump were the Manchurian candidate that people keep wanting to believe that he is, here are some of the things he'd be doing:
Limiting fracking as much as he possibly could
Blocking oil and gas pipelines
Opening negotiations for major nuclear arms reductions
Cutting U.S. military spending
Trying to tamp down tensions with Russia's ally Iran
That Trump is planning to do precisely the opposite of these things may or may not be good policy for the United States, but anybody who thinks this is a Russia appeasement policy has been drinking way too much joy juice.
Obama actually did all of these things, and none of the liberal media now up in arms about Trump ever called Obama a Russian puppet; instead, they preferred to see a brave, farsighted and courageous statesman.
Back when Mitt Romney warned of Russian influence in 2012, Democrats – including the New York Times' Maggie Haberman – were quick to mock him. She's suddenly repented of her Romney mocking, now that Romney, instead of being a Republican candidate for president, is a Trump critic. Broken brain, indeed.
One of the great legacies of the Trump Administration is the extent to which it has revealed that huge swathes of our national establishment, in government, the media, and elsewhere, are both hopelessly partisan and frighteningly incompetent. Buckle up, because all the evidence is that the establishment hasn't learned its lesson yet.

MONTPELIER — A bill that would set drinking water standards for five PFAS compounds and require water system managers to test for them by the end of this year has cleared the Legislature.
The governor is expected to sign the bill when it arrives on his desk.
The bill, SB 49, requires managers of public water supplies to test to ensure levels of five PFAS contaminants — PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFHpA and PFNA — are below a combined 20 parts per trillion.
If elevated levels are found, drinking supply managers would have to treat water to lower levels and provide residents with clean drinking water until the public supply is safe.
The bill also requires the secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources to file a final rule for drinking water standards for the five PFAS compounds by February. Vermont’s Agency of Natural Resources has already proposed drinking water standards of 20 parts trillion combined for five PFAS compounds.
Under SB 49, ANR would have to devise a plan this year for a statewide investigation into potential sources of PFAS contamination and submit a report on managing landfill leachate. Next year, it would have to start setting drinking water standards for the thousands of chemicals in the PFAS family.
The Senate passed SB 49, earlier this session, but had to weigh in on changes proposed by the House. On Friday, the upper chamber agreed to the House’s changes, which Bray referred to as mainly “linguistic” in nature.
But a couple of changes were more substantive, he said. Under the Senate version, managers of public drinking water supplies would have to provide bottled water to residents if testing showed drinking water supplies had elevated levels of PFAS.
“It turns out that’s not the standard protocol for municipal water systems,” said Bray. In the House’s proposal that was agreed to, water suppliers would issue “do not drink notices” to residents.
PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, do not break down in the environment and are used in a wide array of manufactured products, from rain jackets to cookware to firefighting foam. Scientists have linked certain PFAS chemicals to testicular cancer, kidney cancer, thyroid disease and immune system affects, among other medical conditions.
PFAS gained notoriety in Vermont in 2016 after the state discovered that a particularly toxic chemical in that group, PFOA, had contaminated hundreds of wells in Bennington. State officials say the primary source of pollution was emissions from now defunct ChemFab Corp. plants in North Bennington.
The state’s Agency of Natural Resources listed those compounds as hazardous materials and adopted an emergency enforcement standard for groundwater — meaning companies that are found to have contaminated groundwater with those five chemicals would have to clean up the site.
Earlier this month, the state reached a settlement with Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, which purchased ChemFab, to pay for municipal water line extension for residents with contamination wells.
Meanwhile, Bennington residents are moving ahead with a lawsuit seeking to make Saint-Gobain pay for property damages and long-term medical monitoring.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency has been slow to act to regulate PFAS, leaving states largely on their own to figure out how to deal with contamination. Both the EPA and the White House sought to block release last summer of a federal health study on PFAS contamination, fearing it would cause a “public relations nightmare.”
The EPA released a long-awaited draft plan this week for addressing groundwater contamination, which the New York Times reports was “significantly weakened” after pressure from the Defense Department. The military long-used PFAS-related fire fighting foam, which is known or suspected to have contaminated hundreds of sites around the country.
Six other states — Alaska, California, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York — have policies or are developing policies that would be stricter than the EPA’s 70 parts per trillion health advisory for PFOA and PFOS, according to E&E News.
Rebecca Kelley, spokesperson for Gov. Phil Scott, said in an email last week that the administration has been working closely with lawmakers throughout the session on SB 49. She said Scott will review final changes when the bill gets to his desk.
“I think we’re getting very close on that one,” Scott said of SB 49 during a press conference Thursday.

U.S. Border Patrol in tacit alliance with militias

Texto completo: For
The leader of the militia group United Constitutional Patriots was arrested April 20 by the FBI on a federal weapons charge. As reported, “The United Constitutional Patriots came to public attention this month after the emergence of videos that showed men stopping and detaining people crossing the border.”
The videos included two that, CNN reported, appeared to feature a UCP member impersonating a Border Patrol agent. Another video showed armed men in military-style uniforms detaining dozens of migrants. “Customs and Border Protection agents arrive and collect migrants but do not ask the group with guns to disperse or take their weapons elsewhere,” reported.
Vigilantism is always a threat to democracy, but the militia videos are especially troubling because of the appearance that civilians were masquerading as law enforcement officials — in at least one, according to , members could be heard shouting “Policia, alto!” or “Police, stop!” — and because federal agents encountered the vigilantes without confronting them.
The apparent cooperation of federal border agents and civilian militias is a disturbing sign that President Donald Trump’s open disregard for what he calls America’s “very stupid” immigration laws is taking hold in perilous ways. As revealed in the documents charging UCP leader Larry Mitchell Hopkins as a felon possessing firearms and elsewhere, the federal government is well aware that some militia members have dangerous criminal histories. (Hopkins’ lawyer said he will plead not guilty at a bond hearing next week.)
A fusion of vigilantes and the state is a particular threat to the Constitution and one of the signs of rising authoritarianism that historians warn democracies to guard against.
The FBI’s arrest of Hopkins is encouraging, as is the recent condemnation of vigilante justice issued by Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, but the activities of UCP and other militias on the border bear further investigation and action.
It is a federal crime, for instance, for militias to impersonate and act as federal law enforcement officers. Militias making “arrests” implicates other federal criminal laws, as well. And to the extent the Department of Homeland Security or individual Border Patrol agents collaborate with militias, they also violate federal law. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from subjecting private citizens to a state-created danger, as they would by partnering with — or even knowingly permitting — vigilantes to detain people and make arrests. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable seizures, and the Supreme Court has held that involving private citizens in arrests is indeed unreasonable.
Customs and Border Protection has issued a statement saying the agency “does not endorse or condone private groups or organizations taking enforcement matters into their own hands.” But DHS must proactively ensure that all ties between the agency’s Border Patrol and the militias are severed: by ordering the groups to stand down; informing them that Border Patrol will notify the FBI and state officials if they learn the groups are detaining migrants; and disciplining or removing agents who collaborate with or tacitly encourage militias.
Militias have an ugly history in the United States, particularly on the southern border, yet even before the Trump administration, the federal government did little to discourage them. Although Customs and Border Protection has acknowledged that armed vigilantes patrolling the border can have “public safety and legal consequences for all parties involved,” the recent news stories indicate that the agency’s concern has not been communicated adequately to agents on the border.
A 2016 investigative report by Mother Jones revealed a Border Patrol agent thanking a militia member by saying, “It impresses me that you guys come out and do my job for me for no pay at all,” and offering tips on where the group should patrol. A Freedom of Information Act request filed by our organization, Protect Democracy, uncovered video footage of a Border Patrol agent thanking a militia group for their efforts and asking more Americans to do the same.
Militia members tend to explain their activity by saying that they are simply supporting the Border Patrol, or defending the Constitution, or guarding the border until the wall that Trump seeks has been built, but an undercurrent of racism and potential violence is often present. The Mother Jones investigation quoted one militia member who described their mission as “hunting Mexicans,” and another who described the border as a “war zone.” The New York Times reported that responses to UCP’s videos on Facebook included “an array of antagonistic or racist descriptions of the asylum seekers.”
This is not the kind of support that federal law enforcement needs or can legally allow.
The president’s irresponsible rhetoric has inflamed matters at the border, requiring urgent action by the executive branch to close off any possibility of coordinated efforts between unlawful militias and government agents. In the absence of such leadership, congressional oversight and private lawsuits will be needed.

Tracking phones, Google is a dragnet for police

Texto completo: When detectives in a Phoenix suburb arrested a warehouse worker in a homicide investigation last December, they credited a new technique with breaking open the case after other leads went cold.
The police told the suspect, Jorge Molina, they had data tracking his phone to the site where a man was shot nine months earlier. They had made the discovery after obtaining a search warrant that required Google to provide information on all devices it recorded near the killing, potentially capturing the whereabouts of anyone in the area.
Investigators also had other circumstantial evidence, including security video of someone firing a gun from a white Honda Civic, the same model that Molina owned, though they could not see the license plate or attacken.
But after he spent nearly a week in jail, the case against Molina fell apart as investigators learned new information and released him. Last month, the police arrested another man: his mother's ex-boyfriend, who had sometimes used Molina's car.
The warrants, which draw on an enormous Google database employees call Sensorvault, turn the business of tracking cellphone users' locations into a digital dragnet for law enforcement.
In an era of ubiquitous data gathering by tech companies, it is just the latest example of how personal information - where you go, who your friends are, what you read, eat and watch, and when you do it - is being used for purposes many people never expected.
As privacy concerns have moun:ed among consumers, policymakers and regulators, tech companies have come under intensifying scrutiny over their data collection practices.
The Arizona case demonstrates the promise and perils of the new investigative technique, whose use has risen sharply in the past six months, according to Google employees familiar with the requests. It can help solve crimes. But it can also snare innocent people.
Technology companies have for years responded to court orders for specific users' information. The new warrants go further, suggesting possible suspects and witnesses in the absence of other clues. Often, Google employees said, the company responds to a single warrant with location information on dozens or hundreds of devices.
Law enforcement o�cials described the method as exciting, out cautioned that it was just one tool.
"It doesn't pop out the answer like a ticker tape, saying this guy's guilty," said Gary Ernsdorff, a senior prosecutor in Washington state who has worked on several cases involving these warrants. Potential suspects must still be fully investigated, he added. 'We're not going to charge anybody just because Google said they were there."
It is unclear how often these search requests have led to arrests or convictions, because many of "he investigations are still open and judges frequendy seal the warrants The practice was first used by federal agents in 2016, according to Google employees, and first publicly reported last year in North Carolina.
If has since spread to local departments across the country, including in California, Florida Minnesota and Washington This year, one Google employee said, the company received as many as 180 requests in one week. Google declined to confirm precise numbers.
Sensorvault, according to Google employees, includes detailed location records involving at least hundreds of millions of devices worldwide and dating back nearly a decace.
The new orders, sometimes called "geofence" warrants, specify an area and a time period, and Google gathers information from Sensorvault about the devices that were there. It labels them with anonymous ID numbers, and detectives look at locations and movement patterns to see if any appear relevant to the crime. Once they narrow the field to a few devices they think belong to suspects or witnesses, Google reveals the users' names and other information.
"There are privacy concerns that we all have with our phones being tracked - and when those kinds of issues are relevant in a criminal case, that should give everybody serious pause,' said Catherine Turner, a Minnesota defense lawyer who is handling a case involving the technique.
In a statement, Richard Salgado, Google's director of law enforcement and information security, said that the company tried to "vigorously protect the privacy of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement." He added that it handed over identifying information only "where legally required."

Texto completo: MOSCOW - President Vladimir Putin of Russia made a public show of support for North Korea on nuclear disarmament, seeming to undermine President Donald Trump's approach to nuclear diplomacy, as Putin and Kim Jong Un on Thursday wrapped up their first summit.
Russian officials have long insisted they wanted to support Trump's efforts at one-on-one nuclear negotiations with Kim, the North Korean leader. But speaking to reporters after the meeting in Vladivostok, on Russia's Pacific Ocean coast, Putin said North Korea needs security guarantees from more nations than just the United States before abandoning its nuclear arsenal.
Putin also reiterated Russian backing for a gradual process of trading disarmament for sanctions relief. "If we take one step forward and two backward, then we would fail to achieve the desired result," Putin said. "But it will eventually be possible to achieve this goal, if we move forward gradually and if we respect each other's interests."
At talks in February in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, Trump had proposed a "big deal" to lift punishing economic sanctions in return for a quick and complete elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Kim offered, instead, only a partial dismantling of nuclear facilities - while keeping his arsenal of nuclear warheads and missiles - in exchange for relief from the most harmful sanctions.
With each side calling the other's plan unacceptable, the talks collagsed - in sharp contrast to the rosy picture both leaders painted of their first meeting in Singapore in June.
In his first trip abroad since the talks in Vietnam, Kim sought to stress his friendly relations with the Kremlin as a counterweight to the hard-line tactics of the Trump administration.
"It is my and my government's firm strategic position that the strategic and traditional friendly relations between North Korea and Russia be strengthened and improved ceaselessly to fit the needs of the new century," Kim said after the meeting.
Putin suggested Russia might welcome a revival of multilateral talks on North Korea, known as the six-party negotiations, which have been dormant for a decade and were previously derided by Trump.

Texto completo: I love God and my country and my family and my friends and my synagogue and my writing and I also really love golf. Two bad knees and the rehab after their replacement have put a crimp in my game, but I am slowly returning to the links. This is why Tiger Wood’s victory at the Masters after over a decade of physical and emotional challenges was so inspiring. Every old guy was happy for him, and I am now officially an old guy.
My friend Tom Friedman, who writes the foreign affairs op-ed column for the New York Times, also loves golf with a true passion and also was happy for Tiger. On April 15 he wrote a wonderful piece entitled, “Tiger Woods and the Game of Life.” Tom brought up my favorite philosophical/bar room/drinking debate, and that is this deep and profound existential mystery: “What sport is most like life?”
So, dear readers, now it is your turn. This is your God Squad homework assignment for the week. Write to me and tell me which sport you think wins this debate, but please don’t even try to suggest that the sport most like life is:
— Polo. Any sport which requires you to buy a horse is not like life.
— Hockey. There are no pads in life and not really that much ice, and though there is fighting in life, there is clearly much more fighting in hockey.
— Tennis, soccer, basketball. In these sports there is absolutely no chance that old slow people can win unless the only people playing are old slow people.
No, the way I see it there are only really two candidates for the winner of the sport that is most like life. Friedman makes an excellent case for golf in his recent wonderful column. Here is a short excerpt:
“The biggest takeaway for me (of Tiger’s victory) is the reminder of the truism that golf is the sport most like life, because it is played on an uneven surface and everything is on you. So good and bad bounces — and self-inflicted mistakes — are built into the game. And so much of success in golf, as in life, is about how you react to those good and bad bounces. Do you quit? Do you throw your club? Do you cheat? Do you whine? Do you blame your caddie?”
Well said. Golf is indeed a possible winner in the debate over which sport is most like life, and Tom has made an excellent case for it ... and yet ... I have another candidate and I think this sport is the true winner: baseball.
Baseball is the game that is most like life because in baseball, as in life, mostly nothing happens.
Then, in baseball as in life, something unexpectedly happens and you have to be ready for it. If you are ready and you hit, catch or throw the ball properly you are a hero, but if you are not ready you are the goat. Sometimes you never have an opportunity to redeem your mistakes. But sometimes (actually quite often) you do, but you just never know when your redemptive opportunity will come. You have to be ready all the time.
Baseball is also the perfect replica of life in that it is a perfect combination of individual effort and teamwork. The result of a baseball game depends partly on what you do alone and partly on what you do as a team. Baseball forms itself into teams, and teams bring in supporters who wear their colors and are brought together rooting for the team. Even if the fans agree on nothing else in life they agree on rooting for the team. Rooting for the same team binds them together with other fans. But the game is not just different teams, it is also about one game with the same rules for everybody (OK, this is the same in golf and the designated hitter does not fit here). It is the same in life. We have different religions and different countries, but we are all supposed to be fans of the same game with the same rules — the rules of justice and compassion, freedom and charity. Life is not always like that, but it should be, and it must be if we are all going to live together.
If you only get one hit out of three at-bats you are a hero, and that is about the same ratio of successful attempts at living a good life. You just have to be good enough sometimes to make your mark and be proud of how you played the game.
Q.E.D. “Quod erat demonstrandum” — thus it has been proved. Baseball is the sport that is most like life.

Texto completo: Some kids play soccer. Other kids make slime. Guess who has more money for college?
Take, for example, Rancho Santa Margarita teen Nick Werfelmann. The Tesoro High student and social media slime sensation just bought a 2019 Tesla Model 3 for $45,000. With cash. He’s 16.
You can meet him Sunday, April 28, at the SoCal Slime Bonanza at The District at Tustin Legacy. He’ll be among 40 of Southern California’s social media slime celebs selling their creations.
Ashley Kua, 16, will also be there. The Valencia girl has 1 million followers on her Instagram account @slimeyoda. Off the top of her head, she said she has about $300,000 in slime profits saved up for college, give or take.
If you are completely confused about how slime turns into money then go online right now and punch in the word slime.
Thousands of videos will pop up: mesmerizing close-ups of hands methodically poking, slapping, stretching and caressing colorful blobs and bowls of slime. This isn’t the gross green slime you see on Nickelodeon, by the way. We’re talking about slime that resembles liquid and makes a splashy sound when you play with it. Slime that is fluffed up with shaving cream or jiggly like Jell-0.
Some slimes are a translucent sea green that you can plunge your hands into, others are like rainbow-colored taffy.
As pretty as they look, the real appeal is the sound they make when they are manipulated. Depending on the ingredients you add (foam beads, Vaseline, instant snow) they might crackle, crunch, or even make a slurping sound. Think of the satisfaction of popping bubble wrap and you get the idea.
Young and old alike have sworn by the therapeutic value of slime videos. Some even say they get an autonomous sensory meridian response: a relaxing tingle, often starting in your scalp and traveling south, triggered by a soft, repetitive sound.
Now, stay alert, because this is where the money comes in. Slimer kids (and most are kids) don’t just make free videos for you to watch; they sell their creations. Nick has sold about 14,000 slimes, he guesses, since making his first video when he was 14 years old — on Feb. 21, 2017 (he has the date memorized). They sell for $5 to $15 (for a 16-ounce container).
Nearly 500,000 fans follow his Instagram accounts @itsslimetyme and @theveganslimer. Most of his customers are girls ages 10 to 15, but he does get comments from older clients saying that playing with his slimes help their anxiety and their arthritis.
Nick’s biggest seller is his Strawberry Twizzler, which smells like strawberry licorice. A video of his hands kneading a giant mound of Strawberry Twizzler has gotten 11 million views.
Perhaps the most viewed slime video of all time, though, was made by a former Riverside waitress named Karina Garcia, a.k.a The Slime Queen, according to a New York Times story.
As of today, a video of her making a 100-pound slime ball has gotten more than 26 million views. When the Times story came out (July 2017), she also had advertising partnerships worth up to $200,000 — a month. But then, she has a YouTube channel with 9 million subscribers.
All slimes, by the way, begin with basic ingredients that are both cheap and easy to find: glue and Borax and food dyes and essential oils. Some of the scents are mouth-watering.
Ashley’s biggest seller is her I Loaf You Puff.
“It literally smells like dinner rolls,” she says. “And it feels super smooth, really velvety.”
Her other top seller is Yummy Gummy Freeze, which smells like tropical fruit and feels cold in your hands, like a Slushee.
The junior at Trinity Classical Academy, a private school in Valencia, dreamed of med school but now that her slime sales are booming she wants to study business or advertising, preferably at Stanford, Duke, University of Pennsylvania or Brown. She’s hoping her slime profits will cover tuition.
Ashley said she got into slime two years ago after seeing a video and instantly feeling relaxed.
“It’s, OK, I have a 10-minute break, let me play with some slime,” she says. “When I’m stressed out, when I feel kind of fidgety, it’s something I can squish; kind of like a stress ball, but better.”
Ashley has sold about 25,000 slimes online and another 15,000 at conventions, mixing up batches when she’s not doing homework or playing in tennis tournaments.
Nick says he ships up to 400 orders a week; thus the Tesla. He uses it to make post office runs.
The car purchase didn’t wipe him out, by the way. He guesses he’s got another $20,000 to $30,000 for college (plus another year of sales before graduating high school). He couldn’t give an exact total because it’s in several accounts and he hasn’t added it all up lately.
The Tesla arrived several weeks ago. In a role reversal, his parents have taken to borrowing it.
“It’s like kinda crazy,” says Nick, who’s only had his driver’s license for eight months. “I just go with the flow. My parents are really supportive.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Expanding the boycott of an annual press gathering, White House aides told staff members Tuesday that President Donald Trump doesn't want them to attend Saturday night's White House Correspondents' Association dinner.
Trump himself said earlier this month he would not be going to the dinner, calling it "too negative" and "I like positive things;" instead, the president will host a political campaign rally in Green Bay, Wisc. , a pivotal state in the 2020 presidential election.
Aides, some of whom attended last year's event, were told at a staff meeting that Trump did not want them to go, officials said.
It appears that officials will heed the president's request.
"The President and members of his administration will not attend the White House Correspondents' Dinner this year," the White House said in a written statement issued later in the day.
Olivier Knox, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said of the boycott: "We’re looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, present, and future. "

More: Post-Michelle Wolf, biographer Chernow to headline White House Correspondents' Dinner
The decision came the same morning that Trump posted a number of tweets attacking the media, particularly MSNBC's Morning Joe to The New York Times.
"I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election," Trump said in one tweet. "But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!"
The Times has never apologized to Trump for its coverage of the president.
Trump also did not attend the dinner during his first two years in office. He is the first president to intentionally skip it since Jimmy Carter in 1980.
President Ronald Reagan did not personally attend the dinner in 1981 – he was recovering from an assassination attempt – but he did phone in some remarks to the crowd.
After last year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner, Trump and other administration officials criticized comedian Michelle Wolf for a barbed monologue that included attacks on White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.
There will be no comedian this year; instead, the association invited presidential historian Ron Chernow to speak.
Before Trump, the dinner traditionally featured comics who made fun of the president – and other politicians – and offered presidents the chance to retaliate with comedy routines of their own.
Perhaps most famously, in 2011, President Barack Obama mocked an audience member who had questioned his U. S. citizenship and was contemplating a campaign against him.
That dinner guest? Donald J. Trump.

17 days strong! James Holzhauer win 'Jeopardy!' again Friday. Here's how he did it

Texto completo: "Jeopardy!" legend-in-the-making James Holzhauer is revealing the secret sauce that's made his exciting winning streak possible.
Holzhauer, 34, a professional sports gambler from Las Vegas, kept his streak alive on Friday's episode, bringing home $49,600 in a runaway victory.
He has won a total of $1,275,587 over 17 days, second only to computer programmer-turned-author Ken Jennings, who made off with $2,520,700 over 74 games in 2004.
In a Q&A with The New York Times that published online Wednesday, the professional sports gambler shared how his experience helps him keep a firm grip on the game show.
"There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament," he told the Times. "You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Holzhauer, who goes "$1,000-1,000-1,000 whenever I can," said he conceived of the strategy of aiming for the high-value clues "right away. "
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said.
Holzhauer believes his "comfort zone is very different than the typical contestant," which he hails as "a huge advantage. "
He tells the outlet: "The fact that I win and lose money all the time helps desensitize me, so I can write down $60,000 as the Final Jeopardy wager and not be trembling at the thought of losing that money. "
'Jeopardy!' Most loved, hated and memorable contestants through the years
More: A five-time champ explains why James Holzhauer a game-changer
Describing the typical way the game show is played as "too risk-averse," he explained the advantage of his strategy.
"The funny thing is, my strategy actually minimizes the risk of me losing a game," he said. "There’s times in a football game where a team goes for a big TD pass. If you don’t take a risk like that, you’re not going to win. "
Holzhauer's strategy is backed by knowledge he said he picked up from children's literature.
"I’ve found that in an adult reference book, if it’s not a subject I’m interested in, I just can’t get into it," he told the Times. "I was thinking, what is the place in the library I can go to to get books tailored to make things interesting for uninterested readers? Boom. The children’s section. "
He crossed the $1 million mark during Tuesday's episode, becoming only the second person in the game show's 35-year history to reach the feat in regular-season (non-tournament) play.

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
BEYOND THE CANON: 'SIDEWALK STORIES' AND 'THE KID' at BAM Rose Cinemas (April 28, 2 p.m.). Six decades after the end of the silent era, Charles Lane made "Sidewalk Stories," a (mostly) wordless independent feature in which Lane played a street artist who ends up caring for an abandoned 2-year-old girl. Lane will introduce this double bill, which pairs "Sidewalk Stories" with the film to which it tips its bowler hat: Charlie Chaplin's "The Kid." (Separately, "The Kid" will screen at IFC Center on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.)
718-636-4100, bam.org
ROBERTO GAVALDÓN: NIGHT FALLS IN MEXICO at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 5). Appraising MoMA's 2015 series on Mexican noir in The New York Times, J. Hoberman called Gavaldón "the most versatile and prolific of Mexican golden age filmmakers." That thesis can be put to the test with this 13-film tribute. Gavaldón's noir-friendly interest in blurring the line between good and evil gets an uncommonly literal vehicle in "The Other One" ("La Otra"), showing on Friday and May 4, which finds Dolores del Rio playing identical twins -- one poor and kind, the other wealthy and venal. In the western "Rosauro Castro" (on May 4), Pedro Armendáriz plays a cruel political boss who strains to keep a village in his grip.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
IARA LEE RETROSPECTIVE at Maysles Cinema (April 28-May 2). This filmmaker and activist is perhaps best known for her 1996 documentary "Synthetic Pleasures," which examined how then-emerging phenomena like virtual reality and cosmetic surgery were changing the way humans related to the world around them. That movie will screen on Sunday, and Lee will appear for Q. and A.s at all four screenings in this series.
212-537-6843, maysles.org
TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL at various locations (through May 5). Every spring Robert De Niro offers up this downtown movie smorgasbord. (See our recommendations of potential discoveries here.) The big revival screening is a Sunday showing of what's being called the "final cut" of "Apocalypse Now."
It's being shown at the Beacon Theater with the addition of "very low frequency" sound -- meaning audio that you can't hear but might be able to feel. It sounds like the modern equivalent of Sensurround, which was used on "Earthquake." Brace yourself for those helicopter vibrations.

But first, this is fine: Americans say they're more stressed out than people in Chad, the world's most pain-stricken country. Cool, cool, cool. Let's talk about some stressful things.
85,000 officers investigated. We've got their files.
Some officers have beaten people, planted evidence and harassed women. Others have lied, stolen, dealt drugs, driven drunk and abused their spouses. The public entrusts police to protect them but rarely hears when they hide misdeeds behind the badge. USA TODAY is changing that. Today, we published an investigation showing at least 85,000 law enforcement officers across the USA have been investigated or disciplined for misconduct in the past decade. We spent more than a year creating the biggest collection of police misconduct records, showing not only why thousands of officers have been banned from their professions but also how many of them escape their pasts in one place to become police chief somewhere else.

Biden's in, but Anita Hill's not having it
Joe Biden's long-awaited 2020 presidential campaign bid launched Thursday, making him one of 20 Democrats vying to become nominee. Thanks to the former vice president's name recognition, the 76-year-old has polled among Democratic front-runners for months. But controversy erupted for Biden after four women claimed he inappropriately touched them without permission. Biden spoke with Anita Hill to express regret for how she was treated during Senate hearings on Clarence Thomas in 1991. Hill told The New York Times she "cannot be satisfied" with Biden's words.
More on Biden's (third) presidential run:
President Donald Trump “welcomed” Biden to the race by insulting his intelligence and promising a "nasty" fight for the White House. He called him "Sleepy Joe. "
Former President Barack Obama also welcomed Biden but declined to formally endorse him. Why? Biden says he asked Obama not to. Well, OK.

Sri Lanka bombing suspects are still out there
Sri Lanka's leader said Thursday that suspects in the Easter Sunday bombing attack that killed at least 253 people are still at large and may be carrying explosives. The U. S. Embassy in Colombo urged people "to remain vigilant and avoid large crowds," especially at worship services for various faiths from Friday to Sunday. Many Catholic churches in Sri Lanka closed and canceled Mass upon advice from officials. At least 58 people have been detained in connection with the bombings, among the world's worst terrorist attacks since 9/11, in which almost 3,000 people died.
Real quick
At least five people are dead after violent storms, floods and tornadoes ripped through the South.
Where the money at? Twitter. Twitter users make more money than U. S. adults overall, a study shows.
The Baylor Bears will be the first female sports team – and the first basketball team – to get its own championship celebration at the Trump White House.

​Sitting in the back seat? You could be at greater risk of dying or suffering serious injury in a head-on collision than someone sitting in front, according to federal safety regulators. That's from an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study released Thursday that found rear passengers often lack sufficient protections in frontal crashes. In some crashes, poorly engineered seat belts killed or badly injured back-seat passengers while front-seat passengers in the same vehicle survived or avoided serious injury.
North Korea took an American captive. Then they sent a bill.
North Korea sent the United States a $2 million bill for Otto Warmbier's medical care when he was released from captivity in 2017, according to The Washington Post. Warmbier, 21, a college student from Ohio, died shortly after being returned to his family after 15 months in captivity in North Korea. "The bill went to the Treasury Department, where it remained – unpaid – throughout 2017, the people said. However, it is unclear whether the Trump administration later paid the bill, or whether it came up during preparations for Trump’s two summits with Kim Jong Un," the Post reported.
Judge allegedly helped a migrant flee
A Massachusetts judge was charged for allegedly allowing an undocumented immigrant to escape ICE agents through a back door at the courthouse and lying to a grand jury about what happened. The charges against the judge marked an escalation in the federal government's strict immigration enforcement policy and in its battles with states and local governments that shelter migrants. A lawyer for the ACLU called the charges "very aggressive. "

Texto completo: Democrat Beto O’Rourke brought his presidential campaign to the Richmond area on April 16, pledging to reform an economic system he said, “works too well for too few, and not at all for too many.”
He said national policies have fostered racial inequalities in criminal justice, education and wages. Then, he called out what he sees as another unfairness.
“It’s our system of health care,” he said, “where you see disparities in infant mortality between white Americans and black Americans greater today, in 2019, than in the year 1850 - 15 years before the abolition of slavery.”
We fact-checked whether the racial gap in infant mortality has, indeed, widened over the last 169 years.
Let’s start with a definition: The infant mortality rate is the number deaths before age 1 per 1,000 live births.
Chris Evans, communications director for O’Rourke’s campaign, sent us an email saying the candidate got his information from an April 11, 2018, article in The New York Times Magazine headlined, “Why America’s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis.”
The article cites estimates of child mortality in 1850 that were made by economists Michael Haines of Colgate University and Richard Steckel of The Ohio State University. Haines concluded that in 1850, the infant mortality rate for blacks was about 340 per 1,000; Steckel estimated the white rate was 217 per 1,000.
The Times compared those estimates to modern rates computed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2016, the latest year available, the infant mortality rate for blacks was 11.4 per 1,000. For whites, it was 4.9 per 1,000.
In other words, the data shows “a racial disparity (in 2016) that is actually wider than in 1850, 15 years before the end of slavery,” The Times article said.
O’Rourke claim needs context
Haines, who developed the 1850 estimate, said O’Rourke’s statement is “right,” but tells an incomplete story about infant mortality since the decade before the Civil War. “There has been remarkable improvement for both races; really quite dramatic,” he said.
The estimates roughly show that in 1850, one in three black infants died in the first year compared to one in five white newborns.
In 2016, CDC statistics show one in 88 black infants died before the first birthday compared to one in 204 whites.
“The mortality decline since the late 19th century seems to have been the result particularly of improvements in public health and sanitation, especially better water supplies and sewage disposal,” Haines wrote in a 2008 paper. “The improving diet, clothing, and shelter of the American population over the period since about 1870 also played a role.”
So, why has the racial gap increased?
Infant mortality is often associated with premature births and low birth weights, and black infants in 2014 were 3.2 times more likely than whites to dies of those causes, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But what leads to prematurity and low weight isn’t fully understood.
Black mothers are more likely than white mothers to be impoverished, very young and unmarried - factors associated with with higher infant deaths. They are twice as likely as whites to have received late or no prenatal care.
But research has shown a gap in low birth weights exists even when black and white mothers are matched for age, marital status, education, prenatal care and the father’s education.
A growing body of research points to racial discrimination as a cause of infant death disparity. It was pioneered by Arline Geronimus, a professor in the Department of Health Behavior and Health Education at the University of Michigan. The theory is that repeated exposure to discrimination and insult can have a stress-related “weathering” effect on a black mother’s body, producing poor pregnancy results and infant death.
Our ruling
O’Rourke said, “Disparities in infant mortality between white America and black America (are) greater today, in 2019, than in the year 1850...”.
O’Rourke’s statement is deeply grounded in academic research. But, it lacks important context: there has been a monumental drop in infant death rates for both black and white infants since before the Civil War.
So, overall, we rate O’Rourke’s statement Mostly True.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - In the months before Kirstjen Nielsen was forced to resign, she tried to focus the White House on one of her highest priorities as homeland security secretary: preparing for new and different Russian forms of interference in the 2020 election. President Donald Trump's chief of staff told her not to bring it up in front of the president.
In a meeting this year, Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, made it clear that Mr. Trump still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory. According to one senior administration official, Mr. Mulvaney said it "wasn't a great subject and should be kept below his level."

This account of Ms. Nielsen's frustrations was described to The New York Times by three senior Trump administration officials and one former senior administration official, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.

A prominent group of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists were handed sentences of up to 16 months in prison on Wednesday for their role in the "umbrella movement" rallies in 2014.

Chu's sentence was suspended for two years.
The men were founders of "Occupy Central with Love and Peace," a nonviolent movement that demanded free and open elections in the semi-autonomous Chinese enclave. More than 100,000 protesters immobilized the city's financial district for 79 days and used bright umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas.

To Save Public Housing, City Considers Tearing Some Down

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Years of neglect, mismanagement and drastic funding cuts have forced the beleaguered New York City Housing Authority to entertain bold solutions to alleviate the dismal conditions of its mold-ridden and pest-infested apartments.
Demolishing and rebuilding from scratch are now among them.
The city is considering a proposal to tear down two buildings in a public housing complex in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan and build three mixed-income private developments, according to several officials briefed on the tentative plan. The plan would raise money for urgently needed repairs.
Under the proposal, residents in the two buildings would be relocated to new affordable apartments with private landlords within the Fulton Houses, an 11-building complex a few blocks south of Hudson Yards that abuts the High Line, several luxury hotels and prominent art galleries.
In its eight-decade history, the housing authority, known as Nycha, has shied away from tearing down its aging buildings, with the exception of a high-rise complex in Brooklyn and some low-rise buildings in Staten Island.
But the brick buildings of the Fulton Houses, built in 1965, have deteriorated even as Chelsea has undergone a dizzying economic transformation that has made real estate values skyrocket and mom-and-pop stores shutter, burdening many public housing residents with higher living costs.
In total, three residential towers with almost 700 new units could be built, according to preliminary details of the plan obtained by The New York Times. Each building would have a proposed mix of 70 percent market-rate apartments and 30 percent affordable units.
"This is a conceptual framework of what we think drives the most money to ensure that we are rehabilitating the apartments that are at Fulton," Kathryn Garcia, the interim chairwoman at Nycha, said in an interview, noting that the plan was in its early phases.
Ms. Garcia stressed that residents would not be displaced, and Mayor Bill de Blasio emphasized that point at an unrelated news conference on Monday, after Politico first reported the proposal.
"Every Fulton resident will receive either a brand-new or completely renovated apartment, and we look forward to starting our resident engagement process soon," Ms. Garcia said.
Those reassurances, however, did little to quash the concerns of residents who have longstanding fears of being displaced from one of the most expensive and gentrified neighborhoods in the city.
"Everybody should be scared," said Miguel Acevedo, the resident association president at the Fulton Houses. "We are human. We have a heart. We have families. People fear it is easier to get evicted with a private landlord."
The proposal to partner with private developers to build on underutilized Nycha land is a central part of Mr. de Blasio's revamped plan to generate desperately needed revenue for the housing authority, which is facing $ 32 billion worth of backlogged repairs to its roofs, boilers and elevators.
For decades, New York City took pride in its public housing high-rise towers -- a huge array of affordable apartments for 400,000 low-income New Yorkers -- as housing projects across the country came down by the dozens.
"The fear I always had was what happened in Chicago, what happened in St. Louis, whereas buildings deteriorated, the civic consensus became 'tear them down,"' Mr. de Blasio told The Times in an interview last year. "I think that's horrifying, and I could never live with any approach like that. We have to guard against that type of mentality."
So as the city's public housing stock, the oldest and largest in the country, has aged, administration after administration has mostly chosen to renovate rather than raze and wade into complicated politics.
Demolishing buildings had not been a part of the calculus -- at least not publicly -- and Mr. de Blasio will likely face a struggle to garner buy-in from other elected officials and skeptical residents.
"City Hall has been thinking about having us bring them different ideas on what would be most effective to drive money into Nycha," Ms. Garcia said. "I am cautiously optimistic that we can move these projects ahead quickly and we will get the support that we need."
The Fulton Houses consists of 944 apartments with an average monthly rent of $ 660, a sharp contrast to the neighborhood's $ 3,462 median asking rent in luxury buildings and a stark example of the growing income inequality in New York City.
Even though residents are protected by a federal policy that caps their rents to 30 percent of their income, the influx of development around them has long fueled a sense that they will be pushed out from their homes.
"I truly believe in my heart they will bring the rent up," said Amelia Martinez, 60, who has lived in the Fulton Houses for four years. "I don't trust a private landlord. Nycha should manage our buildings."
She added: "I feel like I live in Europe. I like galleries. I like museums. This is perfect. If I leave, it'll be torture."
Housing officials met with a group of tenants in early March, but the demolition plan was not discussed. The next week, City Hall shared the plan with elected officials whose districts include the Fulton Houses, which are on Ninth Avenue between 16th and 20th Streets.
On Monday night, those officials -- Representative Jerrold Nadler, State Senator Brad Hoylman, Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson and Gale Brewer, the borough president -- called for transparency and resident input in a letter to Nycha.
Under the proposal, one new residential tower would be built on a parking lot in the complex, according to two people briefed on the matter. Then residents from 72 units at two of the development's smaller buildings would be moved to that new tower and continue to pay subsidized rents.
The two small buildings would be demolished, paving the way for two additional mixed-income towers.
Under the city's tentative plan, one tower would be 14 stories high and have 269 units; another would have 25 stories and 153 units; and the highest one would have 28 stories and 265 units, according to details shared with The Times.
Nycha would retain ownership of the land, but lease it to the developer.
Mr. Acevedo, the resident association president, said the city's plan would likely face resistance, but as long as the city honored its commitments, it was likely a viable alternative to "maintain the infrastructure at Fulton Houses for another 50 years."
Asked if this was a model that the city could replicate at other developments, Ms. Garcia said, "I would only say that if it works and we can do new construction ahead of demolition. It's not always the case. We don't always have underutilized land, but that would be the paragon."
The money generated from the three new towers would be used to simultaneously repair the other nine buildings in the Fulton Houses and the neighboring Chelsea-Elliott housing development. About 3,000 people live in the two housing projects, which are facing a combined $ 344 million in repairs, or about $ 166,000 per unit.
The city is also considering handing over the day-to-day management of both the Fulton and Chelsea-Elliott sites to a private partner who would invest to renovate the buildings, officials said. Those plans are part of New York City's goal to convert about 60,000 apartments -- or one-third of its public housing stock -- to Section 8 through public-private partnerships.
Ms. Garcia said residents' concerns about displacement were understandable given the turbulent history of public housing in other cities, where families moved off site, sometimes never to return.
"I heard my neighbors talking about it, and I was worried," said Jennifer Beeks, 36, a security guard at a homeless shelter, said of the proposal.
Ms. Beeks, a mother of three, said her worst fear was to end up at the shelter where she works.
"I haven't told my children about the building plans," she said. "I don't want to stress them yet. We love it here."
Jeff Mays and Edgar Sandoval contributed reporting.

Texto completo: On the evening of April 15, Olivier Latry, one of the world's greatest organists, arrived at a hotel in Vienna ahead of a planned concert.
"I had just put my luggage down and received a text," he said in a telephone interview. "It was from a friend, and it just said, 'Notre-Dame is burning!' and there was a picture of the roof on fire."
"I could not believe it, of course," he added. "But then a second picture arrived ..." He trailed off. "It was like a bad dream."
A day earlier, Mr. Latry -- one of the three main organists at Notre-Dame -- had played the cathedral's Grand Organ on Palm Sunday. It had been a beautiful service, he said, especially the moment when, according to tradition, a priest knocked on the cathedral's door with his processional cross and demanded to be let in.
As the cathedral's doors opened, Mr. Latry recalled, he let the organ's full volume swell, sending its musical colors reverberating around the Gothic building. "It sounded like Christ was entering the cathedral," Mr. Latry said. "It was such a moving moment. I didn't know it would be my last time."
But Mr. Latry, talking the day after the fire, was speaking too soon. On Tuesday, he was told that the organ was safe, albeit covered in dust. It may not sound exactly the same again, however, depending on how the cathedral is rebuilt.
Renée Louprette, an organist at Rutgers University in New Jersey who played as a guest at Notre-Dame in December, said in a telephone interview that the acoustics of the building were vital to the organ's much-admired sound. "When they rebuild, I hope the sound's just as impressive, but it will be different," she said.
After the fire that devastated Notre-Dame last week, politicians, religious leaders and architects all paid tribute to the building, and tried to convey how important it was to France, to Europe and to the world. But the devastation was also acutely felt by the people who worked at the cathedral, not least its three organists -- Mr. Latry, 57; Vincent Dubois, 38; and Philippe Lefebvre, 70. All of them were outside Paris at the time of the fire, watching on television as the cathedral burned and wondering what might be the fate of their instrument.
"All I could do was watch," Mr. Dubois said in a telephone interview. "It was just impossible. You cannot do anything. You are powerless."
The Grand Organ was one of Notre-Dame's most important objects, with five keyboards and almost 8,000 pipes. It traces its origins to the 1400s, though the current organ is mainly from 1868 and had been added to and improved many times.
It was "the most sumptuous example of France's greatest contribution to the organ world," wrote John Rockwell in The New York Times in 1992, after the instrument had completed a 30-month, multimillion-dollar restoration.
The Grand Organ, like Notre-Dame itself, has witnessed some of France's most momentous events. During the French Revolution, many organs in the country were vandalized by revolutionaries who took the pipes and melted them down to make bullets. But Notre-Dame's survived with only some of its decorative elements removed (Mr. Dubois said that was because the organist at the time played "La Marseillaise" for the revolutionaries a lot).
In 1937, Louis Vierne, the cathedral's organist for 37 years and a renowned composer who was also almost blind, died in the middle of a recital.

The Grand Organ also survived World War II, and it has been heard at numerous noteworthy Masses, including in November 2015, when Mr. Latry improvised an austere and powerful version of "La Marseillaise" at a memorial for victims of the Paris terror attacks.
Mr. Latry said he could not objectively comment on whether the Grand Organ was the best in the world. "But for sure, it's, for me, the most transcendent," he said. "It's superlative."
"When you play the organ, the stones are singing," Mr. Lefebvre said in a telephone interview. He said that he had first heard the organ when he was 14, visiting Paris on vacation with his parents. They went to the cathedral and an organist happened to be playing, he remembered. "I was not so religious, but it was the most beautiful sound I'd heard in my life," he said.
One of the reasons the organ is so impressive is that it has been renovated repeatedly, Mr. Dubois said, noting that every great French organ builder had worked on it and modernized it using the best technology, including adding electronics. "The synthesis of all that work is just a miracle," he added.
Mr. Dubois said he remembers every detail about the first time he played the organ, age 16. He wore green velour pants, he said, and a blue, V-neck pullover. "I didn't eat, as I was nervous," he added. "And I didn't eat for a few days after, as I was so shocked by it, in a good way."
"Once you play it, it's part of your body, of your mind and your soul," he added. "I still get the same sensations today."
The organ loft at Notre-Dame is 84 steps above the cathedral's entrance. It survived the fire with only minor damage thanks to being at the front of the cathedral beneath a stone roof, rather than beneath the 800-year-old wooden one that covered most of the building. And the roof above the organ is sloped, which meant water from firefighters' hoses ran off it and also protected the instrument.
Mr. Latry sent a statement last week to friends and supporters after he learned that the organ was probably safe. (That initial assessment was confirmed on Tuesday after technicians and restorers visited.) "It is very dusty, but will continue to move us as soon as its case is restored," he wrote. "When? No one knows yet."
He then quoted a passage from the Bible in which Jesus says he will raise a new temple in place of a destroyed one in three days. "It will surely take longer for Notre-Dame, but I am confident and hopeful," Mr. Latry wrote.
After the fire, Mr. Lefebvre said that he had felt lost because he did not know how long it would be until he could play the Grand Organ again. "I don't know what I will do now," he said. "I will do concerts elsewhere, I suppose, but that is so different to Notre-Dame."
But in a phone call on Wednesday morning, having learned that the instrument would survive, he sounded almost ecstatic. "The organ only needs to be cleaned and tuned," he said. "In maybe three, four years, we can reopen the church and play again." Technicians would play it soon, once electricity was restored to the church, he said.
"It's a miracle. Amazing. Incredible," Mr. Lefebvre added, when asked for a word to describe how he felt. Then he laughed, a sound full of joy.

By Eduardo Garcia
Ever notice those recycling symbols, the triangles with the numbers inside, on plastic packaging and containers? I always assumed they meant the plastic was recyclable. But that's not necessarily the case.
Those numbers are resin identification codes, and they tell what kind of plastic the item is made from. And not all plastic is created equal.
Identifying what types of plastics are recyclable can be challenging because plastics do not always carry a resin code and because not all recycling programs are equal, either. Generally speaking, though, some categories of plastic are more widely recyclable in the United States.
"We always encourage people to focus on Nos. 1, 2 and 5 because we have great markets for them in the U.S.," said Brent Bell, vice president of recycling at Waste Management, a major garbage collection and recycling company.
Water and soda bottles, milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, yogurt cups and butter tubs are mostly made of these plastics. You could lend a helping hand by rinsing these kinds of containers and removing labels.
On the other hand, placing items made with resins 4, 6 and 7 in the recycling bin is usually not a good idea. These are used to make squeezable bottles, plastic bags, pouches, meat trays, some clamshells and disposable plates and cups. Sorting plants will quite likely throw them in a landfill, together with other items considered contaminants.
Finally, No. 3 -- the category that covers the PVCs often used in packaging for cosmetics, some food wrap, blister packs and pipes -- is particularly bad. Because of its chemical composition, it can contaminate large batches of plastics in the recycling system that would otherwise be acceptable.
"You absolutely want to make sure that you never ever put PVC into your recycling bin," said Steve Alexander, president of the Association of Plastics Recyclers, an industry group.
Regardless of what they're made of, shopping bags and other soft plastics like cling film and Bubble Wrap shouldn't be put in recycling bins because they tend to jam sorting machines.
If one exists, your local recycling program should have information online about the types of plastics it accepts. If you can't get a clear answer there, though, the best policy is not to guess.
"If in doubt, keep it out," Mr. Alexander said.
The big lesson from our glaciers series
By Henry Fountain
Here's some of what I learned about glaciers in the time I spent reporting on them over the past half-year or so:
■ They look spectacular from far away, but up close they often have a dirty, somewhat drab appearance.
■ They are hard to get to, especially if you don't like climbing over sharp rocks.
■ With few exceptions around the world, they are shrinking
No. 3, of course, is why I did all that reporting -- in Switzerland, Kazakhstan, Washington and Alaska. The series that emerged had three parts, and the final one, about the effects on ecosystems, fish and other organisms, was published last week. The first two were more about what the melting means for humans. You can read all three by following the links below:
Being near, or on, a glacier -- as I was with my Times colleague, Ben C. Solomon, for the first two stories, and Max Whittaker, a freelance photographer, for the latest one -- is an amazing experience. I had the feeling of being in the presence of something extremely powerful, created by nature. These were massive sheets of ice, hundreds of feet thick in some cases, the result of thousands of winter snowfalls. For centuries these glaciers had crept slowly under their own weight, carving the landscape and grinding even the hardest rocks.
The evidence for that carving and grinding was all around us -- in the valleys the glaciers created; in the rock powder that coated the ice, giving it that drab look; and in the seemingly endless piles of rocky debris, from stones to large boulders, that we had to hike over.
I remember especially being with Ben in the Trift Glacier Valley in Switzerland. We had crossed a spectacular footbridge over the valley that the glacier had once filled; all that could be seen of the ice now was a small triangular patch, high up on the slope at the other end.
I've been writing about climate change for a while now, and I have a pretty good idea of what is happening and why. But it was there at the Trift that I realized its full force. Sure, glaciers are powerful, but global warming is even stronger -- strong enough to bring the Trift to its knees.

Texto completo: A man charged with threatening to kill employees of The Boston Globe last summer will plead guilty to all seven criminal counts against him, his lawyer said on Monday.
The man, Robert D. Chain, made a series of menacing phone calls to the Boston newspaper from his home in California last year, according to court documents. Transcripts of his comments during the calls show that Mr. Chain repeatedly threatened to shoot employees in the head, mentioned President Trump several times and used the phrase "enemy of the people," which the president has frequently used to describe the news media.
"We will hunt you down and kill you and your dogs," Mr. Chain said in one of the phone calls, according to court documents.
Mr. Chain, 68, was arrested in August at his home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Encino. He was charged in federal court in Boston with seven counts of making threatening communications in interstate commerce. The charge carries a maximum prison sentence of five years.
"Mr. Chain intends to plead guilty to all counts in the indictment and take full responsibility for his actions," his lawyer, William Weinreb, said in a statement on Monday. "He is anxious to make a full, public apology, expressing his sincere remorse to those he affected."
The United States attorney's office in Massachusetts and Mr. Chain's lawyer declined to comment on Monday about whether any agreement had been reached regarding Mr. Chain's sentencing.
The Associated Press first reported Mr. Chain's intention to plead guilty.
The F.B.I. investigated Mr. Chain and found that he owned several firearms and had recently bought a small-caliber rifle. He did not face criminal charges in connection with weapons possession. After his arrest, he was released on bond, and his next court hearing is scheduled for May 15.
Phone calls to a number associated with Mr. Chain went unanswered on Monday evening.
Mr. Chain began calling The Globe immediately after the newspaper announced on Aug. 10 that it would publish a coordinated editorial response to political attacks on the news media. Federal prosecutors said his threats were in retaliation for that campaign.
Court documents show that in one phone call, Mr. Chain was asked why he was calling.
"As long as you keep attacking the president, the duly elected president of the United States, in the continuation of your treasonous and seditious acts, I will continue to threats, harass and annoy The Boston Globe, owned by The New York Times, the other fake news," he replied. (The Times sold The Globe in 2013.)
News media executives have denounced the president's use of the phrase "enemy of the people," calling it an assault on the First Amendment and warning that it could incite violence by the president's most ardent supporters in the United States and embolden authoritarian political movements overseas.
Mr. Chain's phone calls prompted The Globe to bolster its security, and officers with the Boston Police Department were dispatched to the newspaper's office. Jane Bowman, a Boston Globe spokeswoman, said in a statement after the arrest that the newspaper was grateful to the authorities for investigating the threats.
"We couldn't have asked for a stronger response," she said, adding that "while it was unsettling for many of our staffers to be threatened in such a way, nobody -- really, nobody -- let it get in the way of the important work of this institution."
In a statement after Mr. Chain's arrest, the United States attorney, Andrew Lelling, said: "Anyone -- regardless of political affiliation -- who puts others in fear for their lives will be prosecuted by this office. In a time of increasing political polarization, and amid the increasing incidence of mass shootings, members of the public must police their own political rhetoric. Or we will."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: President Trump spent early Tuesday morning tweeting his grievances against the media.

He targeted The New York Times, referring to the outlet as the enemy of the people and saying the publication will “have to get down on their knees [and] beg for forgiveness” from him, inaccurately claiming the paper apologized to him in 2016 for its coverage during the election.

He attacked New York Times opinion columnist Paul Krugman as “stupid,” accusing the economist of writing “false and highly inaccurate” things about him — without specifying what he objected to.

The president also accused the mainstream media of ignoring how well the economy is doing during his presidency.

Trump did offer praise to one corner of the media — to Fox News, the cable news network he promotes almost daily on his own Twitter feed — before resuming the attacks.

Teeing off on MSNBC's “Morning Joe,” he called cohosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski “angry,” “dumb,” “sick” and “psycho.”

The president ended by mocking CNN anchor Chris Cuomo as being a “massive failure.”

When Trump finished the diatribe, he returned to live-tweeting Fox News.

Texto completo: EVANSTON, Ill. --- A Chicago journalist embarks on a project to chronicle the lives of history's most incredible women, including groundbreaking mathematician Gene Grabeel, French swordswoman and opera singer Julie D'Aubigny and early civil rights leader Ida B. Wells in the 88th annual Waa-Mu Show.
Presented by the Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts at Northwestern University, the entirely student-written and orchestrated musical "For The Record" will run May 3 to 12 in the Cahn Auditorium, 600 Emerson Street, on the Evanston campus.
Amisha (Amy) Padnani, editor at The New York Times and creator of "Overlooked," the Times' series chronicling the lives of forgotten women, will attend the May 9 performance and participate in a post-show discussion. Padnani inspired the themes of "For the Record."
Though Grabeel, D'Aubigny and Wells dedicated their careers to changing the world, their stories have been largely overlooked in historical records. Now one woman's quest to reveal their lives will end up shaping her own. Inspired by incredible true stories, "For The Record" asks how we can learn from our past in order to create a more enlightened future.
Co-chaired by Northwestern School of Communication seniors Gabby Green, Ziare Paul-Emile, Alex Rothfield and Lindsay Whisler, "For The Record" features a team of nearly 100 students, including 16 writers, a music team of 36 and a cast of 29, with more students involved in the artistic and business teams.
Speaking about this year's show, School of Communication student writing coordinators Lauren Katz ('21) and Carly Mazer ('20) highlighted the relevance of the theme.
"I am excited to be working on this show because the topic is so raw and revalent to what is going on in the world today," Katz said.
"I am thrilled to have so many brilliant minds working together to make this show possible," Mazer said. "Collaboration and inclusivity are so important and especially pertinent to this subject matter."
"For The Record" is directed by School of Communication lecturer Stephen Schellhardt, with associate director and choreography mentor Amanda Tanguay. The music is directed by School of Communication lecturer Ryan T. Nelson.
"With Waa-Mu, I get to watch young professionals hone their craft and skills in a supportive, positive and diverse environment," Schellhardt said. "I believe this year's show will reflect the passion and talent of our enormously talented student body, and that makes me beyond excited to bring this show to life."
The historical women in "For The Record" are: Gene Grabeel (1920 - 2015) was an American home economics teacher-turned-mathematician and cryptanalyst who founded the Venona Project. Grabeel's work directly helped uncover a Russian mole in the Manhattan Project, the U.S. government's operation that created the atom bomb during World War II.
Julie D'Aubigny (1673 - 1707) was a bisexual French swordswoman and opera singer who dueled her way through Paris society and fought sexism on the opera stages. When Julie's female lover was sent to a nunnery by her family, D'Aubigny helped her escape by faking her death and setting the nunnery on fire.
Ida B. Wells (1862 - 1932) was a Chicago-based investigative journalist, educator and an early leader in the Civil Rights Movement. Wells centered her life around combating prejudice and violence, specifically documenting the resurgence of lynchings in the United States in the 1890s, and she eventually helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
Waa-Mu tickets are $25 (tier two) and $30 (tier one) general admission, $22 for seniors and educators, $20 for NU faculty and staff and $10 for full-time students with valid ID.

Texto completo: Joe Biden is planning to close his personal charity, the Biden Foundation, when he begins campaigning for president.

The foundation would likely suspend its activities as soon as he enters the 2020 race and then begin the longer process of shutting down for good, according to the New York Times.

The move is likely an effort to avoid conflict-of-interest accusations that plagued Hillary Clinton during her presidential bid in 2016, when the Clinton Foundation continued to accept donations. Biden aides said he had not accepted foreign funding for any of his nonprofits.

Biden is expected to announce he’s running for president on Wednesday.

The former vice president and his wife, Jill, launched the nonprofit after he left the White House in 2017. It raised $6.6 million by the end that year and has focused on issues like ending violence against women, strengthening the middle class, and and expanding LGBT rights.

It’s unclear what will happen with other nonprofits Biden created after leaving the White House, including the Biden Cancer Initiative, the Beau Biden Foundation, and the University of Pennsylvania’s Biden Center for Diplomacy and Public Engagement.

Texto completo: The environment has become a polarizing issue in recent years, but as honorary co-chairs of the “Year of the Environment” which launched on Earth Day, we are hoping to help make it a bipartisan cause again.
The initiative, aimed at commemorating a half-century of bipartisan environmental progress, will include 12 months of celebrations, special events and public lectures leading up to next year’s 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day, brainchild of the late Wisconsin senator and governor, Democrat Gaylord Nelson.
It’s kicking off at the Gaylord Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which hosts an annual Earth Day Conference conducted in the spirit of the original 1970 “teach-in. ” The event is called Imagine and Adapt: Possibilities in a Changing World.
We urge Americans to become what the Nelson Institute calls “New Environmental Citizens” — people who understand that the environment is at work all around us, including (and especially) in cities. The environment is not some abstract concept, but something that connects and unites us all. The environment is embedded in our everyday lives, whether it’s the food we eat, water we drink, air we breathe, or communities where we live.

Greta Thunberg, student protesters should demand better solutions to climate change
As Gaylord Nelson put it, “The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. "
As a nation, we’ve made great progress in cleaning up our water and air since the first Earth Day, which was a unifying event, but that unity has eroded in recent years, as the global conversation has shifted to combating the effects of climate change.
First Earth Day was life-changing
In 1969, after a massive oil spill in Santa Barbara, California killed thousands of birds, fish, and sea mammals, then-Sen. Nelson called for a nationwide teach-in on the environment in a speech in Seattle. The first Earth Day was held April 22 the next year.
“If the environment had any enemies they did not make themselves known,” the New York Times observed.
On that original Earth Day, Congress adjourned for the day so members could speak at events — and two-thirds of them did so. An estimated 20 million people participated in cities and towns, at 2,000 college campuses, 10,000 elementary and high schools, and other venues, including Fifth Avenue in New York City, which Republican Mayor John Lindsay closed to traffic as thousands mobbed the city’s central artery.
But as Adam Rome wrote in “The Genius of Earth Day: How a 1970 Teach-in Unexpectedly Made the First Green Generation,” the teach-in went well beyond numbers.
“Because Earth Day 1970 was unprecedented, the organizers had to plan everything in their communities from scratch, and the effort was life-changing,” Rome wrote, noting that thousands of organizers and participants across the country decided to dedicate their lives to the environment.
Later that year, Republican president Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and signed into law the Clean Air Act. The Senate had passed it unanimously.
Common ground is conservation
Finding common ground again is critical, and there have been a few hopeful signs in recent months. In February, overwhelming majorities of both houses of Congress passed a comprehensive public lands conservation bill, which will protect more than a million acres of wilderness and permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. President Donald Trump signed the bill into law last month.
The bill’s passage demonstrates that even in today’s polarized atmosphere, Republicans recognize that there is strong public support for conservation.
Working in our different leadership roles, we’ve tried to do our part for the environment. One of us made purchasing and saving lands for conservation a major priority as Wisconsin governor. And the other founded the Wilderness Caucus in the U. S. Senate, to help lawmakers learn about and defend wilderness areas.
As a conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat, we don’t agree on many things, but we both believe that Americans need to be good stewards of the natural resources upon which our environment, economy and public health are dependent.
We need to put partisanship aside and focus on finding commonsense solutions that will make this world more prosperous for this and future generations.

Three Earth Day lessons

Texto completo: In April 1970, about 20 million Americans turned out for the first Earth Day, attending speeches, demonstrations and other community-based events in what the New York Times called "among the most participatory political actions in the nation's history."
Nearly 50 years on, the movement spawned by that historic gathering is rallying around calls for a Green New Deal to embody the aggressive action required to fight global climate change, create good-paying jobs and advance a more just and equitable society.
As Congress begins crafting legislation to turn those bold aspirations into law, the original Earth Day provides three key lessons.

First, national movements are born of local concerns.
In the year before the first Earth Day, industrial pollution was so bad in Ohio that the Cuyahoga River caught fire. An estimated 3.3 million gallons of oil spilled along the Santa Barbara coast, killing thousands of birds, fish and sea mammals. Acid rain was taking out Adirondack forests. Every car in America was spewing lead into the air we breathed.
Those local crises, and dozens more, sparked the national environmental movement. Similarly, climate change is imposing mounting costs and growing peril on families and communities across the country -- including the drowning of the Midwest in epic spring floods, catastrophic wildfires in California, and Gulf Coast hurricanes and sea-level rise.
Climate change amps up these kinds of natural disasters and makes them more devastating. That's why seven in 10 respondents told Monmouth University pollsters they expect national action to fight it.
Second, national solutions flow from local opportunities.
On the first Earth Day, neither state nor federal governments were fully organized to confront toxic pollution, reckless development or industrial ruin. We were a nation in search of solutions. It was, though, an earnest search that we faced as Americans, not something that split us into red and blue factions.
Out of a national consensus for change came bedrock federal safeguards such as the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act -- laws that passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan majorities. States set up environmental agencies to help monitor pollution and enforce those laws.
Fighting climate change now means once again connecting the dots between national policies and local opportunities.
For example, even as national climate progress stalls under President Trump, more than 3,700 city, state, business and academic leaders have pledged to put in place policies that support the aims of the 2015 Paris climate accord. And 25 cities nationwide -- including Los Angeles, San Jose and San Diego -- are working to accelerate climate action through participation in the Natural Resources Defense Council-sponsored American Cities Climate Challenge. Meanwhile, policies that speed a just and equitable transition to clean energy are supporting millions of good-paying local jobs.
Already, the NRDC affiliate Environmental Entrepreneurs counts about 3.3 million Americans working to make our homes and workplaces more efficient; building all-electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars; and helping us get clean, homegrown American power from the wind and sun. That's nearly three times the jobs fossil fuel production provides.
We must make sure these clean-energy jobs spread to the regions and people that need them most. That includes areas -- rural and urban -- traditionally dependent on coal, gas and oil production.
Earth Day's final lesson is connected to environmental justice. The effort Earth Day kicked off relied on grass-roots citizen activism forged in the 1960s movements for civil rights, women's rights and opposition to the Vietnam War. It was about empowering people who'd not been heard to stand up, speak out and work for change. A half-century later, we must listen again to the voices that have been silenced too long, from people of color, low-income communities, indigenous people and others who often pay the highest price for environmental hazard and harm.
As a new generation brings fresh energy and ideas to the mission of protecting our environment and health, we're called to confront environmental injustice, to achieve 100% clean energy and to protect ourselves from the dangers and costs of climate change. I believe we can build on what we've learned; bridge racial, economic and political chasms; and spark a renewed national effort to save the planet and leave our children a livable world.

Roam overseas without cellphone roaming fees

Texto completo: There's an easy way to get zero roaming fees, inexpensive internet service and cheap phone calls when you travel. The trick is the SIM card, a tiny, removable chip, inside your phone.
What is a SIM card?
Subscriber Identity Module cards are roughly the same size, and indeed look like, the microSD memory cards you'd find in a digital camera. (Some phones actually have both microSD and SIM cards, but most just have the latter.) The main purpose of a SIM card is to store a small amount of data that lets the closest cell tower know, among other things, what wireless company you've subscribed to. For example, if you're on Verizon, the SIM card will let Verizon's tower know that, yep, you're on Verizon.
When you're traveling, this creates a problem. When your phone connects to the tower in a different country, the tower effectively says "I don't know you," and either denies you service, or tells Verizon you're roaming. If the latter, you get whatever speed Verizon and that provider have determined is acceptable, and you get charged exorbitant roaming rates. AT&T works similarly. Sprint, T-Mobile and Google Fi are different, but we'll get to them later.
If you're wondering if you can just get a different SIM card that will work on a different network, you can.
For years that's how I've gotten cheap data in dozens of countries all over the world. I'd arrive in a city, head to a local cellphone company store (like Vodafone, 3, or Orange), and buy a SIM and a month of service. These would have different names, like "pay-as-you-go" or "prepaid." But in every store I'd just say I was traveling and wanted a SIM for a few weeks, and they all knew what I was looking for. Put the new SIM in your phone (make sure you don't lose your old one, you'll need it when you go home!) and you're all set. If you're not sure how to do that, the store will probably do it for you. You can be in and out with cheap high-speed data in less than 30 minutes.
How much does a local SIM cost?
The prices vary depending on country and provider, but on average I've paid around $20 for a month's worth of 4G data and calls in that country. You read that right. Most roaming packages charge that for a few days, and are slow and data-limited as well. Most companies want to look at your passport, so make sure you bring it. A handful of countries have other requirements, so a quick Google search before you go is a good idea.
The catch, and you knew there'd have to be one, is that your phone has to be unlocked. This means your cellphone company has to enable a setting on your phone that allows you to use it on a different network. The process to do this varies, but in most cases you need to have paid off your phone. The actual unlocking process is free, though.
Not every phone will work in every country, but most new phones should be fine. Best to check with your current cellphone company to verify that your phone will work, and if it needs to be unlocked.
A handful of phones have dual-SIMs, which is exactly what it sounds like: two SIM card slots. This lets you keep your home SIM and your "away" SIM in the same phone. Not necessary for infrequent travelers, but for anyone who regularly goes to another country, quite handy.
Times are changing for SIM cards, however. Both Google and Apple have "eSIMs" in some of their phones and tablets. These Embedded-SIMs are essentially a virtual SIM card, and work across multiple cellular networks. This is how Google's Fi works.
Speaking of Google Fi, it, along with Sprint and T-Mobile, have generous free international coverage. Generally, if you have one of these providers, you'll be able to step off a plane just about anywhere in the world and your phone will work more or less normally. Google Fi has 4G data; Sprint and T-Mobile have far slower 2G, but offer 4G packages for a few dollars a day.
Where do I get a local SIM card?
You can buy SIMs at airports, but these are often far more expensive and offer less data than those you can purchase from a local telecom company. Lists of the main providers in the Americas, Asia/ Pacific, Europe, and Africa and the Middle East can be found online before you depart. There are also "universal" travel SIM cards, but these cost more than a local SIM.
Will I have the same telephone number?
No. Your apps will work, but you will have a new number. Your old number will go direct to voicemail until you return home and swap in your original SIM, which will return your phone back to normal. Just something to keep in mind. - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: Illustration Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 9 during the International Arctic Forum in Saint Petersburg.

Arctic may be next frontier for Russia The world's next hot spot theoretically could be its coldest. Atop the globe, the Arctic expanse is a new frontier for the United States and friends to fortify against an aggressive, ambitious Russia.
The West used to rely on the polar cap as a trusty, ice-covered moat to keep the Russians at bay. But climate change is slowly melting that cap. As ice sheets shrink, Russia's assertiveness in the Arctic grows. Moscow has reopened military bases in its Arctic regions that closed down when the Cold War ended, The New York Times recently reported. Russia has ramped up its fleet of icebreaker ships, and has Arctic-based anti-ship missile launchers and air defense systems at the ready.
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently said he isn't done beefing up Russia's presence in the Arctic, announcing a plan to establish new ports along the northern coastline and build more icebreakers. It is believed that at least a quarter of the world's undiscovered oil and natural gas is locked underneath the Arctic Ocean. And as Arctic ice melts, those new sources of energy will be ripe for exploration, and new shipping lanes will become accessible.
Putin has known this for some time, which is why, in 2007, the Kremlin sent a couple of submersibles to the seabed underneath the North Pole to plant a titanium Russian flag and claim the Pole in the name of Mother Russia. At the time, it was derided as a stunt. Today, Russia's growing military presence in the Arctic is a concern.
The U.S. and its allies cannot afford to cede the Arctic to the Kremlin. NATO recently conducted military exercises in northern Canada aimed at training alliance troops to deploy and fight in extreme cold. Troops from Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland and France took part — the U.S. sent observers. The troops made igloos, fought off frostbite and snowmobiled in minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit.


Global warming is setting up the day when the Arctic becomes a shipping superhighway, and reveals the world's next trove of natural resources wealth. The last thing the U.S. and its allies want to see is an Arctic expanse studded with Russian flags.

Decision to detain more cynical and cruel A new ruling by the Department of Justice ordering thousands more asylum seekers to be detained for the duration of their application process — which can take years — is another reminder of two deplorable aspects of the Trump administration's immigration policy: its obsessive efforts to radically reduce immigration, and its willingness to trample any notion of human decency by jailing people who arrive at the border asking for help.
Atty. Gen. William Barr's ruling reversed a 2005 decision by the Justice Department's Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed asylum-seekers to be released into the United States while waiting for their immigration court proceedings. Relying on the 2018 Rodriguez decision by the Supreme Court that immigration detainees do not have a right to a bond hearing, Barr held that immigration law requires some asylum-seekers who have passed the initial threshold for consideration — by persuading an asylum officer that they have a "credible fear" of persecution in their home countries — to be jailed while their cases play out.
The mandatory detention applies only to adults apprehended between ports of entry, and not minors and families. By the time you read this, legal challenges have likely been filed, joining pending court action in the Rodriguez case over whether the statutes requiring detention are constitutional.
Putting aside the legal arguments, it is unconscionable that the U.S. government detains people indefinitely without offering a chance for a bond hearing — especially when they are asking for our government's help and are not accused of any crime other than the misdemeanor of crossing the border illegally. Such incarcerations run contrary to our notion that the government should not deprive people of their freedom without due cause and court oversight. They also presume, contrary to reality, that people seeking asylum are all criminals or scam artists.

Modell's taps financial adviser to help its business

Texto completo: Modell's Sporting Goods, known for its catchy "Gotta Go To Mo's" jingle, has obtained guidance from a financial adviser – an indication that the country's oldest sporting goods store is facing mounting pressure in today's competitive retail climate.
The Manhattan-based retailer, which has more than 150 stores in the Northeast, including dozens in New York and New Jersey, has tapped California-based consulting firm Berkeley Research Group, the same adviser that worked with Modell's in 2017 and that has advised other troubled retailers like Gymboree Group Inc.
Retail experts say it is not unusual for retailers to reposition themselves in the ever-changing world of retail, where competition from big-box stores and online shopping has forced a growing list of retailers to file for bankruptcy in the first four months of 2019 alone, including Charlotte Russe and Payless ShoeSource.
Mitchell Modell, the retailer's chief executive, said the retailer has long-term plans to stay in business. "We are committed to securing our future in a challenging retail climate, and therefore are always looking for ways to improve our performance," Modell said in an emailed statement responding to questions from the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. "To help us with efficiencies and process improvement, we have engaged Berkeley Research Group, as we have done in the past."
Modell, a resident of Alpine, did not specify what the company's plans were. When asked if stores would be closing in New Jersey or New York, he said the retailer had no plans to shutter stores in those markets, beyond closures that he said occur annually when leases expire.
The Wall Street Journal first reported in March that Modell's hired Berkeley Research Group. In the report, people familiar with the matter said options on the table included a possible bankruptcy filing or restructuring.
Should the retailer eventually file for bankruptcy or plan any widespread closures, it could send shock waves across New York and New Jersey's retail sectors. The chain has an estimated 100 stores in the two states, according to a count on the company's website. That's about one-third of the chain's retail footprint.
Widespread closures could have a big impact on the region's commercial real estate market, which has recently had to absorb the closure of Toys R Us and Sears stores, and must deal with planned closures of some Bed Bath & Beyond stores soon.
Retailers typically hire financial advisers when the future of their companies is uncertain, and because advisers can offer an objective approach to dealing with a distressed company, said Ted Gavin, managing director of Gavin/Solmonese, a bankruptcy and restructuring consulting firm. Modell's likely hired an adviser "because they have a fundamental business problem that is threatening the future of the company, and that is in all likelihood a combination of too little revenue and burdensome leases," Gavin said.
Gavin, who has more than 20 years of experience working with distressed companies, said Modell's may consider getting out of under-performing markets. That, he said, is key to balancing other financial strains a retailer may be facing, whether too much debt or declining sales in particular stores.
"The key is to get out of the markets that aren't working for you and to do it early enough to be able to preserve cash," Gavin said. "Moving to online may supplement what you lose in closing retail — but the important thing is to get out of money-losing retail locations."
An immigrant from Hungary The retail world has been unforgiving to sporting goods companies, but Modell's, the oldest family-owned sporting goods company in the country, has managed to stay afloat amid the changing tides.
The business started when Morris A. Modell, an immigrant from Hungary, opened a general store on Cortlandt Street in Lower Manhattan in 1889 — a date that has been affixed on the store's red-and-white signs for decades. The company thrived after World War I by stocking up on Army surplus merchandise and selling it at low prices, according to William Modell's obituary in The New York Times.
William Modell, the third generation to run the business, profited from the failures of his rivals, the Times reported. In 1996, Modell's grew from 67 stores by paying $2.5 million for 15 outlets in New Jersey and in the Baltimore and Washington areas from bankrupt Herman's World of Sporting Goods.

Texto completo: Clare Bronfman, heredera del imperio licorero Seagram’s, se declaró culpable ayer en un tribunal del distrito neoyorquino de Brooklyn por el caso de la secta sexual Nxivm, acusada de tráfico y esclavitud en las afueras de Albany, capital de Nueva York.
Bronfman (40) era considerada la directora de operaciones de la organización Nxvim, junto con su fundador, Keith Raniere, y la actriz Allison Mack, de la serie de televisión “Smallville”.
El 8 de abril, Mack (36) admitió la culpabilidad de dos cargos de crimen organizado y conspiración, pero aún tiene pendientes otros relacionados con tráfico sexual, usurpación de identidad y blanqueo de dinero.
Raniere (58) es el único de los acusados que se mantiene detenido , tras ser arrestado en México y deportado a Nueva York en marzo de 2018. Enfrenta un mínimo de quince años de prisión y un máximo de cadena perpetua.
Además de Bronfman, también se espera que se declare culpable otra de los miembros del grupo, Kathy Russell, apuntaron medios locales.
El pasado 13 de marzo, la presidenta de Nxivm, Nancy Salzman, también se declaró culpable de conspiración para crimen organizado, robo de identidad y alteración de documentación. Otra acusada es su hija Lauren Salzman.
Así, Raniere es el único de los acusados que podría acabar enfrentándose a un juicio , destacó EFE.
Raniere ha negado todos los cargos presentados contra él. Su abogado, Marc Agnifilo, ha informado que piensan ir a juicio, y se mostró aliviado de que Bronfman y Russell no vayan a pasar por el proceso judicial, ya que no cree que “se las debía haber acusado”.
La fiscalía acusa a estos miembros de la cúpula directiva de Nxivm de una serie de crímenes, entre ellos conspirar para cometer robo de identidad, blanquear dinero, tráfico sexual, extorsión y posesión de pornografía infantil.
En abril de 2018 Raniere fue deportado desde México tras ser acusado formalmente en un tribunal de Nueva York.
En 1998, este supuesto gurú de la motivación personal creó la organización “Programas Ejecutivos de Éxito”, a través de la cual impartía talleres de cinco días por los que cobraba hasta $5 mil dólares.
Años más tarde fundó Nxivm, la secta que estableció en el norte de Nueva York y donde obligaba a los asistentes a tomar clases adicionales a mayor precio y a traer a otras personas para “ascender” dentro de los rangos internos de la organización y así obtener “privilegios”.
En 2015, Raniere formó una sociedad secreta dentro de Nxivm llamada “DOS”, acrónimo en latín para “Amo de las compañeras obedientes”, donde él era el único hombre y líder. La secta operaba con los rangos de “maestros” y “esclavas”.
Todo salió a la luz cuando una “esclava” desertó en 2017 y la historia fue reseñada por The New York Times. Raniere huyó del país poco después de esa publicación.

Texto completo: Un grupo de milicias armadas de derecha operando a lo largo de la frontera sur detuvo a un grupo de 200 inmigrantes que buscaban asilo y los amenzó con armas de fuego hasta que llegaron los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza.
Esta milicia armada, que se llama a sí mismo Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos , dijo que está decidido a monitorear la frontera hasta que el Presidente Donald Trump cumpla su promesa de campaña de un muro fronterizo o hasta que el Congreso promulgue una legislación más fuerte para hacer más difícil que los inmigrantes soliciten asilo, dijo Jim Benvie portavoz del grupo en entrevista con el New York Times.
Al conocer sobre los hechos la gobernadora de Nuevo México, Michelle Lujan Grisham, en una declaración al diario neoyorquino dijo que es “completamente inaceptable” que los inmigrantes sean “Amenazados” al ingresar a los Estados Unidos por este tipo de grupos.
La Unión Americana de Libertades civiles ACLU aseguró en una declaración que “el racismo vil de la administración Trump” es lo que le da alas a este tipo de grupos radicales.
Por su parte la Patrulla Fronteriza a través de su portavoz, Carlos A. Díaz, dijo en una declaración que la CBP “no respalda a grupos privados u organizaciones que tomen asuntos de cumplimiento en sus propias manos “.

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors say actress Felicity Huffman should serve between four and 10 months for her role in the college bribery scam, though her plea agreement, obtained by USA TODAY, indicates they plan to recommend a number toward the lower end of that scale.
The plea agreement does not specify the length of her prison term. However, using the sentencing algebra used by the DOJ, once Huffman's offense, admission of guilt and the money involved in the crime are factored in, that figure is in the four-to-10 month range, according to The New York Times and CNN.
According to the terms of the deal, which Huffman signed on April 4 and announced four days later, her prison term will be followed by a year of probation. She also agrees to forfeit the $15,000 she paid to have her elder daughter's SAT exam corrected. Huffman must also pay a $20,000 fine, with financial restitution to be determined at sentencing.

The filing also warns that if Huffman, 56, does not accept full responsibility for her crime at the plea hearing or commits any new offenses or obstructs justice in the meantime, the DOJ will "object to any reduction in her sentence. "
The maximum penalty for her offenses of mail fraud and honest services fraud is a 20-year prison term, forfeiture of the money used in the crime, a fine of $250,000 and other restitution.
Huffman, who accepted responsibility and expressed remorse in her statement last week announcing her plea deal, is due back in federal court on the afternoon of May 21, according to the DOJ's website.
Fellow celebrity defendants Lori Loughlin and husband Mossimo Giannulli filed court documents Monday indicating their intention to plead not guilty. They also face an additional felony charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering.

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to release a lightly

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to release a lightly redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s 400-page report today, offering a granular look at the ways in which President Donald Trump was suspected of obstructing justice, people familiar with the matter said.
The report — the general outlines of which the Justice Department has briefed the White House on — will reveal that Mueller decided he could not come to a conclusion on the question of obstruction because it was difficult to determine Trump’s intent and some of his actions could be interpreted innocently, these people said. But it will offer a detailed account of his alleged conduct — analyzing tweets, private threats and other episodes at the center of Mueller’s inquiry, they added.
Attorney General William Barr plans to hold an 8:30 a.m. news conference to address "process questions" and provide an "overview of the report," a senior Justice Department official said. The report will be delivered on discs to Capitol Hill between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. (CDT), the official said, and will be posted on the special counsel’s website thereafter.
Those who spoke to The Washington Post for this report did so on the condition of anonymity, citing the matter’s supreme sensitivity.
Today’s rollout plan — and news of the White House’s advance briefing, which was first reported by ABC News and The New York Times — led to political uproar Wednesday, with Democrats suggesting the attorney general was trying to improperly color Mueller’s findings before the public could read them.
"This is wrong," Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter.
While the report’s light redactions might allay some of their concerns, Democrats are likely to bristle at any material that is withheld. What the Justice Department and Trump’s lawyers might view as modest, lawmakers might see as overly aggressive.
Barr also is likely to face scrutiny over the Justice Department’s talks with the White House — which could help Trump and his attorneys hone their attacks on the report in advance.
Rudolph Giuliani, one of Trump’s lawyers, has said he is preparing a counterreport to Mueller’s findings, and in a recent interview said his document would explain from the president’s viewpoint every episode that could be considered obstructive. Giuliani and others have long feared Mueller’s findings on obstruction, viewing them as potentially more damaging than anything Mueller found on the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians.
Mueller did not find a conspiracy between Russians and Trump or his campaign, Barr said in a brief letter of the special counsel’s conclusions shared with Congress late last month.
Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s attorneys, told The Washington Post, "We do not discuss conversations that we may or may not have had with the president." A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to address questions about its briefings to the White House, the report’s redactions or Mueller’s findings on obstruction.
Trump had also apparently been briefed in advance of the planned news conference, which he revealed Wednesday during a radio appearance, which was confirmed later by a Justice Department spokeswoman. Barr will appear alongside Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the spokeswoman said, and he planned to take questions.
Barr has faced intense scrutiny from the public and lawmakers on Capitol Hill for his handling of Mueller’s report. Today’s news conference could give him an opportunity to address his critics — and perhaps provide them fresh ammunition. It is sure to be watched closely by Trump, an avid TV viewer whose relationship with his attorney general will almost certainly be colored by Mueller’s findings and what Barr says about them.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the White House did not ask the Justice Department to hold the news conference, but she declined to discuss White House and Justice Department interactions about the report.
Trump told the Larry O’Connor show on WMAL that he was pondering having his own news conference.
"You’ll see a lot of very strong things come out tomorrow. Attorney General Barr is going to be giving a news conference. Maybe I’ll do one after that; we’ll see," Trump said.
Already, Democratic lawmakers and pundits have alleged that Barr seems to be taking steps to mitigate the political damage Mueller’s report might do to Trump, and some members of Mueller’s team have told associates they are frustrated by the limited information he has released about their work.
A senior White House official said Trump has praised Barr privately for his handling of the report and compared him favorably with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who Trump grew to loathe over his recusal from what would become Mueller’s investigation.
Since the special counsel’s office closed its investigation late last month, Barr and his team at the Justice Department have been reviewing the final report to determine how much of it can be made public. The Justice Department has said it plans to release the document with four categories of information shielded from public view: material from the grand jury, material that reveals intelligence sources and methods, material that is relevant to ongoing investigations, and material that could affect the privacy of "peripheral" third parties. Each redaction will be color-coded so readers know the reason material is being shielded, Barr has said.
Any redactions could be controversial, and Democrats have said they won’t be satisfied unless they are given the entire, unfiltered document. It is likely House Democrats will attempt to subpoena it, sparking a legal battle that could last for months or even years.
Barr has so far disclosed only what the Justice Department terms Mueller’s "principal conclusions." In a four-page letter to lawmakers, he declared last month that Mueller did not find that anyone on Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, and that the special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice. Barr wrote that he and Rosenstein then reviewed the evidence and did not find it sufficient to make an obstruction case.
Barr offered only a few quotes from Mueller’s report, leaving a curious public with many more questions than answers about what his 22-month investigation had found.
White House officials are concerned about damaging testimony from a number of senior aides, particularly former counsel Donald McGahn and former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, according to current and former officials. Their testimony, according to people with knowledge of it, gave a clear, detailed breakdown of some of the most controversial incidents, from the firing of James Comey as FBI director to attempts to oust Sessions. McGahn spoke with the special counsel for dozens of hours, according to two people familiar with the matter.

How tragic church fires can inspire decency in others

Texto completo: Seeing the iconic church on fire was stunning. After firefighters extinguished the inferno, the heartbreaking scenes of the charred church, which had been a beloved home for generations of her family, were almost too much for Monica Harris.
"Seeing the church in the condition it is now," the 57-year-old Christian said for a story in The New York Times, "it’s almost like losing a family member."
That loss, and the beauty destroyed by that blaze, hadn’t even had time to register before a man of the cloth added some perspective.
"They burned down a building. They didn’t burn down our spirit," he said.
The gofundme rebuilding fund for three overwhelmingly black churches burned in Louisiana in the past month had topped out under $100,000 until Monday’s fire at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris reignited the cause. None of those structures was on par with the world-famous, centuries-old, magnificent cathedral of Notre Dame, but black churches matter. As of Wednesday, online donations for the three black churches were nearing the $1.8 million goal. Donations for Notre Dame are expected to top $1 billion.
"As we hold Paris in our thoughts today, let’s also send some love to our neighbors in Louisiana," Hillary Clinton tweeted Tuesday. Journalist Yashar Ali and CNN anchor Jake Tapper posted similar tweets asking people to remember those black churches, too.
As the world watched the flames consuming the iconic spire of the cathedral of Notre Dame, people used words such as heartbreaking and tragic to describe the damage to the centuries-old architectural wonder, which is a monument to Christianity. But one of the first online comments I read came from a suburban Catholic priest, who noted, "This is really, tragically sad. But God is NOT confined to even beautiful and ancient structures." He went on to explain how asylum-seekers and other people suffering hardships deserve that same outpouring of empathy and assistance.
Easter celebrates the belief that Jesus Christ was crucified and rose from the dead, the keystone of the Christian faith. But it also offers a more universal message that bad things can get better. Easter signals hope and a new start.
On the same day Notre Dame was burning, every Major League Baseball player, coach and umpire wore a No. 42 jersey to honor Jackie Robinson, the first black player allowed to play in the majors. It is heartbreaking and tragically sad that there was a time when black players were banned from the National Pastime, but in honoring Robinson, we celebrate how the world can change for the better.
At the same time, we can continue to find it heartbreaking and tragically sad that MLB now is investigating racist messages sent to Carl Edwards Jr., a relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs who got off to a bad start this season and happens to be black.
Clearly, today’s world gives us plenty of opportunities to right wrongs and make bad things better. Louisiana officials on Monday charged a 21-year-old white man with arson and hate crimes in connection with the fires set at the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, as well as the St. Mary Baptist Church in nearby Port Barre.
Every cowardly and hateful act can inspire a commitment to decency and good in others. Not only can we take some comfort in the fact nobody died in any of these tragic church fires, we can also find something good in the response of ordinary people.

Texto completo: At the bottom of my list of the Democratic candidates I would like to see nominated in 2020 is Bernie Sanders. At the top of my list of the candidates I expect to see nominated? Same.
The presidential campaign is still young. The first actual votes will not be cast for more than nine months, when the Iowa caucuses are held on Feb. 3. In a congested race, as we know from the Kentucky Derby, the fastest contenders can find themselves hopelessly boxed in. But at the moment, it's easier to see a path for Sanders to win the Democratic nomination than it is for anyone else.
I have written before of my many objections to Sanders, which have not abated. But his political strengths are not to be underestimated.
Plenty of politicians look formidable until they actually enter the campaign. Remember Rudy Giuliani in 2008? Or Rick Perry in 2012? The jump to the major leagues is bigger than it looks.
Sanders, however, has competed at this level before, and he came close to defeating a rival who was the most admired woman in America for 17 consecutive years.
Hillary Clinton was a savvy, impeccably qualified and lavishly funded candidate who had the backing of the party establishment and the nostalgic power of her husband's presidency. Yet Sanders won 23 of the contests and 43 percent of the votes cast. He excited crowds in a way that Clinton never could.
He has raised far more money than anyone else this time around, the great majority from small donors -- which suggests that a lot of people who voted for him in 2016 are eager to do it again.
Sanders' central advantage in 2016 was the blunt repetition of his signature themes: "Medicare for All," taxing the rich, free college, fighting Wall Street, attacking inequality. No one can match his credentials on these issues. No one is better at communicating them in a forceful manner.
His status as the only democratic socialist in Congress gave him an anti-establishment credibility that remains as potent as ever. But for all his eccentricities, Sanders proved to be a sure-footed campaigner who avoided gaffes without ever sounding canned or cautious. His appearance at a Fox News town hall Monday showed fearlessness.
Sanders has wrought a change in the Democratic Party, pushing its ideological center of gravity well to the left of where it was just four years ago. He paved the way for such firebrands as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib to be elected to the House. The Congressional Progressive Caucus has 98 members, up from 69 in 2014.
"Medicare for All" has gained the support of many Democratic politicians, including several of those running against him. On that and other issues, the senator from Vermont could sue most of his opponents for plagiarism.
His disadvantage is that he's well to the left of most Democratic voters -- half of whom say they are moderate or conservative. The New York Times noted that "perhaps 1 in 10 Democrats over all ... might identify as democratic socialists, based on recent polls."
Among less liberal Democrats, the obvious alternative to Sanders is Joe Biden. But Biden has run twice for president with dismal results. His responses to women's complaints about his unwanted touching were tone-deaf -- and revived bitter memories of how he handled the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings.
His past positions on abortion, criminal justice and the Iraq War will be used against him. He has a propensity for unforced errors, brought on by his garrulous nature and thirst for attention. If any candidate is a good bet to self-destruct, it's Biden.
Donald Trump got the Republican nomination not because he was the best candidate but because the better ones split up the voters who disliked him. Sanders may not be the choice of most Democrats, but he is better placed to capture consistent pluralities than anyone else.
Candidates who might outshine him in a small field, such as Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Julian Castro, will struggle to set themselves apart from each other. The fresh-faced Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg are bound to seem underprepared next to the battle-scarred Bernie.
Most Democrats would probably prefer not to risk losing the election by nominating an avowed democratic socialist. But as Trump showed in 2016, a majority that is divided can be conquered.

Texto completo: PLAYA VISTA — You’ve just set an NBA record for biggest postseason comeback in NBA history – what are you going to do next?
Settle in for a critical film session, naturally.
“We came back and what we did was historic, but the reality tells a whole different story,” said Coach Doc Rivers, whose team’s epic comeback evened their first-round Western Conference playoff series with the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors at 1-1. Game 3 is Thursday night at Staples Center.
“The reality is that we were down 31, and the reality is we’re not going to win a lot of games against anybody doing that. The reality is they’re shooting over 50 percent and there’s a lot of realities in this series that don’t bode well unless we do something about it.”
The reality, Rivers stressed before (and likely at) Wednesday’s practice: “We have to play better. We understand we won the game, but we’re not going to win the game playing that way. I think we fully understand that. If not, we’re about to when we watch film.”
Yes, the Clippers outscored Golden State 72-37 – the best offensive 19 minutes of not just the season, but “of their lives,” Rivers said – down the stretch to win Game 2. But prior to the 7:31 mark of the third quarter on Monday, they were being outscored 215-167 in the series.
“I mean, 131 points (total),” said Clippers guard Patrick Beverley, whose job it has been to harass Kevin Durant. “Ain’t nobody really playing no defense, but we were fortunate to get stops when they mattered, to get loose balls when they mattered.”
They had squandered opportunities in Game 1 – which was encouraging, insisted the Clippers, who were pleased to have had chances. And it was true: Before the turnaround began in the third quarter, the Clippers had forced 28 turnovers. The problem was that they’d turned them into only 23 points. (Conversely, they’d coughed it up 27 times themselves, miscues the Warriors converted to 34 points).
Except for the production of Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell off the bench, the Clippers hadn’t been nearly aggressive enough for Rivers’ liking – especially because against the Warriors, offense might be the best defense.
“We’ve just got to be more in sync offensively,” Clippers guard Landry Shamet said Wednesday. “I know they scored 70 points in the first half, but offensively, I think that made a big difference (in the comeback). We were more in sync, making plays for each other, on the same page. Our flow was a whole lot better in the second half.”
In the final 24 minutes, the Clippers’ offensive assertiveness and togetherness was rewarded: They went 17 for 19 from the free-throw line (to which they made seven more trips than in the opening half), and they shot 30 for 45 from the field, including 8 for 14 from 3-point range.
And as the Clippers – the biggest first-round underdogs in 30 years, at 100-1 – rallied from a statistical 0.1 percent probability of winning with 8:30 on the clock Monday, the nation took notice, either that night as it happened or waking up to the stunning result the next morning.
USA Today proclaimed the Clippers “the best thing to happen to the NBA playoffs,” the New York Times profiled Lou Williams (whose 36 points and 11 assists in the game were more than any other reserve in a postseason game since 1985), and ESPN invited Landry Shamet to share his reliable insight on “The Jump.”
“It’s been good,” Shamet said Wednesday of the attention, but he quickly added, “at the end of the day we’re 1-1 right now. By no means are we satisfied or feel like we’ve accomplished anything in its entirety, at least.
“It’s a good feat to come from behind and tie the series, but me personally, I’m trying to move past all that because we know we probably just (irritated) a sleeping bear. They’re going to be ready to go tomorrow.”
“I don’t care,” about the bear, Rivers said. “Because we have to have an extra something.”
And then, with his players taking their seats on folding chairs in a semi-circle around a television monitor, Rivers went to show them how.

Trooper’s collapse cause unknown stop still unknown after lab analysis

Texto completo: VtDigger
Vermont State Police say the cause of a trooper’s collapse in March remains unknown after laboratory and medical testing; however, the initial explanation that he overdosed from contact with synthetic opioids appears unfounded.
State police said in a press release Tuesday that the substance seized by Acting Sgt. Brett Flansburg was heroin, not synthetic opioids as police initially suggested.
“Following continued investigation and laboratory analysis, the substance Trooper Flansburg encountered has been identified as heroin,” the press release said. “The results of any medical tests must remain confidential due to Trooper Flansburg’s personal privacy rights. The ultimate cause of the incident in March is inconclusive.”
State Police director Col. Matthew Birmingham was quoted as saying that Flansburg had recovered from the incident and was back on the job.

The trooper collapsed in a parking lot minutes after a traffic stop in which he seized a baggie of a drug suspected to be heroin. He was given multiple doses of Narcan, an anti-overdose drug, and eventually regained consciousness.
Birmingham quickly concluded that contact with the drug had caused the collapse.

“Were it not for the immediate availability of Narcan and the quick actions of his fellow troopers and medical personnel, we might be speaking today about the death of a trooper in the line of duty,” he said in a press release on March 16. “I’m angry at how close we came, and relieved that the situation was no worse than it was.”
Birmingham’s conclusion was consistent with law enforcement officers across the country who have warned that first responders face the risk of opioid overdoses from incidental contact with powerful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and carfentanil.
But those concerns have been countered by the medical community, which says the drugs do not easily penetrate the skin. If the drug enters mucous membranes — such as eyes or nostrils — or enters the air in large amounts, it can pose a risk.

In Tuesday’s press release, Birmingham did not walk back his initial claims about the cause. Public Safety Commissioner Tom Anderson instead defended their response by pointing to advice from the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
“While we know that the risk of overdose from merely touching these drugs is low, we take the CDC at its word when it says first responders face possibly life-threatening consequences through exposure routes including inhalation, mucous membrane contact, ingestion and needles,” Anderson said.

Anderson sent an angry letter to VtDigger after the news organization published a “fact check” that challenged Birmingham’s claim that police were facing a new mortal danger from contact with the drugs.

“Most troubling, this article also diminishes and downplays the very real threat faced by the Vermont State Police, local law enforcement and front-line first responders who face risk in nearly everything they do each day — and who continue doing it despite those risks, because their mission is to protect the public and keep Vermonters safe,” Anderson wrote.

“If VT Digger has a complaint with the conclusions of the CDC and other federal agencies on which the Colonel reasonably relied in making his statement, you should take those concerns up with the medical professionals and researchers at the CDC, ONDCP and CBP.”
Dr. Howie Mell, an emergency physician in the Chicago area and spokesperson for the American College of Emergency Physicians, said last month that law enforcement agencies had to consider the absolute worst-case scenario in their advice, but that incidental contact such as touching a baggie or brushing drugs off your uniform simply didn’t cause overdoses.
Mell and others say a more likely explanation for the collapses is panic attacks brought on by fears of overdoses, though there is no certainty about that.

The American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology released a joint statement on the issue.

“Fentanyl and its analogs are potent opioid receptor agonists, but the risk of clinically significant exposure to emergency responders is extremely low,” the groups wrote in July 2017. “To date, we have not seen reports of emergency responders developing signs or symptoms consistent with opioid toxicity from incidental contact with opioids.”
The media has helped perpetuate the unsubstantiated fears around opioid contact in recent years. But some outlets are now seeking to set the record straight.

“A dangerous fentanyl myth lives on,” was the headline of a Columbia Journalism Review article published on Thursday.

The New York Times editorial board called out the misconception a week earlier. “As baseless public health scares go,” it wrote, “the one about police officers and nurses purportedly overdosing from passive fentanyl exposure should have been easy to dispel.”

Texto completo: Donald Trump’s actions are frequently “rash, ignorant and chaotic,” but a new report by the Council on Foreign Relations concludes his individual policies toward world nations may be better than critics realize.

The general focus on White House churn or presidential announcements delivered on Twitter distracts from successes, such as alerting policymakers to the threat from China, pursuing talks with North Korea, and strengthening relationships in the Middle East, according to Robert D. Blackwill, Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow at the think tank.

The result is a rare endorsement from the foreign policy establishment.

“All the chaos generated by this flawed president does produce actual policies, the substance of which in many cases is likely to be more consequential than the ways by which the policies arrived and the character of the man who formulated them,” he writes in the report, which is titled, "Trump’s Foreign Policies Are Better Than They Seem."

“What matters most is the effectiveness of U.S. policy over time and its consistency with U.S. national interests, not the personal qualities of its leaders.”

Blackwill offers a string of positive grades for policies on Saudi Arabia (B+), Syria (B+), North Korea (B), China (B+), Afghanistan (B+), and Venezuela (B+).

Withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and Syria both represent a realistic reading of the battlefield, writes Blackwill, who served on the National Security Council and as ambassador to India under President George W. Bush.

He also concludes that the U.S. stance on Venezuela has been carefully conceived in coordination with local partners.

Those grades stand in contrast to the assessment of the way the president operates, ignoring much of the national security, diplomatic, and military expertise at his disposal. So for “policy process,” “issues of character,” “promotion of U.S. values at home and abroad,” and “approach to allies” Trump scores straight F's.

Blackwill concludes: “This report, heavily influenced by the president’s realistic approaches to China and the greater Middle East, gives him an overall foreign policy grade of D+, a substantially higher mark for his foreign policies than found on the Sunday talk shows, in the editorial pages of the New York Times and Washington Post, or among many U.S. national security experts.”

Or, he could have added, Republican senators who criticized Trump's plans to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan.

Although Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, writes in a foreword that Blackwill has managed to make a case that flawed individuals can make good policy, “Like Wagner’s music, [Blackwill] argues, Trump’s foreign policy is better than it sounds."

“But I would give President Trump a lower grade on how he has handled Iran, North Korea, and Syria,” Haass continued. “In addition, it is hard to see what the Trump administration has received in exchange for its uncritical embrace of Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or for moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.”

Texto completo: The Pulitzer Prize Board awarded a special citation Monday to the staff of the Capital Gazette for their work in covering the June attack on their Annapolis offices that killed five employees.
The Capital's citation was given "for demonstrating unflagging commitment to covering the news and serving their community at a time of unspeakable grief." The award comes with a $100,000 bequest by the Pulitzer Board - the largest amount ever awarded - to be used to further the newspaper's journalistic mission.
The Capital Gazette staff was also a Pulitzer finalist in the editorial writing category.
In the face of tragedy, the Capital Gazette staffers continued to report on the shooting June 28 that killed Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith and Wendi Winters.
The Pulitzer Prize Board's special citation for the Capital was an unusual decision, existing outside of the 21 categories across journalism, books, drama and music awarded annually. A special citation was last awarded in 2011 to songwriter Hank Williams. The previous record for a cash award was $15,000, said Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy.
Canedy called the prize money a statement of support for local news, and said she hopes the gesture brings a measure of comfort to the staff and their families.
"It was important to us to make the contribution significant enough to aid the newspaper in continuing to do extraordinary community work," Canedy said.
Leadership with Baltimore Sun Media, which includes the Capital Gazette, will work with the newspaper's staff to determine how best to use the funds from the Pulitzer Board, said Tim Knight, CEO of the group's parent company Tribune Publishing, in an email Monday to employees.
"I ask that we pause and consider the remarkable sacrifice and dedication that our journalists poured into their award-winning work," Knight said. "That ... our teams could deliver such precise, compelling, heartbreaking journalism while their own hearts were breaking demands our awe."
Capital editor Rick Hutzell called the citation a "great honor," but one that brought mixed emotions.
"We spent the last couple of weeks talking about what this could mean," Hutzell said of the Pulitzer Board's consideration. "It's a recognition of what happened after June 28. The work we've done in the last eight to nine months speaks volumes about the community of journalism and it speaks worlds about the people in this room."
Staff believe it is the first Pulitzer that the paper has won.
Staffers gathered in the newsroom for a small event that Hutzell said was not quite a celebration.
"We weren't sure what to call this today," he said. "We have some refreshments in the office. We didn't want to have a celebration, but it feels really good that our peers were nationally recognized."
Reporter Chase Cook said the mood among the staffers, former colleagues and family at the gathering Monday was "subdued."
"There was definitely no exciting pop-off like there may have been at other papers," Cook said. "It was a little confused. Was it OK to cheer? It's a complicated feeling. I think we were all overcome with excitement, but also the reminder of the worst day of our lives."
Despite the bittersweet feelings, reporter Selene San Felice said she felt elated to learn of the special citation."[I want people] to know that we do this not for us, but for the community," San Felice said. "We picked up nationwide notoriety after the shooting, but we're reporting for Anne Arundel County, for Annapolis. That's been our goal since day one and nobody's going to stop that."
Trif Alatzas, publisher and editor-in-chief of Baltimore Sun Media, which includes the Capital Gazette, called the award a great tribute to the staff's work under extraordinary circumstances.
"They always came to work and did their job as they remembered Rob Hiaasen, Rebecca Smith, Wendi Winters, John McNamara and Gerald Fischman," Alatzas said. "We also owe an incredible amount of thanks to the entire journalism community, who provided so much assistance throughout the days, weeks and months to help this organization continue on its mission."
Before announcing the winners, Canedy shared strong words recognizing journalists, including those at the Capital Gazette, who have died for their work.
Gov. Larry Hogan tweeted a congratulations to the Capital Gazette and called the prize a "well-deserved honor."
"Gerald, Rob, John, Rebecca, and Wendi will never be forgotten," Hogan said in the tweet.
The 2019 winners and finalists of the Pulitzer Prize, considered one of the highest honors in journalism, were announced Monday afternoon at Columbia University's School of Journalism. Other winners included: the South Florida Sun Sentinel (also part of Tribune Publishing) for its coverage of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland; the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for coverage of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting; and The New York Times for its investigation into President Donald Trump's finances.
Aretha Franklin, who died last summer, also received a special citation from the Pulitzer Prize board, with judges praising the Queen of Soul "for her indelible contribution to American music and culture."
In addition to the Pulitzer citation, the Capital staffers won the 2019 News Leaders Association award for breaking news and were named among Time magazine's Person of the Year for their work as "The Guardians and the War on Truth." And Hutzell accepted the National Press Foundation's Benjamin C. Bradlee Editor of the Year award in February.
The Maryland General Assembly unanimously voted in March to designate June 28 as "Freedom of the Press Day" to honor the fallen Capital employees.

Parents must stop feeding college-admission 'mania'

Texto completo: We have only ourselves to credit or blame. In 2003, I chose to publish my dissertation with ASU on parent involvement in their children's education — rather than focusing on student concerns.
Working with the International Baccalaureate Program at Desert Mountain High School in Scottsdale, I observed firsthand how most parents want only the best for their children, yet today, they often lack know-how in assisting their students over the educational threshold into adulthood.
Now based in Dallas, I continue to collaborate with parents and students nationwide to observe the ethical challenges facing families as students participate in the college application process.
As a parent of three children, I believe most of us personify the best intentions, yet we sometimes prioritize our own competition for the American Dream over our students' educational journey. We may even venture off-course regarding their goals by hyperfocusing on the stats and scores over their learning.
When top-tier educational institutions boast about their numbers, propagating an elite system, our loved ones disportionately focus on how to compete rather than how to contribute. And the mania will continue unless we shift our perspective and stop it.
The New York Times noted recently: "The nation's most selective universities trumpeted the news that they had record numbers of applicants — and record low admission rates."
I take issue with the arrogance of universities "trumpeting" their selectivity while myriad qualified students suffer sincere disappointments with their rejection notices. What makes this information even more disturbing is the recent cheating scandal perpetuated by unethical parents and professionals who have bought into a value system promoting elitism – winners at the expense of losers – as if the remaining 4,000 plus four-year colleges and universities in the United States deliver substandard academic programs.
As first-tier advocates for our children, we need to provide a sense of security as our students anticipate moving away from home to a college campus. Instead, many well-meaning mothers and fathers fall prey to an often impossible competition for highly selective colleges. Just when our children need affirmation, we channel angst. Frank Bruni, in his book "Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be," warned everyone in 2015 of the devastation caused by college admissions "mania."
Yet today, the "mania" expands and flounders — fraught with cheating scandals and void of ethical checks and balances. Instead of competitive inclinations, we as parents must rethink the college application process for the health and well-being of our children.
If we fail to address the herd mentality that can ruin a student's last year at home and beyond, we reinforce a system that neglects learning for learning's sake. To circumvent such nonsense, we must expect skill development that diminishes the stress of test prep and encourage narrative admissions essays that can be quite therapeutic when developing an authentic voice.
As parents, we should support a college admissions process that contributes to learning and improved self-awareness — where collaboration between parents and children rather than mere competition informs a meaningful transition from childhood to adulthood.
This means letting go of unrealistic expectations, reducing the number of schools to which a student applies, creating a balanced list that includes institutions with diverse selectivity, maximizing childhood experiences, and remembering our kids are not unicorns.
So, an important question for parents to ask is the following: What can we do to positively accompany our young people over the threshold of their next educational passage?
The answer must include ethical stances and enlightened awareness of all appropriate university options in the quest for lifelong learning.

ASSANGE IS UNPLEASANT, BUT HIS WORK IS CRUCIAL FREE SPEECH LAWS DON'T DEPEND ON THE LOVABILITY OF THOSE IN THE FIRING LINE

Texto completo: Of all Julian Assange's undoubted talents, maybe his greatest gift is the ability to make enemies. He trusts, likes and respects almost no one. He falls out with his friends and disgusts his opponents. Now that he has been dragged kicking and shouting from the Ecuadoran Embassy in London - where he was, by all accounts, the house guest from hell - he may find few allies in the world outside.
Many conservatives despise him for supposedly imperiling national security. Liberals will never forgive him for what he did to Hillary Clinton. Numerous journalists - perhaps the majority - scoff at his effrontery in identifying as one of them. Women can never forget the never-settled claims of sexual coercion in Sweden.
He is an information anarchist - dumping vast oceans of material into cyberspace with barely a thought for the consequences. He's often portrayed as a useful idiot to Vladimir Putin, an enabler to Donald Trump. He is rude, aggressive, pompous, self-regarding, unreasonable and even - or so say multiple sources - smelly.
There is, in short, much not to love about Julian Assange. He and I collaborated on the release of military and diplomatic documents relating to the Iraq War when I was editing The Guardian in 2010 and 2011. We spectacularly fell out.
And yet. The laws protecting free speech should not depend on the lovability, mental health or personal hygiene of those in the firing line. And Mr. Assange is now very much a target - being threatened with extradition to America to face charges relating to his collaboration with the source of the 2010 WikiLeaks revelations, Chelsea Manning. It may be that we have to suspend our complicated feelings about the man and consider the implications for free expression.
It is interesting what Mr. Assange is not being charged with - at least for now. To have prosecuted him for the substantive content of the stream of Manning-sourced articles - about war, torture, murder and dissembling - would have reopened many cans of worms that too many people would doubtless prefer remained forgotten. And if Mr. Assange was in the dock, why not the editors of The Guardian, The New York Times, Le Monde, Der Spiegel, the Hindu, El Pais and numerous others?
There was a genuine public interest in publishing details of the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq. And in the American authorities' turning a blind eye to systemic torture and murder by its Iraqi allies in 2009. Any mainstream news organization would have gladly broken the news disclosed in the 2010 "collateral murder" video, with its footage from an Apache helicopter showing the killing of a dozen innocent people, including two Reuters news staffers.
It would be difficult to explain why Mr. Assange alone should be singled out for his role in the joint publications.
He is not - at least currently - charged with being the agent of a foreign power or of placing lives in jeopardy. No, the charge against Mr. Assange appears to be more modest, punishable by up to five years in prison.
The unsealed grand jury indictment boils down to two claims, neither of them new: one, that Mr. Assange conspired with Manning to try to get hold of more material, even after she had leaked hundreds of thousands of classified documents; and two, that Mr. Assange attempted - unsuccessfully, it seems - to crack a government password. The benign explanation is that he sought to help Manning avoid detection as the source of the material she was downloading. Others accuse him of hacking, pure and simple.
What are the implications of successfully prosecuting such behavior? To James Goodale, the veteran lawyer who helped The Times defend the Pentagon Papers from the Nixon administration's hot pursuit in 1971, the precedent would be devastating.
"Should Trump's Justice Department succeed in prosecuting Assange," he wrote in Harper's last month, "the only safe course of action for a reporter would be to receive information from a leaker passively." Mr. Goodale worries that courts could end up routinely examining the efforts of reporters to obtain information, thereby potentially criminalizing much reporting.
So why the muted response to the threat against Mr. Assange? Mr. Goodale speculates that the reason more editors and reporters don't leap to his support is because they don't consider him a "proper" journalist.
In a sense they are right. Mr. Assange is a shape-shifter - part publisher, part impresario, part source, part activist, part anarchist, part whistleblower, part nihilist. And, that new 21st-century creature, part journalist.
Mr. Assange does - sometimes - carry out the function of a journalist and thus should benefit from First Amendment protection, just the same as "real" reporters.
Of course, the rather weak allegations against him may be bolstered by more disturbing charges, as United States officials seek to strengthen the case for extradition. We should judge each by its own merit.
But for the moment journalists should look beyond Mr. Assange's erratic character and capacity for making enemies and look at the underlying issue the indictment raises. "If the prosecution succeeds," warns Mr. Goodale, "investigative reporting based on classified information will be given a near death blow."
That's a narrow issue for journalists. But it should matter for a more general public. All around the world repressive regimes are successfully reducing the glare of scrutiny that the press used to shine on them. If we believe that daylight is a necessary condition for democracy - that good societies can't function without transparency and an agreed-upon factual basis for debate and governance - then the defense of investigative reporters, however difficult or even wrong-headed those individuals may be, is important.

Texto completo: WILKES-BARRE, Pa.- Campaign advisers to Bernie Sanders escalated their attacks on a major Democratic-leaning think tank Monday, accusing the group of using corporate donations to mount a "consistent effort to belittle or demean" the independent Vermont senator while seeking to "kneecap" populist support for policies such as Medicare-for-all.
The onslaught, coming as Sanders sits atop national 2020 polls of declared presidential candidates, was the clearest signal yet that he plans to reprise his role as a disruptive insurgent who will run against established Democratic Party institutions even as he seeks the party's nomination.
"I think this time around he wanted to make sure that people understood that he wasn't just going to be a punching bag," said Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, in an interview at the Mohegan Sun Pocono, where Sanders addressed members of a nurses union. "He's comfortable having the fight within the party or outside the party, in general. That's Bernie Sanders."
In a sign of Sanders's newfound power, the targeted think tank, Center for American Progress, or CAP, sought to defuse the conflict Monday afternoon with a conciliatory message.
Sanders has been upset about a video by ThinkProgress, a project of an independent affiliated organization, called Center for American Progress Action, or CAP Action. The video described how Sanders had reduced his use of the term "millionaires" to describe the nation's wealthy after he personally earned more than $1 million in 2017, largely from book sales.
The president of the think tank, Neera Tanden, released a statement Monday saying she had no editorial control over the publications of CAP Action or its news website ThinkProgress, but nonetheless disagreed with the tone of the video.
"The orientation of CAP is to positively engage with all political leaders about the country's future," Tanden said in a statement. "We believe the content of the ThinkProgress video critiquing Sen. Sanders is overly harsh and does not reflect our approach to a constructive debate of the issues."
After the statement was issued, Shakir, who is a former editor at ThinkProgress, said he welcomed the contrition and hoped to meet soon with Tanden to further discuss their disagreements.
"We appreciate the statement. It affirms one of the concerns Senator Sanders had," Shakir wrote in a text message. "Look forward to working in a more productive manner if possible."
But lingering distrust remained between the two organizations, and by extension two wings of a party still nursing wounds from a tense and divisive 2016 primary campaign pitting establishment favorite Hillary Clinton against the insurgent Sanders.
CAP was founded in 2003, by John Podesta, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton who later served as the chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. The group, for which Hillary Clinton raised money, played a major role in providing a policy foundation to the first term of President Barack Obama's administration, and several CAP officials, including Podesta, went on to serve in the Obama White House.
As recently as last year, Sanders attended a CAP ideas conference, where he thanked the group "for all the important work" it had done, and was praised onstage by Tanden. But sharp disagreements over policy began to burst into public view last week, when Sanders reintroduced his Medicare-for-all plan on the same day that CAP had previously scheduled an in-person briefing for reporters on an alternative plan backed by the think tank, called Medicare Extra for All.
Under Sanders's plan, government-backed health care would supplant the current private employer system. Under the CAP proposal, individuals would be able to choose between their current plan and a government-run option. There have been other policy disagreements as well. Tanden personally sided with Clinton over Sanders in a 2016 debate about how quickly to raise the federal minimum wage, calling for a $12 increase, not a $15 increase. CAP, as an organization, did not take a position on that issue at the time.
Realizing the two health-care events would happen on the same day, Tanden said she called Ari Rabin-Havt, Sanders's campaign chief of staff, to make sure he knew it was not an intentional slight. The following day, a ThinkProgress article about Sanders's millionaire status was published, without the knowledge of Tanden or the CAP leadership, the organization said. The article called Sanders's millionaire income "very off-brand and embarrassing."
Rabin-Havt called Tanden to complain about a line in the article that mocked Sanders's physical appearance. Tanden passed on the complaint to the head of Center for American Progress Action Fund, Navin Nayak, who answers to a different board of directors. He passed the complaint onto the editor of ThinkProgress, Jodi Enda, without explicit instructions to make a change, said people familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Enda said she had not seen the story before it published, and in consultation with the story's editor, she decided to edit out the physical description of Sanders, because she said she disapproved of similar physical descriptions of female candidates.
"No one at CAP has ever talked to me about political ideology. No one at CAP has ever said to me you should write nice things about somebody or write mean things about somebody else," said Enda, who employs a staff of nearly 40.
The subsequent publication of a video on the same topic detailing Sanders's shifting rhetoric further infuriated the Sanders campaign, prompting Sanders to write a letter Saturday to the boards of both CAP and CAP Action denouncing Tanden by name for "maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas." The letter was first reported by the New York Times.
"Senator Sanders felt very strongly about this one," Shakir said about the origin of the letter. "He sees that as an effort to kneecap, undermine the effort, the populist support that exists for Medicare-for-all."
The Sanders campaign then sent out a fundraising email Sunday that took an even more aggressive tone, calling CAP a part of "the corporate establishment" that is "bankrolled by billionaires and corporate executives that profit from finance, pharmaceutical companies, fossil fuels, and sending American jobs overseas."
The CAP website lists its corporate donors, which do not include any 2018 contributions from pharmaceutical or fossil fuel companies. People who work at CAP and CAP Action pointed out that because Shakir used to work at ThinkProgress, he was aware of the editorial wall between the think tank and the liberal news and commentary operation.
Other candidates, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have received critical coverage in ThinkProgress, which also has written tough stories about CAP and Tanden's handling of a recent sexual harassment scandal at the organization.
Other Democrats saw Sanders's denunciation of CAP as a worrying sign at the start of the 2020 campaign, which could herald a potentially destructive path that Sanders intends to pursue for the party's nomination.
"I think his tone in general is too Trumplike. It's based on anger," said Greg Hale, a longtime Democratic presidential campaign adviser who worked for Clinton in 2016. "We all need to be together and we need to have a positive message, not a negative message."

Buttigieg kicks off his 2020 campaign

Texto completo: SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Pete Buttigieg, the young Midwestern mayor whose presidential bid has been an unlikely early focus of attention from Democratic voters and donors, kicked off his campaign Sunday and proclaimed his hometown's revival as the answer to skeptics who ask how he has the “audacity" to see himself in the White House.
At a rally inside a partly rebuilt factory, once owned by the automaker Studebaker and now being turned into glass-sheathed offices for tech and other businesses, Buttigieg said, “I ran for mayor in 2011 knowing nothing like Studebaker would ever come back, but that we would, our city would, if we had the courage to reimagine our future."
Buttigieg, a 37-year-old Rhodes scholar and veteran of the war in Afghanistan, would represent a series of historic firsts if elected: the youngest president ever and the first who is openly gay.
Though he is a political progressive, Buttigieg's main message is that he represents the claim to leadership of millennial Americans, those who will be on “the business end" of climate change and left to clean up messes that current leaders have made of health care, immigration, and exorbitantly priced education.
Little known just two months ago, Buttigieg has won support and financial backing through a blitz of television interviews in which he has given earnest, nuanced responses that make liberal points without raising the temperature.
New York Times
Trump's reelection campaign raised $30m in quarter
President Trump raised more than $30 million for his reelection in the first three months of 2019 and now sits atop more than $40 million, his campaign said Sunday.
Trump's campaign — which has set an ambitious $1 billion goal for the 2020 race — launched an aggressive fund-raising push earlier than his predecessors. The campaign has already installed a headquarters in Northern Virginia and is combining a push for both big donations and small contributions online.
Nearly 99 percent of the donations in the first quarter were for $200 or less, according to the campaign, with an average contribution of just more than $34.
Some Democrats are concerned that Trump will spend the next year amassing a war chest as Democrats fight among themselves in a primary contest now featuring nearly 20 candidates. Trump's $30 million haul is about the size of what Senators Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, and Kamala Harris, Democrat of California — the top two fund-raisers so far in the 2020 Democratic field — raised combined in the first quarter.
Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand said Sunday that her campaign has raised more than $3 million in the first quarter.
New York Times
Harris, husband earned almost $1.9m in 2018
Senator Kamala Harris released 15 years of her tax returns Sunday, showing that she and her husband earned almost $1.9 million in 2018.
Most of the adjusted gross income of $1,884,319 in 2018 reported by Harris, Democrat of California, came from the earnings of her husband, Doug Emhoff, as a lawyer. Harris reported $157,352 in Senate salary and $320,125 in net profit from the memoir she released before announcing her campaign. The returns released Sunday covered every year that Harris, a former attorney general of California and district attorney of San Francisco, has served in elective office.
Harris's income has been relatively consistent since she began serving as San Francisco's top prosecutor in 2004.
Washington Post
Congress not 'smart enough' to review taxes, aide says
WASHINGTON — A White House spokeswoman said lawmakers aren't "smart enough" to assess President Trump's tax returns.
Press secretary Sarah Sanders told "Fox News Sunday" she doesn't think House Democrats are equipped to examine the documents, which a key House committee is demanding under a 1920s law. The panel has given the IRS until April 23 to hand over six years' worth of Trump's personal and business filings. Trump said again last week that he won't release them because he is under audit, although the IRS says an audit doesn't bar public release.

Texto completo: Today is Tax Day.
Actually, every day is tax day, with a portion of our paycheck going toward income tax or gas tax or sales tax or other myriad methods used to raise money for services that help develop a civilized society. But today is the day when federal income taxes for 2018 are due.
The federal budget for Fiscal Year 2019, which runs through the end of September, is about $4.4 trillion — a little more than $13,000 per resident. Roughly half of that budget goes toward either Social Security or Medicare, Medicaid and other health care expenditures.
The largest chunk of discretionary spending is for defense, which is about 15 percent of the federal budget — $686 billion for this fiscal year. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the United States spends more on the military than the 10 next biggest-spending nations combined.
This year, the federal government expects to receive about $3.5 trillion in revenue, and you might notice a problem with that. With expenditures exceeding revenue, the deficit is projected to be $897 billion — an unusual situation during a time of economic growth. The national debt has reached more than $22 trillion, with $16.6 trillion of that debt being held by the public, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. That means that by the end of the fiscal year, each American will be holding more than $50,000 in debt accrued by the federal government.
The debt has been exacerbated by the Republican tax cuts promoted by President Trump and passed by a Republican-led Congress late in 2017. Years ago, when Barack Obama was in the White House, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, explained the danger of runaway deficits: “If Congress doesn't stop the overspending, America will cease to be the ‘land of opportunity' we all know … our current national debt is crippling businesses, hurting families and stifling the growth of new jobs.” But with Trump in office, Herrera Beutler supported both the 2017 tax cuts and a sharp increase in spending.
Interest payments on the federal debt are expected to be about $390 billion this year, roughly 50 percent more than in 2017. That interest is expected to outpace even defense spending within a decade. As The New York Times explained last year: “The deficit is soaring now as the economy booms. … The risk is that the government would have less room to maneuver if the economy slows.”
All of that might be a bit wonkish, but it is instructive to consider where your taxes go as Tax Day arrives. It also is instructive to consider whether recent policies have benefited the average taxpayer.
According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of earners received 20.5 percent of the tax cuts that are in effect for this year's filings. And the Internal Revenue Service has one-third fewer auditors than it did eight years ago, even though studies show that the U.S. Treasury reaps $4 for every $1 spent on trying to catch tax cheats. Meanwhile, President Trump refuses to release his tax returns, as has been the norm for presidents for nearly five decades.
Yes, with taxes being due today, we have taxes on our minds. But perhaps we have targeted the wrong milestone. According to The Tax Foundation, Tax Freedom Day for the typical Washington worker won't arrive until Saturday. That is the day that we will have worked enough to pay all federal and state taxes for 2019.
So at least we have something to lo

Texto completo: Sydney Paige Monfries , una estudiante de 22 años, cayó de más de 12 metros de altura por querer tomarse una “selfie” panorámica de Nueva York, desde la torre del reloj de la Universidad de Fordham.
Los hechos ocurriero el domingo en la madrugada, alrededor de las 2:00 a.m., cuando la joven –becaria de la revista InStyle y estudiante de periodismo– y otros compañeros subieron a la torre, a pesar de que estaba prohibido.
Ella era asidua a las selfies, como se puede ver sus perfil de Facebook, pero el domingo murió, tras caer al interior de la torre, tuvo una fractura craneoencefálica, incluso los paramédicos lograron resucitarla en el lugar, pero la joven originaria de Portland, Oregón, murió más tarde en el hospital.

“Con gran tristeza informo que Sydney Monfries, estudiante del Fordham College en Rose Hill, murió hoy después de sufrir una caída dentro de la torre del Reloj Keating en las primeras horas de la mañana. Nuestros corazones están con los padres de Sydney, su familia y amigos” , escribió el presidente de la escuela, Joseph McShane . “No hay palabras suficientes para describir la pérdida de alguien tan joven y lleno de promesas, y solo semanas antes de la graduación”.
El funcionario académico indicó la joven recibirá una licenciatura póstuma, la cual entregarán a los padres.
La torre es un lugar prohibido para los jóvenes, pero eso no ha detenido a los estudiantes curiosos de echar un vistazo.
“Es como una cosa de alto nivel ir al edificio más popular del campus” , dijo Priscilla Morales, una estudiante de psicología, al New York Times. “Recientemente supimos que la puerta estaba abierta o se encontró un acceso. Por lo general, van tarde por la noche alrededor de la 1 o 2 a.m. para beber y disfrutar la vista”.

Texto completo: A former Trump staffer, best known for serving just 11 days in the White House, is the latest conservative pundit to cast doubt on a Joe Biden presidential run because of suspicions around his family's business dealings abroad.
Even as President Donald Trump has berated and dismissed investigations into conflicts within his own business empire, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci said, "There's going to be a lot of scrutiny" on Hunter Biden's dealings with Ukraine's natural gas company, Burisma Holdings.
The comments telegraphed what Trump supporters will likely use to try to discredit the former vice president as the 2020 presidential race heats up.
While conventional wisdom – and many polls – point to Biden as the Democrats' best chance to win back the presidency, Scaramucci said Trump doesn't feel "threatened by Biden at all."
"I like Vice President Biden, but I think he's going to have a few issues," Scaramucci said at an economic development conference in New York when asked about a potential Trump-Biden contest.
"It's not necessarily related to the female touching; it's more related to some of the things that have gone on in terms of his interests that his family may have outside of government," he said.
Scaramucci added that Biden will be the latest "conventional" politician that Trump defeats on a debate stage.
"He does very, very well, where people like him, like that union thing the other night, but when he's in an adversarial position, he has a little bit harder of a time," he said.
In 2015, the New York Times reported that Biden's efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine faced skepticism because of his son's association with Burisma Holdings owner Mykola Zlochevsky, whose bank accounts had been frozen by British authorities as part of an investigation into money laundering.
The Times reported that Hunter Biden had joined Burisma's board of directors in 2014.
A spokeswoman for the vice president reportedly told the Times that Hunter Biden's business had no impact on his father's policy positions.
On Friday, a spokesman for Joe Biden did not immediately respond to a request to comment on this story.
Since 2015, conservative reporters and columnists, including John Solomon at thehill.com and author Peter Schweizer, have published stories alleging Hunter Biden's businesses did influence his father's official acts as vice president.
Those pieces were the sources for Scaramucci's comments, he said Thursday.
The former press secretary also noted that he is loyal to Trump despite having been fired from his position in the White House.
Last month, Reince Priebus, another former Trump staffer, told CNBC that Biden could be a "pretty serious" candidate, but he was doubtful that Democrats would nominate the politician who had represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for 36 years.
The contrasting opinions from the two men who each had served in the current White House reflect broader divisions. After Priebus' name was mentioned on Thursday, Scaramucci, clearly irritated, said, "He tried to destroy me."
"He's got a mortal enemy in me for the rest of his life," he said.

Texto completo: Think of making a budget like spring-cleaning: It's a great way to get things in order around your house, and you'll feel so much better after it's done.
I know lots of people think of a budget as something that limits freedom. (I know because I was one of them.) But just like getting all those old clothes out of a closet and into a yard sale or finally Marie Kondo-ing your kitchen cupboards, there's a sense of relief once it's done. Both spring cleaning and budgeting give you freedom and space to do more of what you want to do.
Here are three things to remember that will make budgeting and spring cleaning much easier:
1. Tackle one area at a time
Don't think you have to clean the entire house in one fell swoop. Pick a small room to start and go after it. Once you have a little task done, go on to something larger. Same goes for your budget. Don't focus on saving 15 percent of your income or tens of thousands for your kids' college fund — that gets overwhelming fast. Start with Baby Step 1: Get $1,000 saved for emergencies. Then, tackle each Baby Step as you get there. For more on the Baby Steps, go to rachelcruze.com.
2. Start with a small task
If you begin cleaning and organizing in your bedroom, do something small and simple like cleaning out a drawer to get yourself into a work groove and see some progress. Just like budgeting for your debt snowball where you target one debt at a time (starting with the smallest), this approach will get you motivated to clean the rest of the rooms in your house.
Here's the next small thing to check off your list. It couldn't be easier to make sure your family, your savings, and your identity are covered with the right insurance policies. Take this 5-Minute Coverage Checkup to see what you need and what you don't: daveramsey.com/cover age-checkup.
3. Give yourself plenty of time
You don't need to have a schedule that would make the hosts of Hoarders beg for a rest. Set a timetable for yourself for each task. It's your house, so that means you get to operate on your clock. There's no need to compare your progress to anyone else's — and no need to think you're not winning because you're not at their level. Same goes for your progress as you budget, save money, and pay down debt.
You may feel like your house and money situation are both in a mess — and who hasn't at one time or another? That's totally normal. But the good news is, both situations can change starting right now.

Pontiac pensioners win battle with Walmart

Texto completo: It was 2012 when a pint-sized David north of Detroit took on a well-known Goliath in Arkansas.
Last week, their epic struggle ended. Contrary to early predictions, a federal court in Arkansas decided in favor of David — that is, the puny City of Pontiac General Employees Union Pension Fund.
After a seven-year slug fest in and out of court, Pontiac's pensioners prevailed in a lawsuit about stock investing against the world's largest retailer, Walmart.
These 1,200 retirees of city government in Pontiac, who live on modest pensions, have yet to receive official notification. And their joint nest egg of about $500 million soon will get merely a modest infusion of perhaps $20,000 or $30,000 — the amount has yet to be calculated, their California lawyers say.
But that's just a fraction of the total payout that retired city unionists in Pontiac have extracted from Walmart, on behalf of countless others nationwide and still more folks around the world.
Under a settlement approved by a judge last week, Walmart is on the hook for a daunting $160 million. That sum that will go to make whole not only the Pontiac retirees but every Walmart stockholder across the nation and around the world who was cheated when investors were misled in a 2011 Walmart report to investors, according to the legal settlement. The report white-washed a massive bribery scandal by Walmart in Mexico, according to a review of the evidence by U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in the Western District of Arkansas.
Asked to comment, Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove, from the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, said last week: "There's really not much we're saying other than we're pleased with the final approval of this settlement."
Walmart had slightly more to say back in October, after the two sides reached a preliminary agreement to settle the lawsuit. At that time, Walmart Executive Vice President and General Counsel Karen Roberts said: "We are pleased both sides could reach a resolution that ends this litigation. Years ago, we began making investments that have established a leading, comprehensive, worldwide ethics and compliance program for our business."
The dollar amount of the recovery per share of stock won't be a windfall. It will vary from shareholder to shareholder, according to the prices they paid to buy the stock during a specific period. Investors who qualify will get back only what they lost, attorneys said.
Still, the legal victory put a big smile this week on Pontiac's former mayor, Walter Moore, 73, chairman of the city workers' pension fund. Moore said he's proud that the city's pensioners stood up to Walmart on behalf of numerous stockholders.
"We in the public employee plans — we have to take on these big companies because if we don't, nobody will," Moore said this week, over a salad in downtown Pontiac.
Judge had a big stick Moore has followed the twists and turns of the complex case, and he said he's grateful to the federal judge in Western District of Arkansas:
"She was amazing. She was soft-spoken but carried a big stick, you know?"
The settlement is poised to benefit thousands of Walmart stockholders across the nation — individuals as well as many pension funds, large and small — who as plaintiffs had charged they'd been cheated by the retailing behemoth, said San Diego attorney Jason Forge, one of nine lawyers from three law firms who argued on behalf of Walmart investors in the class-action lawsuit.
The Pontiac pensioners were the lead plaintiffs, suing "on behalf of all others similarly situated," according to the lawsuit.
"There were many different class members, but Pontiac stepped up and represented everyone," said Forge, who grew up in Farmington Hills and attended law school at the University of Michigan.
"They said, 'On behalf of everybody who bought high and sold low, we want to sue to recover those losses.' So this was for pensioners across the entire country," he said.
As is typical in class actions, Forge and his colleagues spent years on the case without pay or any reimbursement for expenses, all the while hoping for a share of a big settlement. They'll get it. The three firms fighting for Pontiac's pensioners and for other stockholders would've earned nothing if their side had lost. Now they and the consultants they hired will share in a $48-million payday, Forge said.
He said owners of Walmart stock should be grateful to Pontiac's former mayor, who steadfastly nudged the pension fund's board members into suing.
"If it wasn't for the Walter Moores of the world, a lot of individual shareholders would suffer in situations like this. The government doesn't get the job done in these cases. It's really up to the courts to expose these situations and punish corruption," said Forge, who signed key briefs in the case on behalf of his law firm — Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd in San Diego. Meanwhile, an investigation of Walmart by federal authorities is grinding slowly on with no end in sight, he said.
Blue vests and bribes In the long-running securities class-action lawsuit just settled, which will be known to generations of future law school students as City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the small union pension plan represented any individual or group anywhere that bought "or otherwise acquired" Walmart stock between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012.
Walmart in 2018 was listed by Forbes magazine as the world's largest company, both in revenues — more than $500 billion — and in staff size, with 2.2 million employees.
According to the judge's Report and Recommendation in the lawsuit, the company also loomed large in unethical dealings. That judge's report said evidence showed that Walmart was guilty of years of corruption, as it spread about $24 million in bribes across Mexico so that it could rapidly overcome zoning and political hurdles to become in short order Mexico's biggest retailer. Then, after the bribes came to the attention of Walmart's top executives, emails showed that company brass covered up the illegal deals for years.
Finally, just when the retailer's to management learned that the New York Times would soon expose the bribery, after a former Walmart executive tipped off a reporter, Walmart — instead of coming clean with investors — filed false statements about the corruption with the Securities and Exchange Commission, misleading countless investors.
The result?
Investors, including many pension funds, bought the stock when it was priced above $60 and then saw it drop about 5% immediately after the New York Times' Pulitzer Prize-winning article came out in April 2012, according to the litigation.
As seems to occur often in complex legal cases, the initial wrong-doing was not so much the stumbling block for this particular Goliath of a retailer. Instead, it was the subsequent cover-up of the corruption that made humongous Walmart vulnerable to the legal slings of a small pension fund situated 30 miles north of Detroit.
It isn't often that the little guys beat a giant in federal court. Yet, the hope and promise behind this case were enough to draw the attention not only of the New York Times but also from numerous financial publications.
Last week, new stories about the historic settlement favorable to the Pontiac pension fund and to many other Walmart investors splashed Walter Moore's name and references to Pontiac onto numerous legal and stock-watching websites, from Yahoo Finance to Law360.com, as well as into the pages of the New York Times.
The financial outcome, but even more the moral victory of Pontiac's pensioners, "makes me feel so good," Moore said.

Texto completo: Two superheroes, both alike in not taking themselves too seriously, had very different experiences at the box office this weekend.
Warner Bros.'s "Shazam!" made $25.1 million domestically, a solid sum that kept it in first place after a strong debut last weekend.
That PG-13 film centers on a teenager (Asher Angel) who can transform into a hero with an adult body (Zachary Levi) by speaking the word "shazam." Based on a DC Comics character, "Shazam!" has a jaunty and lighthearted tone, and its continued box-office success provides further evidence of the success of Warner Bros.'s shift away from the dark mood of "Suicide Squad" and "Justice League."
"Shazam!" picked up an additional $35.9 million outside of North America this weekend, according to Warner Bros., which brings the film's worldwide gross to $258.8 million. That's more than double the roughly $100 million the movie cost to make.
But a mix of wisecracks and superpowers is no guarantee of success, as evidenced by another new movie: Lionsgate's "Hellboy," financed by Millennium Media.
That film, a bloody, R-rated affair with a cherry-red, semi-demonic superhero (David Harbour) at its helm, landed in third place with a dreary $12 million in North American theaters this weekend, well below analysts' expectations. A reboot of the Guillermo del Toro movies (themselves based on comic books by Mike Mignola), the new "Hellboy" was directed by Neil Marshall, with Harbour taking over the title role from Ron Perlman. It had a production budget of $50 million, according to Box Office Mojo.

Though it keeps the unserious tone that helped del Toro's movies develop a cult following and stand out from other superhero stories, the new "Hellboy" arrived to poor reviews from critics -- it currently holds a 15 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
More successful was Universal's "Little," which landed in second place with $15.5 million, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. It had a reported production budget of around $20 million.
"Little," a comedy directed by Tina Gordon, is like "Shazam!" in reverse: The story is about an adult C.E.O. (Regina Hall) who gets transformed into her 13-year-old self (Marsai Martin).
Paramount's "Pet Sematary," based on the novel by Stephen King, came in fourth place with $10 million domestically.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Baloney is not free, harmless, trivial or abstract

Texto completo: Baloney is not free.
That's important to keep in mind in an era that finds America wading hip deep in a cascading tide of bovine effluvium. This nonsense is not harmless, not trivial, not abstract. And it always exacts a cost.
If some of us ever knew that, they have apparently forgotten. As a result, we have become a nation awash in public lies - conspiracy theories without basis, crackpot pronouncements from figures of authority, misleading, mendacious misstatements false as a four-dollar bill, delivered every minute of every day to our television, computer and smartphone screens
Baloney is not free. Still, the price thus far has been borne by a relative few.
It has cost "only" the parent who paid in heartache when some wild-eyed conspiracist claimed that a beloved child killed in a mass shooting never existed and the shooting itself did not happen.
"Only" the African Americans who paid in deepening estrangement as the first black president was pressured into producing his birth certificate to answer baseless claims that he was not born in this country.
"Only" the pizza restaurant patrons who paid in terror as a man with a military-style assault rifle opened fire in hopes of rescuing child sex slaves he had been led to believe were imprisoned there. But if only a few of us have paid for such baloney thus far, it looks as if the whole country might soon have to ante up. It seems the United States is grappling with an outbreak of the measles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting last week that there have been 465 cases so far this year. That means this is already the second worst year since the disease was reported eradicated in 2000. Measles has shown up in 19 states, including Michigan, Missouri, California, Texas, Georgia, New York and Florida. At the present rate, we will eclipse the previous record of 667 cases, set in 2014.
Officials say the resurgence of the highly contagious, sometimes-fatal disease is driven by the so-called "anti-vax" movement - parents who refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated because they believe the vaccine causes autism. Which it doesn't. The supposed link between vaccinations and autism stems from a 1998 study by a British doctor. The study was debunked, its findings retracted, the doctor defrocked. But the baseless fear he raised lives on.
Now we - actually, our young children - stand to pay for the baloney he sold. The currency will be fevers, runny noses, coughs, watery eyes and rashes. It could be death.
Is that what it will take to finally bring some of us to their senses? There is, after all, something stark and undeniable about the link between cause and effect here, between anti-vaccination and outbreak. Maybe that will show some of us how foolish it is to believe absurd untruths without the slightest evidence. Maybe it will remind them how dangerous it is to abandon the obligation of thinking critically. Maybe it will teach them how dumb it is to consider Facebook more authoritative than the CDC or The New York Times.
And maybe it will remind them that the truth doesn't care what you believe, doesn't care what you want or whom you voted for. The truth just is.
To reject that is to reject the connective tissue that makes nationhood possible, to reject any chance of greater good and common cause, to reject the very possibility of us. So this outbreak, troubling as it is, offers a timely chance for some of us to reconsider the choice to live in nonsense.
Because the cost of baloney is high. And it's getting higher all the time.

Texto completo: Author Amy Rivers will travel to her hometown of Alamogordo on her Southern New Mexico book tour promoting her psychological thriller, which was released on March 5.
The book is Rivers' third, but the first in this genre.
"All the Broken People" tells the tale of Alice, who travels to the kudzu-covered mountains of Pickens County, Georgia to help her mother-in-law after a suspicious fall. Alice must deal with small town thinking as well as her own issues from a difficult past as she finds that family secrets can threaten her very existence, as well as the people she loves.
"I'm fascinated with what motivates people, especially in terms of violent behavior. In my graduate work, I focused on violence prevention and I've always felt that we can't truly prevent something without understanding it," said Rivers.
"I'm not willing to stamp the word 'monster' on someone and then close the door. I want to know why they did what they did, because we all have very complicated and layered backgrounds that impact the way we behave every day. Psychological thrillers allow us to delve deep into the motivations for behavior we might not see on a regular basis."
When asked where she sees herself in 10 years, Rivers said she sees herself on the New York Times Best List in the next 10 years.
Those are high aspirations, but Rivers works every day towards those goals. She not only writes, but also runs her own imprint — a marketing strategy to publish her books with the potential to publish other writers. She is the director of Northern Colorado Writers (NCW) and runs an Airbnb, so most days she has a morning check-in with her personal assistant who keeps her on task. She manages all of this while raising her son and daughter.
Joining NCW early in her writing career was an invaluable part of Rivers' writing experience.
"I took classes, attended and participated in conferences, and made important connections that have helped me stay the course even when it's been difficult, and that writing group gave me the confidence to branch out to others. I can walk into a New York City conference and feel like I belong largely because of the support I've received from my writing group and NCW, my home organization."
While Rivers feels that she wouldn't be where she is today without the support of family and friends, she has had personal limitations to overcome which make her empathetic to the plights of others.
"Being visually impaired is hands down the biggest obstacle in my life. My vision has impacted every part of my personal and professional lives, both negatively and positively," said Rivers.
"I can't drive, which makes it challenging to do things like spend a week on a book tour in New Mexico. But I've also learned to be resourceful and to find my own way of doing things to compensate for both my visual impairment and the way it effects my mobility."
Rivers has similarly adapted in the way she approached the publication of her latest book.
"I learned the importance of following my instincts and hiring professionals to help me polish my work. When I wrote 'Wallflower Blooming' I was working largely on my own," said Rivers.
"With 'All the Broken People', I hired a professional editor, cover designer, and marketing company so that I could focus on making the book look and feel like it came straight out of a big publishing house. I hope to continue improving on that process and working with incredible people to make each new book better than the last."

Students Vote To Support Reparations

Texto completo: Students at Georgetown University voted on Thursday to increase their tuition to benefit descendants of the 272 enslaved Africans that the Jesuits who ran the school sold nearly two centuries ago to secure its financial future.
The fund they voted to create would represent the first instance of reparations for slavery by a prominent American organization.
The proposal passed with two-thirds of the vote, but the student-led referendum was nonbinding, and the university's board of directors must approve the measure before it can take effect.
"We value the engagement of our students and appreciate that they are making their voices heard and contributing to an important national conversation," Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs, said in a statement on Thursday.
The undergraduate student body voted to add a new fee of $27.20 per student per semester to their tuition bill, with the proceeds devoted to supporting education and health care programs in Louisiana and Maryland, where many of 4,000 known living descendants of the 272 enslaved people now reside.
A 2016 article in The New York Times described the 1838 sale by what was then Georgetown College, the premier Catholic institution of higher learning in America at the time.
The college relied on Jesuit-owned plantations in Maryland that were no longer producing a reliable income to support it, so the Jesuit priests who founded and ran Georgetown decided to raise cash by selling virtually all its slaves, receiving the equivalent of about $3.3 million in today's money.
"The school wouldn't be here without them," said Shepard Thomas, a junior from New Orleans who is part of the campus group, Students for the GU272, that worked to hold the referendum. Mr. Thomas, a psychology major, is descended from slaves who were part of the 1838 sale.
"Students here always talk about changing the world after they graduate," he said. "Why not change the world when you're here?"
Mr. Thomas said the amount of the fee, $27.20, was chosen to evoke the number of people sold but not be too onerous for students. Tuition and fees for a full-time student per semester is $27,720.00.
Georgetown University agreed in 2016 to give admissions preference to descendants of the 272 slaves; Mr. Thomas was one of the first to be admitted under the policy. The school also formally apologized for its role in slavery, and has renamed two buildings on its campus to acknowledge the lives of slaves; one is now named for Isaac Hawkins, the first person listed in the 1838 sale.
The university has about 7,000 undergraduates, so the fee would raise about $380,000 a year for the fund.
"It makes me feel happy that we, as students, decided to set a precedent for the betterment of people's lives," Mr. Thomas said.

Texto completo: At the Walker on Wednesday, Claudia Rankine made us listen, feel, think, cringe and laugh out loud. For a cultural force, MacArthur genius, award-winning poet many times over, author of the powerful “Citizen: An American Lyric” and poetry professor at Yale, Rankine is funnier than we expected. She has a big, generous, knowing laugh.
Rankine was here to give what was billed as her Mack Lecture, but it wasn’t a lecture in the usual sense, as “Citizen” isn’t a poetry book in the usual sense. She opened by reading the preface to her new book, “The White Card,” her first published play, which came out from Graywolf last month. Next, actors Stephen Yoakam and Joy Dolo took the stage and read the play’s second act. Then Rankine returned to the podium and announced that the Q&A part of the evening had begun.
No lecture, just straight into what Rankine seems most interested in these days: conversation. Specifically, conversation about race. How can we learn to talk about it honestly, respectfully, without getting defensive and angry and leaving the room? “What do white people need from people of color so they feel OK staying in difficult conversations?” she asked at the Walker. And earlier this year, during “On Being With Krista Tippett”: “How can I say this so we can stay in this car together, and yet explore the things that I want to explore with you?” Rankine has also said that every conversation about race doesn’t have to be about racism. But we do have to talk, and we need to keep talking – about race, white privilege, colorism and the terrorism of white supremacy.
“The White Card” is a conversation among well-meaning people that ends badly. A young black female artist, two wealthy white art collectors, their activist 20-year-old son and a white art dealer have gathered in the collectors’ New York City loft for a dinner party. The collectors specialize in art depicting violence done to blacks – to “prevent the forgetting,” the man explains, and “keep our history in the forefront.” To the artist, they’re collecting black suffering and death.
Much of what the collectors say and assume is tone-deaf and, especially if you’re white, embarrassing to hear. Asked how the play has been received, Rankine replied that some critics said the white people were stereotyped and didn’t get any of the good lines. She noted that much of the dialogue came from talking to black artists, who told her things that had been said to them. She said, “At what point will white people see these not as stereotypical moments, but as things white people actually say?”
When an audience member asked if “The White Card” would come to Minneapolis, Rankine let a cat out of the bag. The play will be part of Penumbra’s next season, to be announced next week. Talvin Wilks will direct. He was in the house and confirmed that Penumbra will produce “The White Card” in early 2020. This will be the second time a work by Rankine has been staged at a Twin Cities theater. In 2017, Frank Theatre brought an adaptation of “Citizen” to Intermedia Arts.
Rankine gave us a glimpse into “Just Us,” her next book on Graywolf, due out in September 2020. “I hired a shrink specifically for this book,” she said. “The format is, I have a conversation, then write it down, then read it to the shrink. I want to know – what are my blind spots? What am I not seeing? Because the person I spoke with is another person.”
Understanding the dynamics that lead to an awkward or offensive situation is important to her. She gave an example from a time she was at an airport, about to board a flight. “I was standing in the first-class line when two white men walked in front of me. I said, ‘Excuse me, I’m in this line.’ One man turned to the other and said, ‘You never know who they will let in.’” It was an awful thing to say. But Rankine knew it wasn’t really about her. “He was embarrassed before the other man,” she said. “It was about him, not about me.” She mentally stepped out of the scenario and took what she calls “a 3-D look” at what had happened.
“The best thing about me is I think a lot of things are funny,” she went on to say. She knew that her presence in that line had challenged the men’s elitism, and she wasn’t sorry. “The reason I found it amusing was I understood the dynamic. A lot of times, it’s not about you. You’re just caught in it. If you call it out, you can put it back where it belongs.”
The Mack Lectures continue next Wednesday, April 17, when philosopher and critic Mark Kingwell talks about “Boredom and the Interface.” Wednesday, April 24, will feature British artist Ed Atkins, whose “Happy Birthday!” video is part of the Walker’s new exhibition “The Body Electric.” So far, this series has been brilliant: Claudia Rankine this week, New York Times foreign correspondent Rukmini Callimachi the week before. FMI and tickets ($25/20).
The picks
Because of the weather, check before you go to see if what you’re going to is still going on.
Tonight (Friday, April 12) at the Uptown Theatre: “Amazing Grace.” The best-selling album of Aretha Franklin’s career, “Amazing Grace” was recorded over two nights in January 1972 at a Baptist Church in Watts. It became the best-selling gospel album in history. Few people know the performances were filmed by Warner Bros. and director Sydney Pollack. Because of a technical error, the footage and sound could not be synchronized and the film was shelved. Finally fixed, and having passed a few more roadblocks, this ecstatic, joy-filled film is having its first release 47 years later. Here’s the trailer. Wow. FMI and tickets.
Saturday at the Hopkins Center for the Arts: Joshua Redman Quartet. Heads up, Joshua Redman fans: He just released “Come What May,” his first recording in almost two decades with his original quartet, so he’s touring behind that. Everyone else: Redman is one of the finest saxophonists playing today, charismatic and electrifying. It’s exciting to be in the same room with him. The quartet’s other members are Aaron Goldberg (piano), Reuben Rogers (bass) and Gregory Hutchinson (drums). Here’s a taste. Social hour at 7 p.m., concert at 8. FMI and tickets ($12-42).
Sunday at Hamline’s Sundin Music Hall: Chamber Music Society of Minnesota: Ieva Jokubaviciute and Ariana Kim. This should be sublime. Lithuanian pianist Jokubaviciute and violinist Kim will play a concert featuring the Minnesota premiere of Lasse Thoresen’s “Invocation of Pristine” (for piano solo); Ruth Crawford Seeger’s Sonata for Violin and Piano; Dvorak’s Piano Quintet in A major, Op. 91; and selections from Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess.” With Young-Nam Kim (violin), Sally Chisholm (viola) and Anthony Ross (cello). 4 p.m. FMI and tickets ($25 adults, $20 seniors; students free).
Monday at North Regional Library: Club Book: Kwame Onwuachi. As a “Top Chef” contestant, Onwuachi made the Final Four on the 2016 season. On Tuesday, Food & Wine named him one of the Best New Chefs of 2019. An ambassador for and expert on Afro-Caribbean fusion cuisine, he’s written a reportedly dishy book about his personal successes and failures and being a black chef in America. 6:30 p.m. Free. FMI. Can’t go? Download the podcast a few days later.
Monday at the Southern Theater: Good Night. Something new at the Southern: a monthly Monday-night showcase of new ideas, works in progress and previews. You might see anything from dance to theater, music, spoken word, comedy and more. For its April 15 inaugural show, Good Night will feature performances by Ballet Co. Laboratory, comedian Corey Adams and the urban and street dancers of MixTape. Each performance will last up to 20 minutes. Stay for the post-show gathering to learn more about the artists and upcoming shows, buy merch and tickets, or just mingle. 7:30 p.m. Pay-what-you-can at the door. FMI. Future Good Nights are scheduled for these Mondays: May 13, June 10, July 22, Aug. 19.

Your lawyer is unreal: How to spot the scammers

Texto completo: Shakespeare once wrote, “First, let’s kill all the lawyers.” And you can insert any of hundreds of lawyer jokes here. (Here’s one: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer? A: His partners.) So why would anybody want to pretend to be a lawyer? It happens, all too frequently, in many guises.
Here are a few to watch out for …
The fake lawyer “suing” you
A common scam these days involves a phone call or an email from someone claiming to be a lawyer representing an opposing party in a lawsuit against you. This fake lawyer may also state they’ve already obtained a judgment against you, and now it’s time to pay up. They may even give you a (fake) case number. Typically they’re demanding personal information and often a settlement amount. Real lawyer (me) wants you to know that’s not how this works.
If there were a lawsuit against you, you would know long before someone started calling to collect money. To start, you would have been served with the complaint. But the easiest way to figure out if the call is from an actual lawyer or even a real lawyer’s office is to ask for the name and bar number of the attorney handling the matter.
If the caller gives you a name and/or number, check with the State Bar of California at calbar.ca.gov/Public to see if the phone number they’re calling from matches the name and bar number you’ve been given. Attorneys (the real ones) in California are required to maintain current contact information with the State Bar.
This faux lawyer wants to represent you
Be wary of scams when you’re searching for a lawyer. Sadly, there are certain areas of law that seem to attract scammers pretending to be lawyers to make a quick buck off your pain. Common areas for this are immigration, disability, troubles with the IRS and personal injury. Signs it’s a scam include demands for large sums of money up front, pressure to retain them immediately, and the insistence that this is an emergency and you’ll soon lose rights if you don’t retain this person immediately.
If you find yourself being approached with offers of representation or even when you’re responding to an ad, be sure to do your due diligence. Again, find out the alleged attorney’s name and check with the State Bar. Check the phone number you’re getting calls from — does it really belong to a law office? Check your gut, too. If you’re feeling pressured, worried, or just queasy, this isn’t the right person to represent you, whether they’re a lawyer or not.
“I’m not a lawyer, I just play one in your documents”
“Document preparation assistance” offices have proliferated in California. You can usually recognize them by their neon signs and big window advertisements stating you can get a divorce, file bankruptcy, do your estate planning … and go home with several Ginsu knives all for $299. (I’m only kidding about the Ginsu knives. Those are extra.)
These offices are staffed with non-attorneys (and, not unheard of, disbarred attorneys) whose role is supposed to be solely to assist you in typing up your paperwork for a divorce, bankruptcy, estate planning or other legal matter. By law, they cannot give you legal advice. What could possibly go wrong?
Well, let me tell you. Here are just a few issues the document preparer cannot advise you on:
* What type of bankruptcy to file
* Is a will sufficient or do you need a trust
* How do your retirement plans or life insurance integrate with your estate plan
* How do federal laws dealing with retirement plans affect your divorce
* How can you tell if the spouse you are divorcing is hiding assets
* Can your soon-to-be ex waive spousal support forever? How about child support?
* Do you need a corporation or a limited liability company? How will that entity be taxed?
And filing incorrect immigration papers can result in permanently destroying a person’s immigration status or losing your place on the years-long INS waiting list.
When you skip the lawyers and head to a “document preparer,” you’re the one who is now “playing lawyer.” You might guess right. You might not. However it turns out, the document preparation assistance guy or gal isn’t responsible — they were just your typist.
Legal matters require legal advice. And yes, we know, it’s not cheap. But it’s cheaper than getting it wrong. If you still go to a non-lawyer, please at least make sure they’re bonded. And remember, they’re not covered by the attorney-client privilege, so anything you discuss with them is not private, and they can be called to testify against you.
The victim lawyer
This is just to make you feel better. Lawyers are becoming the victims of online scams now as well. Usually, it’s someone claiming they need legal assistance and want the lawyer to hold funds for them in the lawyer’s trust account. And guess what they need in order to send that? The lawyer’s banking information. You’re not feeling sorry for us though, are you? It’s OK. We’re used to that.
Q: Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt? A: Because deep down, they’re really good people.

Texto completo: They come from different musical backgrounds but share a common rich culture — and a last name.
One is an innovative Grammy-nominated mandolinist with classical training, and the other is an internationally acclaimed jazz performer and composer. But, combined, Israeli musicians Avi Avital and Omer Avital become Avital Meets Avital, a vision of Mediterranean melodies, from their childhood musical memories to their Moroccan ancestral home.
In a performance at the Diana Wortham Theatre on April 13, Avital Meets Avital will transport Asheville audiences across the globe to the shores of an ancient sea.
Avital Meets Avital "is dialogue between two musicians that have a lot in common but come from different worlds," said mandolinist Avi Avital, co-frontman of the global folk-fusion group. "Omer is a brilliant composer and an acclaimed jazz performer — and I come more from the classical music world. And that's the exciting thing about this project:" It's influenced by so many different elements, "combining the complicated rhythms of the Mediterranean with jazz ... and the finesse of chamber music."
Award-winning bass virtuoso and oud player Omer Avital added: "We explore different Moroccan and north African music, folklore and classical music, Mediterranean sounds, very Israeli harmonies."
The son of Moroccan and Yemeni parents, Omer found musical inspiration from all over the Mediterranean region — and, though Avi studied orchestral music, he's always loved music that reminds him of home.
"Omer (Avital) and I are not blood related," Avi said. "But it's not a coincidence that we share a family name."
While both musicians were born in Israel, they share similar cultural backgrounds, tracing their separate family histories back to northern Africa.
"It suggests that our origins are close together," Avi continues, "and it's very meaningful for this project."
Both Avi and Omer showed an interest in music (along with rapid proficiency) at an early age. By 8 years old, Avi was performing with his local symphony orchestra — and, at age 11, Omer began his formal training, studying classical guitar at Givatayim Conservatory. When Omer began school at Thelma Yellin, Israel's leading high school for the arts, he switched to the acoustic bass and began arranging jazz. Avi, on the other hand, studied at both the Jerusalem Academy of Music and the Cesare Pollini Conservatory of Music in Padua, Italy.
Nominated for a Grammy in 2010 for Best Instrumental Soloist with Ensemble, mandolinist Avi Avital has made a name for himself through his unique interpretations of Baroque and folk music — often taking well-known works written for other instruments and reimagining them as mandolin masterpieces. In 1992, Omer moved to New York City, where he began playing, recording and touring professionally.
Separately, Avi and Omer have been commended by critics — with The New York Times praising Avi for his "exquisitely sensitive playing" and "stunning agility," and Omer praised as "extraordinary" by The New York Times, "roaringly inventive" by JAZZIZ and "one of the most exciting musicians to come onto the jazz scene in the last 20 years" by DownBeat.
When the two come together in Avital Meets Avital, worlds collide. With Yonathan Avishai on piano and Itamar Doari on percussion, Avital Meets Avital takes the audience on a tour of vibrant Mediterranean music traditions — from the melodies and folklore of Morocco and North Africa to the harmonies and rhythms of Israel. Together, these two celebrated instrumentalists create a musical melting pot.
"One of the nicest things about [Avital Meets Avital] is the opportunity to get away from what I do normally every day: playing classical music," Avi explained. "(I get to) put myself a little bit more on the creative side of things. There's a lot of improvisation (in our work together) and there's even some room for me to compose a couple of tunes, and that rarely happens."

When passenger safety becomes a casualty of innovation

Texto completo: I'll never forget my first wasted girl. The young woman was probably 19 to 20 tops. She was so intoxicated, she couldn't remember where she lived. Somewhere in the Inner Sunset. That's all she was able to tell me.
I had just started driving for Lyft and the person who ordered the ride didn't know her. There was a house party, she must have taken something and, yada yada yada, she was my responsibility now.
I was more than a little freaked out. Especially when her first garbled attempt at an address proved futile and she climbed into the front seat of my Jetta.
At this point, she was bawling nonstop. I was on the verge of hysterics myself. Besides the frantic attempt to get her home, I'd already ended the trip through the app, so it was a free ride.
Forty-five minutes later, to my great relief, she finally recognized her building. I managed to help her inside, with only a few more crying jags between the car and her door.
A few months after that, while driving for Uber, a young woman jumped into my car at Market and Eighth Streets and instantly passed out. When the actual person who ordered the ride called me, I had a momentary panic attack. But I managed to figure out where the woman in my backseat lived and get her home.
Over the years, I've found myself in similar situations on numerous occasions. And while I had the routine down to a science by the time I started driving a taxi, the immediate fear that grips you at the onset of these incidents never really goes away.
Most people don't seem to realize just how vulnerable you are on the streets at night, whether you've been partying, or driving for hire.
In last week's column, I wrote about how easy it is for predators to use the Uber/Lyft business models for nefarious purposes. This prompted several readers to contact me and point out that the same thing could happen in a taxi.
It never ceases to amaze me how far Uber/Lyft boosters will go to protect their precious luxury.
While it's true that criminals will always find a way to fulfill their dastardly deeds, a passenger would have to be absolutely wasted to mistake a random car for a taxi.
San Francisco taxis have color schemes for a reason. Phone numbers are prominently displayed on the vehicles for a reason. Top lights are mounted on the roofs for a reason. Cameras are installed for a reason. Licensing, FBI background checks, proper training, permits and insurance are required for a reason. All of these regulations - and more - are mandated by The City to keep the public safe.
Last Thursday, the New York Times published an article on the proliferation of fake Ubers and Lyfts preying on women leaving clubs and bars, as well as tips for how to avoid them.
According to the article, in addition to last month's murder of a 21-year-old University of South Carolina student who mistook a car for her Uber ride, there have been dozens of cases reported over the past few years. And with all this recent attention focused on their IPOs, even more stories are coming to light.
This week, NBC4 and KTLA in Los Angeles reported on a lawsuit filed by three women who'd been sexually assaulted by men pretending to be Uber drivers. Their case alleges that Uber isn't doing enough to implement safeguards to protect riders from these imposter ride-hail drivers.
Uber's response is to try and educate users on how to properly identify their assigned vehicles. This sounds like the same kind of victim shaming you see in the comments sections for these stories.
Uber and Lyft seem to have created a false sense of security. You can't really expect people who've been drinking and/or doing drugs at night to be able to read a license plate or make sure that the thumbnail in their phone matches the dude behind the wheel.
Slowly, people are beginning to realize that the only innovation these companies can brag about anymore is their ability to skirt century-old regulations in order to achieve their own sinister designs. But if Uber and Lyft want to become the largest taxi companies in the world, shouldn't they be required to act like taxi companies?

Texto completo: Books: Discussing Labels, Turning Tables BOOKS THE NEVER-ENDING QUESTION Who Wants to Be a Jewish Writer? Adam Kirsch Yale University Press
THE PROBLEM WITH Jewish writers, Adam Kirsch writes, is that even the best of them detest the label.
Philip Roth famously resisted being categorized as such, as did Saul Bellow, Lionel Trilling and two unnamed novelists whom Kirsch moderates a discussion between at the beginning of his new collection, Who Wants to Be a Jewish Writer? Why accept a label, as Kirsch characterizes their arguments, that seems to "imply that one loves, hates, and so on in a different way from people who are not Jewish"?
Kirsch, who is quite clearly a Jewish writer, does not accept the premise. To be a Jewish writer, he says in the opening essay of his new collection (some original, some previously published), is to write with moral seriousness and particularity, the kind that seems so accessible to the James Joyces and William Faulkners of the world. Those two were "describing a particular way of life with great specificity that they could make it meaningful, even to people who led very different lives," fundamentally "Irish" and "Southern" writers who nevertheless hold universal appeal.
The problem for American Jewish writers, Kirsch theorizes, is the same problem for American Jews, full stop: The condition of each is that their relationship to Judaism is of an "elusive and perspectival quality." They are no longer strangers in a strange place.
Agrande esta imagen.

That is the central tension of Kirschs essays, the best of which blast away at the illusions that sustain American Jewish life. Kirsch, a poet, critic and professor whose work appears everywhere from The New Republic to Tablet, sees quite clearly that the problems of the American Jew and the writers among them are of course one and the same.
Jewish writers in a secular world wish to "transcend" their Jewishness, to be considered simply writers (as the great Austrian-Jewish writer Stefan Zweig did, an episode Kirsch writes about with great tenderness); Jewish revolutionaries wish for the same (as Rosa Luxembourg and Isaac Deutscher did, two iconic Jewish Marxists of the 20th century to whom Kirsch applies Deutschere proud label of "non-Jewish Jew.")
Kirsch's deep familiarity with the texts of Jewish life, though not much directly remarked on, is as much of an argument in itself as what he says on the page. His familiarity with Seamus Heaney is as deep as his knowledge of the Psalms, and rather than setting these texts as oppositional to one another, he seems them as equally rich, complex and worthy of consideration.
To take the Jewish literary tradition as seriously as one takes that belonging to others is to take Judaism as seriously as others take their own lives. There are lots of people and ideas that don't want Jews to acknowledge, live or practice Judaism, he wrote. "We don't escape that danger," he said, "by clamoring to eliminate ourselves."
Not all of the essays concern Judaism directly. His explications of the work of Heaney, Kay Ryan and Christian Wimman are dense but thought-provoking, and "Night Thoughts," a Minima Moraliastyle collection of aphorisms, is a nice break in the action. But even these chapters are about Judaism in the way that Wesley Yang's excellent 2018 collection, The Souls of Yellow Folk, is about the Asian American experience, even when he's not writing about Asian Americans (a book where Yang wonders, among other things, about the connection between the struggles of Asian American writers as they relate to Asian Americans writ large).
Kirsch interrogates some of the very basic assumptions of the American Jewish mainstream with love and with firmness. And you don't need to be a Jewish writer to try and understand what he's saying.
STRANGE DREAMS
Fleishman Is In Trouble
Taffy Brodesser-Akner
Random House
"Toby Fleishman," begins Taffy Brodesser-Akner's debut novel, Fleishman Is In Trouble, "awoke one morning inside the city he'd lived in all his adult life and which was suddenly somehow crawling with women who wanted him."
Fleishman, like Kafka's Gregor Samsa, is inexplicably in a new world after awakening from strange dreams; namely, the dissolution of his marriage, which seems stranger and more distant from him by the day. Armed with a quick and dirty dating app and his newfound freedom, Fleishman's New York is transformed (at a blissful early point in his newly single life, a montage of the women he meets through the app is like a mix of Caligula and 8 1/2 and Manhattan all together).
Fleishman, henpecked doctor, self-doubting dieter, loving father and the aggrieved party in his divorce, is a new man. As he settles into this new world, the long and torturous history of his marriage to Rachel is drawn out detail by icky detail, and a picture emerges of Rachel, too - haughty breadwinner, social climber, barely present mother and frigid, nasty wife.
When Toby awakes on a different morning to find that his soon-to-be-ex-wife has dropped their kids off at his apartment without warning, and cannot be reached through any form of communication for weeks, this picture only comes more clearly into focus, and Toby's newfound ability to direct her cruelty back toward her via snarled text and email is a cause for cheering. He will no longer be made the wife in this divorce, as his lawyer tells him he is.
It is, of course not so simple, and Brodesser-Akner, who writes enormously popular profiles for The New York Times Magazine, approaches her characters in the same way she approaches her subjects at her day job: She doesn't allow them to present themselves on their own terms forever. However revealing it is to see what people choose to reveal about themselves to you, there's no substitute for a simple change in perspective.
Though much of the story is told from Fleishman's point of view, there are increasingly frequent interventions from his friend Libby Epstein, a former men's magazine writer who finds herself suffocatingly contented by her family in a New Jersey suburb (Brodesser-Akner herself once wrote those enormously popular profiles for GQ). It is through Epstein, a close friend of Toby's since they studied abroad in Israel together, that the more self-serving aspects of Toby's storytelling are cast in a new light.
It is through her - and increasingly, through Toby's actions - that the true story of Rachel, Toby and their years together is told. Surprise! Toby's victimhood is often of his own making, and Rachel's witch-ness has been more than a little misrepresented. Neither party is completely guilty, though they're both far closer to that than to innocence.
It seems such an obvious lesson: There's another side to this story! And yet, by withholding Rachel's full account until nearly the end of the book, Brodesser-Akner implicates the reader in Toby's cruelty (you want him to get full custody). If Rachel's telling had never been brought to light, Fleishman Is In Trouble is the story of poor Toby Fleishman who gets to be free of his bitch wife, and the reader is none the wiser - did we even want to hear the other side? Instead, it's a story about the use and misuse of stories, the way that they mutate into grotesquerie or sunshine-y bliss, whichever is more suited to our conception of ourselves. Fleishman, again like Gregor Samsa, never even realizes that he was always an insect - or, in Fleishman's case, as cruel and angry as Rachel told him he was.
Brodesser-Akner is a terrifically funny writer - here and there, she drops in empowerment-slogan yoga tank tops that become funnier with each repetition (Ñamaste In Bed!) - and one can only hope that she never gets the chance to lift a boulder and look at the creepy-crawlies of your life in the pages of the Times.

Senator releases '18 taxes as Democrats pressure Trump

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren released her 2018 tax return Wednesday morning, joining a growing group of Democratic presidential contenders who have made the information public as they seek to use the issue of financial transparency as a cudgel against President Trump.
Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, reported a combined adjusted gross income of $846,394, and had $230,965 in total taxes, according to the return, a drop of about $67,000 from her adjusted gross income in 2017. Overall, they paid about a 26 percent tax rate, down from nearly 28 percent in 2017.
The couple's main sources of income were $402,897 from Harvard, which Mann earns as a law professor, Warren's $176,280 salary as a senator, and $324,687 in writing income related to her books (Warren is also a professor emeritus at Harvard, but does not draw a salary for that title). Those added up to a total income of $905,742 before various deductions.
After withholdings and other payments, Warren and Mann owed $24,477 in taxes for 2018, and made $50,128 in charitable gifts.
Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has called for more transparency in government as a way to curtail corruption and self-enrichment in Washington, put 10 years of her tax returns online last summer.
The release of tax returns from presidential candidates like Warren, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota comes as Democrats ramp up pressure on Trump to release his own tax returns, which he has refused to do in defiance of longstanding norms around the presidency. Representative Richard Neal, the Springfield Democrat who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, requested Trump's returns last week, and other Democrats in the House are seeking ways to get to the returns.
Warren is among a group of candidates who have revealed more than a decade of their own tax returns, hoping to draw a contrast with Trump and pressure other Democrats, such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former Texas Representative Beto O'Rourke, to do the same.
But by drawing attention to their own personal finances, Warren and some other Democrats also are highlighting their own wealth, creating someawkwardness as they vie to take on the billionaire Trump by emphasizing issues such as economic inequality and the eroding middle class.
According to her reported financial disclosure forms, which list assets in ranges, Warren and Mann hold between $4 million and about $11 million in investment funds and retirement accounts. Last year, she also received a $300,000 advance for her book, “This Fight is our Fight."
Sanders, who has been criticized for not releasing more of his tax returns, told The New York Times on Tuesday that he plans to do so by April 15 — and said he had crossed into millionaire territory thanks to his book sales. O'Rourke had a net worth of nearly $9 million in 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and has told reporters on the campaign trail he plans to release his tax returns soon.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Lawyers for Gregory B. Craig, a White House counsel in the Obama administration, expect him to be indicted in the coming days on charges related to his work for the Russia-aligned government of Ukraine.
The case against Mr. Craig, 74, stemmed from an investigation initiated by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
An Ivy League-educated lawyer who held prominent positions in the Clinton and Obama administrations, Mr. Craig would become the first person who made his name in Democratic Party politics to be charged in a case linked to the special counsel's investigation.
Mr. Craig would also become the first person to be charged in a case connected to the special counsel after Mr. Mueller finished his investigation into the 2016 presidential election. In a summary of the inquiry, Attorney General William P. Barr said that the special counsel's team had concluded that there was no evidence that President Trump or his aides "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."
The case against Mr. Craig is related to the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which the Justice Department is prioritizing in part because of scrutiny related to Mr. Mueller's investigation.
The law requires Americans to disclose detailed information about lobbying and public relations work for foreign governments and politicians, and it has been the basis for charges brought against several people investigated by the special counsel.
Mr. Craig's lawyers do not necessarily expect him to be charged with violating the act.
Rather, they expect him to be charged with making false statements to the Justice Department officials examining whether he was required to register under the law for work he did in 2012, while he was a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
The work, on behalf of the government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine, was linked to Paul Manafort, who at the time was a political consultant earning tens of millions of dollars for his representation of Mr. Yanukovych.
Mr. Manafort, who went on to become Mr. Trump's campaign chairman in 2016, was sentenced last month to seven and a half years in prison on charges brought by Mr. Mueller's team related to obstruction of justice and violations of FARA, as well as banking and tax laws stemming from his work in Ukraine.
Mr. Manafort arranged for Skadden Arps to be paid more than $5.2 million in 2012 and 2013, primarily from a Ukrainian oligarch, to assist the Ukrainian Justice Ministry. Specifically, Mr. Craig and his team produced a report that Mr. Manafort intended to use to quell Western criticism of the prosecution and jailing by Mr. Yanukovych's government of one of his rivals, the former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, and to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case.
After the report was released, and Mr. Craig was quoted discussing it in an article in The New York Times, the Justice Department unit that oversees FARA reached out to Skadden Arps to ask why the firm and its lawyers had not registered as foreign agents for the Ukrainian government.
The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was obligated to register. But it reversed itself the next year after Mr. Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine.
After the initial determination, Mr. Craig told the Justice Department that he and Skadden Arps did not proactively reach out to news outlets to disseminate and promote the report. Rather, he claimed he distributed the report only "in response to requests from the media," according to a letter he sent to the department at the time.
Prosecutors cast doubt on Mr. Craig's claim in a settlement reached in January between the Justice Department and Skadden Arps. Under that settlement, the firm avoided prosecution in the matter in exchange for an agreement to pay $4.6 million, to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA, to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on behalf of Ukraine.
But the settlement did not exonerate Mr. Craig, and in fact it signaled that he was in prosecutors' cross hairs. It quoted emails showing Mr. Craig reached out to a journalist to offer to provide the report and discuss it.
Neither Mr. Craig nor the journalist are identified by name in the settlement. The journalist, David E. Sanger of The New York Times, is an author of the article in which Mr. Craig is quoted.
Mr. Craig's lawyers have argued that he was not required to register his work under FARA because he was not doing public relations for the Ukrainian government.
In a statement on Wednesday, they said he "repeatedly refused requests that he participate in Ukraine's media and lobbying campaign to promote the Tymoshenko Report."
Rather, they say he spoke to The Times to correct the Ukrainian Justice Ministry's claims that the report cleared Mr. Yanukovych of accusations that he directed the prosecution of Ms. Tymoshenko for political purposes.
The report "was critical of the Tymoshenko trial and caused unhappiness in the Ministry of Justice," the lawyers said in their statement.
Mr. Craig's lawyers asserted that the case against their client was flimsy, pointing out that Mr. Mueller's team referred it to federal prosecutors in Manhattan last year for potential prosecution related to FARA, but that they did not bring charges. Instead, the case was moved in January to Washington.
It is being handled by the United States attorney's office in Washington, and the Justice Department's National Security Division, which enforces FARA.
Mr. Craig's lawyers said in the statement, "We expect an indictment by the D.C. U.S. attorney's office at the request of the National Security Division." But they added, "Mr. Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government's stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion."
Mr. Craig left Skadden Arps last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr. Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his work on the effort.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
On April 6, something known as the GPS rollover, a cousin to the dreaded Y2K bug, mostly came and went, as businesses and government agencies around the world heeded warnings and made software or hardware updates in advance.
But in New York, something went wrong -- and city officials seem to not want anyone to know.
At 7:59 p.m. E.D.T. on Saturday, the New York City Wireless Network, or NYCWiN, went dark, waylaying numerous city tasks and functions, including the collection and transmission of information from some Police Department license plate readers.
The shutdown also interrupted the ability of the Department of Transportation to program traffic lights, and prevented agencies such as the sanitation and parks departments from staying connected with far-flung offices and work sites.
The culprit was a long-anticipated calendar reset of the centralized Global Positioning System, which connects to devices and computer networks around the world.
There has been no public disclosure that NYCWiN, a $500 million network built for the city by Northrop Grumman, was offline and remains so, even as workers are trying to restore it.
City officials tried to play down the shutdown when first asked about it on Monday, speaking of it as if it were a routine maintenance issue.
"The city is in the process of upgrading some components of our private wireless network," Stephanie Raphael, a spokeswoman for the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, said in an email on Monday. She referred to the glitch as a "brief software installation period."
By Tuesday, the agency acknowledged the network shutdown, but said in an emailed statement that "no critical public safety systems are affected."
Ms. Raphael admitted that technicians have been unable to get the network back up and running, adding, "We're working overtime to update the network and bring all of it back online."
The problem has raised questions about whether the city had taken appropriate measures to prepare the network for the GPS rollover.
Ms. Raphael did not respond to questions about what the city had done to prepare for the rollover; she said that the city pays $37 million a year to Northrop Grumman to maintain and operate NYCWiN. A Northrop Grumman spokesman referred all questions to the city.
"If the city's paying $40 million a year to maintain software infrastructure, first, when it goes down, the Council and the public should know about it," said Councilman Brad Lander of Brooklyn, who learned about the shutdown when he was told of it by The New York Times.
"And two, if it's mission critical, then it should be clear: the effort to get it up and running, and account for those things that are lost."
Mr. Lander, who sits on the City Council's technology committee, said that the committee might hold a hearing to look into the cause of the shutdown and how it was handled.
Many computerized systems use the Global Positioning System as a timekeeper because it is convenient and easy to connect to, according to a Department of Homeland Security advisory about the reset posted on the agency's website.
Approximately every 20 years, the GPS needs to reset the way it keeps track of weeks, and Saturday, April 6, was the date selected for the most recent reset. The reset also came with an improvement in timekeeping that means the next rollover will not be needed for about 157 years.
According to Homeland Security, which first issued a notice about the rollover a year ago, newer systems were considered to be safe but older equipment might need updates to software or hardware.
Ms. Raphael would not provide a list of agencies that use the system.
But a Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications alert that went out on Saturday showed that 38 Police Department license plate readers had gone down. The city maintains a system of license plate readers mounted at fixed locations and on patrol cars, which it uses to scan license plates. That has helped it in routine crime fighting, such as finding stolen vehicles, and its antiterrorism work.
Phil Walzak, a police spokesman, said the department had hundreds of license plate readers, most of which did not rely on the NYCWiN system. He said that patrol cars with readers mounted on them were stationed at key locations affected by the shutdown and that "the N.Y.P.D. has not experienced disruption to operations, investigations or services."
Saturday's alert also reported that 12,389 traffic-signal controllers were down. According to the information technology agency's website, the Transportation Department's Traffic Management Center uses the network "to centrally monitor and wirelessly program traffic patterns during rush hours, special events and emergencies."
While traffic signals continued to operate normally, a city official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the shutdown and asked not to be named, said that there was concern that as they remained disconnected, the timing of individual signals could drift slightly and they could eventually come out of sync with one another.
Laura Anglin, the deputy mayor for operations who is responsible for the information technology agency, refused to answer questions about it on Wednesday afternoon as she entered City Hall.
Asked if the city had taken the necessary steps to prepare for the GPS rollover, she said, "Talk to the press office."
The disruption also affected the transportation department's Real Time Traffic Information webpage, where people can look at the video feeds from hundreds of cameras posted around the city. The webpage showed that many cameras were not working on Wednesday.
The alert indicated there were also disruptions to the city payroll system, known as CityTime, and systems used by the departments of health, sanitation and parks.
The wireless network was intended to fill a gap in the ability of city agencies to communicate with one another and get access to information, a problem that was exposed during the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, when police and fire department officials could not talk to one another because their radios used different frequencies.
The network began operating in 2008, but it quickly drew criticism for being underused and failing to live up to its promise.

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert Mueller provides a "fuller explanation" on obstruction of justice in the report that will be released next week, Attorney General William Barr testified Wednesday.

During a hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., asked Barr if he had any conversation with Mueller about why he did did not reach a conclusion one way or the other on whether President Trump obstructed justice.

"Yes, I did. And he also has a fuller explanation of that in the report that I'll be making available hopefully next week," Barr replied.

Mueller concluded his months-long Russia investigation last month, after which Barr submitted a four-page letter that stressed the special counsel's did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Barr also said Mueller left the obstruction question unresolved. A line taken from Mueller's final says, "while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him." Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein found there was a lack of “sufficient” evidence to determine whether Trump obstructed justice.

Barr appeared before a congressional committee for a second day in a row on Wednesday -- both hearings were intended to focus on the proposed Justice Department budget, but often got sidetracked with questions about Mueller's investigation.

In his appearance Tuesday, Barr said Mueller played no role in crafting the summary and added he suspects special counsel Robert Mueller's team "wanted more" out of his summary of the final report for the Russia investigation.

Democrats not satisfied with Barr's summary, who are angling to get access to Mueller's full report, were further incited by reports last week from the New York Times and Washington Post in which anonymous sources said members of Mueller's team were frustrated with the way Barr portrayed the findings in his summary.

In a March 29 letter, which followed the summary, Barr identified four categories of information that will not be made public in the redacted report he intends to release, including material related to grand jury proceedings which by law cannot be made public, information deemed by the intelligence community to compromise sensitive sources and methods, details that could affect other ongoing investigations — including those referred by the special counsel’s office to other offices — and material that would “unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.”

Barr testified Wednesday that he never "overruled" Mueller on any redactions.

The Judiciary Committee, ruled by Democrats, voted last week in favor of subpoenaing Barr to turn over the entire Mueller report.

However, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Tuesday his panel will not actually issue a subpoena for Mueller's full report until they see the redacted version provided by Barr.

WISCONSIN VINYL COLLECTIVE TAKES THIRD SPIN THROUGH LOCAL MUSIC; MUSIC

Texto completo: Michael Perry is a cheesehead through and through. He was born in the northwestern Wisconsin town of New Auburn and spent his youth as a "farm kid," growing up with "black-and-white cows and red barns on a little dairy farm in Wisconsin."
After a short stint in Wyoming during his college years, he returned to the Badger State to work as a pig farmer.
Perry, along with his band the Long Beds, is one of the 10 unique voices that appear on volume three of Wisconsin Vinyl Collective, a collection of songs by artists with state or regional ties. The release will be available digitally as well as on a special vinyl release during this Saturday's Record Store Day.
Bascom Hill, Kerosene Kites, Derek Pritzl and the Gamble, Lost Lakes, Madison Malone, Christopher Gold, The Belle Weather, LASKA, and Craig Baumann are included. OSG is also featured on the record.
A series of shows in Viroqua, Appleton, Madison and Milwaukee will celebrate the album's release with Perry's band headlining.
"I love being from and of Wisconsin," said Perry. "I'm grateful to have grown up here, and no matter where I wind up in the long term, I'm just always going to be a cheesehead.
"Wisconsin has such a wide range of people and pursuits. With those songs in vinyl, it's literally these rings of different experiences laid out across that disc. You're quite literally getting a cross section of experience and insight."
His contribution, "Thread," a spoken word piece set to music, acts as a coda to the collection. Perry, who is also a New York Times-bestselling author, added words to an instrumental provided by the band's guitarist and musical director Evan Middlesworth.
"I just listened to it and reacted to it in real time and wrote what I felt and what I saw in my head when I heard that music that Evan had created," said Perry.
While he has written many songs in the typical sense, "Thread" finds him experimenting with the use of spoken word.
"When I was in college, I wound up going to (open mic) poetry readings," he said. "I started writing spoken word pieces way back when I was still a college kid and I had no clue. I still had cow manure on my boots, man. But that was my gateway into writing. That's how I fell in love with writing and words, and it led to my whole unexpected life as a writer. I never saw any of that coming. I did not come from artists, or I don't have an artistic education, an artful education."
On "Thread," Perry talks about post-winter. Wisconsin Vinyl Collective founder Erik Kjelland, who plays in The Mascot Theory and runs Stone After Stone Records, thought it was a good song to release in the spring.
Kjelland has compiled all three volumes with the help of musician and producer Butch Vig.
"We're trying to expose folks to music from Wisconsin artists maybe they haven't heard before," Kjelland said. "Any time we can introduce folks to new?state artists, or regional artists, I think that's always a huge thing."
The project will support Keep Wisconsin Warm/Cool Fund, a statewide nonprofit that assists low-income households that cannot afford to pay their energy bills.

Tampa’s master of hugs weighs in

Texto completo: Tactile politics, the New York Times called the former vice presidents handsy ways. And it should go without saying that no one should have to put up with any contact theyre not okay with.

But its interesting how Bidens issues have been interpreted in different ways: First, that he is just one more white-haired guy the world has passed by, somebody who doesnt get that what was once tolerated is no longer.

Or, in the alternative, that the #MeToo pendulum that absolutely had to move against powerful men who took lecherous advantage of women swung wide, leaving not much room for nuance or lack of bad intention.

Which brings to mind our own Dick Greco.

In a career that includes four terms as Tampa mayor, Greco, now 85, turned physicality in politics into high art. He is the undisputed master of the I-could-not-be-happier-to-see-anyone-in-this-world-than-you hug and the patented full-body handshake, delivered with such zeal that afterward you could be dusted for his fingerprints. Or so the joke went.

Greco talks about how he was brought up in an Italian family where he knew he was loved from the day he was born, how he always kissed everyone goodbye. I like people  men, women, he says, and its true his affection with friends and strangers is gender-indiscriminate. He sounds troubled at what the Biden news could mean.

If you do something totally inappropriate, its wrong. Its as wrong as you can get, he says. But if everybody stops  (if we) dont dare say, You look nice today  I dont get it. If no one ever hugs each other or kisses each other, what kind of society are we going to be? I cant imagine it, I really cant.

(Republicans, by the way, might not want to get too giddy about those who have said ick about Biden, given President Trumps own graphic and taped opinion on where he thinks its okay to grab women.)

For perspective, I call Pam Iorio, also a former mayor and a pragmatic politician if ever there was one, not given to tolerating nonsense.

She points out three things for consideration on the subject of hugging et al.: Context, intent and culture.

A group of scholars and industry leaders are set to have a timely debate about fracking and its associated benefits and drawbacks at the University of Colorado Boulder's Conference on World Affairs on Wednesday.
Boulder Mayor Suzanne Jones will moderate the policy debate among Ivan Penn, energy correspondent for the New York Times; Steven Rubin, associate professor of art at Penn State University; and Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Oilfield Services.
"My role as moderator is to make sure we have a lively and thorough review of the facts around the fracking issue," said Jones, adding that in her role she will seek a full vetting of the facts but will not take a side.
Last week, the Colorado Legislature passed Senate Bill 19-181 , which Gov. Jared Polis is expected to sign and which will make sweeping changes to the way oil and gas is regulated in the state. And the Denver Post on Sunday reported that Colorado public health officials have let oil and gas companies begin drilling and fracking for fossil fuels without first obtaining federally required permits that limit their emissions, a practice that might not be legal under the federal Clean Air Act.
Boulder voters in November also overwhelmingly supported a ballot measure that authorizes the city to tax the extraction of oil and gas.
"This is an issue near and dear to Boulder, so I look forward to a lively but respectful debate," Jones said. "... Even though this is a national discussion, it's very timely at a local level as well."
Penn, who writes about issues related to the electric grid, said one of the big debates has been about how to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
"One of the big things right now is this question of natural gas serving as the bridge between where we have been with fossil fuels, supplying the generation for the grid in large part, to the shift to carbon-free sources of generation," Penn said. "A great part of the debate has been up until now that renewables weren't ready for prime time in terms of supplying the entire grid. Those things are quickly shifting."
Solar and wind prices have dropped dramatically over the last decade, he said, to the point that in some cases solar plus its storage is cheaper than the natural gas alternative.
During the boom in clean energy sources, there also has been growth in liquid natural gas as an export, he said, though no state runs entirely on carbon-free electricity.
"The thing is, a lot of our energy still is coming from natural gas," Pennsaid. "You're dealing with the transition. The question is how fast the transition is going to take place."
Wright said he supports more energy, more reliable energy and cheaper energy, regardless of where it comes from, because he sees it as an equity issue.
He said he did not want to discard residents' concerns about oil and gas operations near their homes, and said the dialogue around various energy sources is important to evaluate options.
"I'm all in favor of the honest dialogue," Wright said. "Are there tradeoffs? Of course. There are tradeoffs with everything in life, but we should try to rationally evaluate the downsides and the pluses of various energy sources and look for what's got the greatest net benefit."

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders became the most famous socialist in America -- and then he became a millionaire.

On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that after a long pressure campaign, Sanders has agreed to release the past ten years of tax returns, and they will reveal that the man who built a political career railing against capitalism, has joined the ranks of the top one percent.

“I wrote a best-selling book,” Sanders told the newspaper. “If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.”

A week after the 2016 election, Sanders released the book "Our Revolution," a mix of campaign memoir and political manifesto. It became a New York Times bestseller.

Sanders began his campaign trailing Hillary Clinton by over 60 points in polls, but his socialist outsider message appealed to younger voters, liberals, and those who wanted to challenge the system, and he made it into a real race.

Ironically, his long harangues against the rich, by making him into a national celebrity, in turn enabled him to build a successful brand and cash in.

Texto completo: En el juicio de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera hubo varias revelaciones sobre la operación del Cártel de Sinaloa, homicidios, traiciones y un largo etcétera, pero hubo temas que no fueron tratados en la Corte de Brooklyn, debido a limitantes que fiscales federales lograron, ya que podrían afectar a sus cooperantes.
También los abogados del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa tuvieron que acceder a que alguna información fuera retenida, como la supuesta compra de menores por parte del mexicano para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas .
Esa historia se hizo pública a pocos días de que el juicio terminara, lo que incluso desató una polémica con los miembros del jurado, quienes afirmaron no haber leído al respecto en internet, debido a que una de las reglas que se les impuso era no buscar historias sobre Guzmán Loera en redes sociales o cualquier página en la web.
Tras una batalla legal de abogados de VICE News y del New York Times, algunos documentos serán liberados, como uno hecho público hace unos días, donde se indica que Alex Cifuentes , ubicado como W1 (Testigo 1) era un testigo complicado, debido a sus creencias y práticas esotéricas.
Cifuentes, quien vivió con Guzmán Loera en las montañas de Sinaloa, creía en la brujería, además de tener “creencias poco ortodoxas “, innecesarias para el caso, consideraron los fiscales.
El colombiano, quien acusó que su exsocio pagó $100 millones de dólares al expresidente Enrique Peña Nieto , podría haber sido descalificado también por creer en los extraterrestres y de que habría un apocalipsis en el 2012 .
También creía en los Illuminati, la masonería y otras teorías de conspiración que afectarían su testimonio ante el jurado y la opinión pública, ya que fue quien reveló el estilo de vida de Guzmán Loera, cómo escapó de las montañas, explicó su círculo de seguridad, los negocios de drogas con socios de Colombia y Ecuados y la apertura de nuevos mercados, como el de Canadá.

NY bills target Trump returns

Texto completo: ALBANY — Some New York Democrats think they have a new way to get at President Donald Trump's tax returns.
A bill introduced Monday by a Democratic senator would allow the state tax department to release a president's state tax returns if any of three congressional committees asks for them.
Sen. Brad Holyman, D-Manhattan, said the measure would be a way to assist the Democratic-controlled House in its efforts to review the president's state returns, which would have a bevy of information since Trump and his businesses are based in New York.
"Americans deserve to know whether the person who sits in the highest office of the land has conflicts or potential conflicts of interest," Holyman said Monday.
The bill is latest attempt by Democrats in the state Legislature to try to find a way to compel the president to release his state taxes.
The proposal would allow three congressional committees — the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation — to request from the state Department of Taxation and Finance the president's federal tax returns.
The New York bill comes after House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., last week asked the IRS to release six years of Trump's tax returns by April 10. But the Trump administration has resisted.
White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday called the efforts by Democrats a "political stunt."
He said the issue of Trump's tax returns "was already litigated during the election."
"Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn't, and they elected him anyway, which is, of course, what drives the Democrats crazy," Mulvaney said on "Fox News Sunday."
Some New York Democrats believe they are in a unique position to pass a state law that would force the release of Trump's state taxes because he is a New Yorker.
Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-Manhattan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told The New York Times the New York bill would be helpful.
"The state return, presumably, has to match the federal return," he said, adding, "It just makes the work of the federal committee, that has a legitimate reason to look into this, a little easier to see the complete picture."
Holyman has helped introduced three bills in New York to try to get Trump's state taxes.
The latest had yet to get an Assembly sponsor.
One measure, called the NY TRUTH Act, would require all statewide elected officials, including the president and vice president if they file New York income taxes, to release their taxes publicly each year.
Another would keep Trump off the state's 2020 ballot if he doesn't release his taxes, a bill similar to ones being considered in other states, including New Jersey, where it passed but was vetoed by then-Gov. Chris Christie, a Trump ally.
So far in New York, though, none of the bills has been successful. Yet there is renewed hope this year because Democrats control the state Legislature; Republicans had held the Senate majority for the past eight years.

Terrorist Label For Iran Force

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump said on Monday that he was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization, the first time that the United States has named part of another nation's government as that type of official threat.
The designation imposes wide-ranging economic and travel sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as well as organizations, companies and individuals with ties to it. Iran's Revolutionary Guards carry out operations across the Middle East, train Arab Shiite militias and oversee businesses in Iran.
Monday's designation "will significantly expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the Iranian regime," Mr. Trump said in a statement.
The designation was opposed by some top Trump administration national security officials who said it could incite retaliation by Tehran against American troops and intelligence officers. It takes effect April 15, but was announced Monday in what American officials described as a chaotic and rushed process.
In Baghdad, where some Iraqi officials have close ties to Iran, American officials said they had been given no guidance on how to enforce the policy.
The timing of Mr. Trump's announcement appeared aimed at giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel a final boost in a tight re-election campaign before a vote on Tuesday. Mr. Netanyahu and Trump administration officials have said Iran is the greatest threat to Israel, and Mr. Netanyahu immediately thanked Mr. Trump in a Twitter post.
Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly raised the specter of the Iranian threat to Israel and tried to reinforce the notion that his close ties to Mr. Trump strengthen Israeli security.
In thanking Mr. Trump on Twitter, Mr. Netanyahu took credit for the idea of the terrorism designation. "Once again you are keeping the world safe from Iran aggression and terrorism," Mr. Netanyahu wrote in English, while writing in a separate tweet in Hebrew, "Thank you for accepting another important request of mine."
Last month, in an effort to bolster Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; the United Nations considers it occupied territory.
After Mr. Trump's announcement, Iran's Supreme National Security Council said it was designating as a terrorist organization the United States Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East.
Iraqi leaders had no immediate reaction, although Karim al-Nuri, a senior figure in the Badr Organization, an influential Iraqi Shiite militia, said there may not be much direct effect.
"But it will put more pressure on Iraq" from Tehran to grow closer to Iran, he said.
Some American officials said the broad designation potentially covers 11 million members of the Iranian group and affiliated organizations, including the large Basij volunteer militia.
In its statement about the new designation, the State Department sharply criticized the Quds Force, an elite unit of the Revolutionary Guards led by Qassim Suleimani. That unit and Mr. Suleimani are already under sanctions from lesser terrorism designations.
Top American intelligence and military officials, including Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, opposed Mr. Trump's action, which they argued would allow Iranian leaders to justify operations against Americans overseas, especially Special Operations units and paramilitary units working under the C.I.A.
But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, pushed for it, a Trump administration official said. The fighting among the senior administration officials intensified after The New York Times disclosed the pending designation last month.
The final decision belonged to Mr. Pompeo because the State Department controls the list of designated terrorist organizations.
At the height of the Iraq war in the mid-2000s, Iranian military officials and partners helped train Iraqi Shiite militias to fight American troops. The Defense Department says at least 603 American personnel were killed in Iraq by Iran-backed fighters -- 17 percent of all Americans killed in hostile action there.
When the Islamic State, a radical Sunni group, took over large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014, the Quds Force helped train Iraqi Shiite militias to retake the territory. The American military also took part in the campaign, meaning the Americans and Iranians were on the same side.
Many Iraqi officials are opposed to the new terrorist designation, as it could impose travel limits and economic sanctions on some lawmakers in the Shiite-led government and other Iraqis who have ties to Iranian officials.
The new pressure from the Americans also could fuel a popular proposal among Iraqi lawmakers to limit the movements and actions of some 5,000 American troops based in Iraq.
In recent days, State Department officials had asked Mr. Pompeo to delay any announcement, arguing that the designation could have unintended consequences for unrelated countries, a government official said. But Mr. Pompeo dismissed their concerns.
Under a provision of the USA Patriot Act, low-level officials are empowered to deny entry to foreigners who are associated with an organization that the officials decide meet broad standards for terrorism -- even when the United States government has not formally applied a terrorism label to that group.
Until now, American officials had never interpreted laws as permitting them to deem a government entity a terrorist organization.
The Trump administration's decision to breach that constraint with the Iranian group raises the question of whether other government intelligence services that use violence -- including those of Israel, Pakistan and Russia -- also now meet that standard. If so, should American officials deny visas to people who work with those agencies? State Department officials say the rushed announcement meant such policy details have not been worked out.
The George W. Bush administration considered a range of tough actions on Iran during the Iraq war, but held back.
"The potential blowback vastly outweighs the benefits," said Jeffrey Prescott, a senior Middle East director under President Barack Obama.
Wendy R. Sherman, a former top State Department official, said the Obama administration considered designating the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization, but decided against it because there would be no practical payoff given the risks to Americans and the fact the group was already under other sanctions.
"By designating a foreign military as a foreign terrorist organization, we were putting our troops at risk, particularly our troops in Iraq, next door to Iran," she said.
The Revolutionary Guards oversaw the previous Iranian nuclear program, and some of the top officers were placed under United States and United Nations sanctions.
The Obama administration entered into a nuclear deal with Tehran and world powers in 2015. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from that agreement last year in the start of a crackdown against Iran.
There are signs that Trump-era sanctions on Iran are undermining its budget for foreign military activities, meaning less money for Hezbollah and other Iranian allies. The new terrorism designation could expand on this by further undermining the Revolutionary Guards' finances.

Texto completo: Alec Baldwin seems to relish getting under President Trump 's skin. The actor, who plays the commander in chief as a swirly-haired buffoon on "Saturday Night Live," on Monday mulled running against Trump, asking on Twitter whether his 1 million followers would vote for him.
"I won't ask you for any $," he wrote. "And I promise I will win. Beating Trump would be so easy. So easy. So easy."
That seems all but guaranteed to set Trump's Twitter fingers flying: The president has attacked Baldwin before, saying Baldwin's impression of him "stinks" and that he has a "dying mediocre career."
And Baldwin has talked about beating Trump before, including in an interview last year with radio host Howard Stern . Baldwin said he was "1,000 percent" certain he would trounce the incumbent if he were to get into the race. "If I ran, I would win," he said. "I would absolutely win."
Despite Baldwin's assuredness about Trump's certain defeat, the actor has cried wolf about running for office for years. Baldwin floated the idea in 2006, telling the New York Times that being governor of New York would suit his fancy. He then toyed with the idea of running for mayor of New York but announced in 2011 that his work on "30 Rock" got in the way. Since then, Baldwin has expressed his intentions to hold political office but has never entered any races. Could 2020 finally be it?
Baldwin followed up his Monday query about a potential campaign with another tweet: "These tweets save me millions in polling."
So what did this "poll" tell him (and can someone tell him he can actually create a poll on Twitter)? Reaction was, of course, mixed, with responses ranging from "heck yeah" to "hard pass." And a few would-be supporters had some reasonable questions. "Idk," one user wrote. "I need to see your positions on policies."
"How many Baldwins in your Cabinet?" another asked.
And plenty of people responded with images of the last person who thought they would handily defeat Trump. A simple GIF of Hillary Clinton shaking her head "no" apparently speaks a thousand words (or 280 characters).

Sonoma County’s oldest bookstore celebrates 47 years in business

Texto completo: With an inventory of more than 100,000 used books and knowledgeable employees happy to assist customers, Paperbacks Unlimited is an oasis for North Bay readers.
Jill Brown and Howard Brown — then a couple, now 20 years divorced — founded the bookstore on a whim in 1972. Today Paperbacks Unlimited is Sonoma County’s oldest bookstore, a fixture along Highway 12 in Santa Rosa’s Rincon Valley.
Books are meticulously shelved in sections by genre and in alphabetical order by author and title, a courtesy to shoppers searching for book club selections, favorite series, bestsellers or obscure works. Even the occasional reader who shows up asking about a recommended book — knowing a character or theme but not the author or title — still has a chance of scoring a copy. Clerks double as sleuths, asking questions, referencing information online and narrowing down options.
“That’s when we put our heads together,” said Jill, 72.
It’s the kind of personalized service customers appreciate, the owners say, and something not available from online competitors.
“A lot of people come in and say they’re looking for something to read,” said Howard, 73. “My first question is, ‘Tell me something you’ve liked.’” His suggestions start from there.
The staff also helps out by recommending titles, and Paperbacks Unlimited produces an informative monthly newsletter and blog. Customers can find in the store a large children’s section, teen titles, cookbooks, memoirs, westerns, romance and a small area for erotica, like “Fifty Shades of Grey.” There are religious and political titles, gay and lesbian topics, contemporary and historical fiction, sci-fi, fantasy and miscellaneous fiction and nonfiction.
“Gothic is gone, horror has shrunk and paranormal is growing,” Jill said. “Ten years ago we didn’t have a paranormal section.”
The mystery and suspense section is the most popular, and author Louise Penny “is gold right now,” Jill said. Danielle Steel also has made a comeback, while Agatha Christie and Rex Stout are always popular. Books by Lee Child, Janet Evanovich and Nora Roberts (and her pseudonym J.D. Robb) are among those in high demand. North Coast novelist Christine Feehan, a No. 1 New York Times bestselling romance-paranormal author, also has a following.
Paperbacks Unlimited specializes in pleasure reading — no textbook or antiquarian items to be found. The store encourages lighthearted risk-taking with its “Blind Date” offerings: a $1 book wrapped in brown craft paper, listed as fiction or nonfiction, and with a few hints about the story hidden within.
Members of Sonoma County’s numerous book clubs make up a considerable customer base, as do older readers.
Anne Delse, a retired middle school math and science teacher, visits the bookstore every few months. She enjoys the “friendly people” and how “well-shelved” the books are in the spacious, 4,000-square-foot store.
“When you’re looking for a specific author, that’s important,” said Delse, who left the bookstore on a recent morning with seven paperbacks. “Some people eat for comfort. I read for comfort.”
All books at Paperbacks Unlimited, including numerous audiobooks, are sourced from customers, who get a store credit for the quality paperbacks they bring to the trade-in window. A small percentage of hardcover books are accepted and sold, mostly current titles not yet out in paperback.

The Browns have rolled through numerous changes within the publishing industry since opening their bookstore nearly 47 years ago.
“Amazon and electronic books definitely have taken a toll on our business,” Jill said. “As a consequence, our sales have been trending downward. It was getting tight there for a while.”
Howard handles the accounting and maintenance for the store, with Jill managing most everything else. They’ve had to adjust policies and pricing a few times as sales trends changed. Most books are sold at half the publisher’s price: “It’s a good deal that works for the customers and works for us,” Jill said.
Even with considerable floor space, Howard and Jill say finding room for everything is their greatest challenge. Their store is spacious enough for customers to browse without feeling crowded, but they’ve blocked a few windows with bookshelves and utilize a back room for overstock, as well as space in an adjacent office they own. Keeping up with their ever-changing inventory is simply a result of their success.
The Browns didn’t plan to open a bookstore back when Richard Nixon was president and “Jonathan Livingston Seagull” was a New York Times bestseller.
Dick’s Books, a used bookstore they frequented in Mayette Village, was closing. Howard worked in data processing for Sonoma County at the time, and Jill had left her job as a social worker two years earlier, after the birth of their daughter. With little time to contemplate their actions, and no way to predict their future success, the Browns purchased the tiny bookstore and opened it just days later as Paperbacks Unlimited.
“We bought it on a Saturday night and opened on Monday,” Howard said. They’ve since moved a few times to larger spaces.
The Browns have no regrets. Jill, an avid reader who dreamed of becoming a librarian and hoped to someday run a bookstore, found Paperbacks Unlimited an ideal endeavor. She brought her daughter Heather to work with her, and eventually Heather was on staff, working at the family business before attending college. Now 48, Heather is a real estate agent but still helps with the store and is a part owner. The oldest of her three sons, Drake, 15, and Lance, 13, share rotating shifts there on Sundays.
As the business grew, the Browns opened a second Paperbacks Unlimited in 1978, in a Petaluma shopping center. Howard left his job with the county and ran the Petaluma bookstore for 25 years, until he tired of the commute and needed to fill a void at the Santa Rosa location after Heather had her first child.
Even though the Browns divorced in 1998, they made the bookstore a priority.
“It was just going to be a joint effort,” Jill said. “We were very motivated. We loved the bookstore. It was a little difficult at first, but we worked it out. We’re friends.”
Each credits the other for their talents and contributions to the bookstore’s success. “It wouldn’t work without the both of us,” Jill said.
Both now work part-time — Howard pursues model railroading, Jill likes outdoor activities — and rely on their seven employees (some former customers) to staff the bookstore seven days a week.
They’re grateful for the positive feedback they receive from customers, some come from as far away as Mendocino County and Crescent City. Many developed an affection for the bookstore cat, Booker, a scrawny tabby Heather rescued from Highway 12 as a kitten. He happily resided at Paperbacks Unlimited until the old age of 19. Many brought cards or flowers when Booker died.
Jill recently introduced a new pet to the bookstore, an 11-year-old mini poodle mix named Marvin she adopted from Muttville, a San Francisco senior dog rescue. He accompanies her whenever she’s at the bookstore. “He’s blind in one eye and missing a few teeth, but he’s sweet,” Jill said.
The friendly pooch already has fans at the bookstore.

Colorado town with iconic peak seeks new destiny

Texto completo: Driving south on Interstate 25, the mesa emerges like a hazy talisman. That’s Fisher’s Peak looming over Trinidad, the flats of piñon and juniper morphing into hills of pine and aspen, rising to those volcanic cliffs near 9,700 feet.
“I’ve had visions from many, many, many years ago. How can we have public access to this thing?” says Phil Rico, Trinidad’s mayor and native son. “And I’m not the only one. The residents who’ve been here all our lives, we’ve always felt like it belonged to us, yet we couldn’t access it.
“Now it has become reality.”
It will be reality after two to four years of planning. Thanks to a deal reached by multiple agencies, Fisher’s Peak and the surrounding Crazy French Ranch will be for the public. Thirty square miles of classic, Colorado beauty will become a recreation paradise, boldly representing Trinidad’s new destiny.
The town has a gritty heritage of farms, railroads, mines and oil — faded images of an economic portrait. Leaders are pleased by the recent boost from marijuana dispensaries. But they’re wary of that industry spreading far and wide, erasing the niche they’ve established.
“We need to develop something different,” Rico says.
So they’ve set a course aimed at outdoor recreation, the state industry reportedly worth $62 billion. Their proclamation? The dramatic backdrop they’ve identified with all along.
“What the Flatirons are to Boulder, Fisher’s Peak is to Trinidad, or what Pikes Peak is to the Springs,” says Jim Petterson, the Colorado director with the Trust for Public Land.
A senior planner with that organization sparked the conservation mission. He had come across a 2014 article in The New York Times mentioning the ranch owned by a French couple. Initially, Fisher’s Peak was listed with a larger tract of adjoining land, altogether the size being three times that of Manhattan, The Times reported.
“I think the price was over $80 million,” says Trinidad City Manager Greg Sund.
In 2017, Sund saw the price reduced for a smaller portion that included the mountain. He called the Trust for Public Land people, who called The Nature Conservancy people.
The two nonprofits are raising the rest of the $25 million cost after Colorado Parks and Wildlife and Great Outdoors Colorado combined to pony up an essential $14.5 million.
Thus Trinidad has what Juan DelaRoca calls its “game-changer.”
“With Fisher’s Peak, it really hits home,” the resident mountain biker says. “This is going to be a place that will turn around in a big way.”
He saw the potential when he drove into town in 2015. The longtime Coloradan had been living in Boulder, continuing his career in marketing. He was feeling “squeezed” and priced out.
So he went looking for something that felt more true to the state. What he found had promontories, plains, a running river — the ingredients of a fine mountain town but far more affordable.
“I never would’ve thought I’d end up in Trinidad,” DelaRoca says. “But this is part of the state that’s as good as any other. It’s just one of those areas that people have overlooked for a long time.”
So here he is, an emerging advocate for the open space all around. Last weekend, he hosted the Explore Las Animas Dirt Series, taking advantage of the gravel roads webbing one of the state’s larger counties in land mass, smallest in population.
With the parties responsible for acquiring Fisher’s Peak, DelaRoca took a helicopter ride over the mountain and has been dreaming big ever since.
“That ride from Crested Butte to Aspen?” he says, drawing one lofty comparison. “That’s the sort of ride you’ll be able to do here that you’ve never done before.”
That would be from Trinidad to Raton, N.M. Overseers expect Fisher’s Peak to become a convergence point for outdoor enthusiasts, with Santa Fe and Denver about the same distance away in either direction.
But first, a management plan. Parks and Wildlife has pledged to manage the property, leading some to wonder if Fisher’s Peak has a state park designation in its future.
Previously private, rugged land near Conifer became Staunton State Park in 2013 and could be “useful learning,” Petterson says. But the size pales in comparison with these 19,200 acres. Among Colorado’s state parks, only State Forest is bigger than that.
With Teller County’s Mueller State Park, land managers split a massive ranch into a wildlife area and park. At the Fisher’s Peak site, wildlife areas border the ranch, with Trinidad Lake State Park northwest of the mountain.
CPW isn’t talking specifics yet. “We’re very excited about the possibilities here,” said spokesman Bill Vogrin.
For now, ideas are being heard. Trinidad kids were recently asked to contribute theirs. They returned colored pictures depicting cyclists and equestrians, all with that iconic landmark in the background.
“They’re dreaming, too,” the mayor says.

Texto completo: Kirstjen Nielsen, la secretaria del departamento Seguridad Nacional (DHS) y cara de la actual campaña migratoria del presidente Donald Trump en contra de la inimgración ilegal no aguantó mas la presión y renunció a su cargo tras un reunión este domingo con el presidente en la Casa Blanca.
“La secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen, abandonará su cargo y me gustaría agradecerle por su servicio”, dijo Trump en Twitter.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service….
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2019
A paso seguido Trump anunció su reemplazo en Twitter. “Me complace anunciar que Kevin McAleenan, el actual Comisionado de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de los Estados Unidos, se convertirá en Secretario Interino de @DHSgov. ¡Confío en que Kevin hará un gran trabajo!”
Kirstjen Nielsen abandona el cargo luego de un dificil paso por la dirección de DHS, gestión que la convirtió en el blanco de repetidas críticas por parte del presidente Trump y de varios miembros de su gabinete.
La medida se produce días después de que Trump, quien ha expresado en repetidas ocasiones su enojo por el aumento de migrantes en la frontera sur, se arrepinitió y retiró a su candidato Ron Vitiello para dirigir ICE porque buscaba a un funcionario mas “agresivo” en contra da inmigración ilegal.
Para muchos en Washington la salida Nielsen no es una sorpresa tras las reiteradas críticas de Trump por su insatisfacción con la funcionaria debido al aumento de inmigrantes que ingresaban ilegalmente a los Estados Unidos por la frontera sur
En mayo pasado, seis meses después de asumir el cargo en el departamento, The New York Times informó que Nielsen había redactado su carta de renuncia después de haber sido reprendida públicamente por lo que el presidente llamó su fracaso para ayudar a detener la inmigración ilegal en la frontera.
Según reporta el diario neoyorquino, Stephen Miller, asesor principal de Trump en temas migratorios, se habría dado a la tarea de aumentar la presión y las quejas sobre Nielsen, acusándola de no encontrar formas creativas para detener la entrada de inmigrantes centroamericanos a suelo de EEUU.
De igual forma Jared Kushner, asesor y cuñado de Trump tampoco veía con buenos ojos la continuidad de Nielsen en la dirección de DHS, aumentando la presión para que la funcionaria diera una paso al costado, dijeron varios funcionarios de la Casa Blanca.
Todos estos factores habrían llevado a que Nielsen, después de una agitada reunión con Trump en la Casa Blanca este domingo, decidira renunciar.

The Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame

Texto completo: The news that special counsel Robert Mueller "did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government" has left a lot of people in Washington with a lot of explaining to do.
Put aside the rogues' gallery of reporters and pundits who assured us that Donald Trump had conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the presidency. What is most insidious are those who did have access to classified intelligence and led Americans to believe that they had seen what we could not: actual evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.
Recall that in 2016, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., released a letter to FBI Director James Comey claiming the FBI had proof of Trump-Russia collusion. "In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government," Reid declared. When asked what information Reid was referring to, a spokesman said, "There have been classified briefings on this topic. That is all I can say."
Trump has called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to resign. He is absolutely correct. Schiff repeatedly said that his committee had dug up "plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy." In March 2017, he said on "Meet the Press," "I can't go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now" and last May he told ABC that Trump's Russia conspiracy is of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate."
Schiff is a disgrace. But he is not alone.
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "In our investigation, we saw strong evidence of collusion" and declared Trump an agent "working on behalf of the Russians." House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed, "It's clear that the campaign colluded, and there's a lot of evidence of that."
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee, assured us last year that "the evidence is pretty clear that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians."
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "There is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America's democracy."
And recently, the committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., declared that "enormous amounts of evidence" exist of collusion between Trump and Russia and that "there's no one that could factually say there's not plenty of evidence of collaboration or communications between Trump Organization and Russians." Except for Mueller, of course.
These comments by people with access to intelligence were shameful. But the most sinister of all is John Brennan, who used his authority as former CIA director to suggest that Trump was a traitor and a compromised Russian asset. After Trump's Helsinki summit, Brennan declared "he is wholly in the pocket of Putin." When challenged by Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press," Brennan stood by his assessment. "I called [Trump's] behavior treasonous, which is to betray one's trust and aid and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim."
This month, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell told Brennan this investigation was "developing while you were still on the job" and asked, "Did you see enough at that stage to believe ... that that would result in indictments?" Brennan replied, "I thought at the time there was going to be individuals who were going to have issues with the Department of Justice. Yes."
In a New York Times op-ed, he wrote that "Trump's claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash." Now, Brennan feigns contrition. "I don't know if I received bad information, but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was," he said, adding, "I am relieved that it's been determined there was not a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government over our election."
Hogwash. He wanted it to be true, and he relied on his CIA credentials to convince Americans that it was. That is a violation of the public trust. Trump was right to revoke Brennan's security clearance. He is among the worst of the worst, the Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame. We have long since passed the point where Americans expect objectivity from the press. But we should hold our elected and appointed officials handling sensitive national security issues to a higher standard.

Texto completo: The current frenzy of new IPOs — Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb — seems destined to reinforce progressive notions that California represents the future not just for the state, but the nation. It will certainly reinforce California’s fiscal dependency on tech-dominated elites — half of the state’s income taxes come from people making over $500,000 a year — and provide a huge potential multi-billion dollar windfall for the state treasury.
To be sure, the insiders — founders, with nearly half the voting shares in companies such as Lyft, a small “tech mafia” of venture firms, foreign investors such as Japan’s Softbank and Wall Street investors — will have reason to celebrate. But the lavish paydays will do little to relieve, and may even serve to worsen, the state’s gaping inequality and nation-leading poverty rates .
Most damaging of all, the IPO high will encourage supporters of the state’s policy agenda. If new companies crop up, and the handful of politically savvy investors thrive, California’s illuminati can fend off criticism of policies that undermine the middle and working class in everything from energy to housing.
The changing nature of California’s tech economy
“Science,” observed Daniel Coit Gilman, the second president of the University of California, ”is the mother of California.” With few navigable rivers, a persistent shortage of water, far from the then-dominant Eastern seaboard, California’s growth depended on engineering prowess. Not tied to the traditional industries, the state seized on emerging fields such as aviation, space and eventually semiconductors, laying the basis for an expanding middle class
In contrast, little of today’s tech growth produces tangible products, and those that remain, such as Space X , the semiconductor industry and Apple, are placing their production either abroad or in less expensive and less highly regulated states. This allows them to escape California’s high electrical rates, poor roads, collapsing bridges and lagging public education system. The digital future may remain in California but the action in chip-manufacturing, biomedical products or space exploration seems headed elsewhere.
The firms in the new “information peddling economy,” notes the University of Washington at Tacoma’s Ali Modarres, have a very different relationship with their employees than “first wave” companies such as Hewlett Packard and Intel. In the first wave a broad range of employees enjoyed rewards from corporate success and stock gains; drivers for Uber, as one analyst suggests, will get nothing but the privilege of seeing vast flows of cash used to replace them with automated vehicles.
The neo-feudal city
The new wave of IPOs will expand the ranks of what The New York Times aptly describes as “the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area.” Tech senior managers will enjoy huge capital gains, greatly reducing their federal tax liability. In contrast, less well-placed working schmucks will pay upward of half their income in taxes while those who clean their offices will face potential new fees on everything from tires and soda to water.
Even in the Bay Area, home to four of California’s wealthiest ZIP codes, middle-wage jobs are disappearing and most new growth is tilted toward low-wage service work. Nearly half of all millennials are planning to leave and analysts suggest the area may face a severe shortage of skilled workers. Overall, notes a new Joint Venture Silicon Valley report, homelessness and inequality has expanded in the region, while the quality of life is perceived by most to be deteriorating.
One can appreciate the economic benefits that Uber, Lyft, Salesforce and others have brought to San Francisco, but there’s also a neo-Dickensian reality: sky-high housing prices, widespread homelessness, displaced minorities, few children and a rapidly shrinking middle class. There are now more drug addicts in the city of San Francisco than high school students and so much feces on the street that one website has created a “poop map.” More than half of the Bay Area’s lower-income communities, notes a recent UC Berkeley study, are in danger of mass displacement.
As for the rest of California
In previous tech-led economic booms — as recently as the last decade — growth extended to the rest of the state, particularly the more affordable interior. Tech firms expanded eastward, to Sacramento, south toward Salinas and throughout Southern California. The new tech economy, in contrast, has no real need for a periphery. It expands almost anywhere, whether to media-centric New York, less expensive places including suburban Austin, Nashville or Dallas or to China, India or the Philippines.
This has left much of Southern and interior California an economic dependency, hosting largely on low-wage jobs and increasingly dependent on an expansive welfare state. Worse yet, the tech boom serves as a narcotic, anesthetizing our political leaders from confronting the economic realities outside the venture capital-funded Bay Area bubble.
What is needed now is a focus on the middle- and working-class Californians, the vast majority of whom live far from the Bay Area. California’s policy makers need to start by rolling back many of the regulations on energy and housing that are reducing opportunity by driving up costs and driving middle-class jobs out of the state. We also need to focus more on developing employment centers outside the ultra-expensive coastal areas, something that would allow people to live closer to where they work. This suggests a policy that focus on such things as good roads, decent schools and a variety of upwardly mobile jobs — things that may not matter much to oligarchs or the youthful staffs, but make all the difference to middle- and working-class families.
To be truly a sustainable society, California needs opportunities for carpenters, machinists, middle managers, not just for the current structure that relies on superstar coders and produces large numbers of low-paid service workers. We need a California boom that lifts most of our citizens and does not drive them toward a permanent semi-feudal state, servants and supplicants of a small, fantastically wealthy and preening technological elite.

Belgium apologizes for kidnapping children from African colonies

Texto completo: BRUSSELS - Belgium apologized Thursday for the kidnapping, segregation, deportation and forced adoption of thousands of children born to mixed-race couples during its colonial rule of Burundi, Congo and Rwanda.
The apology is the first time that Belgium has recognized any responsibility for what historians say was the immense harm the country inflicted on the Central African nations, which it colonized for eight decades.
Prime Minister Charles Michel offered the apology Thursday afternoon in front of a plenary session of Parliament, which was attended by dozens of people of mixed race in the visitors gallery.
"Throughout Belgian colonial Africa, a system of targeted segregation of metis and their families was maintained by the Belgian state, and acts were committed that violated the fundamental rights of peoples," he said, using the term for mixed-race people.
"This is why, in the name of the federal government, I recognize the targeted segregation of which metis people were victims" under Belgian colonial rule in Africa and "the ensuing policy of forced kidnapping" after independence, he added.
"In the name of the federal government," Michel said, "I present our apologies to the metis stemming from the Belgian colonial era and to their families for the injustices and the suffering inflicted upon them."
"I also wish to express our compassion for the African mothers from whom the children were taken," he said.
The prime minister said the Belgian government would make resources available to finance additional research on the issue, open up its colonial archives to metis people and offer administrative help to those seeking to gain access to their official records and seeking Belgian nationality.
Some experts on colonial history noted that Belgium's apology had came late - nearly 60 years after the three countries gained independence.
Racial segregation was a pillar of Belgian colonial rule, historians say. Until the late 1950s, the colonial authorities discouraged interracial romance and banned interracial marriage before the Catholic Church.
Many white Belgian men, nevertheless, married Black Congolese women according to local customs, producing children sometimes called metis. But in the eyes of Belgium, these children undermined official segregation policies and blemished the white race's prestige, official documents from that time show.
Fearing a repeat of the Red River Rebellion in Canada in 1869-70, when metis people revolted and overthrew the local government, the Belgian authorities ordered metis children in Congo to be separated from their families and from the Black population as a whole.
An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 children were segregated from their parents - most often from single African mothers - and placed in orphanages and schools predominantly run by the Catholic Church, historians said.

Texto completo: It is also true that libraries transform lives, ensuring everyone has access to information and lifelong learning regardless of income, age, education, ethnicity, or gender. Melinda Gates is the 2019 National Library Week Honorary Chair and a resolute advocate for our nation's libraries. Over the last 20 years, the Gates Foundation has invested more than $1 billion to enhance the power of libraries to improve lives.
Yes, libraries are good investments! Live Oak Public Libraries provide services valued at more than $34 million for the residents of Chatham, Effingham, and Liberty Counties. For every dollar residents invest in their libraries they realize more than four dollars in service value. Libraries operate using best practices, including economy of scale and resource sharing. Charlotte Welch, President of the Live Oak Public Library Regional Board of Trustees, noted that libraries services are cost effective, wise community investments in terms of dollars-and-cents, and in great demand.
Our libraries are in great demand with more than 1.2 million items borrowed annually, 450,000 computer/online sessions conducted, and 79,000 attendances at library-sponsored programs. Libraries host more than 1 million visits a year, have 100,000+ active card holders, and are open to the public 37,000 hours annually. From e-books, e-audiobooks, and e-magazines, to on-demand digital media services for streaming movies and television shows, libraries have never been easier to use and can be accessed 24/7 from all types of digital devices.
Libraries uphold core values of the American democracy, the rights to read, seek information, and disseminate ideas openly and without restriction. From Thomas Jefferson's small circulating libraries to create a well-informed citizenry, to Live Oak Public Libraries' state-of-the-art fiber optic network that connects users to the Internet, information guides our society and libraries are central to free public access for all.
Libraries are for everyone and this week, like every week, many interesting and diverse programs and services are planned. Need help with your taxes; AARP free tax assistance is available. Interested in earning your GED; Savannah Technical College classes are offered. Take your child to a S.T.E.A.M. activity, story-time, or anime club. Check out a New York Times bestseller or one of the American Library Association's LGBTQ Rainbow List books. From healthy cooking, to yoga, to computer basics, it's all at your library. We invite you to join the celebration.

For that, Desert X is a second act.
Art? A bright orange box? How about massive litter? And a spray-paint heart added by a "vandal"? No – it is the art.
This, Desert X, as "The Magic Christian," shows the level of our culture.

If I were Palm Springs' police chief, I'd cite bikers who scream through downtown and break the law. I'd tell them we aren't anti-biker – in fact, we love them. All they need to do is purr through our lovely city.

Pitts is a sore loser I wonder if Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts has been out of the country over the last three years and missed the daily claim from the media (the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN and MSNBC among the most prominent) that they had compelling evidence of President Donald Trump's guilt with regard to Russian collusion?
Robert Mueller's report says Trump, the Trump family and his campaign did not collude with Russia to steal the 2016 election.
Apparently, having missed all that, Pitts now claims that the media owes no apology for its biased behavior, not to mention its colossal failure to get the facts right.
If, as Pitts writes, the media failed on WMD claims, I find it impossible to not see the media's efforts over the last few years as equally catastrophic.
But not to Leonard Pitts.
And why is that? It seems to be because, like many others in the media, he wanted Muller's two-year effort to conclude with the evidence they needed to impeach the president.
Leonard Pitts will not celebrate the good news that our president did not commit treason, and he will not apologize for his peers suggesting otherwise.
Leonard Pitts: sore loser.

Trump drops threat to close border, adds demand on drugs

Texto completo: President Trump retreated from threats to immediately close the border with Mexico over migration, instead abruptly pivoting on Thursday to a new demand: that the Mexican government stop the flow of illegal drugs into the United States within a year or face car tariffs.
“If the drugs don't stop — Mexico can stop them if they want to — we are going to tariff the cars. The cars are very big, and if that doesn't work we are going to close the border," Trump said Thursday at the White House. “We are going to give them a one-year warning."
Trump also threatened to impose car tariffs if the country didn't step up its apprehension of migrants transiting through the country to the United States from Central and South America. The remarks, following a week of back-and-forth threats to close the border, risked further muddying the US relationship with its second-largest trading partner.
Trump said Mexico has improved immigration enforcement since he threatened to close the border last week. He has repeatedly used tariffs — or the threat of them — to achieve his policy goals, and has previously mentioned penalties on imported vehicles and auto parts.

In tweet, Trump mocks accusations against Biden
President Trump, ignoring his own history of buying a porn star's silence and bragging about sexual misconduct, on Thursday leveled another broadside at Joe Biden, tweeting a meme that mocked the former vice president for putting his hands on women's shoulders.
The 15-second meme, accompanied by the text “WELCOME BACK JOE!," doctored a video that Biden released Wednesday in which the former vice president explained his history of physical contact with women, some of whom say his behavior made them uncomfortable. Biden has said he tried to comfort people with hugs, kisses, and other physical contact when they appeared nervous.
In the meme, as Biden delivers his explanation, a pair of hands appears on his shoulders, and then an image of Biden's head pops up and appears to sniff the back of the former vice president's head. The meme appeared to be a reference to an accusation by a former Nevada assemblywoman, who said in an essay published last Friday that Biden had touched her shoulders, smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head at a campaign event in 2014.
Biden is widely expected to join the 2020 presidential race soon, and some Democrats view him as perhaps the most formidable challenger to Trump. But in the last week, accusations from several women that Biden touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable have threatened to upend his fledgling campaign, and on Wednesday, he addressed the claims directly for the first time in a video posted to his Twitter feed.

Warren demands review of security at Mar-a-Lago
WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is calling for an investigation into whether the White House is overruling Secret Service recommendations about which guests at President Trump's Florida estate have access to him during his frequent weekend stays.
The request to the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security follows the arrest this past weekend of a Chinese woman after she bypassed layers of security and gained access to the reception area of Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club and was found carrying two passports and a thumb drive containing malicious software, according to court documents.
In a letter, Warren, along with Representative Stephen Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, cited a Government Accountability Office report published last month that said the White House ultimately determines who sees the president after vetting by the Secret Service.

Ryan of Ohio joins race for Democratic nomination
WASHINGTON — Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio announced a presidential bid Thursday, emphasizing education, health care, and the economy as he joined a diverse group of Democrats looking to take on President Trump in 2020.
In his first television interview as a candidate, Ryan cast himself as a "progressive who knows how to talk to working-class people" and said he could win back Rust Belt states lost to Trump in the 2016 election.
On a website that debuted Thursday, Ryan, who has a reputation in Washington as a moderate Democrat, highlighted issues of public education, affordable health care, and "an economy that works for all of us."

Buttigieg defends remarks on president's faith
Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who's gaining increased notice in the Democratic presidential nomination race, on Thursday defended his questioning of President Trump's belief in God, saying he felt obligated to call out the Republican's "hypocrisy."
Buttigieg, an Episcopalian, drew scrutiny for comments in a USA Today interview published Wednesday in which he said Trump's behavior is at odds with his understanding of the teachings of Christianity.
"I'm reluctant to comment on another person's faith, but I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God," Buttigieg said. "I just don't understand how you can be as worshipful of your own self as he is and be prepared to humble yourself before God. I've never seen him humble himself before anyone."
On ABC's "Good Morning America" Thursday, Buttigieg was pressed by host George Stephanopoulos on whether his comments were consistent with a need for decency in politics for which Buttigieg advocates in a recent book.
"I work very hard to make sure when we oppose this president we're not emulating him, but we do need to call out hypocrisy when we see it," he said.

Texto completo: Update, April 4, 2019: This story was updated to include additional details of the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton’s review as well as comments about the new conflict-of-interest policies.
Top officials at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center repeatedly violated policies on financial conflicts of interest, fostering a culture in which profits appeared to take precedence over research and patient care, according to details released on Thursday from an outside review.
The findings followed months of turmoil over executives’ ties to drug and health care companies at one of the nation’s leading cancer centers. The review, conducted by the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, was outlined at a staff meeting on Thursday morning. It concluded that officials frequently violated or skirted their own policies; that hospital leaders’ ties to companies were likely considered on an ad hoc basis rather than through rigorous vetting; and that researchers were often unaware that some senior executives had financial stakes in the outcomes of their studies.
In acknowledging flaws in its oversight of conflicts of interest, the cancer center announced on Thursday an extensive overhaul of policies governing employees’ relationships with outside companies and financial arrangements — including public disclosure of doctors’ ties to corporations and limits on outside work.
The review was one of several steps the nonprofit cancer center has taken in the wake of reports last year by The New York Times and ProPublica that several top executives and board members had profited from relationships with drug companies, outside research ventures or corporate board memberships. Those revelations prompted Memorial Sloan Kettering, based in New York, to hire outside firms to conduct inquiries into those relationships as well as into internal allegations of ethical lapses.
The scrutiny of researchers’ stakes in startups has intensified at a time when venture capitalists are betting millions of dollars on the next potential cure for cancer and when expensive treatments like immunotherapy have fueled public concern over rising drug prices.
The spotlight on the deals at Memorial Sloan Kettering also swayed other leading cancer centers, like Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, to reconsider their policies.
Dr. Walid Gellad, director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, said the changes appeared to be more comprehensive than those in place at many other health care institutions.
“Memorial Sloan Kettering really does seem to be taking this seriously and this document, I think, shows it,” he said, referring to the hospital’s revised policies. “Kudos to them.”
At the staff meeting, Mark P. Goodman, co-chairman of the law firm’s commercial litigation group, told doctors that the review found “a number of instances of serious noncompliance with MSK’s conflict-of-interest policies,” according to a recording. A spokesman for the hospital, Mike Morey, declined to provide a copy of Debevoise’s findings.
The conflicts and some profit-making deals — which were not specified at the meeting — did not occur through intentional misconduct, Goodman said. Rather, the review exposed inadequate oversight and a lack of established protocols for examining whether employees’ and executives’ affiliations with corporations could result in biased results that favored a company’s products.
Goodman also said the review, involving interviews with 36 current and former employees and board members and an examination of 25,000 documents, did not find that the ethical shortcomings had hurt patients or compromised research. In an email, Goodman disputed the characterization of the findings as violations of rules and said the report did not conclude that top officials acted in a concerted way. In his presentation, he referred instead to “noncompliance” with hospital policies and to instances where executives appeared not to have followed existing policies.
Scott Stuart, chairman of the cancer center’s Boards of Overseers and Managers, said in an emailed statement: “We took a deep and honest look at what went wrong at our own institution, examined what was occurring in the wider cancer research community, and are putting in place best practices that will not only allow us to learn from our mistakes, but will contribute to best practices for the wider research community.”
The cancer center has been reeling from the series of reports by the Times and ProPublica, including that its chief medical officer, Dr. José Baselga, had failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from drug and health care companies in dozens of articles in medical journals.
Baselga resigned in September, and he also stepped down from the boards of the drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb and Varian Medical Systems, a radiation equipment manufacturer. The British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca hired Baselga to run its new oncology unit this year.
Additional reports detailed how other top officials at Memorial Sloan Kettering had cultivated lucrative relationships with for-profit companies, including an artificial intelligence startup, Paige.AI, that was founded by a member of the cancer center’s executive board, the chairman of its pathology department and the head of one of its research laboratories. The hospital struck an exclusive deal with the company to license images of 25 million patient tissue slides that had been collected over decades.
Another article detailed how a hospital vice president was given a nearly $1.4 million stake in a newly public company as compensation for representing Memorial Sloan Kettering on its board.
In October, Memorial Sloan Kettering’s chief executive, Dr. Craig B. Thompson, resigned from the boards of Charles River Laboratories, an early-stage research company, and the drugmaker Merck.
Then, in January, Memorial Sloan Kettering went a step further, barring its top executives from serving on the corporate boards of drug and health care companies. Hospital officials also instituted policy changes to limit the ways in which its top executives and leading researchers could profit from work developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering, which admits about 23,500 cancer patients each year.

Memorial Sloan Kettering Curbs Executives’ Ties to Industry After Conflict-of-Interest Scandals
The cancer center will now bar top officials from sitting on outside boards of for-profit companies, and is conducting a wide-scale review of other policies.
Goodman said at the staff meeting that the law firm had not found evidence of intentional wrongdoing — defined as “a conscious decision to engage in misconduct” — by the hospital’s leaders or board members.
“Although we did not identify evidence of breaches of fiduciary duty, we did find that processes and controls for the review and management of senior executive and board-level conflicts were deficient and resulted in instances of noncompliance with MSK policies,” Goodman said.
Specifically, he noted, plans to manage executive conflicts of interest, a requirement at the hospital, “were not implemented because it was felt to be unnecessary or because there was a failure to realize that a management plan was needed.”
Goodman also said that hospital leaders’ corporate ties were handled differently from other employees. Beginning in 2014, senior executives were no longer required to vet financial relationships with a conflict-of-interest advisory committee because the hospital felt the committee should not be asked to make decisions about executives to whom it reported. While Goodman said that rationale made sense, the general counsel’s office — tasked with overseeing the leaders’ conflicts — did not put in place formal procedures to examine potential problems.
“As a result,” Goodman said, “conflicts were allowed to persist without formal firewalls in place.”
Hospital leaders also did not always disclose to faculty and staff when they had relationships to companies whose research was being conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering, Goodman said.
The policy changes that Memorial Sloan Kettering announced on Thursday include the creation of a board committee to focus on overseeing conflicts, an existing hospital policy that the law firm learned had not been carried out.
The hospital also said it would disclose financial interests of faculty members and researchers on its website and create a more centralized review of conflicts between employees’ work at the hospital and their outside duties.
Other changes included new limits on how income is distributed from research discoveries that originate at Memorial Sloan Kettering, and regular audits to ensure the hospital is complying with its own rules. The cancer center reinforced its earlier statements that many profits from outside work should flow back to MSK research.
Heather H. Pierce, the senior director for science policy and regulatory counsel at the Association of American Medical Colleges, said the hospital decided to undergo a review that “was far broader than the initial concerns that were raised.” As an outside member of the task force recommending changes, Pierce noted that “there was nothing that wasn’t up for discussion.”
Gellad, of the University of Pittsburgh, said the issues raised at a prominent institution like Memorial Sloan Kettering have placed others on notice. “We’ve seen what happens when these conflicts, even if they’re only perceived, they lead to problems in terms of how an institution is judged,” Gellad said. “Every institution, if they’re not, should look to see how that impacted Memorial Sloan Kettering.”

Legal fees for ex-Georgetown coach charged in college scandal to exceed $250,000, lawyers say

Texto completo: Lawyers for the former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst, who is charged in connection with the nationwide college admissions cheating scandal, said Wednesday that his legal fees are likely to exceed $250,000 and asked a judge to release funds the government has seized from his accounts.
In a motion filed in US District Court in Boston, attorneys for Ernst, 52, a Cranston, R.I., native with homes in Falmouth and Chevy Chase, Md., said that releasing the funds is necessary to help pay his legal fees and living expenses.
And, the lawyers argued, the government hasn't shown that the seized funds are tied to alleged criminal activity. All told, federal officials seized more than $1.1 million from four accounts pursuant to seizure warrants, records show.
The “government lacks probable cause to believe that the seized funds are traceable to proceeds of a RICO conspiracy," the motion said. “The government alleges that the racketeering conspiracy involving Mr. Ernst transpired between 2012 and 2018. . . . Between January 1, 2019, and March 12, 2019, [redacted] and Mr. Ernst earned wages totaling [redacted]."
Ernst, who once gave Michelle Obama tennis lessons and told The New York Times in 2014 that the then-first lady had a powerful backhand shot, is one of 50 defendants charged in a sweeping scandal that exploded into the headlines last month.
Federal prosecutors say dozens of wealthy parents, including Hollywood stars and captains of industry, cut fat checks to have their children falsely certified as athletic recruits at fancy colleges, or to facilitate cheating on their SAT and ACT exams.
Ernst faces a charge of racketeering conspiracy for allegedly collecting bribes totaling $2.7 million over several years in exchange for designating “at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, including some who did not play tennis competitively, thereby facilitating their admission to Georgetown," court records show.
He has pleaded not guilty.
Noting that Ernst recently resigned from coaching women's tennis at the University of Rhode Island, Ernst's lawyers said in Wednesday's motion that he has limited options for generating income, absent the release of the seized funds.
“Mr. Ernst's affidavit further shows that much of Mr. Ernst's assets are significantly burdened by substantial debt, and that the vast majority of his assets are illiquid and/or not easily liquidated," the filing said.
“Even assuming that Mr. Ernst could sell his Maryland home (he cannot sell his Massachusetts condominium in light of the restraining order), its sale will not generate proceeds net of costs and commissions, sufficient for his legal defense."
In a separate case, a prominent California dentist has lost three book deals because of the onslaught of publicity surrounding the case, legal filings show.
But on Wednesday the defendant, Dr. Homayoun Zadeh, 57, heard some good news when a federal judge in Boston granted his request to travel abroad for speaking engagements while his case is pending.
Zadeh is charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for allegedly conspiring to pay a $100,000 bribe in several installments in exchange for having his daughter certified as a lacrosse recruit at the University of Southern California, even though she didn't play the sport competitively, records show.
Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley on Wednesday approved Zadeh's motion for permission to travel to upcoming conferences in foreign locales.
The motion, filed March 21, laid out the professional challenges faced by Zadeh since his arrest.
“As a result of his highly publicized arrest, Dr. Zadeh has been placed on administrative leave from his position as the director of the Laboratory for Immunoregulation and Tissue Engineering at the University of Southern California, and has lost three book contracts," the motion said. “Dr. Zadeh makes this motion to avoid canceling upcoming speaking events so that he may continue to earn a living and pay his legal fees to defend against the charges in this case."
According to court records, Zadeh is slated to give talks on April 19 in Malaysia, April 21 in Taiwan, May 3 in Canada, and May 31 in France.
“Dr. Zadeh is an internationally respected periodontist, and is not a flight risk," the motion said.

Texto completo: De acuerdo con la Oficina del Censo de Estados Unidos analizados por la Asociación Estadounidense de Mujeres Universitarias (AAUW), “ellas” reciben 80 centavos por cada dólar que ganan sus homólogos masculinos.
El promedio nacional de salario anual es $52,146 dólares para hombres versus $41,997 para mujeres, en el año 2017.
En Nueva York la situación es un poco menos desigual: las mujeres ganan 88 centavos por cada dólar de los hombres, reduciendo la brecha de 20 a 12% .
El estudio de la AAUW incluso muestra la diferencia salarial de género por cada distrito electoral de Nueva York.
En NYC, un informe de 2018 realizado por la Contraloría destacó la brecha entre las mujeres negras y latinas.
Las mujeres negras que trabajan a tiempo completo ganan 57 centavos “por cada dólar pagado a hombres blancos no hispanos”, dice el informe. Para las latinas, esa cifra es aún menor: 49 centavos, destacó The New York Times.
El gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, hizo un llamado ayer a la Asamblea y Senado del estado a aprobar el proyecto de ley que cerraría la brecha que persiste en el estado. El 2 de abril, “día de la igualdad salarial”, señaló que Nueva York tiene una de las diferencias salariales por género más bajas de la nación “pero esa diferencia de doce centavos es todavía muy alta”.
La brecha salarial se ha reducido lentamente en Estados Unidos. A su ritmo actual, se cerrará para la mujer promedio en el año 2059, predice el Instituto para la Investigación de Políticas de la Mujer.
Las mujeres piden mejor salario, pero como dijo Otegha Uwagba, “es más probable que sean rechazadas o sufran una reacción violenta por atreverse a abordar el tema”.
¿Qué podría cerrar la brecha?
* Los empleadores pueden ofrecer transparencia salarial. Cuando se conocen los sueldos, la brecha se reduce.
* Los gerentes que piden a los solicitantes de empleo el historial salarial pueden perpetuar la brecha. Además, es ilegal preguntar al respecto en la ciudad de Nueva York.

Hats, knives helped sailors escape capsized ship

Texto completo: No one knows exactly how the sailors aboard the F.D. Hodgkins were dressed.
The six-man crew of the merchant schooner did not wear uniforms and they were probably attired in a hodgepodge of shirts, trousers, coats and shoes that enabled them to move about freely as they worked the rigging and sails of the three-masted sailing vessel.
Most of the crew accessorized their meager wardrobe with hats, which in the late 19th century was de rigueur for men working outdoors. The sailors also had sharp knives stuck into their belts to cut, splice and repair the lines that composed the schooner's web of rigging.
Hats and knives may have been mundane parts of a sailor's attire, but when the F.D. Hodgkins reached the Delaware coast, these simple items were lifesavers.
In 1884, the F.D. Hodgkins, commanded by Captain R.C. Bonsey, was completing the last leg of its maiden voyage from Jacmel, Haiti, with a cargo of logwood when it arrived off Fenwick Island.
The weather was calm as the sturdy Maine-built schooner sailed northward along the Delaware coast; but as happens often in March, a strong squall with high winds and heavy seas blew over the sailing vessel.
The sudden wind caught the schooner's sails and tipped the vessel over capsizing it, and throwing the captain and crew into the water.
Fortunately, all six men were uninjured by their sudden plunge into the ocean, and they were able to make their way to the overturned hull of the F.D. Hodgkins, where they clung until the squall had passed.
After the wind calmed, the sailors found the ship's small boat lying bottom up and still attached to the lines of the davits. Armed with the knives that they carried, the sailors cut the boat loose from the davits' rigging.
Next, they turned the boat right side up, but it was still nearly filled with water. Using their hats as makeshift buckets, the sailors bailed most of the water out of the boat.
According to the New York Times, "They then sprang into the boat, but the latter was without oars, and it was with difficulty that they prevented it from striking against the wreck and becoming swamped. They tore up some of the planking in the inside of their boat to use for oars."
The men in the small boat probably could not see the Delaware coast, and they decided that the best strategy for their survival was to keep close to the wrecked hull of the schooner which had a bigger chance of being spotted by a passing ship.
Although the squall had passed, the seas remained heavy, and waves sometimes splashed into the small boat. Equipped with their hat-buckets, the sailors were frequently forced to bail the water out.
After spending a cold and wet five hours in their small boat, the sailors spotted another schooner and immediately began to row with their improvised oars toward it.
The schooner was the Joshua S. Brazdon, which had also sailed from Haiti, bound from Port au Prince for New England. The Brazdon rescued the exhausted sailors and landed them in Boston.
Meanwhile, three tugboats were dispatched from Philadelphia to Delaware coast, where they were able to turn the F.D. Hodgkins right side up.
According to the Delaware County Daily Times of Chester, Pennsylvania. "Three tugboats, the Ivanhoe, Protector and Baltimore were seen coming up the (Delaware) river yesterday with a graceful looking schooner in tow. Her topmasts were gone, her sails hanging in shreds, and a general look of desolation about the vessel."
The schooner was salvaged, the sailors were saved, and all because of their wardrobe accessories — hats and knives.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — White House spokesman Hogan Gidley twice referred to Puerto Rico as "that country" during a television appearance Tuesday in which he defended a series of tweets by President Trump lashing out at leaders of the US territory. In two bursts of tweets — one late Monday night and another Tuesday morning — Trump complained about the amount of federal relief money going to the island and called its politicians "incompetent or corrupt."
He also claimed that Puerto Rico "got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane," a figure that actually reflects a high-end, long-term estimate for recovery costs. Only a fraction of that has so far been budgeted, and even less has been spent.
As he pressed to defend Trump's contentions, Gidley sought to make the case that the leaders of the territory, whose residents are US citizens, have mishandled the aid they've received thus far.
"With all they've done in that country, they've had a systematic mismanagement of the goods and services we've sent to them," Gidley said. "You've seen food just rotting in the ports. Their governor has done a horrible job. He's trying to make political hay in a political year, and he's trying to find someone to take the blame off of his for not having a grid and not having a good system in that country at all."
Gidley later attributed his misstatements to "a slip of the tongue."

Trump brand falls short on appeal, personality metric
WASHINGTON — President Trump has long been focused on measuring his brand, obsessively reviewing television ratings, cataloging his magazine covers, and fixating on polls.
But Trump may not like how his brand is faring in one important metric: his “E-Score," a number compiled by E-Poll Market Research that is not publicly available, but which marketing executives, network television stations, and advertisers rely on to figure out which personalities appeal to audiences — and which do not.
Like the Q Score, which measures the appeal of celebrities, the E-Score calculates awareness and appeal of individuals in the public eye. But it also tracks how individuals score on more than 40 personality and physical attributes.
In terms of those attributes, Trump was most often described as “aggressive" (48 percent) and “mean" (38 percent), according to his scores from December that were obtained by The New York Times. He also scored high for being “insincere," “confident" and “creepy." But he scored between 0 and 4 percent for the attributes of “sexy," “impartial," “handsome" and “physically fit."
About 29 percent of people described Trump as “overexposed." And his overall strong positive appeal is 14 percent, compared with an overall strong negative appeal of 39 percent.
Among adults over age 55, Trump consistently held more positive appeal than among those who are younger. Trump also consistently held more positive appeal with men than with women, across all age groups.

Sanders raises $18m in quarter, outpacing rivals
Senator Bernie Sanders raised $18.2 million for his presidential campaign during the first quarter of the year, a sizable sum that establishes him as an early pacesetter in the money chase underway in the Democratic primary.
Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said the total came from 525,000 donors and 900,000 individual donations. Sanders, a Vermont Independent, launched his campaign Feb. 19.
The number of individual donations fell short of the campaign's established goal of 1 million.
The senator ended the first quarter with $28 million in his campaign account, according to Shakir. As a senator, Sanders is eligible to transfer money from his Senate campaign account.
Many close observers expected Sanders to report a hefty first quarter sum. He turned heads when he announced raising about $6 million in his first 24 hours as a presidential candidate, surprising some Democrats who were uncertain whether his loyal coalition of small-dollar donors would renew its support for him during his second run for president.
Only Beto O'Rourke, who raised about $6.1 million, pulled in more than Sanders on his first day. O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman who entered the campaign late in the quarter, has yet to release his total for the period.
Sanders is the third candidate in the Democratic primary to release his first-quarter numbers, which must be reported to the Federal Election Commission by April 15.
Senator Kamala D. Harris, a California Democrat, who announced her candidacy Jan. 21, raised $12 million in the first quarter, she said Monday. Mayor Pete Buttigieg from South Bend, Ind., reported $7 million.

Pelosi says Biden's behavior not "disqualifying" to run
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, on Tuesday offered some advice to former vice president Joe Biden, who has been under heightened scrutiny for his intimate physical style with women: "Join the straight arm club" and shake hands with people as if you both have colds.
Pelosi said she doesn't consider Biden's behavior "disqualifying" for the presidency but said "he has to understand that in the world we're in now, people's space is important to them."
Her comments came during an interview with Politico reporters in front of a live audience.
Pressed about accusations from women who've said Biden made them uncomfortable, Pelosi shared that she has a very different style of interacting with people.
Pelosi said she has known Biden for decades and shared that her grandchildren "love Joe Biden," adding: "He's a very affectionate person."
Biden, who has appeared to be on the cusp of announcing a bid for Democratic presidential nomination, is facing questions about whether a self-described "tactile politician" is well-suited for the White House in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

Marc A. Thiessen: The Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The news that special counsel Robert Mueller "did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government" has left a lot of people in Washington with a lot of explaining to do.

Put aside the rogues' gallery of reporters and pundits who assured us that Donald Trump had conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the presidency. What is most insidious are those who did have access to classified intelligence and led Americans to believe that they had seen what we could not: actual evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.

Recall that in 2016, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., released a letter to FBI Director James Comey claiming the FBI had proof of Trump-Russia collusion. "In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government," Reid declared. When asked what information Reid was referring to, a spokesman said, "There have been classified briefings on this topic. That is all I can say."

Trump has called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to resign. He is absolutely correct. Schiff repeatedly said that his committee had dug up "plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy." In March 2017, he said on "Meet the Press," "I can't go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now" and last May he told ABC that Trump's Russia conspiracy is of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate."

Schiff is a disgrace. But he is not alone. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "In our investigation, we saw strong evidence of collusion" and declared Trump an agent "working on behalf of the Russians." House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed, "It's clear that the campaign colluded, and there's a lot of evidence of that." Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee, assured us last year that "the evidence is pretty clear that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians." Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "There is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America's democracy." And recently, the committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., declared that "enormous amounts of evidence" exist of collusion between Trump and Russia and that "there's no one that could factually say there's not plenty of evidence of collaboration or communications between Trump Organization and Russians." Except for Mueller, of course.

These comments by people with access to intelligence were shameful. But the most sinister of all is John Brennan, who used his authority as former CIA director to suggest that Trump was a traitor and a compromised Russian asset. After Trump's Helsinki summit, Brennan declared "he is wholly in the pocket of Putin." When challenged by Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press," Brennan stood by his assessment. "I called (Trump's) behavior treasonous, which is to betray one's trust and aid and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim."

This month, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell told Brennan this investigation was "developing while you were still on the job" and asked, "Did you see enough at that stage to believe ... that that would result in indictments?" Brennan replied, "I thought at the time there was going to be individuals who were going to have issues with the Department of Justice. Yes." In a New York Times op-ed, he wrote that "Trump's claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash." Now, Brennan feigns contrition. "I don't know if I received bad information, but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was," he said, adding, "I am relieved that it's been determined there was not a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government over our election."

Hogwash. He wanted it to be true, and he relied on his CIA credentials to convince Americans that it was. That is a violation of the public trust. Trump was right to revoke Brennan's security clearance. He is among the worst of the worst, the Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame. We have long since passed the point where Americans expect objectivity from the press. But we should hold our elected and appointed officials handling sensitive national security issues to a higher standard.

Fake Accounts Promote Netanyahu Online, Watchdog Says

Texto completo: TEL AVIV -- An Israeli watchdog group has found a network of hundreds of social media accounts, many of them fake, used to smear opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in next week's election and to amplify the messages of his Likud party, according to a report to be released Monday.
The messages posted on the network's Twitter and Facebook accounts are frequently reposted by prominent Likud campaign officials and by the prime minister's son, Yair Netanyahu, the report says.
The watchdog group, the Big Bots Project, an independent organization that aims to expose the malicious use of social media, found no direct links between the network and Mr. Netanyahu, his party or his son, but said it appeared to operate in coordination with the party and Mr. Netanyahu's re-election campaign.
"The network operates through manipulations, slander, lies and spreading rumors," the report said. "On its busiest days, the network sends out thousands of tweets a day."
The network's activity has intensified almost fivefold since the election was called in December, the report said, and "is mobilized at climactic moments for Netanyahu, such as the announcement of the indictment against him."
The report says the network may violate Israeli laws pertaining to elections, campaign finance, privacy and taxation.
A spokesman for the Likud party said that it did not run a network of fake accounts. "All of the Likud's digital activity is entirely authentic and is based on the great support of the citizens of Israel for Prime Minister Netanyahu and the great achievements of the Likud," the spokesman, Jonathan Urich, said on Sunday.
Mr. Netanyahu, who is facing an indictment on corruption charges, is in a tight race for what he hopes will be his fourth consecutive term. He is facing a strong challenge from Benny Gantz, a retired army chief, in the April 9 election.
According to the report, 154 of the accounts in the network use fake names and another 400 accounts are suspected of being fake. The accounts appear to be operated by people, not bots, making them much harder to detect, the report says. Their posts, all in Hebrew, have had over 2.5 million hits, the report's authors estimate, in a country with 8.7 million citizens.
The report was written by Noam Rotem and Yuval Adam, founders of the Big Bots Project. They were assisted by the Israeli Alliance, a liberal-leaning organization, and their investigation was financed through an Israeli online crowdfunding site, Drove.
The New York Times and the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot received advance copies of the report.
One of the accounts is under the name "Moshe," whose handsome profile picture actually belongs to the Greek model Theo Theodoridis. Moshe, whose posts praise Mr. Netanyahu and excoriate his rivals, tweeted only 16 times during the first three months of 2018. By contrast, during the first three months of this year, with the election campaign underway, he tweeted 2,856 times.
The members of the network work in sync with each other, the report says. When one posted the false rumor that Mr. Gantz was a rapist, many of the others reposted it. On Thursday, many of the members almost simultaneously began tweeting that Mr. Gantz was mentally ill, echoing a video clip distributed by the Likud campaign.
As Mr. Gantz became Mr. Netanyahu's chief rival, the network focused more on him. The network's activity has often spiked at times of key political events.
The evening before the attorney general announced his decision to indict Mr. Netanyahu, the network circulated a Facebook post by an American woman saying that Mr. Gantz had sexually harassed her when they were in high school.
Mr. Gantz denied the accusation, and no support for it has been forthcoming, but the fabricated accounts pushed the story with tweets like: "Gantz the rapist to jail" and "Lousy scum rapist."
Items posted by the network have also described Mr. Gantz, somewhat incongruously, as being gay and having a mistress.
The network has also attacked the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, echoing Mr. Netanyahu's assertion that by seeking to indict the prime minister the attorney general had "surrendered to the media and the left."
All accounts in the network are linked to that of a real person, Yitzhak Haddad, a resident of Ashdod.
The report cites a YouTube channel to which Mr. Haddad is an active subscriber, which has a message offering workers cash in exchange for "responding on Facebook and on the internet with political messages."
"You just get political messages and you post them," the message said.
It was not clear if the message was linked to the fake social network or whether Mr. Haddad ran the network.
When asked about the network on Sunday, Mr. Haddad said it was "all lies."
He declined to confirm or deny that he was the person behind the Twitter account bearing his picture and email address, his connections with Likud, or his relationship to the YouTube channel recruiting workers for the election campaign.
In a later text message, Mr. Haddad wrote: "There is absolutely nothing in this. Anyone publishing this nonsense can expect a very large lawsuit."
"You have no right to gag people on the right or on the left, period," he added, "and the organization that is busy identifying accounts, who are they at all to decide for the open and free world?"
Mr. Urich, the Likud party spokesman, said that he did not know Mr. Haddad, and that Mr. Haddad was not employed by the Likud party and had no connection with Likud.
The network's messages have been redistributed by prominent figures in the Likud campaign team. Yair Netanyahu, an unofficial adviser to his father's campaign, has retweeted the network's members 154 times, the report said. Similarly, the network "liked" and replied to his messages 1,481 times, and shared his messages 429 times.
Yair Netanyahu did not reply to a request for comment. Mr. Urich, speaking on his behalf, said, "Yair Netanyahu has no role in the Likud campaign, does not know the people of the network and is not involved in its activities, if any."

Some of the tweets that include curse words and anti-Arab slurs are written using numbers that look like letters in the Hebrew alphabet, apparently so that a Twitter audit would not identify them as inappropriate and shut down the account.
There have been efforts to update Israeli election law to cover relatively recent developments in social media. After the work of a special panel headed by a former Supreme Court chief justice, Dorit Beinisch, an amendment to the law was proposed to cover social media.
The Likud party opposed the amendment and it did not pass.
Karine Nahon, president of the Israel Internet Association, who was a member of the Beinish panel, said: "We made a great effort to submit the recommendations as soon as possible so that legislation could already be enacted in the coming elections. But when a first reading bill was about to be voted on, the Likud decided in the middle of the night to remove it from the agenda."

Texto completo: People are becoming parents at ever-increasing ages, a trend that can have implications for the health of the pregnancy, the babies and the women who give birth to them.
But while most women know that reproductive risks to themselves and their babies rise as they get older, few men past 40 realize that their advancing years may also confer a risk.
The age at which couples start families has been rising steadily for the last four decades as more couples marry later and delay having children.
Whereas a woman’s clock typically slows in her 30s and runs down by age 50 or so, it can go on ticking almost indefinitely for a man. Since the 1970s, the percentage of births to fathers age 40 or older in this country has doubled, and by 2015, they accounted for 9 percent of births.
“For so many years, it was assumed that advancing age only mattered for women,” Hilary K. Brown, a researcher in reproductive public health at the University of Toronto, said. “Paternal age matters as well.”
A recent study, published in BMJ, of more than 40.5 million births in the United States revealed potentially harmful effects of advanced paternal age on a baby’s risk of prematurity, low birth weight and risk of seizures, as well as the mother’s chances of developing gestational diabetes.
“There needs to be a greater awareness of the man’s responsibility to reproductive health,” Brown said, adding that this responsibility starts with a man’s “preconception health - factors like obesity, chronic disease and behaviors like smoking and alcohol consumption that could affect the health of a pregnancy.”
She added: “While it makes sense to delay reproduction to accommodate educational and career goals, couples should have full access to the risks and benefits of having children now or later. A man’s age has not been a typical part of the conversation.”
In an editorial accompanying the report, Brown emphasized that “current findings underscore the importance of including, in reproductive life plans, discussions of paternal age and declines in sperm quality.”
She suggested that doctors emphasize the need for everyone of reproductive age - future fathers and mothers alike - to adopt healthy lifestyles that can “pay off in a number of ways, not just in having a healthy pregnancy but also in preventing chronic disease. Physicians should be having these conversations with men, not just women.”
Of course, there can be significant advantages to having children sometime later in life than in one’s teens or 20s, maturity and financial security of the parents among them. Older parents may also have more time and patience to nurture their children.
“Couples should have full access to the risks and benefits of having children now or later,” Brown said.

Texto completo: A friend of mine's passion is growing orchids. We're talking perfect, exotic, contest-winning orchids. To get the best results, she does her work in a greenhouse. An environment that is perfectly situated to maximize growth. It fosters the ideal conditions for the natural act of creation.
It's pretty obvious that orchids grow better in a lush greenhouse than they would in a dark, cold prison cell. Simply put, climate and environment impact growth and beauty. Why is it, then, that most companies have facilities that qualify as sensory deprivation chambers instead of fertile ground for fresh ideas and imagination?
How do you grow creativity? We know that creativity and innovation have become the currency for success in our brutally competitive environment, yet we house our teams in windowless rooms with beige cubes and bad florescent lighting. And then we wonder why the work-product is bland and uninspired.
It's no coincidence that the fastest growing, most successful companies create "greenhouses" of creativity. They build physical environments that drive imagination instead of restricting it.
For centuries, artists, musicians, and authors have sought out inspiring locations to do their best work. The latest trend is to do the same for organizations in the Age of Creativity. The recent book, "I Wish I Worked There," shows some great examples and further demonstrates the impact that environment makes on innovation.
Environment fuels imagination What type of environment have you created in your organization? Do you reinforce the past with torn wallpaper, steel desks, and high cubes? Or do you foster creativity and imagination with inspiring and playful spaces?
In today's ultra-competitive marketplace, fostering creativity and original thought is job No. 1 for leaders. If your budget won't allow for an extreme office makeover, start small by adding some color and fun. Making even the simplest changes to your workspace will pay off much more than another lame company picnic.
Take a hard look around and make sure that you're building a greenhouse instead of a prison cell.
Make sure you're injecting your team with passion and energy instead of dull, boring, and bland.
If you build your own creative greenhouse, you will be rewarded with fresh thinking, original thought, and innovation.
You can be sure that each step you take toward a fertile environment will yield jack-and-the-beanstalk-like results.

Texto completo: Valley News Columnist
I came across a classified advertisement last week that shows the lengths Dartmouth College will go to to save a few bucks at the expense of workers on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder.
In the ad, the college was looking for dishwashers, cooks and counter workers in its dining halls. The jobs paid $13.50 an hour — hardly a living wage these days.
At first, it didn’t make sense to me.
I thought most dining hall laborers were covered under the college’s contract with Local 560 of the Service Employees’ International Union (SEIU, for short). The contract, which is available online, indicates the starting pay for union workers is $16.67 an hour.
So how does Dartmouth get away with paying full-time workers $127 a week less than the union contract calls for?
By claiming the employees are only “temporary.”
The college then has six months before it has to make them permanent employees — and begin paying union wages. Not only do temporary workers make $3.17 less an hour, the college is off the hook for their health insurance, vacation, retirement contributions and other benefits.
If the college decides they’re no longer needed, out the door they go.
Local 560 President Chris Peck, a painter at the college for 28 years, had also seen the ad. “It irritates the hell out of me,” he said. “The college doesn’t even try to hide what it’s doing.”
I see what he means.
Dartmouth has also been advertising for full-time “temporary” custodians to work up to six months “with the possibility of promotion to benefited positions.” The ads don’t mention pay, but I’m guessing it’s not the $19 an hour that union custodians start at.
Temporary workers are losing a lot, Peck said, “but we’re still fighting for people to earn a living wage and get benefits. Dartmouth’s endowment shows they can afford it.”
With its endowment at $5.5 billion — and growing by the day — the college has a hard time crying poverty. For Dartmouth, however, shortchanging rank-and-file workers is about more than just keeping down labor costs.
It’s to the college’s advantage to keep as many workers out of Local 560 for as long as it can. New Hampshire is an “at-will” employment state. Employers are free to terminate, without cause, workers who are not under a union contract. This puts nonunion service employees at Dartmouth’s mercy.
“The college can fire them at will without us being involved,” Peck said. “We can’t go to bat for them.”
The SEIU, which has represented Dartmouth maintenance and dining workers since 1966, has about 550 members — 40 fewer than it did 10 years ago. That doesn’t sound like a big loss, but it’s come at a time when the college has added dorms and expanded dining services.
In theory, that should lead to more union jobs. But the move toward temporary dining hall workers and custodians — along with paying outside companies to handle much of the college’s painting — has taken its toll.
Other than the union and a few professors who speak up from time to time, Dartmouth’s blue-collar employees don’t have many advocates on campus.
The billionaires and captains of industry who sit on the college’s board of trustees don’t mind giving President Phil Hanlon a total compensation package of more than $1.1 million a year. They just don’t want to pay cooks and custodians any more than market forces require.
Which is a shame. “These are the employees who are on the front lines,” said Local 560 Secretary Treasurer Susan Russell, a dining hall cashier. “They’re making the food and cleaning the toilets.”
Peter Menard, 32, has worked as a cook at Dartmouth for 9½ years. The union job pays nearly $21 an hour, which allows him to own a decent car and small home in Lebanon.
“I can live comfortably,” said Menard, who has a high school diploma. “I don’t have to count pennies.”
He said he’s just glad that he didn’t have to start out as a temporary worker. “It’s not fair to them,” he told me. “They’re doing the same jobs for less money.”
In an exchange of emails, Scot Bemis, Dartmouth’s chief human resources officer, explained the college’s approach to staffing its dining halls.
Dartmouth uses temporary workers to “fill the gap” left by union employees who are out sick or have short-term disabilities, he said.
They’re hired mostly through so-called temp agencies. Under its deal with the temp agencies, the college pays $19.58 an hour for each worker sent its way, Bemis said. The worker gets $13.50. The temp agency gets the remaining six bucks and change. If workers receive any benefits, they come from the temp agency, not the college.
I understand why Dartmouth likes doing business this way. It cuts down on the number of workers who can earn higher union wages, and the temp agencies handle all the paperwork.
The college also can claim it has no control over whether the temp agencies are providing benefit packages that are less than desirable.
But it doesn’t have to be this way.
Last year, The New York Times wrote about an Ivy League college that requires “service workers on the payroll of an outside contractor earn the same pay and benefits they would get as direct university employees — including health insurance and pension benefits, paid vacation and child care assistance.”
The parity policy, adopted in 2002, “ended the practice of outsourcing dining, security and other such services simply to save on labor costs.”
When it comes to taking care of its service workers, Dartmouth is no Harvard.

Texto completo: "Veep" returns for a final season on HBO. And "10 Things I Hate About You" turns 20 years old.
What's on TV
VEEP 10:30 p.m. on HBO. The "Run, Selina, Run" signs are out for Selina Meyer, the onetime president played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus in HBO's farcical political comedy series, which returns Sunday for a seventh and final season. Meyer is back on the campaign trail, but she doesn't go around kissing babies (though she does make one cry). Instead, she ponders ways to spin fictional mass shootings into political assets and throws her cellphone on the ground in disgust after her staffers fly her to the wrong Iowa town. "America owes me an eight-year stay in the White House," she says later. "And this time, I want a war."
MRS. WILSON 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Ruth Wilson, a star of "The Affair" and "Luther," plays a fictionalized version of her own grandmother in this mini-series. It's a mysterious story of secrets and clandestine operations that begins in 1963, when Alison Wilson (Ruth Wilson) meets her deceased husband's wife. Yes, you read that right: Iain Glen ("Game of Thrones") plays that husband, a writer and former MI6 agent who dies in the first minutes of the story, leaving behind a tangle of secrets, including a hidden double life. Unraveling the mysteries becomes Alison's occupation, and the focus of the mini-series. PBS is showing it in two parts, the first on Sunday and the second on April 7.
BARRY 10 p.m. on HBO. "The end of the first season of 'Barry' was so good," James Poniewozik wrote in The New York Times last year, "That it made me never want to watch the show again." Barry, Bill Hader's hit man with heart, is back, despite that deft ending. In the first season, Barry eventually traded killing for newfound love. The second season continues the story -- so it seems his redemption was short lived.
BLACK MONDAY 10 p.m. on Showtime. The crash will finally come in the Season 1 finale of this drug-fueled parody of 1980s Wall Street, which stars Don Cheadle, Regina Hall, Andrew Rannells and Paul Scheer as members of a scrappy brokerage firm. Since it began in January, the series has counted down the days of the year leading to the infamous 1987 crash known as Black Monday. Sunday night's episode, "0," sees the countdown clock to financial doomsday finally run out.
What's Streaming
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU (1999) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This time capsule of late '90s teenage angst turns 20 years old on Sunday. Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Larisa Oleynik star as students at a Seattle-area high school. The plot, based on Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew," involves a marching band, a prom and the pursuit of forbidden love. "It's projecting a fantasy of a high school experience," Oleynik told The Times recently. "But it's also grounded in what most 17-year-olds are still feeling, what I'm still feeling as a 37-year-old."

Health care brings out Republican negatives

Texto completo: Of all the political issues that divide us, health care is the one with the greatest impact on ordinary Americans' lives.
If Democrats hadn't managed to pass the Affordable Care Act, around 20 million fewer Americans would have health insurance than currently do.
If Republican-controlled states hadn't refused to expand Medicaid and generally done as little as possible to support the act, national progress might have tracked progress in, say, California - so another 7 million or 8 million people might have coverage.
You obviously know where I stand on this political divide. But I'm starting to believe that I misjudged Republican motives.
You see, I thought their behavior was cynical and strategic: They opposed Obamacare because they thought there was political mileage in scaring people about change, and also in denying Barack Obama any successes. Oh, and their donors really hated the taxes on the rich that pay for the ACA's subsidies. And right up through 2016 they could hope to convince voters that they had a secret plan for something much better than Obamacare.
Indeed, all of these things surely played a role in GOP health care strategy. But at this point they've clearly lost the political argument. In 2017, Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare made it clear to everyone that their party didn't have any better ideas, and never did; everything they proposed would have devastated the lives of millions.
Then health care became the top issue in the 2018 midterms, and voters who considered it the most important issue went Democratic by a ratio of 3-to-1.
So you might have expected Republicans to cut their losses. Maybe Trump could have done what he did with NAFTA: keep Obamacare basically intact, but make a few minor changes, give it a new name - the Yuge Maga Care Awesomeness, or something - and claim that it was totally different and better.
But no. Most Republican-controlled states are still refusing to expand Medicaid, even though Washington would bear the vast majority of the costs. Utah held a direct referendum on Medicaid expansion, which passed easily - so the will of the voters was clear, even in a very conservative state. Yet GOP legislators are blocking the expansion anyway.
And now the Trump administration, having failed to repeal the ACA when Republicans controlled Congress, is suing to have the whole thing declared unconstitutional in court - because what could be a better way to start off the 2020 campaign than taking insurance away from 20 million Americans?
It's no longer possible to see any of this as part of a clever political strategy, even a nefariously cynical one. It has entered the realm of pathology instead. It's now clear that Republicans just have a deep, unreasoning hatred of the idea that government policy may help some people get health care.
Why? The truth is that I don't fully get it. Maybe it's anger at the thought of anyone getting something they didn't earn themselves, unless it's an inheritance from daddy. Maybe it's a sense that a lot of gratuitous suffering is or should be part of the human condition, or God's plan, or something. I try to understand how others think, but in this case I really do find it hard.
Whatever the reason, however, the fact is that whatever they may claim, today's Republicans hate the idea of poor and working-class Americans getting the health care they need.

Texto completo: The University of Cambridge, one of the oldest and most prestigious academic institutions in the world, has sparked a debate over academic freedom after rescinding a visiting fellowship offer to controversial professor Jordan Peterson.

Though principally a professor at the University of Toronto, Mr. Peterson, who writes and lectures frequently about the Old Testament and Carl Jung, has attracted a large audience through his YouTube videos and talk show appearances on topics like identity politics and cultural Marxism. His popularity has earned him a New York Times best-seller, as well as the opportunity to speak at schools throughout the world, including at Cambridge this past November.

Cambridge and Mr. Peterson dispute some of the details of what occurred when Mr. Peterson's fellowship offer was rescinded. Mr. Peterson claims the fellowship offer had been mutual; Cambridge says Mr. Peterson requested it. Mr. Peterson suggests that the school cowed to a mob of outraged students; Cambridge has declined to say what motivated the decision.

Whatever the case, Cambridge has erred in rescinding its offer to Mr. Peterson, making a cowardly decision to limit the viewpoints accessible to its students. Universities are meant to be a hub for robust conversation and debate, not monolithic viewpoints. Even students who despise Mr. Peterson would be much better off debating him than chasing him off campus.

Colleges and universities are meant to facilitate wide-ranging debate and discussion. Love him or hate him, an individual like Jordan Peterson has made notable contributions to important political and social conversations of the present moment. An institution like Cambridge should be clamoring to have such a significant figure speaking and debating with its students, not caving to outside pressure from people not up to the challenge. Such a weak-willed decision is an affront to the academic freedom upon which the world's elite academic institutions are supposedly built.

Texto completo: During the month of April, the Batavia Public Library, 10 S. Batavia Ave., will present the final three programs in the "One Book, One Batavia" series.
This year’s selection is "Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Mankind’s First Journey to the Moon" by Robert Kurson.
"One Book, One Batavia" is an annual communitywide reading program presented by the Batavia Public Library in cooperation with Batavia High School and co-sponsored by the Friends of the Batavia Public Library.
No library card is needed, however, advance registration is required. To register, call the reference desk, (630) 879-1393, ext. 200, or visit www.bataviapubliclibrary.org.
On Monday, April 1, Michelle Nichols will present "A Lab Aloft: The International Space Station" at 7 p.m. Nichols is the director of public observing at the Adler Planetarium and a Jet Propulsion Laboratory ambassador.
The International Space Station is a cutting-edge, Earth-orbiting laboratory where astronauts from all over the world live for six months at a time and conduct experiments.
What is life like aboard this enormous spaceport? How does science research benefit humanity on Earth? Take a behind-the-scenes tour of the ISS without having to leave your seat.
Nichols also will present "Through the Eyes of Hubble" at 7 p.m. Monday, April 8.
The Hubble Space Telescope has had more impact on astronomy and the public’s awareness of astronomy than any other telescope in history.
This presentation will highlight some of the well-known, and not-so-well-known, images and science from the last 27 years of Hubble’s mission — and a sneak peek at Hubble’s 2018 replacement: the James Webb Space Telescope.
For the final program in the series, William Higgins will present "New Horizons" at 7 p.m. Monday, April 15. Higgins is an engineering physicist at Fermilab and a Jet Propulsion Laboratory ambassador.
The destinations of New Horizons, a spacecraft launched in 2006, are more distant than any other yet explored.
Its dramatic flyby of Pluto in 2015 revealed fabulous landscapes, a remarkable atmosphere, and a family of frigid moons. It kept moving onward for a billion miles.
On New Year’s Day 2019, New Horizons encountered the tiny asteroid-like object 2014 MU69, a frozen body that’s been dubbed "Ultima Thule."
At the edge of the Solar System, for years to come, the NASA mission will continue through a region known as the Kuiper belt.
‘Rocket Men’ book By August 1968, the American space program was in danger of failing in its two most important objectives: to land a man on the moon by President Kennedy’s end-of-decade deadline and to triumph over the Soviets in space.
With its back against the wall, NASA made an almost unimaginable leap: it would scrap its usual methodical approach and risk everything on a sudden launch, sending the first men in history to the moon — in just four months. And it would all happen at Christmas.
Join the author on one of history’s greatest explorations — Apollo 8, a mission many still call the greatest ever undertaken in space.
Kurson is the author of four New York Times best-selling books, including "Shadow Divers" and "Rocket Men." The Chicagoan began his career as an attorney, graduating from Harvard Law School, and practicing real estate law.
Kurson’s professional writing career began at the Chicago Sun-Times, where he started as a data entry clerk and soon gained a full-time features writing job. In 2000, Esquire published "My Favorite Teacher," his first magazine story, which became a finalist for a National Magazine Award.
He moved from the Sun-Times to Chicago Magazine, then to Esquire, where he won a National Magazine Award and was a contributing editor for years. His stories have appeared in Rolling Stone, The New York Times Magazine, and other publications.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump called for the Pulitzer Board to revoke the prizes awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 election and the links between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.
"So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt?" the president wrote on Twitter on Friday. "In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!"
The sentiment has been a talking point for Republicans since Attorney General William Barr said special counsel Robert Mueller did not find a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but it was the first time the president suggested that the media outlets have their Pulitzers – one of journalism's highest honors – stripped away.
The awards were given in 2018 for what the Pulitzer Board described as "deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration. "
More: AG William Barr plans to release Mueller report by mid-April. 'Everyone will soon be able to read it. '
More: Mueller report: Investigation found no evidence Trump conspired with Russia, leaves obstruction question open
Pulitzer Prize Administrator Dana Canedy said in a statement to USA TODAY that Trump's tweet was "fake marketing. "
"This criticism is fake marketing. We stand behind the Pulitzer selection process, which has endured for 103 years. And the winning work speaks for itself," she said. "Beyond that, this simply doesn’t deserve comment. I’m focusing on our exciting upcoming 103rd awards announcement and invite everyone to tune in to the livestream on Monday April 15th at 3 p. m. on Pulitzer. org. "
In a statement, The New York Times said the outlet's coverage stands and Barr's four-page letter summarizing the investigation only confirmed the work of its reporters.
"No report in our package of Pulitzer-prize winning work has been challenged," said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the company. "In fact, what we know of the Mueller report from the Attorney General’s summary confirms our coverage. Russia actively worked to upend the American elections in 2016 and there were multiple instances of Trump Transition and Administration officials having contact with Russia. "
The Washington Post, through a spokeswoman, said it did not plan on commenting on the president's tweet.
Throughout Mueller's investigation, dozens of individuals were charged, including members of Trump's inner circle, his campaign and his administration.
But no charges were filed specifically alleging a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to help him win the 2016 election, though Mueller and U. S. intelligence officials has concluded that the Kremlin was behind a massive campaign to interfere and influence the outcome of the election.
Mueller found, according to Barr's letter to members of Congress, that the Trump campaign did not conspire or coordinate with Russia "despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign. "
Barr said Mueller declined to reach a conclusion on whether the president sought to obstruct the investigation, though Barr said his own judgment was that Trump had not.
Barr's letter included very little from Mueller's nearly 400-page report. The full report is expected to be released publicly in mid-April, Barr told Congress on Friday.
The award-winning work by the Times and Post chronicles issues and warnings about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn before he was charged as part of Mueller's investigation and Jared Kushner's Russian links.
Other stories revealed a meeting between top Trump campaign officials, including the president's eldest son, with a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower before the election and conduct by the president that led to questions over whether he may have attempted to obstruct the investigation, including asking former FBI Director James Comey to let go of an investigation into Flynn.

Texto completo: Jimmy Butler will have a homecoming that could feature many more boos than cheers.
The 76ers will visit the Timberwolves on Saturday. It will be Butler's first game in Minnesota since he was traded to the Sixers on Nov. 12 with Justin Patton for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, and a 2022 second-round draft pick.
Last year, in his only full season in Minnesota, Butler helped lead the Timberwolves to their first playoff appearance in 14 years. But Butler, who can opt out of the final year of his contract this summer to become a free agent, didn't endear himself to Timberwolves fans right before the start of this season. Shortly before training camp, he told the team he wanted to be traded.
Butler did play 10 games this season with the Timberwolves before being dealt.
Earlier this week, he told the New York Times, "They are going to boo me." Then he added, "I would boo me, too."
*The Celtics have banned a fan from their games for two years for being verbally abusive toward the Warriors during their only visit to Boston this season.
The team says it didn't enforce a lifetime ban because its investigation couldn't prove that the fan used a racial slur toward Golden State forward DeMarcus Cousins.
According to a Yahoo! report, Cousins said the fan "muttered" a racial slur at him on Jan. 26.
The Celtics say the fan, who is a minor, was ejected from the game immediately after they received the complaint.

Texto completo: BANKING
Wells Fargo CEO resigns
Timothy J. Sloan, the embattled chief executive of Wells Fargo, abruptly stepped down Thursday, the company announced. Sloan, who has been at the company for 31 years and became chief executive in 2016 after his predecessor resigned under pressure, has been facing intensifying criticism about the bank's culture and sales practices. Wells Fargo said Sloan, 58, would be replaced by the bank's general counsel, C. Allen Parker, on an interim basis as it searches for a permanent chief. Wells Fargo, once regarded as among the nation's best-run financial institutions, has been reeling since it admitted in 2016 that it had for years opened thousands of fictitious accounts in customers' names, improperly charged them fees, and sold them unwanted products. Since then, the bank has been hit with numerous financial penalties by regulators. Last year, the Federal Reserve punished Wells Fargo for its years-long pattern of misconduct by barring the bank from expanding until it cleans up its culture and establishes better internal checks and balances. Sloan twice pushed back his estimate for when the Fed would lift its restrictions. It wasn't clear what prompted Sloan to tender his resignation. He appeared before a congressional committee this month and defended his work repairing the bank's practices and culture. Lawmakers from both parties attacked his record. After Sloan's testimony, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — Wells Fargo's primary federal regulator — took the unusual step of publicly criticizing the bank. Days before his Capitol Hill testimony, The New York Times reported that many Wells Fargo employees felt they remained under intense pressure to reach the types of internal sales targets that bank executives had insisted were no longer in force. — NEW YORK TIMES
RIDE HAILING
Lyft raises $2.34b in IPO
Lyft Inc. raised $2.34 billion in its initial public offering, pricing its shares at the top of an elevated range in a listing seen as a bellwether for Silicon Valley companies, according to people familiar with the matter. The No. 2 US ride-hailing company priced shares Thursday at $72 each, after increasing the marketed range on Wednesday to $70 to $72, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren't public. The company later said in a statement that it had increased the size of the offering to 32.5 million shares from 30.8 shares. At that price, the IPO gives Lyft a market value of more than $20.5 billion, based on the shares that were to be outstanding after the IPO. That value rises to almost $25 billion, including restricted stock and greenshoe shares that could be issued by underwriters. The San Francisco-based company beat its larger ride-hailing competitor Uber Technologies Inc. to the market. Uber is expected to publicly file for its offering in April, kicking off a listing that could value it at as much as $120 billion, people familiar with its plans have said. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
THEME PARKS
Disney to ban smoking at theme parks
Disney is eliminating smoking areas at its theme and water parks in California and Florida. The company said in a statement on Thursday that smoking also won't be allowed at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex or Downtown Disney in California starting May 1. Smoking areas will be available outside the parks and those entertainment areas. Disney Springs in Florida and the company's hotels also will have smoking areas. The smoking policy was part of several rule changes the company is making at its parks. Loose or dry ice won't be permitted for coolers or cooler bags, and Disney is limiting stroller sizes to 31 inches wide and 52 inches long. The company also said stroller wagons wouldn't be allowed after May 1. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MORTGAGES
steep drop for 30-year rate
Purchasing a home just became a lot cheaper, thanks mostly to the Federal Reserve's decision to put its interest rate hikes on hold for now. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage plunged to 4.06 percent this week, down from 4.28 percent last week. That's the steepest weekly drop in a decade. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
CYBERSECURITY
British inspectors find significant risks with Huawei software
British cybersecurity inspectors said Thursday they found significant technical issues in Chinese telecom supplier Huawei's software that pose risks for the country's mobile networks. It's the latest salvo in a global battle over Huawei, which the United States says could give the Chinese government backdoor access to sensitive data worldwide. The annual update on Huawei Technologies' security said officials are not confident Huawei is up to fixing the problems, pointing out that the company still hasn't done anything to address flaws identified in last year's report. Thursday's report said it's possible to only give "limited assurance" that long-term national security risks from Huawei's involvement in critical British telecom networks can be adequately managed. The US government wants its European allies to ban the company from next-generation mobile networks set to roll out in coming years over fears China's communist leaders could use Huawei gear to carry out cyberespionage. Britain has so far resisted, saying it can manage the risks without resorting to a boycott. The European Union is also leaning toward a similar approach, with the bloc's executive commission avoiding a ban when it released security recommendations for 5G networks earlier this week. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
FINANCE
Goldman Sachs to pay record $45m fine in UK
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s UK unit must pay a record fine of 34 million pounds ($45 million) for failing to provide accurate and timely reporting relating to 220 million transaction reports between 2007 and 2017. The failures, including 9.5 million transactions that weren't reported at all, were violations of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directives, or MiFID, regulation designed to ensure markets are safer and more transparent, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said Thursday in a statement. Goldman Sachs got a 30 percent reduction by cooperating with the FCA and agreeing to settle. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ATHLETIC CLOTHING
Lululemon shares climb on fourth-quarter estimates
Lululemon Athletica Inc. shares soared Thursday after the maker of upscale yogawear topped fourth-quarter estimates and its forecast eased concerns of decelerating sales. Lululemon's new products are resonating with consumers, driving more store visits, and turning window shoppers into buyers, as well as limiting markdown activity, analysts said. Investments into digital improvements are paying off, as e-commerce penetration reached 26 percent. Shares rose as much as 16 percent to $171 in New York trading. The stock has now added almost 40 percent since the year began, about three times the gain in the 159-member Russell 1000 Consumer Discretionary Index. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Amazon to hire 800 engineers in Austin
Amazon.com Inc. says it will hire an additional 800 engineers in Austin, Texas, the company's first major US office expansion since backing out of a corporate campus in New York. In February, the online retailer abandoned plans for a campus in Queens, New York, amid opposition from local politicians and labor groups. Amazon said it will distribute the 25,000 jobs formerly bound for New York among some 17 research and development offices in North America, including Austin. As part of the Austin expansion announced on Thursday, which Amazon says was in the works before the withdrawal from New York, the company will occupy an additional 145,000 square feet of office space in the city. Amazon continues to plan for an expansion in Northern Virginia that it says will ultimately be home to 25,000 workers. The jobs in Austin will include software and hardware engineers, alongside research staff. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The House voted Thursday to strongly oppose President Trump's ban on transgender people serving openly in the military, a symbolic rebuke led by Democrats angry at Trump's reversal of a policy established under President Barack Obama.
The resolution condemns the ban as discriminatory and "rejects the flawed scientific and medical claims upon which it is based," but it does not move to actually change the policy. It instead "strongly urges" the Defense Department not to implement the ban and "maintain an inclusive policy" on allowing qualified transgender people to serve in the military.
The resolution passed 238-185. There is no indication the GOP-majority Senate will take up the measure, though binding changes to the policy could be debated as part of the yearly defense authorization process.
Speaking on the House floor Thursday, Democrats lambasted Trump for reversing the Obama policy, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, who called the move "bigoted."
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington, pointed to statements from military leaders — including Army General Mark Milley, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — indicating that there were no indications that transgender troops had affected morale or readiness.
"What this policy is primarily based on is ignorance and bias against the transgender community," Smith said. "This is unfair discrimination, and it's also harmful to national security."
The Pentagon said earlier this month that it would begin enforcing the transgender troop ban for new applicants starting on April 12. That announcement followed a January Supreme Court ruling backing Trump's authority to roll back the previous policy.

Trump says FBI, Justice to review Smollett case
CHICAGO — President Trump says the FBI and Department of Justice will review the case of "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago.
Prosecutors offered little explanation and infuriated Chicago's police chief and mayor this week when they dropped charges against Smollett related to making a false police report. Yet prosecutors still insist the actor faked a racist, antigay attack on himself in January.
Trump tweeted early Thursday: "FBI & DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago. It is an embarrassment to our Nation!"
Smollett's attorney says two brothers who claim they worked with the actor to stage the attack are lying. Investigators alleged Smollett staged the attack with the hopes of advancing his career.

Miramar mayor jumps into presidential pool
MIRAMAR, Fla. — Unless you are a Florida State University football fan, chances are you have never heard of the newest Democratic candidate for president — but Wayne Messam is hoping to quickly change that.
The mayor of Miramar, Fla., Messam said Thursday that he is joining the crowded field seeking to unseat President Trump in next year's election.
Messam, who played for the Seminoles in the 1990s, believes Miramar has much that the rest of the United States would like to have -- environmentally-friendly development, high-end manufacturing, and major corporate operations.
The 44-year-old construction company owner also knows why pundits say he won't win: low name recognition and funding, no sitting mayor has ever won the presidency, his lack of political experience, and more.
But he is quick to respond with why he can.
Why does he have to be governor or a senator first? Trump wasn't.
Messam also points out he is the only candidate from battleground Florida and the strategically important Deep South and his positions align with liberal voters. He favors universal health care, student loan forgiveness, infrastructure improvements, working to alleviate climate change, and focusing education toward a high-tech future.

Klobuchar reveals $1 trillion infrastructure plan
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota unveiled a plan Thursday to spend $1 trillion in federal funds to upgrade the country's infrastructure, the first policy announcement of her campaign for the Democratic nomination for president.
The proposal would use a combination of federal dollars, tax subsidies. and loan guarantees for state and local governments to upgrade not only crumbling roads, highways, and bridges, but also schools, airports, water systems, internet access, public transit, and energy systems.
In a statement, Klobuchar's campaign said the infrastructure plan would be her top budget priority as president, with the goal of turning it into reality in her first year in office through a combination of legislation and executive actions.
On the campaign trail, Klobuchar has presented herself to voters as a seasoned pragmatist who could bridge political divides to get policies passed in Washington.
She has pointed to her experience assembling a bipartisan coalition to quickly rebuild the Interstate 35 W bridge in Minneapolis after it collapsed in 2007, killing 13 people and injuring dozens.

Adam Schiff has no business on the Intelligence Committee

Texto completo: After two years of intense anticipation and speculation, the findings of the Mueller Report are finally in: President Trump did not collude with the Russians.
The headline in the New York Times on Monday, March 25 read, “Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy,” the Washington Post declared, “Mueller finds no conspiracy,” and the Wall Street Journal printed, “Mueller finds no Trump collusion.”
In spite of all of that, on Tuesday, March 26, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying, “Undoubtedly, there is collusion…We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues.”
In another interview with “ABC This Week,” Schiff said that there is “still significant evidence of collusion” and that “there’s a difference between compelling evidence of collusion and whether the special counsel concludes that he can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the criminal charge of conspiracy.”
Okay, then.
Either they don’t deliver the papers to Burbank, or Schiff is prepared to accept the Mueller Report the same way he accepted the results of the 2016 presidential election.
Not at all.
Schiff is like one of those Japanese soldier hold-outs they found on a Pacific island 30 years after World War II ended, still carrying on the fight. Long after Trump and Melania and Ivanka are dead and buried, Schiff will be demanding that President Barron Trump answer a few more questions about the Steele dossier.
At first glance it’s easy to assume that Schiff is pretty dense, and think “how did in the world did he even get on the Intelligence Committee in the first place? Did his parents pay someone a half-million dollar bribe?”
But don’t make the mistake of thinking that he’s stupid.
On the contrary, Schiff is a malicious grifter who has recklessly peddled this provably false conspiracy theory for years, and can’t muster up the courage to admit that he’s wrong.
Schiff’s incessant collusion theories have gotten him so much coverage on cable news he’s been on MSNBC more often than the inmates on “Lockup.”
Here’s just a sampling of some of his greatest hits…
In March of 2017, Schiff said on Meet the Press that there was “circumstantial evidence of collusion” and “direct evidence… of deception.”
Also in March, Schiff told MSNBC there was “more than circumstantial evidence” — and claimed that had seen it.
On December 14, 2017, Schiff told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, “Well, look, there’s clear evidence of an attempt to collude.”
On March 1, 2018, Megan McCain of ABC’s “The View” asked Schiff, “Last March you said you have more than circumstantial evidence of treasonous collusion with Russia. What specifically were you referring to? And please be specific because if it’s true I do believe Americans have the right to know a year later what that is.”
In response, Schiff gave a rambling answer that referenced George Papadapolous, Donald Trump Jr., and a meeting at Trump Tower.
When he was finished, McCain said, “I just think if Mueller doesn’t end up charging him, it just looks like a lot of smoke and mirrors.”
On May 27, 2018 he told “ABC This Week,” that of the Russia investigation, “I think, of a size and scope possibly beyond Watergate.”
On August 5, 2018 he told “CBS This Morning,” “I think there’s plenty of evidence of collusion.”
For two years, Schiff would tell anyone who would listen that President Trump colluded with the Russians, and now we know for a fact, that he was full of it the whole time.
A charlatan like this doesn’t belong anywhere near the Intelligence Committee, let alone as its chairman.
For heaven’s sake, Megan McCain made him look like a fool on The View. That alone should get him kicked off the Intelligence Committee.
At this point, I think it’s obvious that a con artist like Congressman Schiff doesn’t have the character to apologize to President Trump or to the American people; so it’s up to his colleagues to remove him as chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays at 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Las decisiones de Emma Coronel que sorprendieron a “propios y extraños”

Texto completo: Emma Coronel , esposa de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , sigue causando curiosidad entre periodistas, autoridades y analistas de los cárteles en México, ya que hasta ahora es la única esposa de un alto líder del narco mexicano que ha sobresalido por su belleza, estilo y una personalidad fuerte, que deja incluso ver poco de lo que realmente piensa o siente.
Varios perfiles hechos en diarios como el New York Times, L.A. Times, El País, Rolling Stone, incluso en este periódico, revelan sólo una parte de lo que Coronel quiso mostrar en público. Su primera entrevista a un medio de alta cobertura como Telemundo fue retomada por periodicos y televisoras en inglés y español en Estados Unidos. Había nacido formalmente la “Kardashian de Sinaloa” .
Entre los aspectos que sorprendieron de la exreina de belleza fue su fortaleza para acudir a prácticamente a todo el juicio en la Corte de Brooklyn, siempre con una sonrisa para quienes se sentaban alrededor de ella, pero con un rostro serio, casi inmutable frente las fuertes narraciones de asesinatos y trasiego de droga que testigos relataban.
“Creo que Emma y El Chapo hicieron algún show para los medios (durante el juicio) “, dice Anabel Hernández , periodista mexicana autora del libro Narcoland: Los narcotraficantes mexicanos y sus padrinos. “Pero Emma sabe perfectamente cómo es ‘El Chapo'” .
La experta en narcotrafico mexicano dijo a Rolling Stone que la razón de que Coronel no se impresionara con algunos testimonios, incluso el Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López, la “Chapodiputada” –una de las examantes de su esposo– es que ella sabía todo con antelación.
“Estoy segura de que el testimonio para ella no fue una sorpresa” , consideró.
Coronel también desató polémica al afirmar que admiraba y amaba a su esposo, a pesar de todos los crímenes de los que se le acusa.
“No conozco a mi esposo como la persona que están tratando de mostrar” , dijo Coronel al Times. “Lo admiro como el ser humano que conocí y con el que me casé”.
La esposa del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa –que nació en los Estados Unidos– también asombró por el amor hacia sus gemelas de 7 años de edad, a quienes llevó en tres ocasiones al juicio, pero después decidió no hacerlo más.
“Ella realmente se preocupa por sus hijas. Por los comentarios que hace, creo que realmente se preocupa por ellas”, dice Hernández.
El día en que el exsocio de Guzmán Loera, Dámaso López Núñez, alias “El Lic” , afirmó que Coronel ayudó a la segunda fuga de su esposo, ella ni se inmutó. Volvió a sorprender, como cuando fue detenida en Mazatlán con sus hijas y su marido. Historia relatada a detalla por un exagente de la DEA.
Hernández cree que esa ocasión ella quería enviar el mensaje de que estaba “en peligro”, por eso se le vio vulnerable.
“El mensaje fue que su vida estaba en peligro” , dice Hernández. “Si ella estaba siendo sincera o no, no lo sé… solo puedo decirte, para mí como periodista, ese era el mensaje que quería enviar”.
Es incierto si hay o no amor en entre Guzmán Loera y Coronel, pero él confía mucho en ella y ella muestra confianza en él.
“Lo que he aprendido a lo largo de todo este tiempo, en estos años, en los contactos con Emma y familiares de ‘El Chapo’, es que él tiene mucha confianza en ella. Él realmente confía en ella “, dice Hernández. “Y ella es la única esposa, la única mujer (en su vida) que quiere hablar de él, que trata de defenderlo”.

To Barbara Bush, Donald Trump Represented 'Greed, Selfishness'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- For decades, she was the grande dame of the Grand Old Party, the white-haired, pearl-wearing, tart-tongued Republican matriarch and, in the words of one eulogist, the first lady of the Greatest Generation. When she left the White House, she was deemed by one poll the most admired woman in the world.
But in the months before her death last year, Barbara Bush, the wife of one Republican president and the mother of another, abandoned the party she and her family had spent their whole lives building, horrified by President Trump's election and deeply disturbed by his administration.
She refused to vote for Mr. Trump in November 2016, instead writing in the name of her son Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida who had lost the Republican nomination earlier that year. Asked by her biographer in October 2017 if she was still a Republican, Mrs. Bush said yes. By February 2018, she had given up. "I'd probably say no today," she said.
Mrs. Bush's journey from Republican stalwart to Never Trumper is chronicled in "The Matriarch," a biography by Susan Page, the Washington bureau chief of USA Today, to be published Tuesday by Twelve, an imprint of the Hachette Book Group. Ms. Page interviewed Mrs. Bush five times before the former first lady died in April 2018 at age 92, and had exclusive access to her diary.
An excerpt published in USA Today on Wednesday described Mrs. Bush's antipathy toward Mr. Trump -- "greed, selfishness and ugly," as she summed up the New York real estate mogul in her diary in 1990, long before he became president -- but a copy of the book obtained by The New York Times includes other revelations about her life.
Among other things, it recounts Mrs. Bush's strained relationship with Nancy Reagan when George Bush was serving as vice president, describing how she crossed the Bushes off invitation lists to White House events. It reveals that her husband was outraged when his 1988 presidential campaign hired Roger J. Stone Jr., who would later come to fame as Mr. Trump's adviser indicted on a charge of obstruction of justice, and demanded that he be fired.
And the book explores incessant but never proven rumors that Mr. Bush had an affair with Jennifer Fitzgerald, a longtime assistant. While not reaching a definitive conclusion, Ms. Page quotes an unnamed "member of the Bushes' inner circle" confirming that they did have an extramarital relationship.
"Their surreptitious romance would last for more than a dozen years, inexplicable to those around him and impossible for anyone to manage," Ms. Page wrote. "Several aides decided to leave rather than deal with her. The persistent rumors were humiliating for his wife. They fueled gossip that was politically perilous. Despite all that, Bush for years was unwilling to distance himself from her."
Both Mr. Bush, who died in November, and Ms. Fitzgerald denied any affair to the president's biographer, Jon Meacham. "I was very close to her for a while. And liked her," Mr. Bush told him. But did they have an affair? "No," he said. As for Ms. Fitzgerald, she told Mr. Meacham: "It simply didn't happen."
Mrs. Bush was a singular figure in American life, the only first lady to see her son become president as well. (Abigail Adams, the wife of John Adams, had died by the time John Quincy Adams was elected.) But she was a more complicated figure than her grandmotherly image suggested.
A product of the World War II generation, she changed along with society. She resented when Wellesley College students protested her selection as commencement speaker on the grounds that she owed her only achievement to her marriage. Ms. Page recalled encountering Mrs. Bush at a Kennebunkport picnic in 1990 when the first lady asked her, "How can you work when you have young children?"
But years later, when Mrs. Bush received a citation that made no mention of her work promoting literacy and other social causes, she bristled at the focus on her family role. "I had not realized that I was a women's libber," she wrote in her diary, "but I am now."
By the time Ms. Page interviewed her for the biography, Mrs. Bush boasted that all of her married granddaughters had children and worked outside the home. Still, she resisted activism. "Do I believe in equal rights for women? Yes," she told Ms. Page. "But I wouldn't put myself as a feminist, no."
She struggled over the abortion issue, drawing from her experience watching her 3-year-old daughter Robin die of leukemia. She came to believe that the question was "when does the soul enter the body" and decided it was when a baby takes its first breath.
"Having decided that the first breath is when the soul enters the body, I believe in Federally funded abortion," she wrote in her diary. "Why should the rich be allowed to afford abortions and the poor not?" She added, "Abortion is personal, between mother fathers and Dr." But after her husband joined Ronald Reagan's anti-abortion ticket in 1980, she kept her views to herself.
She likewise evolved on sexual orientation. In 2015, at lunch with Mr. Meacham and the historian Timothy Naftali, she criticized the Obama White House for making a big show of announcing that it had hired the first openly transgender person. Mr. Naftali told her he was gay and explained why it was important to know about the appointment.
"I ended up being persuaded in my mind that after years of hiding this may be a good thing," she wrote in her diary at age 90. "Nobody wants to be born Gay or Transgender. They have been misunderstood for years. He won the argument." She added: "There are a world of folks born transgender who are quiet and lonely. How sad to be in the wrong body."
She never came to terms, however, with Mrs. Reagan. "She really hated us," Mrs. Bush told Ms. Page. "I don't know why, but she really hated us."
Ms. Page found a draft invitation list to the Reagans' famed White House dinner in 1985 for Prince Charles and Princess Diana of Britain in which someone, almost certainly Mrs. Reagan, had crossed out the Bushes' names. Mrs. Reagan also crossed their names off the list for the president's birthday party a year later.
Yet when the Bushes were leaving the White House in January 1993, Mrs. Reagan publicly complained that the Reagans had never been invited to the Bush White House for a state dinner, even though Mr. Reagan had been there just 10 days earlier to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
When Mrs. Reagan later called Mrs. Bush, they had it out. "Don't you ever call me again!" Mrs. Bush recalled telling her predecessor before hanging up. It was their last extended conversation.
Mrs. Bush's view of Mr. Trump long predated the 2016 nomination battle with Jeb Bush. "The real symbol of greed in the 80s" she called him in her diary in 1990. A month later, after reading about his divorce, she wrote: "Trump now means Greed, selfishness and ugly. So sad."
She blamed anxiety over Mr. Trump for a heart spell that hospitalized her in June 2016 and erupted when he suggested that her son could not handle Russia. "Putin endorsed him, for heaven's sake," she exclaimed. "Putin the killer! Putin the worst! He endorsed Trump! That's an endorsement you don't want."
On Election Day, she wrote in Jeb Bush's name. "I could not vote for Trump or Clinton," she wrote in her diary. (Her husband voted for Hillary Clinton and her son George W. Bush voted for "none of the above.") The next day, Mrs. Bush told Ms. Page, "I woke up and discovered, to my horror, that Trump had won."
A friend gave her a red, white and blue digital countdown clock displaying the time that remained in Mr. Trump's term down to the second. She kept it on her nightstand where she could see it every day until her own countdown clock expired a year ago.

Texto completo: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York disclosed on Wednesday that she earned about $218,000 last year through her congressional salary and a book deal, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to disclose her most recent tax returns and issuing a challenge to her rivals to do to the same.
In a tax return shared with The New York Times, Ms. Gillibrand stated that she earned $167,634 from her salary and an additional $50,000 through a book that she reported as business income. She paid $29,170 in federal taxes.
Ms. Gillibrand, who is currently at the bottom of the polls, recorded a video touting the disclosure of her taxes as a step toward political transparency. She has made a practice of releasing her tax returns annually since 2012, when she posted her records going back to 2007. The latest disclosure may signal her intention to make transparency a central theme in her current campaign.
In her video, Ms. Gillibrand urged voters to "join me in calling on every presidential candidate to disclose their taxes."
The release of Ms. Gillibrand's taxes may increase pressure on the other Democrats running for president to be open about their personal finances. With the exception of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has released a decade of her tax returns -- though not yet for 2018 -- none of the major Democratic presidential candidates has given the public more than a highly selective look at their personal taxes. (Some candidates may not yet have completed their 2018 taxes, which are due April 15.)
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, currently the leading declared candidate in the Democratic field, released only one year of tax information when he ran for president in 2016. He said after announcing his campaign in February that he would release 10 years of tax returns "soon," but he has yet to provide them or set a deadline for doing so.
A number of prominent candidates have disclosed aspects of their personal finances in congressional ethics forms, but have not released their tax returns to the public. Some, like Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, provided reporters with access to some tax returns when they were candidates for the Senate. Others, like former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, have never released their personal taxes.
The issue of tax transparency has risen in importance for Democratic voters since the 2016 election, when President Trump refused to share his tax returns with the public, becoming the first presidential nominee in decades to flout the tradition.
Democrats in the House of Representatives recently passed a broad government-ethics bill that would mandate that presidential candidates release their personal taxes. The bill is not expected to be voted on in the Senate, where Republicans are in the majority.
It is no accident that Ms. Gillibrand is the first Democrat to share her most recent tax returns with the public. Trailing in early polls, she has been mounting an energetic rollout of her candidacy in recent weeks, branding herself as a "brave" politician, a term she used again in the video about her taxes.
While she did not challenge any other Democratic candidates by name, the tax disclosure is a study in how underdog candidates may seek to break out from the pack by passing high-profile procedural or ideological litmus tests that more cautious candidates may struggle to clear.
In the substance of her taxes, Ms. Gillibrand's finances appear relatively straightforward: Her salary has consistently been her family's primary source of income, with additional boosts coming periodically from book sales and the work of her husband, Jonathan.
The Gillibrand family's income fell in 2018 by about $36,000, compared with $253,273 the previous year, when Mr. Gillibrand reported earning a substantial sum for consulting work. There was no income attributed to Mr. Gillibrand in 2018, and the family reported a $3,000 capital loss held over from a previous year. Her effective tax rate was 13.6 percent.
Both Ms. Gillibrand and her husband checked the box on their tax return electing to contribute to the Presidential Campaign Fund, which provides for limited public financing of general election campaigns.

Trump knows nothing about healthcare; that makes him the ideal guy to improve it

Texto completo: If President Trump’s new plan on healthcare is to try a repeat of what Republicans did in 2017, I hope his insurance covers a pre-existing condition called “stupidity.”

Trump said on Tuesday that he expected Republicans to become “the party of healthcare." But there’s no indication that he or any Republican in Congress has a proposal that will make insurance cheaper or the healthcare system less complicated.

Fortunately for Trump, he knows very little about healthcare. In 2017, he adorably declared, “Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated!” That's a good thing. He'll be flexible enough about what an ideal system looks like that he might actually accomplish something.

Most Americans, 75 percent, believe that insurance companies should be required to cover pre-existing conditions. Both political parties have come to terms with this. For that to work, people either have to be required or incentivized to have insurance before they get sick. Faced with that choice, Americans prefer the latter.

That leaves just one option: There will have to be a penalty to not having insurance — a penalty that is meaningful, i.e., much harsher than the one instituted by Obamacare, which Trump has nearly zeroed out through deregulation anyway.

You penalize people for not having healthcare the same way high school science teachers penalize students who refuse to dissect a frog over some ridiculous violation of their conscience. You bog them down with an unpleasant alternative: massive paperwork, a fine, passport cancellation, travel restrictions, driver’s license suspension, garnished wages, etc. Pick and choose as you like or do them all at the same time.

That's part of it. Another area for Trump to do some good is in the simplification of its dysfunctional payment system. Any new healthcare law will have to put a cap on the number of “codes” that can be submitted from a hospital or doctor’s office to an insurance company, with an exception for life-threatening or other extreme incidents. And those abnormal occasions will have to be audited by insurers. Disputes can be settled in court.

Codes are how healthcare providers negotiate reimbursements from insurers. When a patient sees a doctor, every procedure and instrument deployed during that visit comes with a code that the doctor jots down and submits to the insurer for payment. This is why patients often complain that they don’t understand why they’re repeatedly subjected to unnecessary tests, procedures and checks. It’s because the doctor or hospital can then charge the insurer more.

The New York Times covered this magnificently in 2017:

"Each billing decision, then, can be seen as a battle of coder versus coder. The coders who work for hospitals and doctors strive to bring in as much revenue as possible from each service, while coders employed by insurers try to deny claims as overreaching. Coders who audit Medicare charts look for abuse to reclaim money or fraud that needs to be punished with fines. Hospital coders teach doctors — and doctors pay to take courses — to learn how they can “upcode” their charts to a more lucrative level with minimal effort. In a doctor’s office, a Level 3 visit (paid, say, at $175) might be legally transformed into a Level 4 (say, $225) by performing one extra maneuver, like weighing the patient or listening to the lungs, whether the patient’s illness required that or not. "

Yes, there can be some deregulation of what insurers are required to offer in their health plans. There are improvements to be made by letting private businesses partner up with others around the country to expand their insurance pools to bring down costs. But the government is going to have to crack down on billing chicanery if we're going to drive costs down, even if by just a modest margin.

Trump’s in a good position to do that. And there’s no Paul Ryan around to mess it up this time.

Top China scholar, an Albuquerque native, sees end to country's reform

Resumen: “The basic thrust of the book is that the reform era post 1978, what people have come to think of as modern China, is ending,” Minzner said “The period of 30-40 years was marked by three factors: rapid economic growth, a certain degree of ideological openness to the outside world and relatively political stability where it seemed to be forming institutions. In the reform era, China was under a collective leadership and had presidential term limits. “Once you start to see the getting rid of norms like presidential succession and there comes a rise of cult personality, it really makes you wonder what comes next,” Minzner said.

Texto completo: Albuquerque native Carl Minzner took an unusual path to becoming one of the top scholars in the U.S. about Chinese politics and government.
Minzner shared his journey after returning to his hometown for a speaking engagement about his book “End of an Era: How China's Authoritarian Revival is Undermining Its Rise.”
That first step to becoming an expert on Chinese government and an author began when he was a kindergarten teacher in Taiwan in 1994.
“After spending a year in Taiwan, you sort of get sucked in,” Minzner said. “I wanted to understand more not only about Taiwan but the mainland. You get led progressively in step by step.”
The Albuquerque Academy graduate moved to the mainland the next year to study Chinese in Yunnan province. Minzner said he lived in China for about four or five years and goes back every summer to spend months at a time. He said he has several contacts that he keeps in touch with.
“I got involved in China during the reform era and started seeing some dramatic changes,” Minzner said. “You get sucked in and it becomes part of your life.”
It has become so much part of his life that he's been interviewed by National Public Radio and the New York Times about changes in China's government.
His book “End of An Era,” which he said took four years to write, has been reviewed by the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times.
Minzner, now a professor of law at Fordham University in New York, spoke on Monday to the World Affairs Council of Albuquerque, where he gave an overview of the book.
“The basic thrust of the book is that the reform era post 1978, what people have come to think of as modern China, is ending,” Minzner said “The period of 30-40 years was marked by three factors: rapid economic growth, a certain degree of ideological openness to the outside world and relatively political stability where it seemed to be forming institutions. It is starting to come undone. The economy is slowing. Ideologically, China's closing up.”
He said it's an important issue that Americans need to be aware of.
In the reform era, China was under a collective leadership and had presidential term limits. That is no longer the case under current President Xi Jinping.
“Once you start to see the getting rid of norms like presidential succession and there comes a rise of cult personality, it really makes you wonder what comes next,” Minzner said.
When he lived in China during the reform era, he said there was some openness in civil society that allowed for things such as academic and religious expression. He said there was a hope that it would continue.
“Looking outward, there is an increasing nationalistic tone that the leadership is taking that has resonance among people in Chinese society that there could be clashes over strategic and economic areas,” Minzner said.
In the past two years, Minzner said, there have been relocation, education camps for Muslims in northwest China.
“We haven't seen anything like that since 1978,” Minzner said. “This is an extreme repression measure being taken that really looks like the resuscitation of practices we thought were dead and buried.”

Boeing Appeared to Be Caught Off Guard as a Public Outcry Grew

Texto completo: As much as any company in corporate America, Boeing would appear to be well prepared to deal with a public-relations crisis. A major exporter and military contractor, Boeing has deep ties in Washington and spends lavishly on lobbying.
Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive, is on the board of the Business Roundtable, an influential group that seeks to shape public policy. Boeing's top executive in the nation's capital is a seasoned operator who worked in the Clinton White House.
Yet for all the scrutiny Boeing faced after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and the subsequent grounding of its 737 Max planes around the world, the company initially had very little to say.
It issued brief statements, expressing sympathy and standing by its planes. It communicated quietly with the news media and government officials. And Mr. Muilenburg stayed out of sight -- his first substantial public comments came in the form of a statement released more than a week after the crash in Ethiopia -- and to many observers, Boeing appeared to be caught flat-footed by the growing public outcry.
"Their comments have been very engineering-esque," said Richard Levick, founder of Levick, a Washington crisis communications firm. "There has been no human face to this."
Boeing now faces its most public reckoning since the accident in Ethiopia this month, which followed the crash of another 737 Max jet, Lion Air Flight 610, in Indonesia in October.
On Wednesday in Washington, two Senate subcommittees are scheduled to hold hearings dealing with federal oversight of the aviation industry. Witnesses will include the transportation secretary, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.
In Renton, Wash., Boeing will be engaged in a charm offensive with its customers and the news media. An early-morning briefing for reporters will be followed by a factory tour. Later in the day, Boeing executives -- though not Mr. Muilenburg -- will meet with about 200 pilots, airline executives and regulators to review proposed changes to the 737 Max.
The crash in Ethiopia set off a global crisis for Boeing. In the days that followed, regulators around the world grounded the Max, lawmakers pushed for investigations and airlines called for compensation.
Aviation experts zeroed in on new anti-stall software included in the 737 Max that is believed to have contributed to the Lion Air crash and may have played a role in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Boeing has lost about $40 billion in market value in recent weeks.
At first, Boeing stood by the airworthiness of the 737 Max, even as some regulators took the jetliner out of service. After President Trump tweeted concerns about aviation safety two days after the crash, Mr. Muilenburg called the president and encouraged him to keep the planes flying.
Yet Boeing did not make Mr. Muilenburg or other executives available for interviews at the time. Nor did anyone in Washington -- like Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao or Daniel Elwell, the acting F.A.A. chief -- truly step forward to become the face of the government response.
"You had inconsistent signals coming from the Department of Transportation, the F.A.A. and the N.T.S.B.," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a leadership professor at the Yale School of Management. "There was no one commanding voice of authority."
Meanwhile, the story quickly transcended Washington. Consumers scheduled to fly on 737 Maxes requested to switch planes. The travel website Kayak added a feature that allowed shoppers to sort flights by plane type.
"Boeing responded as a business-to-business company, but this has become a business-to-consumer issue," Mr. Levick said. "Consumers now care about what plane they are on."
The F.A.A. eventually grounded the 737 Max planes, but not until after regulators around the world had already done so. Boeing supported the decision, with Mr. Muilenburg, the day after his first conversation with Mr. Trump, placing another call to the White House to say as much.
Though it appeared to be a flip-flop, Mr. Sonnenfeld said Boeing was doing the best it could with limited and constantly changing information.
"They weren't avoiding or denying, they just didn't have all the facts," he said. "It's just a very confusing situation, and they needed to frame the issue: Here's what we know and here's what we don't know."
Even with the planes grounded, there have been tense moments. On Tuesday, a Boeing 737 Max 8 that Southwest Airlines was flying to California to be grounded was forced to make an emergency landing in Orlando, Fla., after the pilots reported "performance issues" with one of the engines shortly after takeoff, the airline said. There were no passengers on board. The F.A.A. said it was investigating.
Boeing has traditionally relied on in-house employees, rather than public-affairs consultants, to manage periods of intense public scrutiny. But after that hectic week following the Ethiopia crash, Boeing turned to Sard Verbinnen, a crisis communications firm based in New York that it kept on retainer, for assistance. What followed was a more assertive posture by Boeing.
On March 18, Mr. Muilenburg released a statement and video expressing regret for the crashes and emphasizing Boeing's commitment to safety. Days later, Boeing took out full-page advertisements in newspapers including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. Sard Verbinnen declined to comment.
But as Boeing tried to seize control of the narrative, the bad news kept coming. The Justice Department opened an investigation into Boeing's rushed development of the 737 Max. The Transportation Department's inspector general is examining how the plane was certified.
And the Defense Department's inspector general said it was looking into complaints that Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary and a former Boeing executive, had been promoting his former employer and talking down other military contractors.
So far, Boeing has not hired any outside law firms to help it with the mounting investigations. It is relying on its Washington office, led by Timothy Keating, who previously worked in government relations at Honeywell International and served as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton and as staff director for the White House Legislative Affairs office.
To advocate for Boeing in Washington, Mr. Keating has assembled a team that includes more than a dozen former government officials. Boeing spent over $15 million in lobbying in Washington last year, more than all but a few other companies.
Boeing said it was being responsive to inquiries from lawmakers. "We are engaging with offices from across the country to share the facts," Boeing said in a statement. "We're taking every phone call and responding to every request."
On Saturday, Boeing hosted about a dozen pilots and executives from five airlines in Renton. It was the first time Boeing had met directly with airline pilots since the crash in Ethiopia, and followed a round of more contentious meetings between Boeing and pilots after the Lion Air crash last year.
Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association, said his pilots expected to be in more regular communication with Boeing from now on.
"As the pilots of the aircraft, we need more direct interaction with Boeing going forward," he said. "This needs to be the start of an ongoing relationship."
Even as it plays host to hundreds in Renton on Wednesday, Boeing said it would be following the hearings in Washington closely.
"Boeing continues to support the ongoing accident investigations, and is working with the authorities to evaluate new information as it becomes available," the company said in a statement. "Safety is our top priority when we design, build, deliver and maintain Boeing aircraft."
And Mr. Muilenburg released another statement on Tuesday that said, in part, "We are all humbled and learning from this experience."
But as Boeing continues to grapple with an escalating crisis, the public will be watching the company closely, and paying particular attention to what Mr. Muilenburg does, or doesn't, say.
"He could be out there more," Mr. Sonnenfeld said. "You can never express sympathy enough for something this catastrophic."

Texto completo: MELBOURNE, Australia -- Dozens of prominent Australian news outlets and journalists have been ordered to appear in court to answer allegations that they violated a gag order barring coverage of the trial of Cardinal George Pell, a former Vatican official who was convicted in December of molesting children.
Among those summoned to appear in a Melbourne court on April 15 were editors and reporters for Fairfax Media, which owns The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Financial Review, and for Nationwide News, which is owned by News Corp. They could face fines and possibly prison time.
Some of the news outlets themselves were also named in the summons. "I've never seen so many media organizations and journalists charged in one hit," said Jason Bosland, director of the Center for Media and Communications Law at Melbourne Law School.
Chief Judge Peter Kidd, who presided over Cardinal Pell's trial in the County Court of Victoria, imposed a suppression order on journalists who were covering it, on the grounds that news reports could prejudice a jury in what was then expected to be the second of two trials.
After prosecutors decided in February not to proceed with a second trial, the order was lifted, and Australian news outlets were free to report that the cardinal had been found guilty months earlier. He was sentenced this month to six years in prison.
The summons sheet made public on Tuesday does not specify how the accused journalists and news organizations are alleged to have violated the order.
But when the cardinal was convicted in December -- news that was promptly reported overseas and on social media -- some of the news outlets published articles saying that an important story was being kept secret from the Australian public. The next day, Judge Kidd held an impromptu hearing in which he called for prosecutors to initiate contempt-of-court proceedings against journalists.
One of the articles, in the tabloid The Telegraph, read in part: "A high-profile Australian with a worldwide reputation has been convicted of an awful crime, but The Daily Telegraph and other Australian media are prohibited from telling you about it." The headline read, "It's the Nation's Biggest Story."
Other outlets published similarly cryptic articles. The front page of The Herald Sun, a Melbourne paper, bore the headline "CENSORED."
The world "is reading a very important story that is relevant to Victorians," read that article, alluding to overseas coverage. That paper's editor, Damon Johnston, was on the list of those summoned.
To comply with the suppression order, The New York Times published news of Cardinal Pell's conviction in print only in the United States, and it blocked copies of the edition from being delivered to Australia. It did not report the guilty verdict online until the judge lifted the order in February.
Documents filed on Friday by the director of public prosecutions in the state of Victoria, where the cardinal's trial was held, asked the state's Supreme Court to find the journalists and news outlets guilty of breaching the order; interfering with the administration of justice; aiding and abetting international news outlets in violating the order; and "scandalizing the court" by publishing material that could undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.
Justin Quill, a lawyer representing all of the summoned companies and journalists, said he could not comment lest he be held in contempt of court himself, but he said he would "vigorously defend the charges."
The Nine Network, which owns Fairfax Media, said in a statement that the company "and the named employees deny the allegations."
Mr. Bosland, of Melbourne Law School, said there was no statutory limit to a prison sentence that a judge could impose for contempt of court. But he said imprisoning journalists was "a very serious matter" and that fines were more likely in this case, unless any of the accused had been found to have violated such orders before. He said fines for contempt of court could range up to about 200,000 Australian dollars, roughly $140,000.
In 2014, a conservative commentator, Derryn Hinch, spent 50 nights in prison after failing to pay a fine incurred for breaching a suppression order. He had been convicted of similar violations in 1987 and 2011.
Last month, The Law Council of Australia called for a review of suppression orders, which they said had failed to keep up with the rapid dissemination of information via the internet.
Suppression orders that ignore the proliferation of social media endanger the public, Arthur Moses, the group's president, recently told reporters. He said the law needed to adapt to recognize that separating juries from the internet was becoming impossible.

New Stacey Abrams group seeks 'Fair Count' of 2020 Census

Texto completo: ATLANTA - Stacey Abrams launched a nonprofit group on Monday designed to ensure that hard-to-count populations are tallied during the 2020 U.S. Census, which will shape how taxpayer dollars are spent and trigger the redrawing of the state's political maps.
The organization, Fair Count, will focus on minorities, non-English speakers, renters and others who are more likely to be skipped in the once-a-decade head-count of the U.S. population. Based on the latest census estimates, roughly 20 percent of Georgians live in hard-to-count neighborhoods.
"Georgians risk missing out on critical federal dollars, business opportunities and may suffer unfair or inaccurate redistricting if we don't get this count done correctly," said state Rep. Carolyn Hugley, a close Abrams ally who chairs the new group's board.
The Census has long struggled to tally some minority populations. The bureau said it missed more than 1.5 million minorities in 2010, particularly blacks, Hispanics, renters and young men. That came despite an intense outreach effort that pushed the total cost of the tally to $15 billion.
The stakes are high: The data collected from the once-a-decade count of every person living in the U.S. will determine each state's share of representatives in Congress and nearly $900 billion in federal funding for health care, education and other public services.
It's the latest public policy initiative by Abrams, a potential 2020 candidate who founded the group. Since her narrow defeat in November to Gov. Brian Kemp, she has worked to raise the profile of Fair Fight, a voting rights group she started that has challenged Georgia's electoral policies in court.
Fair Count will be led by Rebecca DeHart, the former executive director of the Democratic Party of Georgia. Jeanine Abrams McLean, an evolutionary biologist and Abrams' sister, will be the group's program director.
Along with Hugley, other board members include DuBose Porter, the former lawmaker and chair of the Democratic state party, and Sachin Varghese, a well-known Atlanta attorney and party activist.
"We need organizing, innovation and a thorough understanding of data and processes to get this job done," said Abrams McLean, a former CDC scientist, adding: "We can do better. Because if you aren't counted, you simply won't count."
The group enters the fray as both political parties are scrapping over a question recently added to the 2020 Census that asks: "Is this person a citizen of the United States?"
The Trump administration said the findings from the question will help protect minority voting rights and that the move to seek the answer is nothing out of the ordinary.
Civil rights groups and other critics say it will discourage immigrants, including those not in the country legally, from participating in the mandatory surveys - and thus skew the congressional reapportionment process and federal funding formulas.
The U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide on whether to allow the question, which if allowed would be the first time it's asked of all U.S. households since 1950.
Fair Count launched with a two-minute video featuring Abrams, who said that "too many Georgians feel unseen and unheard - and these are the voices we need in Georgia the most."
In the clip, Abrams McLean and DeHart said the organization will contact the hard-to-count groups through traditional organizing methods, digital outreach and faith-based initiatives.
"Our democracy is stronger when all voices are heard," said DeHart.

Love your hotel room? Take a piece of it home

Texto completo: "Shoppable" hotel rooms offer items from cosmetics and toiletries to art and furniture that guests can buy, essentially turning a piece of your vacation into everyday reality.
"Hotels are doing everything they can to increase awareness and appeal of their online stores and grow their sales of their branded merchandise," said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. "Online stores are getting as much attention as the hotel website where you plan and book your room reservations."
For some properties, this means making standard room amenities like soaps, shampoos, or room art available for public purchase. And at the extreme, an entire accommodation can be turned into an entirely shoppable showroom, offering guests an intimate test drive that most traditional buying experiences lack.
When you buy something you loved on vacation from a hotel's retail site, you send a powerful message to the hotel. "It basically implies that they want to take their hotel experience 'home' with them," said Michael Weiss, senior director of online retail for Marriott International. "I'd say that's an incredible endorsement."
Shop everything from hotel pillows to dishes
Some established hotel groups have long been offering in-room amenities for purchase. Guests at Westin (a Marriott International brand since the group's Starwood acquisition in 2016) properties have for years had the ability to recreate their entire night's sleep at home by purchasing the brand's exclusive "Heavenly Bed" mattresses, pillows and sets of sheets.
Today, 13 of Marriott International's 30 brands offer everything from mattresses to vanity mirrors for sale on their websites.
"I think people - even in today's online shopping-obsessed world - still like the idea of truly sleeping on a mattress for a full night to see if they like it instead of buying one after trying it in a store for 5 minutes," Weiss said.
But Marriott's merchandise menu doesn't end at beds. The company has responded to concierge inquiries about in-room products by expanding its inventory. Customers at Courtyard hotels can take the brand's bistro experience home by way of wineglasses and dishware, for example. And at the Marriott proper, a good experience with the in-room alarm clock, shower curtain or bedside lamp is completely reproducible at home.
Buy turntables, Bluetooth speakers and other boutique goods
Where Marriott helps you replicate your stay at home, some boutique properties are curating aspirational design lifestyles that are easily transported home - for a price.
Shinola, a Detroit luxury design retailer that launched in 2011, opened an entire hotel in downtown Detroit this January in order to offer customers a more immersive experience than was possible in its retail stores. Guests at the Shinola Hotel have the opportunity to live with (and later purchase) the brand's high-end products, including the hotel's limited-edition desk clock, an alpaca throw blanket, a turntable and a set of Bluetooth speakers.
And from the EDITION, a global group of 9 luxury properties, you can purchase extravagant room furnishings - like the "bowling bowl" art or marble-print accent pouf ottomans both featured in the brand's Miami Beach location - as mementos. They even offer three different faux fur throws, specially designed for locations in Barcelona, Shanghai, New York and London.
Bring home a part of your vacation rental
Even apartment rentals are treating their spaces as short-term live-in showrooms. For Domio, a vacation rental company with serviced apartments and "apart-hotels" in seven cities across the United States, giving guests a way to bring the brand's design home is part of the company's mission.
"Bringing home a piece of Domio can help spark those positive moments you've gained while staying with us," said Jay Roberts, the company's co-founder and chief executive. Domio guests can purchase custom designed wallpaper and art featured in the brand's new New Orleans apartment hotel. Shoppable signature toiletries, an extra-wide full length mirror (designed for large groups getting ready to go out) and even a sofa bed are all on the road map.
Fiilhaus - an interior design startup that offers "haus-in-a-box" furniture packages to short-term rental management companies - offers visitors to select properties it has furnished the opportunity to shop that individual apartment's style in its online store.
And even independent Airbnb hosts are taking the opportunity to make a sale. At Montauk's McKinley Bungalow, every item within the home is up for grabs. Some of the pieces are vintage finds, and others are designed by the property's hosts. And on the website for Casa Mami, a vacation rental outside of Sen Bernadino, California, many products featured in the home are listed and linked for a guest's shopping convenience.

Texto completo: When Molly Sarle was 19 years old, she visited a friend who lived in New Orleans’ 7th Ward.
One night during her stay, her host had to leave for the evening. When a wave of loneliness washed over Sarle, she spotted an old guitar that was missing a few strings in her friend’s living room.
She picked up the guitar to comfort herself, plucking away at its few remaining strings. She wrote a tender, warbling tune called “Dog Song” that night.
Fast forward a few months later, when Sarle was in her freshman year at Vermont’s Bennington College. As Sarle sang “Dog Song” in her dormitory’s living room, a voice, harmonizing along, appeared at the door.
It was Amelia Meath, an upperclassman whom Sarle had seen around campus, but hadn’t yet met. She, Meath and a friend who also was there began singing together in harmony.
“All of a sudden, two really beautiful voices were singing to me, so that was wonderful, albeit shocking,” Sarle says.
It wasn’t long before Meath and Sarle started singing with classmate Alexandra Sauser-Monnig. Together, the three women formed the vocal group Mountain Man.
Mountain Man will perform Thursday at the Appell Center for the Performing Arts’s Capitol Theatre in York. The group released its second album, “Magic Ship” in 2018 – eight years after its debut release “Made the Harbor.”
The group formed in 2009 and released its debut album the following year. Sarle remembers the first time the trio sang together as nothing short of magic.
“I was describing it to a blind date recently... it was like feeling our souls meeting in the air,” Sarle says.
Their voices blend in a beautiful, sometimes haunting way that’s drawn comparisons to the Roches.
Mountain Man’s first album earned critical acclaim from publications like the New York Times and Guardian. In 2011, the group toured with Feist as her backup singers.
Before they could record a second album, life intervened. Meath moved to Durham, North Carolina, and shifted her musical focus to Sylvan Esso, an electronic duo with her now-husband Nick Sanborn. Sauser-Monnig moved to Minnesota before joining Meath in North Carolina. And Sarle headed for the West Coast to clean rooms at a zen monastery.
“I didn’t think I was going to be a part of the music industry anymore,” Sarle says. “It wasn’t something I necessarily wanted to continue being a part of.”
When Sarle was ready to return to the East, she moved to North Carolina to be near Meath and Sauser-Monnig. But her motive was friendship, not a second Mountain Man album. She started to work on a solo album. About two years after her relocation to North Carolina, Mountain Man began work on its sophomore record.
Sarle says the first go-round with Mountain Man felt like a larger force guiding the band along. She felt like they had more agency in the process of the “Magic Ship.”
The group’s first performance after its break was in 2017 at Eaux Claires, the Wisconsin music festival run by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver.
“It felt very similar to the first time that we sang together — deeply magical,” Sarle says.
She hopes audiences experience a similar bliss during their performances. She likens it to the deep sense of peace one finds after a long, reflective walk that melts away worries.
“I just want people to come away with a sense of relaxation and peace,” Sarle says. “I think that’s something we all need to experience more often.”

Texto completo: The source of Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill's latest legal obstacle is not one of the four women who said they were touched inappropriately by Hill last year. Nor was it Gov. Eric Holcomb nor any of the other elected leaders who have called for Hill's resignation.
Instead it's Andrew Straw, an attorney with a suspended Indiana law license who said he has an ax to grind with Hill, Hill's attorney and the entire Indiana Supreme Court – which he called a "kangaroo court."
Straw, who has been engaged in various legal battles with the state of Indiana, submitted a complaint to the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission in August, according to a copy he shared with IndyStar. That complaint is the origin for the commission's investigation into Hill.
The commission, which investigates whether attorneys have violated the rules governing their profession, last week accused Hill of engaging "in a pattern of misconduct" including battery and sexual battery against the four women in March 2018 at a legislative party at an Indianapolis bar.
Hill has denied wrongdoing, saying the allegations against him were "vicious and false." Neither a state ethics probe nor a criminal investigation led to formal charges against Hill.
But the commission's accusations, which are administrative in nature, could still lead to discipline ranging from a public reprimand to disbarment, which would then put Hill's elected position in jeopardy.
For Straw, that would be news worth celebrating.
"I want to see him go down," Straw told Indy-Star from the Philippines, where he has been living since June. "Just admit it, Curtis. Just admit it. Don't fight."
Don Lundberg, the former executive director of the disciplinary commission who is now representing Hill, did not respond to a voicemail seeking comment Monday. But last week Lundberg released a statement defending Hill.
"This matter has been investigated three times. There was an investigation undertaken by the General Assembly, another by the inspector general and, finally, one by the special prosecutor," Lundberg said. "And after having reviewed all the information, all three reached the same conclusion: No further action was warranted."
In a filing last week, Lundberg argued in a seven-page reply to the disciplinary commission that there shouldn't be another investigation into Hill. One reason he argued why: Straw's law license has been suspended in Indiana.
But that argument may not hold up in Indiana, where anybody can file a complaint to the disciplinary commission.
"If there is enough substantial evidence, it doesn't matter how fallible the person who reported it is," said Michael Jenuwine, a law professor who teaches ethics at Notre Dame University.
Who is Andrew Straw? Hill and Straw were both attorneys in Northern Indiana for several years – Hill as the former Elkhart County prosecutor and Straw as an attorney working personal injury and other cases mostly in South Bend.
Their paths didn't cross, Straw said, until Hill became attorney general in 2017.
In February of that year, the Indiana Supreme Court temporarily suspended Straw's license over four lawsuits that were deemed frivolous by the court.
Straw, who said he has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, said the court is discriminating against him and persecuting him for standing up for people who have disabilities. (In filings, the Supreme Court has rejected that characterization, saying Straw's license was suspended for incompetence.)
Straw, who is still licensed and in good standing in Virginia, has been involved in a slew of cases, according to online court records, including suits against the Indiana Supreme Court, Indiana attorney general and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.
As attorney general, Hill's office represents the Supreme Court and other state agencies in court.
"There's a lot of civil rights violations that I've been opposing. I'm sitting here for years with Curtis Hill and his deputies and seeing his name on everything," said Straw, referring to the court filings he is involved in. "And they were stonewalling me. They saw what happened to me, but it was like they were getting some sort of sick pleasure from seeing me suffer."
Straw also said he wants to see justice for the four women.
"If he's going to violate my civil rights, and then he's going to violate somebody else's civil rights?" Straw said. "Then I'm their ally, not his."
Straw: 'Did you see how much coverage it got?' Straw said he does not think that Hill will face any punishment from the Supreme Court.
"I can tell you that the Supreme Court is not going to protect those women," Straw told IndyStar. "How could they? Curtis Hill is their lawyer. How can they be neutral?"
When asked why he submitted a complaint against Hill then, Straw had an immediate answer: "Did you see how much coverage it got?"
He rattled off several news organizations that ran stories about the commission's accusations against Hill: At least 30 newspapers, Straw said, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and IndyStar.
Straw said he was "happy as hell" to see the story in The New York Times.
"If you can't trust the court to do it right, then maybe the court of public opinion can do something about it," Straw said.
Straw also speculates that Hill is seeking an appointment from President Donald Trump to a position in the federal court, maybe as a judge.
Straw, who said he is angry at Hill, wants to stop him.
"When you hurt someone, and you block them from justice, then you have to expect them to be angry," Straw said.
What Straw's complaints said Straw told IndyStar he has submitted five or six complaints to the disciplinary commission over the years. Those records are considered confidential by the Supreme Court, so IndyStar is unable to verify that independently.
Straw, however, shared copies of the two complaints he filed against Hill – one in August, another this month – and a complaint against Lundberg, Hill's attorney, this month.
In the August complaint, Straw argued that Hill should be investigated because he was publicly accused of inappropriately touching three legislative staffers and a lawmaker.
"I simply want Hill to be investigated for his behavior because he is bringing the profession of law and the entire legal system in Indiana into disrepute because he ALWAYS represents the State of Indiana whenever any claims against it are made after 10 days notice," Straw wrote in his complaint he shared with IndyStar. "The integrity of the Attorney General must be sacrosanct and it appears to be in very low esteem with Hill holding that office."
Half of his four-paragraph complaint detailed his own interactions with Hill, who he said is the opposing counsel in several cases he has against the state of Indiana.
Hill's office also represented the Indiana Supreme Court when Straw requested that the federal district court prevent the Supreme Court from disciplining Straw and suspending his law license. According to Straw, "Hill encouraged those civil rights violations against me."
In the complaint against Lundberg, Straw said it was unethical for Lundberg, as a former executive director of the disciplinary commission, to represent Hill.
"He deserves a suspension more than others because he knows better than to engage in undue influence more than most people," Straw said.
He also criticized Lundberg for harming Straw's reputation in his response to the commission's complaint.
What is the disciplinary commission? Anyone can file a complaint to the disciplinary commission about an attorney, said Kathryn Dolan, spokeswoman for the Supreme Court.
Once a complaint is submitted, it may be reviewed up to four times by disciplinary commission staff, Dolan said. If they determine that the complaint does not "raise a substantial question of misconduct," Dolan said, the complaint is dismissed and the complainant is notified.
Most complaints are dismissed. During the last fiscal year, the disciplinary commission received 1,411 complaints. Only 144 led to investigations, and of those, 25 resulted in a public accusation such as the one lobbed against Hill.
When that happens, the nine-member commission moves from an investigative body into a prosecutorial one.
In the Hill matter, the commission has asked the Supreme Court to appoint a panel to oversee the case. If that panel is approved, those members would eventually make a recommendation to the five justices, who will ultimately determine whether Hill violated the rules and what punishment, if any, would be appropriate.
Right now, the court is awaiting a procedural filing from the disciplinary commission.
The process typically takes several months.
In the meantime, Straw said he is happy to see attention returning to Hill. Straw said he had not heard from the commission, so he was unsure whether his complaint would lead to anything.
Then he saw the news reports last week while celebrating his birthday.
"What a present," Straw said.

Checkpoints Closed in New Mexico and West Texas Amid Influx of Migrants

Texto completo: ALBUQUERQUE -- [Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]
The Border Patrol is taking the unusual step of shutting down its interior checkpoints across New Mexico and a swath of West Texas as officials scramble to respond to a surge in families requesting asylum along the Southwest border.
A spokesman for the Border Patrol said the temporary measure was intended to help provide "appropriate care" for migrants apprehended at the border. The closing of checkpoints -- not at the border, but up to 100 miles inland -- reflects the strain on border operations as the number of migrants entering the country, which in February reached an 11-year high, continues to climb.
The authorities closed checkpoints across the Border Patrol's El Paso sector, which includes 121,000 square miles in New Mexico and 4,500 square miles in Texas, in order to free more agents to work directly on the border.
"To process and ensure appropriate care for those in custody, resources including personnel have been diverted from other border security priorities," Customs and Border Protection officials said in a statement on the closings, first reported by Texas Monthly. "This is intended as a temporary measure. Checkpoints are integral to U.S.B.P.'s border security mission."
At some of the checkpoints on major highways, orange cones could be seen blocking off access to the roads along which motorists normally are funneled to checkpoints for queries about citizenship status and visual inspection of vehicles.
Agents at the Border Patrol checkpoints arrest relatively few unauthorized migrants, and most of those who are seeking asylum quickly surrender to the authorities at the border. The agents at the checkpoints deal largely with seizures of marijuana and other drugs from motorists.
The checkpoints have emerged as a source of contention with human rights groups, which have contended that Border Patrol agents routinely ignore their legal authority during the traffic stops to search people without warrants. By law, agents must have probable cause to search the interior of a vehicle, though an alert from a drug-sniffing dog "legitimately" alerts to the presence of drugs, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
The Border Patrol operates about 170 checkpoints throughout the country. Checkpoints outside the El Paso sector are thought to be operating normally.
The influx of asylum seekers is placing stress on immigration officials, volunteer shelters and religious charities along much of the Southwest border, as they struggle to assist the migrants.
Border Patrol agents in El Paso said last week that they had apprehended more than 400 unauthorized immigrants during a five-minute period. Most of them were unaccompanied youths or people traveling in family units, the agency said.
"We do not have a way to care for the numbers who are coming," the Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, said during a visit to South Texas this month. "We don't have the facilities, we don't have the legal processes, we don't have the laws that enable us to quickly process their claims to protect them."
Immigrants recently released by federal authorities in South Texas overflowed a respite center run by Catholic Charities this month, bathing their babies in sinks and waiting in long lines for food, bus tickets and medical attention. The immigrants, most fleeing poverty and gang violence in Central America, described the conditions they faced in custody as cold and crowded.
"It was freezing," Cecilio, a 31-year-old from Guatemala, said while sitting behind the respite center with his 7-year-old son. The Border Patrol's processing centers, like the one in McAllen, Tex., where immigrants are housed temporarily after being apprehended, are known in the immigrant community as "las hieleras," or iceboxes, because they are often kept so cold.
The authorities in most cases are supposed to hold immigrants for no longer than 72 hours, yet five immigrants last week, interviewed by The New York Times, said they were held longer than that. One of them, Cecilio, who asked to be referred to by only his first name, said he and his son were in custody for eight days.
President Trump has pointed to the influx of migrants as evidence of a crisis justifying his call for building a wall on the border.
But elected officials in parts of the borderlands, including Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, say that the recent mass releases of migrants without plans for housing them amounts to a fabricated crisis aimed at mustering support for the administration's plans.
In any case, more migrant families are continuing to make their way toward the United States. A new caravan of about 1,200 migrants began moving toward the border over the weekend from southern Mexico.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Reporters should be proud of Russia work

Texto completo: It should be no surprise to anyone that President Trump's reaction to the Mueller report is to attack reporters for doing their jobs.
That's exactly what he has been doing for years. It's a predictable political strategy - an ugly, undemocratic one - that works as a way to feed raw meat to his base.
And it should be no surprise that his media echo chamber - led by Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity - is calling for the heads of journalists whose work Hannity couldn't begin to emulate even if given 100 years.
As for the rest of the harsh criticism that's being leveled at journalists who dug into the connections between Trump, as candidate and president, and Russia, it's largely misguided.
Fairly typical of this was conservative writer Rich Lowry, who said the three biggest losers from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's report were "the media, the media, the media," which he described in a tweet as "obsessed & hysterical for 2 years."
There are calls for a "reckoning" on news coverage.
All right, then. Here goes.
I reckon that American citizens would have been far worse off if skilled reporters hadn't dug into the connections between Trump's associates - up to and including his son Don Jr. - and Russians. That reporting has not been invalidated.
I reckon that the felonious lying to the public about a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow remains a scandal - and that we know about this in large part because journalists were doing their jobs aggressively.
I reckon that the hard-nosed reporting about former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn - roundly denied, you might recall, before it was proved - was an early sign of the venality that was to follow.
I reckon that reporting by The Washington Post, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, BuzzFeed, CNN, Bloomberg News, the Daily Beast, Mother Jones, ProPublica and others drove forward a national conversation that needed to happen. As Americans saw with their own eyes Trump's bizarre efforts to ingratiate himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin, that reporting mattered and provided context.
And that shouldn't be forgotten or swept aside now.
And yes, I reckon that endless speculative threads and the explosions of tiny cannons on Twitter were ridiculous and over the top - and that the cable pundits who made a living off such speculation aren't really journalists anyway.
It's important to acknowledge the value of the serious journalism because there's a real risk that news organizations will take the edges off their coverage of this subject now.
You could see it starting to happen over the weekend.
It was strange, for example, to see Scott Pelley's lead-in to CBS's "60 Minutes" erroneously describe the Mueller report's findings in a way that Trump might have scripted: He flatly stated that the report, as described by Attorney General William P. Barr, exonerated the president.
In fact, Mueller came to no such conclusion on obstruction of justice, and on the contrary stated clearly that his investigation did not exonerate him.
Perhaps cowed by the criticism - which came from the left as well as the right, most notably from author Matt Taibbi - some news organizations may back down from aggressive coverage of Trump.
That would be a serious mistake. With some regrettable and damaging exceptions - individual stories that seemingly went too far - reality-based news outlets have done quite well on this story.
And it's far from over. So this is no time to retreat.
What would be a good idea, though, is to be less obsessed with this subject to the exclusion of others that are far closer to home for most Americans: health care, the economy, affordable housing and crime.
"We've done two listening tours across the U.S. in the past two years, and it was striking how Trump, Russia and Mueller just never came up," HuffPost Editor Lydia Polgreen told me Sunday. As a result, "we haven't invested heavily in covering the Trump/Russia story in terms of enterprise."
Similarly, I've been thinking of Christine Radwan, a Trump voter (and former Democrat) I interviewed in rural New York state in 2017.
When I asked her whether possible Russian collusion mattered to her, she paused and then answered thoughtfully: "Yes, it's important, but not as important as our economy and what's happened to our middle class."
This observation is worth thinking about, and acting on.
But that's not to suggest that serious news organizations should drop the Trump/Russia story, which is still playing out.
Nor should they allow themselves to be bullied about the important work they've done, and must continue to do.

Apple presented its long-anticipated magazine subscription service on Monday, bundling access to selected glossy titles, websites, and newspapers for $10 a month.
The new service, called Apple News+, will be incorporated into the existing Apple News app that comes pre-installed on iPhones, iPads, and Macs, Roger Rosner, vice president of applications, said Monday at an event at Apple’s Cupertino headquarters.
More than 300 magazines will be part of the service, he said. It will also include The Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times, but not The Washington Post or The New York Times. Bloomberg Businessweek will be part of the magazine section. A demonstration showed that some magazines, like National Geographic, have dynamic, moving covers.
Apple launches credit card
Apple is launching its own credit card, called Apple Card, that can be used anywhere Apple Pay is accepted.
Apple says the card will make it easier to see what merchants charged you. It uses Apple Maps to show users where they spend their money. This is in contrast to the sometimes-confusing alphabet soup people can see on their credit card statements.
The card will live in the wallet section of the iPhone, though customers will also get a physical card made of titanium.
It will include a rewards program of 2 percent back on all transactions. Apple says the card has no late fees, annual fees or fees for going over the credit limit. It’s a Mastercard issued by Goldman Sachs.
The service launches today for $9.99 a month, with the first month free. It will be available in the U.S. and Canada, with the U.K. and Australia coming later in the year.
The News+ service will be its own tab in the existing News app and won’t interrupt the free section, the demo showed. Magazines can be downloaded automatically for offline reading. The News+ tab features access to magazine cover stories, new issues, and individual articles. Magazine creators are tweaking their issues depending on whether the story is read on an iPhone or the bigger iPad screen.
The magazine bundle is part of a collection of new services Apple is rolling out as it seeks to boost revenue from sources other than the iPhone.
The magazine service is based on an application called Texture, which Apple acquired about a year ago. Texture had agreements with more than 200 magazines. Some publishers have reportedly balked at the terms Apple offered to be part of the magazine bundle.
Apple launched a News app in 2015, letting users follow topics that suit their interest, subscribe to individual publications and read selected articles for free. Apple has an internal team that decides which news stories are shown to users. The News app was not Apple’s first foray into the business, however. It followed Newsstand in 2011 that allowed people to download and display digital versions of newspapers and magazines on their mobile devices.

Texto completo: What happens to a society that loses its children?
Cape Cod may learn the answer the hard way. Economist Michael Goodman posed that provocative question in a New York Times article about three years ago, a reference to the hollowing out of the Cape's school-age population.
The situation, it's fair to say, has not improved since.
A story in the Cape Cod Times over the weekend prompted Goodman to ask the question anew. That article focused on efforts to help young families on the Outer Cape, such as free preschool or after-school programs. But the numbers in an accompanying chart told a disturbing story of their own, one quite familiar to Cape businesses and residents — a story of demographic shifts that threaten the Cape's economy.
Enrollment fell significantly in nearly every school district across the Cape, compared with the 2008-09 school year, according to data from the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The smaller, remote communities on the Outer Cape were hit hard, for sure. Truro was down 25 percent, for example, and Provincetown fell 27 percent. More surprising: Upper Cape towns, where people can commute more easily over the bridges, also suffered. Bourne slid 21 percent, and Sandwich's numbers plunged 30 percent, the worst of any Cape town.
Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce chief executive Wendy Northcross says business leaders have become increasingly concerned about the labor force, since the Cape's overall population peaked in the late 1990s. (Restrictions on visas for foreign workers who come for summer jobs have not helped.) The chamber, she says, tries to advocate for measures that could help reverse the population loss, such as allowing more apartments to be built.
But it can feel like a losing battle with a force as relentless as the waves.
Goodman, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, cites a host of culprits: environmental barriers to new construction such as wastewater and water limits, generally restrictive zoning that prevents multifamily housing, an increasing number of retirees who turn their summer homes into year-round ones.
Robert Dutch, superintendent of the Upper Cape Cod Regional Technical School, sees another force at work: the rise of Airbnb and its ilk, and the investors who use those sites to rent homes on a nightly basis. The primary cause of the Cape's family exodus, Dutch and others say, is the high cost of housing. Dutch says he hears all the time from employers who can't find enough employees because fewer kids are graduating Cape schools. The average age of workers at marinas and boatyards is 50, he says. There simply aren't enough newcomers to replace those who are aging out. That dynamic plays out everywhere you turn, from landscapers to auto mechanics.
Dutch's school bucks the downward trend; he turns away 85 to 150 kids a year. The skills his students learn are in high demand on the Cape. But he worries about the overall population decline in his school's five-town catchment area: The number of school-age kids in those towns fell 12 percent in only the past five years.
Provincetown, on the Cape's farthest edge, felt this pinch early. Town Manager David Panagore says “we're trying everything we can" to react. Buying up a former time-share building and converting it to 26 apartments. Changing property tax rules to favor year-round residents. Requiring residential developers to contribute to affordable housing in town.
Will it be enough? Panagore can't be sure. He worries about what happens to a town — or a region — when police officers and other essential workers can no longer afford to live full time in a vacationland.
From Goodman's perspective, Cape Cod is conducting a social experiment, testing the viability of a society without children. It's hard to blame him for being skeptical of the outcome.

Barbra Streisand Says She Now Feels 'Deep Remorse'

Texto completo: Barbra Streisand apologized on Saturday for saying that two men who accused Michael Jackson of sexually abusing them -- as detailed in the documentary "Leaving Neverland" -- were "thrilled" to be with him.
In an interview with The Times of London published on Friday, Ms. Streisand also showed sympathy for Mr. Jackson, saying, "His sexual needs were his sexual needs, coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has."
"You can say 'molested,' but those children, as you heard say, they were thrilled to be there," she continued. "They both married and they both have children, so it didn't kill them."
She added that she believed the accounts of Wade Robson and James Safechuck, the men who claimed in the documentary that Mr. Jackson had abused them when they were children.
She said she felt sympathy for Mr. Jackson, and that he was "very sweet, very childlike" when she met him. She added that while she felt bad for the children, she also felt bad for Mr. Jackson and blamed the children's parents.
"I blame, I guess, the parents, who would allow their children to sleep with him," she said. "Why would Michael need these little children dressed like him and in the shoes and the dancing and the hats?"
Her comments drew widespread criticism on social media. Shortly after the interview was published, the hashtag #CancelBarbraStreisand began trending on Twitter. Social media users criticized Ms. Streisand's comments as tone-deaf and said they were tantamount to telling sexual assault survivors to just get over it.
Dan Reed, who directed "Leaving Neverland," asked on Twitter whether pedophilia was tolerated in parts of the entertainment industry.
In a statement to The New York Times on Saturday, Ms. Streisand said she wanted to make it clear she did not side with Mr. Jackson but she reiterated her feelings about the children's parents.
"The single most important role of being a parent is to protect their children," she said. "It's clear that the parents of the two young men were also victimized and seduced by fame and fantasy."
Ms. Streisand issued another statement about three hours later in which she apologized. Referring to the Times of London interview, she said her words "as printed do not reflect my true feelings."
"I am profoundly sorry for any pain or misunderstanding I caused by not choosing my words more carefully about Michael Jackson and his victims," she said in the second statement.
"I didn't mean to dismiss the trauma these boys experienced in any way," it continued. "Like all survivors of sexual assault, they will have to carry this for the rest of their lives. I feel deep remorse and I hope that James and Wade know that I truly respect and admire them for speaking their truth."
Mr. Reed, Mr. Robson and Mr. Safechuck did not immediately respond to messages and emails sent to their publicists.
In August 1993, Mr. Jackson was investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department over claims that he had molested a 13-year-old boy. In 1994, Mr. Jackson settled a lawsuit brought by the boy's parents for $23 million.
In a 2003 documentary, Mr. Jackson discussed sharing his bed with a young cancer survivor. The film sparked a criminal investigation, and Mr. Jackson was charged with child molesting, serving alcohol to a minor, conspiracy and kidnapping. He was found not guilty of all charges in 2005.
"Leaving Neverland," which HBO began showing in two parts this month, features Mr. Robson and Mr. Safechuck detailing how they met Mr. Jackson, how thrilled they were to work with him and how he ingratiated himself with their families to have access to them.
In the documentary, Mr. Safechuck, who was about 9 or 10 when he met Mr. Jackson, and Mr. Robson, who was 7, described how Mr. Jackson appeared larger than life and how they felt special because he had chosen them as buddies.
The relationships soon turned sour, they explained in the documentary, after they felt that Mr. Jackson replaced them with other children.
Mr. Jackson died in 2009 at age 50. Several years after his death, Mr. Robson and Mr. Safechuck separately sued the pop star's estate. Both cases were dismissed, and both are under appeal.
Mr. Jackson lived a majority of his life in the spotlight.
At 5, he was the lead singer of the Jackson 5, a music group his father, Joe Jackson, started with Michael and his four brothers. Michael Jackson later became a solo act and sold 750 million records. He became popular for groundbreaking music videos in the 1980s.
On Saturday, Diana Ross, who knew Mr. Jackson since he was a child and when they were both on the Motown record label, tweeted her support of Mr. Jackson.
"This is what's on my heart this morning," Ms. Ross tweeted. "I believe and trust that Michael Jackson was and is A magnificent incredible force to me and to many others. STOP IN THE NAME OF LOVE."
While Ms. Ross did sing with Mr. Jackson onstage many times, Ms. Streisand chose not to collaborate with him. In the interview with The Times of London, Ms. Streisand said she turned down an opportunity to sing a duet with Mr. Jackson for his 1987 album "Bad."

Robert Mueller found no collusion and now Democrats are doubting America's democratic institutions

Texto completo: On July 24, 2018, President Trump said, "What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.”

Now that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is complete and we know definitively that neither Trump nor his 2016 campaign was in cahoots with Russia to swing the election, we can all rest easy that the state of America’s democracy is strong.

Just kidding! Even before the Justice Department’s key findings were delivered to Congress on Sunday, Democrats and liberals in the news media were already complaining that something was afoul.

Hey, remember when it was an act of treason for Trump to say that he could understand conclusions from U.S. intelligence that Russia had interfered in the election, but that he could equally understand Vladimir Putin’s denials?

New York Times, July 16, 2018: “President Trump stood next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday and publicly challenged the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election…”

Politico, July 16, 2018: “Trump seemed ready to take Putin's word over that of his own intelligence chiefs on the question of Russian election meddling…”

BBC, July 16, 2018: “Trump sides with Russia against FBI at Helsinki summit.”

The Atlantic, July 16, 2018: “Trump Sides With the Kremlin, Against the U.S. Government.”

Those are all articles covering Trump’s meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Finland. Here’s what Trump said about Russia interference in the election: “So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.”

Treason!

You can sum Trump’s remarks up as: U.S. intelligence claims this, while Putin, who I’m trying to build a relationship with, denies it.

Okay, so where’s the part about Trump siding with Putin?

And yet, now liberals are openly hostile to America’s democratic institutions without any push back from our defenders of democracy.

Joy Reid on MSNBC said Sunday that that the roll-out of the Mueller report, with no new indictments and no evidence of Russia collusion, “feels like the seeds of a cover-up … ”

Why doesn’t Reid have faith in our institutions?!

On CNN, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said early Sunday that Democrats would "accept" the special counsel's summary, "subject to seeing all the underlying data." That's a nice way of saying he was ready to reject it all. Sure enough, hours later, he wrote on Twitter that there were "very concerning discrepancies" in the report and that congressional Democrats would "soon" haul in Attorney General William Barr for questioning.

Doesn't he trust the American justice system?!

Beto O’Rourke, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said Saturday in South Carolina, “You have a president, who in my opinion, beyond a shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government … ”

Why is he rejecting the findings of the nonpartisan special counsel?!

The hysteria isn’t limited to the colossal waste of time known as the Russia investigation. The Washington Post on Thursday reported on the spike of illegal immigrants apprehended at the southern border, noting that the data put Democrats in the uncomfortable position of either having to downplay the concern or admit there’s a legitimate problem.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., swept it all away by simply accusing the Department of Homeland Security of “cooking the books.”

Facts matter!*

*Until they don’t.

For Democrats, the special counsel investigation was never about justice. It was a political pursuit. They’re not giving it up just because Robert Mueller is done.

But Trump was right: What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening.

Barr teases hidden pieces to the Trump obstruction puzzle

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr suggested in his letter to Congress on Sunday that the public may not know of some actions by President Trump that raised concerns in special counsel Robert Mueller's obstruction of justice investigation.

In his four-page letter, which stressed the 22-month investigation did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Barr said Mueller left the obstruction question unresolved. A line taken from Mueller's final says, "while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."

Although Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein found there was a lack of “sufficient” evidence to determine whether Trump obstructed justice, there may yet be more to the picture than the American public knows already as Democrats rally for the release of Mueller's full report and underlying documents.

"The report’s second part addresses a number of actions by the President — most of which have been the subject of public reporting — that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns," Barr wrote.

Word of an obstruction inquiry dates back to June 2017. The Washington Post reported former FBI Director James Comey previously assured Trump in private that he was not under investigation, but officials said that changed days after Trump fired Comey in May.

In July 2018, the sources told the New York Times that Mueller was looking at Trump’s tweets about former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Comey as he was pressuring them in private about Mueller’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Trump often railed against Sessions, who left the DOJ in November, for recusing himself from the Russia inquiry.

Another matter related to Trump's actions against the Russia investigation was reported by the New York Times in January 2018. That report said Trump gave the order to fire Mueller in June 2017. Then-White House counsel Donald McGahn warned of the dire consequences of such a move for Trump and threatened to quit rather than inform the Justice Department of Trump's decision. Trump did not press the order any further after McGahn’s warning.

Trump, who often condemned Mueller's investigation as a "witch hunt," declared Sunday he was vindicated upon the release of Barr's letter.

“There was no collusion with Russia,” Trump said. “There was no obstruction, and none whatsoever. It was a complete and total exoneration. It’s a shame that our country had to go through this.”

Texto completo: THE BUZZ ON FLORIDA POLITICS

Andrew Gillum is launching a campaign that could change the dynamics of the 2020 election  even if he didnt announce a plan to run for president.

At a Wednesday rally at Florida Memorial Universitys Miami Gardens campus, Gillum rolled out an ambitious initiative to register one million new voters ahead of the presidential election. The Florida Democratic Party that its also spending $2 million to register 200,000 new voters.

Im tapping into that network  what we built from the campaign, the enthusiasm, the volunteers, the infrastructure, the assets there  and trying to turn all of that energy and effort into registering and engaging one million voters in advance of the 2020 election, the 39-year-old former Tallahassee mayor and past gubernatorial candidate told the Miami Herald.

Florida Democrats hope to reinforce a slipping voter advantage in a crucial swing state that voted for Donald Trump two years ago after twice casting its vote for Barack Obama.

Over the 10 years from the time Obama was first elected in 2008 to the November midterms, Florida Democrats saw a 700,000-voter lead over Republicans dwindle to roughly 260,000.

And that lead didnt hold up when it came to voter participation in the fall when, despite Democratic gains around the country, Republican voters turned out in greater numbers than Democrats and propelled Ron DeSantis to a win of less than half a percentage point over Gillum.

So, after receiving plenty of help courting new voters during his campaign from registration-minded political organizations like Tom Steyers NextGen America, Gillum said he hopes to build on the enthusiasm that resulted in a roughly 33 percent statewide turnout increase over the 2014 midterms.

At the same time, he also wants to do more to reach out to unlikely and unregistered voters around the state, but particularly in places like South Florida, where some party activists felt that the Democratic Party did too little to court Hispanic and black voters in the past election.

To me, its absolutely critical, not just to this election cycle but to the future of politics in the state of Florida, to get back into the business of engaging people where they live, talking to them outside the election and being in contact with them, Gillum said. So when we do reach out to them for their vote theyre not saying, Its been a long time and I havent talked to you. Why should we believe in you? 

Miami-Dade County was among the regions where turnout among Democratic voters was low compared to the rest of the state, one of the key reasons Gillum lost the race. He said South Florida remains one of the most important areas for connecting with unregistered and disenfranchised voters.

From a numbers perspective, South Florida is where a heavy percentage of these new voters are going to come from. The population there is one that I think is critical for us when we consider communities largely left out or left behind, he said.

Gillum says the effort wont be entirely partisan, but he plans to work in conjunction with the Florida Democratic Party and left-leaning organizations like New Florida Majority and Florida Immigration Coalition. In announcing their own effort Wednesday, Florida Democrats said there are more than 4 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state, and the party will be partnering with data science firms and building out infrastructure to grow the ranks of registered Democrats.

Gillum declined in an interview to explicitly say that he isnt going to run for the partys nomination in 2020, although he indicated in a New York Times interview that hes closed that door.

Hurricane a disaster for Florida prisons

After Hurricane Michael hit the Panhandle, a key portion of the states corrections system was crippled, leaving nearly 300 prison employees displaced and more than 5,000 relocated inmates packing facilities across Florida.

New figures obtained by the News Service of Florida show a significant problem in a region where a sizable part of the workforce is employed by the corrections system and a good chunk of the states inmate population is housed.

It has taken months to know exactly how bad the Oct. 10 storm has impacted the regions 23 prisons. But officials with the Florida Department of Corrections said last week that in addition to tens of millions of dollars in damage to facilities, the storm also displaced 284 prison employees, increased job vacancies and forced shifting 5,000 inmates to facilities across the state.

Nearly 800 prison employees who lost or sustained severe damage to their homes in the storm have received a total of $450,000 in assistance from the Corrections Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to aid the Department of Corrections.

The department is also struggling to fill vacancies in the hurricane-impacted areas. Before the hurricane hit, the regions 23 prisons had a vacancy rate of 12 percent. As of Feb. 22, that vacancy rate had ticked up to 14 percent, with vacancies for prison guards and probation officers.

Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.

The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.

Texto completo: Running for election three years ago, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh promised in a campaign ad to be "transparent and accountable." In another she pledged "honest leadership."
The message was aimed at setting her apart from her chief rival, former mayor Sheila Dixon, who had been forced from office in a corruption scandal.
Now, in the early stages of her re-election bid, Pugh has come under fire for revelations that while she sat on the board of the University of Maryland Medical System, the organization paid her $500,000 for children's books she authored.
Pugh, a state senator when she got much of the money, failed to disclose the no-bid deal on her General Assembly ethics forms.
Clarence "C4" Mitchell IV, a WBAL talk radio host, said that in the public's mind the book deal smacks of "old fashioned corruption."
Questions about the books - they feature a girl named Healthy Holly who promotes good diet and exercise - come as Pugh's administration has been unable to quell the relentless violence on Baltimore's streets. The annual homicide tally remained above 300 in each of her first two years in office. And this year has been bloodier than last so far.
Analysts say it's the violence, more than the book scandal, that could determine whether voters return Pugh to office.
Mitchell said if people somehow feel safer when they go to the polls next spring for the Democratic primary, Pugh's record could look quite different. But right now, he said, she's "a wounded mayor."
"Unless there's a complete crime turnaround, it looks like her administration is just incompetent," Mitchell said. "She's very vulnerable."
The book controversy involves a previously undisclosed deal in which the university medical system paid Pugh for 100,000 copies of her self-published Healthy Holly books, in five orders of 20,000 books at $5 each, from 2011 to 2018.
Amid furor over the deal, Pugh has resigned from her seat on the UMMS board, pledged to give $100,000 of the book money back to the medical system, and updated her Senate ethics forms to disclose the arrangement.
She has not apologized for the deal, and issued a statement saying she was proud of the books.
"Despite all that has happened, I am glad that the important messages in the book reached our city's children," the statement read. "I never thought this would lead to today."
She did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
Some political observers say that next year's primary election - which in heavily Democratic Baltimore all but determines who will be mayor - is far enough away that voters haven't begun paying close attention.
Nina Kasniunas, a political scientist at Goucher College, said that by primary day in April 2020, what now looks like a major scandal could have faded in significance.
But Kasniunas said potential challengers will be watching closely and trying to determine whether the book deal creates a new opportunity to run, especially outsiders who could pitch a cleaner brand of politics.
"You won't see anything publicly yet," she said "This is when people huddle together with their closest advisers."
While no one has said they will run against Pugh next year, several people are regarded as potential candidates. Dixon and City Councilman Brandon Scott both say they're considering a run. Former police department spokesman T.J. Smith and state Sen. Bill Ferguson have not ruled out mounting a challenge.
News of the mayor's book deal broke at a moment when it looked like Pugh was finally moving on from a difficult winter.
The Monday before The Baltimore Sun published an article about the deal, Pugh delivered her State of the City speech at City Hall, pledging to reduce property tax rates for homeowners to below $2 for the first time in decades. She touted the launch of new programs to build affordable housing and invest in distressed neighborhoods, an initiative to make community college free for Baltimore students, and a program that targets city resources at the most violent neighborhoods.
The evening of the speech, the City Council unanimously confirmed Michael Harrison, Pugh's well-regarded pick to lead the police department.
Most importantly for the city's residents and Pugh alike, it signaled that the police department had a leader in place to focus on fighting crime.
Then the New York Times Magazine published a cover story titled "The Tragedy of Baltimore." It underscored how Pugh's administration has struggled to find a compelling strategy to fight violence while also pursuing civil rights reforms required under a federal decree. The mayor was quoted in the story taking issue with the significance of homicide numbers.
A day after the article's publication online, the Healthy Holly story broke and it has stayed in the news.
Pugh ran for mayor with the support of much of the Democratic political establishment. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Baltimore gave her a critical endorsement, and many of her colleagues in the General Assembly publicly backed her.
Now, General Assembly leaders are pushing a new law to ban no-bid contracts between the medical system and its board.
Del. Sandy Rosenberg, a Baltimore Democrat who endorsed Pugh in 2016, paused when asked about Pugh's sale of books to the medical system.
"It's unsettling," he said.
Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller said he thought Pugh, who was a member of his leadership team, still could help turn the city around. Like many others interviewed, he cited the choice of Harrison as police commissioner as a positive move.
Council President Bernard C. "Jack" Young declined to comment after a meeting of the city's spending board Wednesday.
And Scott, the councilman, said the Healthy Holly scandal won't be a factor in his decision-making on whether to run for mayor.
"I'm just focusing on my job," he said.
Dixon likewise declined to comment.
"If I decide I'm running, it has nothing to do with her book issues," Dixon said. "I'm not commenting on what Catherine Pugh is going through other than I'm keeping her in my prayers."
Asked about the book deal, the Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr., who leads the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, compared it to the gift-card embezzlement prosecution that ended Dixon's tenure as mayor. But he also said he'd be willing to look past Pugh's current problems.
Gywnn endorsed then-councilman Nick Mosby for mayor in 2016, but said Pugh had done a good job considering "she inherited a mess."
"She's moving the right way," Gwynn said. "If she has no more hiccups, I would support her."

Poll says parents hinder children's life skills

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. The survey was conducted between Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.

Pianist's portrayal of Glass transcends his minimalist roots

Texto completo: Philip Glass, the face of Minimalism for many listeners, is an interesting case of how much we're willing to shift and stretch our definitions of musical styles - rather than abandon them as archaic or inaccurate - when a composer's style evolves. In his early years, in the late 1960s, Glass was labeled a Minimalist - a term borrowed from the art world, as Impressionist had been, decades earlier. That made sense, in those days, when his music was built on what he called "additive process," a technique in which a phrase was repeated many times before added notes altered it, whereupon the extended phrase would be repeated until more notes were added. Works unfolded gradually, often over several hours. But at the end, they sounded nothing like they did at the start.
Glass began moving beyond that technique in 1976, with "Einstein on the Beach," and he moved away from it decisively with "Satyagraha," three years later. By the mid-1980s, works like "Koyaanisqatsi" (1983) and Glass's third string quartet, "Mishima" (1985), were downright neo-Romantic, with comparative short, self-contained movements, with striking changes in dynamics and color, not to mention clear emotional undercurrents of a kind that were harder to identify in the additive process pieces.
But because he still used some (though far less) repetition, as well as certain moves that were identifiably Glassian (arpeggiation, major to minor chord shifts, undulating minor thirds), Glass' music continued to be called Minimalist, with some critics prefacing the label with "post-" to indicate the move away from the original, experimental style. Most of what is called Minimalist now, including music by John Adams, Steve Reich and Michael Nyman, is not really Minimalist at all, in the way the term was originally used.
The music pianist Jenny Lin played in her all-Glass concert at Space on Friday evening was all post-Minimalist, the earliest works dating to the 1990s, the latest from 2017. An excellent, expressive pianist whose large discography includes both standard repertory and contemporary works, Lin recently recorded all 20 of Glass's Piano Etudes (1990-2012), and she included five of them (with a sixth as an encore) on her program.
Glass composed his Piano Etudes to improve his own keyboard technique, and they are full of challenges and demands. But like the etudes of Chopin, Liszt and many others, they are sufficiently musical to work as concert pieces. Granted, they take in all the Glassian thumbprints, and if you don't like his music, you're likely to just tick off the list - arpeggios, check; minor thirds, check; vaguely melancholy major-minor harmonies, check - and claim it's just simplistic twaddle.
But if you listen more closely, there's a lot happening in this music, and more than a few sly references. The grand chordal figures that make two appearances in Etude No. 1 proceed from the opening of Beethoven's "PathÃ©tique" Sonata, but move in strikingly different direction, with arpeggiated figures that take in unexpected leaps, rather than simply outlining the chords. The arpeggiation in Etude No. 2 unfolds similarly, but the striking elements here are deep, loud bass punctuation and, toward the end, high range chordal bursts. The sparkling figuration in Etude No. 13 edges toward borrowing from Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker," but moves safely far afield.
There are other riches, too numerous to list in the available space, but in the selection Lin offered, they show Glass setting himself difficult technical goals, including melodies built of rapidly repeated notes (in No. 6) and brash, dissonant bursts (in No. 10). Mostly, though, these are pieces full of drama, energy and passion, all of which Lin kept firmly in the spotlight.
Lin opened her program with selections from two of Glass' film scores, "The Truman Show" (1998) and "The Hours" (2002). In "Truman Sleeps," the focus is an ascending, bittersweet melody that floats dreamily over the arpeggiated accompaniment. The "Hours" excerpts - "Morning Passage" and the title piece - balance chromatic themes against chordal accompaniments, with the focus occasionally shifting toward the latter.
The most striking work Lin played was the newest, "Distant Figure (Passacaglia for Solo Piano)" (2017). It is a good reminder that repetition as a musical engine did not begin with Glass: The passacaglia is a Baroque form in which a bass line or chord progression opens a work and is repeated throughout, with variation unfolding above it. This is a virtuosic example of the form, with surprising contrasts, dramatic passages etched in Lisztian thunder, and others rooted in layers of chromaticism - but with the repeating, underlying progression consistently in view.

Texto completo: At the risk of paraphrasing the musical, "Rent," I want to pose a serious question: How do you measure the size of a menu? In appetizers? In entrÃ©es? In dim sum and ramen?
Perhaps more to the point, how big is too big? Twenty dishes? Two dozen? Three?
Empire Chinese Kitchen, one of Portland's most consistently popular restaurants, now offers a menu that tips the scales at four dozen items, plus a few specials. Things weren't always this way. When the restaurant opened in late 2013 - about six weeks before this paper awarded it four and a half stars - Empire featured a sharply focused menu of eight dishes.
I wish I had visited then. Instead, I waited 18 months. By then the list of what co-owner and general manager Theresa Chan calls "contemporary Southern Chinese" dishes had long-since begun distending to its current size. But then, as now, I am sure I could have picked eight stellar dishes from the bloated list.
The best place to start is with vegetables. Especially when stir-fried, they are one of co-owner/chef Freeman Chan's strongest suits. Take his sautÃ©ed bok choy dressed with white pepper and oyster sauce ($6), a dish whose simplicity shunts your attention toward the lovely balance of textures: crunchy stalks against tender, delicate leaves. Or dry-fried green beans ($6), a small portion of still-crisp beans that have been flash-fried with tamari, sweet onions and garlic. Savory and slick with vegetarian oyster sauce, they are impossible to resist. Ask the kids greedily eating them at the table next to mine.
Even the Chinese eggplant in sweet-tart garlic sauce ($8) - best eaten spooned over a bowl of sesame-seed-dusted white rice - is a pleasure, despite having absorbed a glug or two too much oil during its time in the wok.
Traditional dim sum dumplings and buns, the purview of Theresa Chan's grandfather, Li Bing Tian, are also largely top-notch. My dinner guests at a recent visit couldn't get enough of that night's special bao, billowy stark-white parcels of steamed dough stuffed with ginger, bok choy and minced chicken ($8). After they've puffed up, the kitchen pan-sears one side until it goes toasty and golden.
Empire's har gow ($9), chubby, clear-skinned steamed shrimp dumplings, might be the best dish on the now-expansive menu. Surrounding a sticky filling of bamboo shoots and chopped shrimp is a house-made crystal wrapper - a pasta of sorts made from potato and tapioca starches that are kneaded together with roasted shallot oil. As the har gow cook, they release volatile compounds into the clouds of steam that surround them. And when they arrive at your table, opening the bamboo steamer unleashes a scent like tramping through a field of wild onions on a sweltering summer afternoon.
Not all the buns are as pleasingly evocative. Banana-chocolate bao ($6), one of the restaurant's few desserts, is an unpleasantly greasy duo of dough balls packed with Nutella spread and sliced banana. They tasted like something you might eat at a carnival, then quickly regret.
Perhaps we should have taken the hint from our server, who, when we inquired about desserts, started his reply with, "Really?" But we assumed that was just part of his brusque, often grouchy approach to service.
We caught the first glimpse of it soon after we arrived when he delivered a blunt (and strangely possessive) warning that "All the food from my kitchen comes out as soon as it is ready. Got it? It's all supposed to be eaten family-style. Sharing is caring, which is what it says there on the wall," he told us, pointing at the phrase "yum cha." "Just kidding. It says 'drink tea.' " Sort of. "Yum cha" might literally mean "drink tea," but it is used to represent the experience of going out for dim sum, of making a meal out of lots of small plates and pot after pot of tea.
As he delivered drinks to our table - including a candy-sweet Pink Flamingo ($8), a sparkling cava, yuzu and Chambord concoction he promised was the least-sweet cocktail on the menu - he launched into his well-rehearsed spiel again. We nodded politely and placed our order, duly cautioned about the process. When he reeled off the same minilecture a third time, we rolled our eyes, then burst into laughter when we heard him start all over again at a nearby table.
We were lucky we were able to hear him at all, because Empire's dining room of exposed rafters, ductwork and hard surfaces (including a sauce-spattered glass door salvaged from a jewelry repair shop) can get calamitously loud when it is full. On nights when there is live music in the owners' adjoining event space, it contributes a further layer of clamor.
Not fixing the noise problems is a puzzling choice, as is the decision to expand the menu by incorporating several American-Chinese dishes more suited to a food court than to an ambitious, occasionally elegant restaurant like Empire. Plates like Kung Pao chicken ($16) and orange beef ($13) seem entirely out of step with the rest of the menu. A few, like dark, smoky chicken marinated in plum sauce and cooked "teriyaki"-style ($15) are solid. Others are not particularly well-executed, like wrapper-heavy spring rolls served alongside a fistful of wilted arugula ($6), or a version of honey walnut shrimp ($11) made with so much sweet Kewpie mayonnaise, yuzu and sweetened condensed milk that it tasted like a Waldorf salad made with deep-fried shrimp.
I like to imagine that Empire's true heart beats through dishes like Chinatown pork ($9): thin strips of marbled loin that has been marinated for an entire day in honey, hoisin sauce and roasted shallots. Or better still, the finely equilibrated beef and broad noodles ($16), a dish that could only have been prepared by someone who is both an engineer and a chef. On a bed of wok-sautÃ©ed, knife-cut rice noodles that Freeman Chan rolls out every day, sit thin strips of flank steak, bean sprouts and pointy-tipped scallion batons. "To do it well, you have a really small window," Theresa Chan said. "It's like a pizza, in that there aren't many ingredients that go into it. It's simple, but not everyone can do it. He does." Co-signed.
Forget the syrupy, deep-fried dishes, the Nutella-filled buns and over-sweetened cocktails. Look for it, and you'll find Empire's secret menu hiding in plain sight. Just let the promise of simplicity guide you.

Texto completo: Sign up for 108 Stitches to get the best Red Sox stories right to your inbox
Alex Cora almost stopped himself before he completed the sentence, but true to his nature, went ahead and said what was on his mind.
“If you guys thought last year was special," the Red Sox manager teased, pausing just long enough to make his final punch especially powerful. “Wait till this year."
This was during the annual offseason Boston Baseball Writers Dinner, while Cora was accepting his Manager of the Year award. There he stood, thick in that heady interlude between past perfection and future potential, the elation over a recently won championship eclipsed only by the excitement for the possibility of doing it again. And as the Red Sox wrapped up spring training this month in Florida, there's been little to dim the bravado Cora shared at that January dinner. With a potent lineup, stellar defense, and a starting rotation to match any in the majors, only the questions around the bullpen remain, and that's not nearly enough to derail the train of optimism that this team can repeat.

“To be honest with you, this ball club looks so good, man, from head to toe," none other than Sox legend David Ortiz told reporters in Fort Myers. “It's like you walk into that clubhouse and you can feel the good vibe, you can feel that. If there's one person who can explain that, it's myself because I was in the clubhouse for a long time, and I have an even better feeling this year than the feeling I had last year.
“And I told you guys how good I felt about the ball club last year. But it's because you can see on the players' faces the experience they went through in the playoffs, what they learned, how confident you feel about how you did and the result and everything. I mean, as a player, I can tell you that plays a big role for the following season.
“Why not?"
The Sox deserve to be confident. But they also need to be wary. Baseball, with its sheer volume of teams, with its expanded playoff format and diminishing windows of star talent, is probably the most difficult of the four major sports to repeat as champions. But it's interesting to note that the last team to do it, the 1999 Yankees, bears a strikingly similar situation to what the 2019 Red Sox face.

The '99 Yankees are often forgotten in the Yankees' dynastic run of four titles in five years. The 1996 team? They were the first, the special ones for breaking a forgettable decade of the '80s, when mediocrity reigned. The 2000 team? They bested the crosstown rival Mets in a memorable Subway Series, as New York an event as sports had seen in a very long time. And the 1998 team? Well, they were the all-timers, who would win a ridiculous 114 games in the regular season and surge through the playoffs all the way to a World Series sweep.
That leaves the '99 team, one that struggled for much of the season to find its footing. As then-New York Times beat writer and now ESPN baseball insider Buster Olney wrote late in the season, “all year the Yankees have played in the shadow of what they accomplished in 1998, when they set a record by winning 125 games and finished with a four-game sweep of San Diego in the World Series. Players sometimes griped early in the year that fans and the news media unfairly compared the 1999 Yankees to that standard, but by midsummer it became apparent that the Yankees themselves were trying to live up to their own impossible expectations. Nearly all the Yankees have been guilty of pressing and pushing themselves into ruts of anxiety at one time or another."

Some rumblings had been there since spring, when a blockbuster trade on the day players reported changed the roster dynamics. The Yankees acquired former Red Sox ace Roger Clemens from Toronto in a deal that included giving away David Wells. Ultimately, the rotation of Clemens, Orlando Hernandez, Andy Pettitte, and David Cone was enough to anchor another title run. The Red Sox foursome of Chris Sale, David Price, Rick Porcello, and Nathan Eovaldi (along with Eduardo Rodriguez) certainly has a chance to be as good. But it wasn't all rosy in New York. Manager Joe Torre missed a chunk of the early season getting treatment for prostate cancer, which also affected veteran Darryl Strawberry, who'd been treated for colon cancer.
In the end, those Yankees did find their way, clinching the division in late September, their 98 regular-season wins four better than the wild-card finishing Red Sox. They'd sweep the Rangers in the division round, beat the Sox in the ALCS (Bernie Williams's walkoff homer off Rod Beck in Game 1 set the tone, and not even a memorable Fenway meltdown by Clemens could derail the train), and keep their World Series winning streak alive by sweeping the Braves. An impressive 11-1 record in the playoffs proved both how much they had shed the identity of the previous year and how much they kept the momentum of the previous year.
Can the Sox do the same? That is the challenge — believing in this year's team while forgetting last year's. Because the nature of sports demands at least some measure of Belichickian focus. It's on to 2019, boys, where last year's 108 regular-season wins, last year's MVP performance by Mookie Betts, last year's trump-card playoff pitching heroics of David Price, last year's unlikely emergence of World Series MVP Steve Pearce, they're all washed away. Time to start again.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Bill Langlois has a new best friend. She is a cat named Sox. She lives on a tablet, and she makes him so happy that when he talks about her arrival in his life, he begins to cry.
All day long, Sox and Mr. Langlois, who is 68 and lives in a low-income senior housing complex in Lowell, Mass., chat. Mr. Langlois worked in machine operations, but now he is retired. With his wife out of the house most of the time, he has grown lonely.
Sox talks to him about his favorite team, the Red Sox, after which she is named. She plays his favorite songs and shows him pictures from his wedding. And because she has a video feed of him in his recliner, she chastises him when she catches him drinking soda instead of water.
Mr. Langlois knows that Sox is artifice, that she comes from a start-up called Care.Coach. He knows she is operated by workers around the world who are watching, listening and typing out her responses, which sound slow and robotic. But her consistent voice in his life has returned him to his faith.
"I found something so reliable and someone so caring, and it's allowed me to go into my deep soul and remember how caring the Lord was," Mr. Langlois said. "She's brought my life back to life."
Sox has been listening. "We make a great team," she says.
Sox is a simple animation; she barely moves or emotes, and her voice is as harsh as a dial tone. But little animated hearts come up around her sometimes, and Mr. Langlois loves when that happens.
Mr. Langlois is on a fixed income. To qualify for Element Care, a nonprofit health care program for older adults that brought him Sox, a patient's countable assets must not be greater than $2,000.
Such programs are proliferating. And not just for the elderly.
Life for anyone but the very rich -- the physical experience of learning, living and dying -- is increasingly mediated by screens.
Not only are screens themselves cheap to make, but they also make things cheaper. Any place that can fit a screen in (classrooms, hospitals, airports, restaurants) can cut costs. And any activity that can happen on a screen becomes cheaper. The texture of life, the tactile experience, is becoming smooth glass.
The rich do not live like this. The rich have grown afraid of screens. They want their children to play with blocks, and tech-free private schools are booming. Humans are more expensive, and rich people are willing and able to pay for them. Conspicuous human interaction -- living without a phone for a day, quitting social networks and not answering email -- has become a status symbol.
All of this has led to a curious new reality: Human contact is becoming a luxury good.
As more screens appear in the lives of the poor, screens are disappearing from the lives of the rich. The richer you are, the more you spend to be offscreen.
Milton Pedraza, the chief executive of the Luxury Institute, advises companies on how the wealthiest want to live and spend, and what he has found is that the wealthy want to spend on anything human.
"What we are seeing now is the luxurification of human engagement," Mr. Pedraza said.
Anticipated spending on experiences such as leisure travel and dining is outpacing spending on goods, according to his company's research, and he sees it as a direct response to the proliferation of screens.
"The positive behaviors and emotions human engagement elicits -- think the joy of a massage. Now education, health care stores, everyone, is starting to look at how to make experiences human," Mr. Pedraza said. "The human is very important right now."
This is a swift change. Since the 1980s personal computer boom, having technology at home and on your person had been a sign of wealth and power. Early adopters with disposable income rushed to get the newest gadgets and show them off. The first Apple Mac shipped in 1984 and cost about $2,500 (in today's dollars, $6,000). Now the very best Chromebook laptop, according to Wirecutter, a New York Times-owned product reviews site, costs $470.
"Pagers were important to have because it was a signal that you were an important, busy person," said Joseph Nunes, chairman of the marketing department at the University of Southern California, who specializes in status marketing.
Today, he said, the opposite is true: "If you're truly at the top of the hierarchy, you don't have to answer to anyone. They have to answer to you."
The joy -- at least at first -- of the internet revolution was its democratic nature. Facebook is the same Facebook whether you are rich or poor. Gmail is the same Gmail. And it's all free. There is something mass market and unappealing about that. And as studies show that time on these advertisement-support platforms is unhealthy, it all starts to seem déclassé, like drinking soda or smoking cigarettes, which wealthy people do less than poor people.
The wealthy can afford to opt out of having their data and their attention sold as a product. The poor and middle class don't have the same kind of resources to make that happen.
Screen exposure starts young. And children who spent more than two hours a day looking at a screen got lower scores on thinking and language tests, according to early results of a landmark study on brain development of more than 11,000 children that the National Institutes of Health is supporting. Most disturbingly, the study is finding that the brains of children who spend a lot of time on screens are different. For some kids, there is premature thinning of their cerebral cortex. In adults, one study found an association between screen time and depression.
A toddler who learns to build with virtual blocks in an iPad game gains no ability to build with actual blocks, according to Dimitri Christakis, a pediatrician at Seattle Children's Hospital and a lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines on screen time.
In small towns around Wichita, Kan., in a state where school budgets have been so tight that the State Supreme Court ruled them inadequate, classes have been replaced by software, much of the academic day now spent in silence on a laptop. In Utah, thousands of children do a brief, state-provided preschool program at home via laptop.
Tech companies worked hard to get public schools to buy into programs that required schools to have one laptop per student, arguing that it would better prepare children for their screen-based future. But this idea isn't how the people who actually build the screen-based future raise their own children.
In Silicon Valley, time on screens is increasingly seen as unhealthy. Here, the popular elementary school is the local Waldorf School, which promises a back-to-nature, nearly screen-free education.
So as wealthy kids are growing up with less screen time, poor kids are growing up with more. How comfortable someone is with human engagement could become a new class marker.
Human contact is, of course, not exactly like organic food or a Birkin bag. But with screen time, there has been a concerted effort on the part of Silicon Valley behemoths to confuse the public. The poor and the middle class are told that screens are good and important for them and their children. There are fleets of psychologists and neuroscientists on staff at big tech companies working to hook eyes and minds to the screen as fast as possible and for as long as possible.
And so human contact is rare.
"But the holdup is this: Not everyone wants it, unlike other kinds of luxury products," said Sherry Turkle, professor of the social studies of science and technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"They flee to what they know, to screens," Ms. Turkle said. "It's like fleeing to fast food."
Just as skipping fast food is harder when it's the only restaurant offering in town, separating from screens is harder for the poor and middle class. Even if someone is determined to be offline, that is often not possible.
Coach seat backs have screen ads autoplaying. Public school parents might not want their kids learning on screens, but that is not an option when many classes are now built on one-to-one laptop programs. There is a small movement to pass a "right to disconnect" bill, which would allow workers to turn their phones off, but for now a worker can be punished for going offline and not being available.
There is also the reality that in our culture of increasing isolation, in which so many of the traditional gathering places and social structures have disappeared, screens are filling a crucial void.
Many enrolled in the avatar program at Element Care were failed by the humans around them or never had a community in the first place, and they became isolated, said Cely Rosario, the occupational therapist who frequently checks in on participants. Poor communities have seen their social fabric fray the most, she said.
The technology behind Sox, the Care.Coach cat keeping an eye on Mr. Langlois in Lowell, is quite simple: a Samsung Galaxy Tab E tablet with an ultrawide-angle fisheye lens attached to the front. None of the people operating the avatars are in the United States; they mostly work in the Philippines and Latin America.
The Care.Coach office is a warrenlike space above a massage parlor in Millbrae, Calif., on the edge of Silicon Valley. Victor Wang, the 31-year-old founder and chief executive, opens the door, and as he's walking in he tells me that they just stopped a suicide. Patients often say they want to die, he said, and the avatar is trained to then ask if they have an actual plan of how to do it, and that patient did.
The voice is whatever the latest Android text-to-speech reader is. Mr. Wang said people can form a bond very easily with anything that talks with them. "Between a semi-lifelike thing and a tetrahedron with eyeballs, there's no real difference in terms of building a relationship," he said.
Mr. Wang knows how attached patients become to the avatars, and he said he has stopped health groups that want to roll out large pilots without a clear plan, since it is very painful to take away the avatars once they are given. But he does not try to limit the emotional connection between patient and avatar.
"If they say, 'I love you,' we'll say it back," he said. "With some of our clients, we'll say it first if we know they like hearing it."
Early results have been positive. In Lowell's first small pilot, patients with avatars needed fewer nursing visits, went to the emergency room less often and felt less lonely. One patient who had frequently gone to the emergency room for social support largely stopped when her avatar arrived, saving the health care program an estimated $90,000.
Humana, one of the country's largest health insurers, has begun using Care.Coach avatars.
For a sense of where things could be headed, look to the town of Fremont, Calif. There, a tablet on a motorized stand recently rolled into a hospital room, and a doctor on a video feed told a patient, Ernest Quintana, 78, that he was dying.
Back in Lowell, Sox has fallen asleep, which means her eyes are closed and a command center somewhere around the world has tuned into other seniors and other conversations. Mr. Langlois's wife wants a digital pet, and his friends do too, but this Sox is his own. He strokes her head on the screen to wake her up.

Texto completo: When I first learned of Princeton University economics professor Alan Krueger’s tragic passing over the weekend, I thought about happiness.
Sure, most people would probably associate this intellectual giant and longtime public servant with his work on the minimum wage. In a paper looking at cross-state labor markets, he upturned decades of conventional wisdom that said raising the minimum wage would necessarily reduce employment. His finding that a higher wage floor could actually increase jobs for low-wage workers has become a staple of Econ 101 syllabuses.
Or perhaps people think of his work exploiting strokes of luck (season of birth, Vietnam draft numbers) to reveal how randomly assigned additional schooling could affect earnings. These and other pioneering papers — which inspired an entire generation of economists to look for similar “natural experiments” -- probably would have won him (and his co-authors) a Nobel Prize in the coming years.
Or maybe you’ve heard about the rock-star job he did as chair of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. Or the rock-star job he did studying, well, rock stars.
Or some of the other eclectic, off-the-beaten-path subjects that his omnivorous curiosity led him to, including: terrorism, the gig economy, Super Bowl tickets, offshoring, the digital divide or the relationship between income inequality and mobility (which he popularized as “the Great Gatsby Curve”).
But, for me, his happiness research was top of mind. The cause of his passing hadn’t yet been made public; in retrospect, maybe I wanted to think about this sunny stretch of research to keep from entertaining the dark possibility that his sudden death at 58 might be because of suicide, as his family would later confirm. Or maybe I was just thinking about it because it was the subject of one the last major assignments he gave me more than a decade ago, when I was his undergraduate research assistant.
Stories of Alan’s fundamental decency are legion, but let me personally attest: He was a terrific and unpretentious boss.
In fact, it was not until my junior year or so — when he invited me along to a TV interview — that I grasped what a big shot I was working for (and that perhaps I should stop showing up to his office in my ratty Snoopy-themed sweatpants). I cringe to recall, as a nobody 19-year-old, scribbling (likely unsolicited) suggestions in red pen across an op-ed he was drafting. But he was not the type to throw his weight around. I think he just laughed. He may have even used my suggestions.
In the years since, Alan served as a mentor, friend and generous advocate. In many ways, I owe my journalism career to him — not least because he suggested me when he heard the New York Times was expanding its economics coverage as the financial crisis erupted.
So why, all those years ago, was Alan studying happiness, a topic that usually falls under the fiefdom of psychology, not the dismal science?
I don’t know whether Alan felt he had a personal stake in the subject; right now, it’s hard not to wonder, though he never said anything to me indicating this was the case. Then, as now, the research looked mostly like the perfect microcosm of what made Alan’s scholarship so remarkable: That is, it was clever, resourceful, interdisciplinary, unorthodox and, most of all, public-spirited.
Working with a team of elite psychologists, Alan measured what conditions and activities make people happy (both in the moment and in retrospect). He was interested in why lottery winners, paraplegics or others who experience a sudden change in life circumstances often returned to their previous levels of contentment. And how much cultural norms affected self-reported levels of happiness. (Are the French actually more miserable than Americans?)
To some economists, investigating happiness probably seemed silly. But Alan saw it as a central mission of his discipline. The whole point of economics is to figure out how, in a world of scarce resources, we can make people’s lives better. And how is that possible without investigating and measuring their well-being — not their wages or the stuff they buy, but whether they are happy? Efficiency, gross domestic product, other “traditional” economic metrics -- these were at best intermediate goals, or imperfect proxies, for the overarching objective of human welfare. And Alan always had his eyes on this prize.
Alan found creative ways not only to study important problems but also to evangelize his findings. At one point, when academic-research-as-metaphor-for-the-human-condition looked like a trendy Broadway genre, Alan and I even discussed writing a play inspired by his happiness work.
The play never got off the ground, alas. But the plan was quintessential Alan: He was a scholar motivated to use every tool in his kit to leave the world a bit better than he found it. And for all the heartache those who loved him are now suffering, that’s what he did.

'Malta Exchange' would test a saint's patience

Texto completo: In Rome, the college of cardinals is gathering to mourn one pope and select his successor. An ambitious rogue cardinal arrives on the island of Malta seeking ancient documents from the secretive Knights of Malta that will pave his way to the papacy. These are just two strands of the convoluted plot of "The Malta Exchange" (Minotaur Books, 393 pp., ), the 14th novel by Steve Berry featuring Cotton Malone, a retired Justice Department operative turned seller of rare books.
Malone arrives in Lake Como, Italy, in pursuit of letters exchanged between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini that British intelligence fears will reveal some embarrassing dealmaking aimed at preventing Italy from joining forces with Germany in World War II.
Why is this so urgent in the 21st century? You got me. But Berry is a New York Times best-selling author, so to quote Pope Francis, "Who am I to judge?"
As Malone arrives at a villa to nab the letters, bullets zing by, bodies are strung up and, inexplicably, a bear rumbling through the villa attacks Malone. Soon, Malone is entwined in the case of Cardinal Gallo, the papal wannabe, and a murderous subsector of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic humanitarian group with its own agenda for the new pope. Gallo's estranged identical twin, Pollux, has been temporarily placed in charge of the Knights, seeking to thwart his brother's ambitions.
Author Berry has a passion for history and historical preservation, so look for long passages about the Catholic Church, Constantine, Mussolini and various other European conquerors. You'll find yourself wondering about several key plot points: Is any of this really true? For the most part, Berry confesses in an epilogue at the end, it isn't.
If you can make your way through a tortuous plot with dialogue that can be as wooden as a church pew, Berry makes some interesting points about religion and how powerful men created the tenets of faith (manufacturing the concepts of ideas of heaven, hell and the devil) to control the masses. But in the finale, good old Cotton shows he has a taste of his own for some righteous religious vengeance.

Boy's chess victory is ticket out of shelter

Texto completo: NEW YORK - In a homeless shelter in Manhattan, an 8-year-old boy is walking to his room, carrying an awkward load in his arms, unfazed by screams from a troubled resident. The boy is a Nigerian refugee with an uncertain future, but he is beaming.
He can't stop grinning because the awkward load is a huge trophy, almost as big as he is. This homeless third-grader has just won his category at the New York state chess championship.
Much of the news of the last week has focused on wealthy families buying access to great universities, either illegally through bribes or legally through donations. There is no question that America is a tilted playing field that gives wealthy children huge advantages.
So we should all grin along with Tanitoluwa Adewumi, the newly crowned chess champion for kindergarten through third grade. He went undefeated at the state tournament last weekend, outwitting children from elite private schools with private chess tutors.
What's even more extraordinary is that Tani, as he is known, learned chess only a bit more than a year ago. His play has skyrocketed month by month, and he now has seven trophies by his bed in the homeless shelter.
"I want to be the youngest grandmaster," he told me.
Tani's family fled northern Nigeria in 2017, fearing attacks by Boko Haram terrorists on Christians such as themselves. "I don't want to lose any loved ones," his father, Kayode Adewumi, told me.
So Tani, his parents and his older brother arrived in New York City a bit more than a year ago, and a pastor helped steer them to a homeless shelter. Tani began attending the local elementary school, P.S. 116, which has a part-time chess teacher who taught Tani's class how to play.
Tani enjoyed the game and prodded his mom, Oluwatoyin Adewumi, to ask if he could join the chess club.
"He is interested in the chess program, which he will like to be participating in," Oluwatoyin, who is working hard to master American English, emailed the club. She explained that she could not pay the fees for the program because the family was living in a shelter.
Russell Makofsky, who oversees the P.S. 116 chess program, waived the fees, and a year ago the boy took part in his first tournament with the lowest rating of any participant, 105.
His rating is now 1587 and rising fast. (By comparison, the world's best player, Magnus Carlsen, stands at 2845.)
Tani has an aggressive style of play, and in the state tournament the coaches, watching from the sidelines, were shocked when he sacrificed a bishop for a lowly pawn. Alarmed, they fed the move into a computer and it agreed with Tani, recognizing that the gambit would improve his position several moves later.
"It's an inspiring example of how life's challenges do not define a person," said Jane Hsu, the principal of P.S. 116, which held a pep rally to celebrate Tani's victory. Hsu noted that while Tani lacks a home, he has enormously supportive parents dedicated to seeing him succeed.
Tani's mom can't play chess, but takes him every Saturday to a three-hour free practice session in Harlem, and she attends his tournaments. His dad lets Tani use his laptop each evening to practice. And although religion is extremely important to the family, the parents let Tani miss church when necessary to attend a tournament.
"Tani is rich beyond measure," in the strength, love and support of his family, Makofsky told me.
Tani's dad has two jobs: He rents a car that he uses to drive for Uber, and he has also become a licensed real estate salesman. Tani's mom has passed a course to become a home health aide. Meeting them, it's easy to see where Tani's scrappy diligence came from.
It is sometimes tough for Tani. His parents say that he once came home from school crying after classmates teased him for being homeless. And at an immigration hearing last fall, he burst into tears when he misunderstood the judge to say that the family would be deported.
"I feel American," he explained. In fact, the family's asylum request is dragging on, with the next hearing scheduled for August.
Tani tries to put that out of his mind. He lies on the floor of the shelter and practices chess for hours each evening - now preparing for the elementary national championship in May.
"He is so driven," said his school chess teacher, Shawn Martinez. "He does 10 times more chess puzzles than the average kid. He just wants to be better."
Makofsky shook his head wonderingly. "One year to get to this level, to climb a mountain and be the best of the best, without family resources," he said. "I've never seen it."
Tani is a reminder that refugees enrich this nation - and that talent is universal, even if opportunity is not. Back in Nigeria, his parents say, his brilliance at chess would never have had an outlet.
"The U.S. is a dream country," his dad told me. "Thank God I live in the greatest city in the world, which is New York, New York."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Mueller investigation. Heard of it?
After a year and 10 months of suspense, special counsel Robert Mueller has completed his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. And, well it’s been a long time coming.
Thirty-four people have been indicted since Mueller opened his review in May 2017, including some of President Donald Trump's closest advisers and Russian intelligence operatives. Mueller’s investigation has already revealed many details about a sophisticated effort to influence the election and a campaign trying to benefit from that work.
But what his final report looks like remains a mystery.
Here’s your guide on what to expect from the Mueller report and what happens next now that Mueller is done:
What will be in the report?
Mueller’s confidential report will explain why he filed the charges he did during the investigation, and why he might have declined to bring charges against anyone else. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Friday it was "comprehensive," but declined to elaborate.
More: Special counsel Robert Mueller delivers report marking end of investigation into Trump's campaign, Russia
Sorry, but you probably won't see the report
After all the anticipation (and nail biting), you probably won’t get to see the Mueller report. At least for a bit.
Why? Justice Department rules require that Mueller submit a “confidential” report when his work is done. Now his boss, Attorney General William Barr, gets to decide what happens. (Barr is the guy who will decide what the public can see, and when). The only thing Barr is required to reveal is whether Mueller’s bosses ever overruled him, which he said Friday did not happen.
Trump has said he doesn't have a problem with the report becoming public.
More: Robert Mueller has spent two years investigating Trump, and he hasn't said a word. It's possible he never will.
Will we ever hear from Mueller himself?
Those who know him are betting on no.
Mueller isn’t required to make public statements about his work, according to Justice Department rules, so he doesn’t need to deliver a public record of his findings.
Plus, he’s stayed quiet since he was tapped in May 2017 to head the probe, despite intense public interest and scrutiny (including from the president).
Those who know Mueller say he's reluctant to speak publicly even when the circumstances seem to require it, so he's unlikely to do on his own at the end of this saga.
So, will Barr make the report public?
That's TBD.
Now that Barr has announced the probe is complete, he says he could alert lawmakers in the coming days to its findings. Those findings will likely be made public at the same time, according to a Justice Department spokeswoman.
More: Read Attorney General Barr's letter to Congress announcing end of Mueller's Russia probe
Barr said in a letter to Congress Friday afternoon that he was "reviewing the report, and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend. "
So, that means the public is likely to get some gist of what Mueller found in his lengthy investigation.
The claws are coming out
Congress wants to see Mueller’s findings and is preparing for a fight to see it.
Lawmakers from both parties — yes, both Republicans and Democrats — plan to press for access not just to the report but also to the evidence he gathered during the investigation. The demands would almost certainly set up a battle between Congress and the Justice Department.
More: What happens after Robert Mueller delivers his report? Congress braces for legal and political battles.
More: Rep. Adam Schiff: Democrats could sue if Robert Mueller's Russia report isn't made public
In particular, newly powerful House Democrats are exploring ways they could force the administration to turn over findings and evidence it might prefer to keep secret.
“We expect the full report," said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N. Y. , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "If we don’t get it, we’ll do what we have to do to get it. If that means subpoenaing it, we’ll subpoena it. "
Republicans have also embraced the idea of obtaining Mueller's conclusions. Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he expects a report that will reveal no wrongdoing by Trump. The House voted 420-0 in March to insist that they get a complete copy of whatever Mueller turns in.
Will that be the end?
No.
Mueller is just one of many potential legal problems for Trump and his inner circle. The list of investigations encircling the president seems to be growing by the day.
More: Michael Cohen's testimony prompts a new question: In web of Trump investigations, is anyone safe?
Both the targets and the total number of investigations is unknown, but we know various probes have examined Trump's campaign, family, charity foundation, inaugural committee and his businesses.
In New York:
The state attorney general subpoenaed two banks this week for financial records relating to several Trump Organization projects, the New York Times reported.
Federal prosecutors are still investigating campaign-finance violations within Trump's campaign even after his former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violations stemming from hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump. Cohen has said he made the payments at Trump’s direction.
Cohen said he’s been in “constant contact” with federal prosecutors in New York about other investigations, but wouldn’t elaborate.
Trump’s inaugural committee was subpoenaed in February as part of an investigation into the group’s fundraising activities.
State authorities in New York have been investigating Trump's private foundation.
In Washington and Maryland:
Attorneys general in Maryland and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging Trump violated the Constitution's Emolument's clause, which bans gifts and payments from foreign governments. The case could allow officials some insight into Trump's business dealings and potential conflicts of interests.
In Congress:
Lawmakers are just getting started. The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee opened a sweeping investigation this month into Trump and his associates, requesting documents from 81 "agencies, entities, and individuals" connected to the administration and Trump's private businesses.
The House Oversight Committee is also examining a wide array of topics, including Trump's communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin, White House efforts in a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia, whether Trump played any part in securing top-secret security clearances for members of his family and whether Trump violated the Constitution by accepting profits from foreign governments. The Committee welcomed Cohen earlier this month, then laid out an investigative road map that could include other Trump Organization employees.
The House Intelligence Committee is expanding its own investigation of Russian election interference.

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at her weekly news conference on Thursday, March 14th that she favors lowering the voting age to 16.
Teens should have a voice on federal elections
By David de la Fuente
In the 1960s, the country asked itself that if young men can die in Vietnam, then shouldn’t they be trusted with the right to vote? Similarly now, we must ask ourselves that if 16- and 17-year-olds can contribute to society through work, and face the criminal justice system as adults, isn't it only reasonable to allow them the right of self-determination through voting?
In these teen years, many individuals begin to work and pay taxes. This is also when we grant the right to drive a car. On the flip side, about 250,000 youth are tried, sentenced or incarcerated as adults every year across the USA. When they're contributing to society or being held liable by society in these ways, they should also be able to weigh in on the future of our country and those responsible for the laws that affect them.

That's why it was great to see freshman Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo. , lead an effort that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to preregister to vote ahead of their 18th birthday. This policy has already worked in many states: 14 states (and Washington, D. C. ) already allow teenagers to preregister to vote at 16, and nine allow it for 17-year-olds.
In California alone, since 2016, more than 200,000 teenagers preregistered before their 18th birthdays.
Congress only has the authority to lower the voting age for federal elections. That's what sparked the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age in every election to 18.
Freshmen Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. , proposed lowering the voting age from 18 to 16 for federal elections. The proposal failed with only 126 votes but represented a turning point in the fight for enfranchisement. It had the support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has championed such efforts at the local level in California for years.
Because voter turnout is habitual, it seems like a no-brainer to let people start voting at a younger age. If 16- and 17-year-olds can go to the polls with their parents or other adult figures, it could begin a lifetime of such civic engagement.
Lowering the voting age is a worthy endeavor. Let's do it.

What others are saying
Jeff Jacoby, The Boston Globe: "Teens more often rely on the amygdala, the more emotional, primitive part of the brain. It isn’t from gratuitous animus that car-rental agencies make it difficult for young drivers to rent a vehicle. Or that the Constitution establishes 25 as the minimum age to be a member of Congress. Of course, another reason that 16-year-olds are subject to so many restrictions that don’t apply to grown-ups is that they don’t know anything — or in any case, they don’t know enough to be trusted to make sound decisions about liquor, firearms, joining the Marines and governing the United States. The ignorance of teens is practically a cliché. "
Laurence Steinberg, The New York Times: "Cold cognitive abilities are those we use when we are in a calm situation, when we are by ourselves and have time to deliberate and when the most important skill is the ability to reason logically with facts. Voting is a good example of this sort of situation. Studies of cold cognition have shown that the skills necessary to make informed decisions are firmly in place by 16. By that age, adolescents can gather and process information, weigh pros and cons, reason logically with facts and take time before making a decision. Teenagers may sometimes make bad choices, but statistically speaking, they do not make them any more often than adults do. "
Noah Berlatsky, CNN. com: "In (America) people start voting at 18. That's the year that they often move off to college. They either have to cast ballots in a community with which they're unfamiliar, or pay attention to elections in a place where they no longer reside. That's a recipe for indifference. It would be much easier to encourage people to vote for the first time, and to establish voting patterns for a lifetime, when they're 16 and in high school. . . . One objection is that young people will just vote like their parents. But researchers have found that people are always influenced by those close to them. People of all ages vote like their parents, or like their spouses, or like their neighbors. "
What readers are saying
Since 2016, (some) Democrats have endorsed ending the Electoral College, lowering the voting age to 16 and giving undocumented immigrants the ability to vote. Why? Because they know they can't beat President Donald Trump in 2020 under the current rules.
— @TimRunsHisMouth
Disagree that Democrats are (trying to lower the voting age) to address the 2020 election alone. It's a reaction to GOP gerrymandering. I am for two things: 1. Automatic registration and 2. Voting on Election Day.
— @gmadison1787
Most 16-year-olds don’t even have a solid view of what they want to do with their future. Why would you lower the voting age for them to choose someone to run the entire country, when they don't even know what to have for breakfast?
— @joceyk13
This is what concerns me about lowering the voting age to 16. In our culture, as teenagers we do not have the needed life skills to make informed decisions that not only affect ourselves but millions of others.

Reticence in Senate After a Bitter Attack On One of Their Own

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Many Senate Republicans are as perplexed as they are perturbed about President Trump's sustained attack on their colleague, John McCain. But few want to shout about it.
Baffled as they may be over why Mr. Trump continues to vilify a man who devoted his life to his nation and suffered as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, that doesn't mean that all of his former colleagues want to get caught in a feud between a president popular with Republican voters and a memory. Most have not publicly commented on Mr. Trump's continuing character and policy assault on a man whom many served with for years.
Attempts to reach multiple senior senators for their views and reactions were unsuccessful. They are scattered around the world and the United States on their weeklong break, but senators can find a way to make themselves heard if they believe the subject is important enough.
There were some exceptions.
"I just don't understand why the president keeps returning to his dislike of John McCain and criticizing him, particularly now that he is no longer alive," Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a longtime friend and ally of Mr. McCain, said in an interview. "The president should refrain from any further criticism of John McCain, an American hero who served his country well."
A handful of other Republicans have spoken out, emphasizing their high regard and their deep respect for Mr. McCain, who died last year. Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican and veteran from Iowa, and Senator Johnny Isakson, a normally reserved Republican of Georgia, are among a few who have directly criticized the president's actions. Mr. Isakson called the comments "deplorable," and urged him to stop.
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who had his own giant clashes with Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, over campaign finance laws, praised his former colleague on Twitter as "a rare patriot and genuine American hero in the Senate." But he did not directly address Mr. Trump's comments.
Others Republicans, such as Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, have taken a similar approach in praising Mr. McCain -- but avoiding Mr. Trump. Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who attended Wednesday's rally in Lima, Ohio, where the president went on an extended tirade against Mr. McCain, expressed some frustration at being pressed on the subject, according to a report in The Columbus Dispatch.
"John McCain was a war hero. I've told you that before," he said. "That's how I feel." Representative Bob Latta, Republican of Ohio, who was there as well, told the paper he did not want to discuss the remarks.
The awkward silence was not lost on Democrats.
"What has happened to my colleagues in the Republican Party?" asked Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. "I am genuinely struggling to grasp what Trump could possibly think was the upside of continuing to trash a genuine American hero regardless of what he thought of his last year's voting record."
"I am grateful for a few friends like Senator Isakson, who stood forward and said clearly what everyone is thinking but not enough senators are saying," Mr. Coons said.
Mr. Coons was correct about what everyone is thinking on Capitol Hill. Despite the lack of a robust Republican defense on behalf of Mr. McCain, party strategists and top congressional officials said privately that they and many senators believe the president's persistent onslaught against the senator was, by various accounts, ugly, bizarre, disgusting, disturbing, counterproductive and just plain weird.
Not only did it call attention to Mr. Trump's own failure to serve in Vietnam despite his being of prime draft age at the time, it rankled veterans who tend to rally around their own and detracted from the economic and national security message Mr. Trump was trying to present.
Former Senator Bob Kerrey, a Democrat who lost a leg in Vietnam, appeared on CNN to challenge Mr. Trump to show Americans the bone spurs in his foot that kept him out of the war. (The New York Times last year located the daughters of a podiatrist from Queens, Dr. Larry Braunstein, who said their father, who died in 2007, often told the story of coming to the aid of a young Mr. Trump during the Vietnam War as a favor to Fred C. Trump, his landlord and the president's father.)
Mr. Trump's attacks continued on Thursday. When Maria Bartiromo, a Fox Business Network anchor, asked about Mr. McCain in an interview, the president insisted the news media had brought up the issue first -- when in fact he had begun his tirade in Ohio unbidden and on television.
"When I went out yesterday to the scrum, they asked me the question," he said falsely, before again hitting the senator for voting against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. "When they ask me the question, I answer the question. But you people bring it up, I don't bring it up. I'm not a fan. He was horrible -- what he did with repeal and replace. What he did to the Republican Party and to the nation, and to sick people that could have had great health care, was not good. So I'm not a fan of John McCain and that's fine."
There are multiple potential reasons Republican senators were steering clear of the dispute between the president and a man interred with military honors at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. First, it is a fact that Mr. McCain had a temper and could be difficult to deal with -- and not all senators, despite their appreciation and respect for his service, have such fond recollections.
Plus, a dozen Republican senators last week broke with Mr. Trump on his declaration of an emergency to redirect federal dollars to his wall along the southwestern border, prompting some backlash at home and giving Republican lawmakers pause about the prospect of challenging the president.
In most Republican-dominated states, the president remains far more popular with Republican voters than the senators who represent them. Mr. McCain was no favorite of the more conservative voters who now dominate in party strongholds, one of the reasons Mr. Trump's initial campaign attack on the party's 2008 nominee -- "I like people who weren't captured" -- did little damage with the base.
At the same time, aides reported that senators traveling their states were not being pressed on Mr. Trump's attack on Mr. McCain by either the public or local news media.
No one can be sure what is driving Mr. Trump, but there are multiple potential explanations. Mr. Trump himself highlighted the fact that Mr. McCain had personally presented to the F.B.I. the unconfirmed private intelligence report, the so-called dossier, suggesting ties between Mr. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government, as well as other misconduct.
"He turned it over to the F.B.I., hoping to put me in jeopardy," Mr. Trump told the crowd in Ohio. "And that's not the nicest thing to do."
With his decisive vote against repeal of the health care law, Mr. McCain, through his famous thumbs-down gesture, denied the president the chance to achieve one of his central campaign promises. Mr. Trump also skewered Mr. McCain for his support of armed intervention in the Middle East. Perhaps most astoundingly, the president dinged Mr. McCain and his family for not thanking him for his cooperation in staging a funeral to which he was not invited -- and which he had no role in.
The Washington National Cathedral, where a memorial service for Mr. McCain was held, released a statement on Thursday, saying: "Only a state funeral for a former president involves consultation with government officials. No funeral at the cathedral requires the approval of the president or any other government official."
No matter to Mr. Trump.
"That's O.K.," he said. "We sent him on his way."
Mr. McCain is indeed gone, no longer roaming the Capitol hallways where he capably defended himself. Were he here, he would no doubt relish the extent to which he has somehow gotten into Mr. Trump's head even in death, not to mention the bind in which he has put politically cautious colleagues forced to pick between him and the president.

Texto completo: In psychology circles, there's an unofficial concept called "the Martha Mitchell effect." It's the tendency to diagnose someone as mentally ill simply because the story they tell is so bizarre, without checking whether the bizarre story is in fact true.
That's what happened to Martha Mitchell, the outspoken wife of President Richard M. Nixon's attorney general John Mitchell. She was dismissed as "crazy" for her wild claims about the Nixon administration and issued a public ultimatum to her husband to choose her or the president.
This week, another marital spat gripped Washington as President Trump tweeted insults about George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, calling him a "total loser" and "husband from hell." Kellyanne Conway said Thursday that she has no intention of resigning. Unlike Martha Mitchell, George Conway isn't being accused of being mentally ill. In fact, he has lately been tweeting that Trump is the one with mental illness.
Martha Mitchell arrived on the Washington social scene in 1969 as her husband became Nixon's attorney general and right-hand man. For years, the witty Southerner was the toast of the town and television, often calling reporters and appearing on evening talk shows to joke about antiwar protesters and Supreme Court justices she didn't like, earning her the nickname "the Mouth of the South." She even did a guest spot on the comedy variety show "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In," capitalizing on her reputation has a charming gossip:
Lily Tomlin (as nosy phone operator Ernestine): "Tell me, Mrs. Mitchell, do you have any time left over for hobbies?"
Mitchell: "Yes. I like to read the funny papers."
Tomlin: "The funny papers - which ones are your favorites?"
Mitchell: "The New York Times and The Washington Post."
For some, her commentary could go too far. In the Slate podcast "Slow Burn," Leon Neyfakh describes Nixon at one point telling his chief of staff, "We need to turn off Martha."
In the spring of 1972, John Mitchell resigned as attorney general to become Nixon's campaign manager for his reelection. And in June, Martha Mitchell joined her husband in California for several campaign events. It was there, on the night of June 17, that John Mitchell got a call about some arrests at the Watergate Hotel.
According to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, John Mitchell realized that if his wife found out that she knew one of the men arrested, James McCord, she might become upset and tell reporters about it, thus tipping them off to the connection between the burglars and the president. So as he headed back to Washington, he instructed security guards working for the campaign to keep his wife in the dark in California - and to stop her from calling members of the media.
But find out she did, and just as her husband predicted, she soon called UPI's Helen Thomas. "I'm sick and tired of the whole operation," she said, before telling Thomas she was giving her husband an "ultimatum" - her or Nixon.
"The conversation ended abruptly when it appeared that somebody had taken the phone from her hand," Thomas reported. "She was heard to say, 'You just get away.' "
Martha Mitchell later said one of the guards discovered her and ripped the phone from the wall. She was kept in the hotel room for days, she said, where the guard held her down as a doctor injected her with sedatives, her young daughter watching the whole time.
"I'm black and blue," she told Thomas days later. "I'm a political prisoner."
(As former Post reporter Jeff Stein notes in Newsweek, the man she accused of roughing her up and "kidnapping" her, Stephen King, is now Trump's ambassador to the Czech Republic.)
"Historians disagree on what exactly Martha Mitchell really knew about Watergate," Neyfakh said. But she intimated to reporters that her public ultimatum to her husband was meant to extricate him from "all those dirty things that go on."
The Nixon camp fought back, spreading rumors that she was an alcoholic and mentally ill.
A week and a lot of phone calls to Thomas later, Martha Mitchell seemed to get what she wanted. John Mitchell tendered his resignation to Nixon, writing, "I have found that I can no longer [carry out the job] and still meet the one obligation which must come first: the happiness and welfare of my wife and daughter."
Martha Mitchell's celebration - "I'm going to have a ball in New York!" she told the New York Times - didn't last. The next year, as her husband remained loyal to Nixon in his Senate testimony, "he walked out and left me with $945," she told The Post. They separated, and about the time of his 1975 criminal trial, she sued him for back alimony.
Martha Mitchell died of cancer in 1976, at age 57. Her attorney told UPI that she had been "desperately ill, without friends and without funds." She was buried in her hometown of Pine Bluff, Ark.
John Mitchell was found guilty of conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Watergate break-in and spent 19 months in prison.
In 1977, Nixon threw Martha Mitchell under the bus one last time, telling journalist David Frost that her alleged mental-health troubles in the spring of 1972 distracted John Mitchell from "minding that store," thus allowing the Watergate crisis to happen.
"If it hadn't been for Martha, there'd have been no Watergate," he said.

Texto completo: JUPITER, - New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft reportedly will reject a plea deal that requires an admission of guilt in his day-spa prostitution case, reports say.
The 77-year-old billionaire owner of the championship football team is accused of paying for sex acts at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter.
Police say they have video evidence showing Kraft visiting the spa two days in a row, on Jan. 19 and 20, the same weekend the Patriots played the Kansas City Chiefs for the AFC Championship.
Kraft insists he isn't guilty of any crime and claims the case being prosecuted by the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office is shaky.
Another prime concern, reports say, is the NFL might come down on Kraft if he admits guilt.
"We categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity," a spokesman for Kraft told CNN.
Among the lawyers representing Kraft is veteran West Palm Beach defense attorney Jack Goldberger. A call and email to his office were not returned Wednesday.
Kraft and 24 other men were charged in the spa-sex crackdown.
All have been offered plea deals, standard for first time offenders, that would drop the misdemeanor solicitation charges if they publicly admitted that they would have been found guilty if they went to trial.
The admission of guilt, according to media reports, is the sticking point for Kraft, who has pleaded not guilty to two charges.
Such an admission, Boston.com reported, would trigger some form of discipline from the NFL under the league's personal conduct policy.
Negotiations are still underway, according to ESPN.
Kraft would rather fight the charges, ESPN said, than admit to a crime.
Miami-based criminal defense attorney Joel Hirschhorn is not involved in Kraft's case. But if he was, he said he would advise Kraft to take the deal and walk away.
"It's clearly in his best interest to own up to this and move on with his life. The notion of going to trial from a legal perspective is foolish," Hirschhorn said. "They have apparently video surveillance, they might even encourage one of the employees to become a witness ... to testify ... He doesn't need this. His trial will be televised; it's not in his best personal interest."
Another reason for taking the deal? Hirschhhorn said he would expect Kraft to face repercussions with the NFL either way - not to mention embarrassment.
"He is going to face some sort of sanction," Hirschhorn said.
The plea bargain also would require 100 hours of community service, an education course about the dangers of prostitution and sex trafficking and a fine of $5,000 for each count charged.
Attorney Larry S. Davis, of Hollywood, said the "issue is the NFL" and how it would take to Kraft resolving the case by admitting guilt.
"Paying a fine or doing community service wouldn't seem a big deal - then it gets dismissed and then you can expunge your record. For a normal person it wouldn't be a big deal; for a person like Kraft it has other ramifications," Davis said.
"It puts him in a different league than anybody else busted for going to a quote unquote massage parlor. I would want to know what the effect [of the plea deal] would have on his standing with the league."
The newest addition to Kraft's legal team, court records show, is Washington D.C.-based William Anthony Burck.
Burck was a lawyer in the George W. Bush White House and had a role in the screening of documents related to Judge Brett Kavanaugh's recent Supreme Court nomination, according to the New York Times.
Kraft's legal team, ESPN said, has filed a motion to suppress the video evidence, described as graphic and damning.
Kraft's motion asks that the video be kept from release if he rejects the plea deal, ESPN reported.
The Jupiter spa Kraft is accused of visiting for illicit services had been under police surveillance since late last year over allegations of human trafficking and prostitution.
There is no evidence that the women Kraft allegedly paid for sex were trafficking victims, according to ESPN.
One was 39 and the other was 58. Each had valid driver licenses and were licensed massage therapists in Florida, ESPN said.
Kraft's arraignment hearing is scheduled for Thursday, March 28 in Palm Beach County Circuit Court. He is not expected to attend.

Texto completo: El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador se reunió el martes en la noche con Jared Kushner , asesor y yerno del presidente Donald Trump , en casa de un “amigo en común”, reveló el propio mandatario mexicano en su conferencia mañanera.
Aunque el morenista no dijo el nombre del amigo se confirmó que el encuentro fue en la residencia de uno de los vicepresidentes de Televisa, Bernando Gómez , donde se desarrolló una cena a la que acudieron el secretario de Relaciones Exteriores, Marcelo Ebrard , y el encargado de negocios de la Embajada de Estados Unidos en México, John Creamer.
“ Estuvimos cenando hasta las 10 u 11 de la noche (…) básicamente abordamos lo de la cooperación para el desarrollo, el que podamos firmar un acuerdo bilateral para garantizar inversiones en Centroamérica y en el país del orden de $10,000 millones de dólares” , presumió el mandatario, quien no explicó porqué se organizó un evento oficial en una residencia privada, pero destacó la inversión. “Para que haya empleos, que haya trabajo y que la migración sea opcional, no forzada por la falta de oportunidades o la violencia”.
Genaro Villamil , director del Sistema de Radiodifusión del Estado Mexicano reconfirmó en Twitter que el encuentro fue en la residencia de Gómez, quien no es la primera vez que destaca en el escenario político de ese país, ya que durante el Gobierno de Enrique Peña Nieto fue el enlace con la empresa de Emilio Azcárraga Jean .
El gobierno sabrá estar a la altura de las circunstancias. Conferencia de prensa en vivo. https://t.co/IYfyc8rI21
— Andrés Manuel (@lopezobrador_) March 20, 2019
El periodista Diego Osorno describió en su libro Slim (Debate, 2015) cómo se tejen las redes de poder en Televisa, donde Azcárraga Jean compartió la dirección de la empresa con tres amigos cercanos: Gómez, Alfonso de Angoitia y José Bastón , esposo de Eva Longoria .
Así lo reveló también Andrew Paxman , autor del libro El Tigre –sobre la vida del padre de Azcárraga Jean–, al periodista Wilbert Torre.
“Emilio Azcárraga Jean ha delegado hace años las relaciones políticas a Bernardo Gómez y las financieras a De Angoitia” , señaló en un artículo publicado en la versión en español del New York Times. “Desde la muerte de (Emilio) Azcárraga Milmo comenzó este liderazgo más colegial y compartido”.
La estrategia de repite, como lo revela el presidente López Obrador, al referirse a Gómez como “su amigo”, olvidando las diferencias que tuvo con la televisora.
“Ahora (Televisa) tiene aún más poder para seguir con los mismos esquemas de ofrecer una cobertura favorable a cambio de favores políticos, sin importar el partido”, indicó Paxman.
Sabido es q, en política, forma es fondo: forma y fondo pésimos de @lopezobrador_ al ir a la casa de Bernardo Gómez, vicepresidente de @Televisa , a hablar de asuntos de máximo interés nacional con @jaredkushner , el yerno de #Trump q antes "manejaba" a MX a través de @LVidegaray pic.twitter.com/QnCwzdgSB7

El perfil de Bloomberg sobre Gómez destaca que su nombre está ligado con al menos 64 miembros de cinco organizaciones en cinco tipos de industrias distintas.
Se desempeñó como Vicepresidente Ejecutivo de Grupo Televisa, S.A.B. desde julio de 1997 y actualmente comparte la dirección de la empresa.
Gómez también se desempeñó como presidente de la Cámara de Televisión y Radiodifusores de México de 2001 a 2002, además de tener de una posición directiva en Univision desde marzo de 2017.
También es director de Grupo Axo, una empresa que se dedica a la distribución de productos de moda de alta costura con oficinas en México y Chile y más de 5,000 empleados.
Durante sus campañas en 2006, 2012 y 2018, el ahora presidente López Obrador criticó en varias ocasiones la relación entre empresarios y el poder político, por lo que ha sorprendido sus decisiones ligadas a empresarios, incluyendo su apoyo a Yasmín Esquivel Mossa como jueza de la Suprema Corte de Justicia, a pesar de un conflicto de intereses al ser esposa del empresario José María Riobóo , el principal contratista del presidente mexicano.
El encuentro con Kushner afianza la relación del Gobierno mexicano con el del presidente Trump y da continuidad a un primer encuentro liderado por el secretario de Estado, Mike Pompeo en julio de 2018 –a pocos días de la elección– al que acudieron la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen ; el secretario del Tesoro, Steven Mnuchin , y el esposo de Ivanka Trump .

Losers seeking Democratic nomination for president

Texto completo: Look at the losers running, or considering a run, for the Democratic presidential nomination.
I don't mean that pejoratively. I mean it literally.
Beto O'Rourke's presidential candidacy is the ultimate expression of the participation trophy culture on the left. It used to be you had to win on the state level before taking the national stage. Barack Obama won a Senate seat from Illinois before immediately declaring his intention to run for president.
At the time, that was considered pretty audacious. He hadn't accomplished anything in the Senate before he decided on a presidential run.
But at least he won. O'Rourke lost his race to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., last year. He got a participation trophy. Apparently, he thinks that qualifies him to be the leader of the free world.
Well, he must have some accomplishments other than almost winning a Senate seat, right? Not really. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was flummoxed when asked what O'Rourke had accomplished in Congress, saying he "brought a great deal of vitality" to his work "preserving our planet and protecting our people." (In fact, O'Rourke passed a single bill, H.R. 5873, which renamed a courthouse in his hometown of El Paso.) Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa was questioned by Ed Henry on Fox News, "What would you say is Beto O'Rourke's top accomplishment that he brings to the table?" Hinojosa could not name a single one.
"I'm not even talking about Congress," Henry said. "What has he done in his life?" "Your question is meaningless," Hinojosa replied.
So, if O'Rourke hasn't accomplished anything, he must at least have some clear ideas of what he wants to accomplish in the Oval Office, right?
Nope. The Post reports that "unlike candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who launched their campaigns with clearly articulated policy platforms, O'Rourke focuses more on sweeping calls for unity and pitching himself as the best antidote to the country's toxic politics."
The motivation for his run, apparently, is him. As Vanity Fair's Joe Hagan explains in a recent profile, O'Rourke "can't deny the pull of his own gifts." He tells a reporter, "Man, I'm just born to be in it."
He's not the only statewide loser taking the national stage.
Stacey Abrams lost the governor's race in Georgia in 2018, yet national Democrats tapped her to deliver the official rebuttal to the State of the Union – a task normally given to those who actually won their races. And now, The Post reports, she is considering a race for president as well.
"I think that I am a skilled communicator," she said. "I think I'm a very good thinker. No, I know I'm a good thinker. I know I have policy chops. I have foreign policy experience."
Foreign policy experience? She served as minority leader of the state House of Representatives. Her official bio lists her as "former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations" (a temporary membership for young people) as well as "a Council on Italy Fellow, a British-American Project Fellow, a Salzburg Seminar-Freeman Fellow on U.S.-East Asian Relations, a Salzburg Seminar Fellow on youth and civic engagement and a Yukos Fellow for U.S.-Russian Relations." That might qualify her for an entry-level job at a left-wing think tank, but it hardly qualifies her to be commander in chief. Even O'Rourke can claim experience on the House Armed Services Committee.
Democrats point out that President Trump had never won statewide office before running for president.
That's true. But he also had not run for state office and lost. He ran as a successful outsider, not as a failed insider. And unlike O'Rourke, he had actual accomplishments – including a multibillion-dollar real estate empire.
This is not to dismiss O'Rourke's chances.
He raised a whopping $6.1 million in his first 24 hours as a candidate, just edging out Sanders's first day haul of almost $6 million. That is the best of any Democrat running for president so far. As the New York Times noted, "In a single day online, he raised nearly a quarter of what Barack Obama, then a senator, did in the entire first quarter of 2007."
Apparently, Democrats like losers.
We'll soon see if one can win the presidency.

Texto completo: COPENHAGEN -- Describing his work as an undercover agent among a group of heavily armed Qaeda terrorists, Morten Storm said his job as a jihadist-turned-informant was dangerous and grueling.
Spy agencies never acknowledged his secret service. But now a Danish state agency, in a breakthrough ruling for Mr. Storm, has awarded him about $27,000 in damages for loss of work ability because of post-traumatic stress disorder, which he said in his claim was a result of his undercover role for the Danish and other intelligence agencies.
Labour Market Insurance, a state body, concluded that he had experienced "exceptionally dangerous events" during his tenure, the newspaper Jyllands-Posten reported on Monday. A future review will decide to what extent he may still be able to work, and could award additional compensation.
The payout is, in effect, the first formal recognition by the government of his undercover work; it has never been acknowledged by the Danish Security and Intelligence Service, PET, or by other Western intelligence agencies, which generally refuse to comment on secret sources.
Hans Jorgen Bonnichsen, a former chief of operations of the Danish intelligence service, said he was stunned when he heard of the decision to compensate Mr. Storm. Agencies that conduct their work in secret are put in a tough spot when former operatives talk publicly about their work, Mr. Bonnichsen said, but the intelligence service usually maintained its silence "until hell freezes over" to protect its current employees.
Mr. Storm's lawyer said the compensation case was "a little peculiar," though he said the size of the initial award was fairly standard. Mr. Storm had no pay slip or contract to show for his work, and PET refused to submit any corroboration.
"In regular work-damage cases both the injured and the employer offer information, but PET chose to be completely silent," said the lawyer, Brian Bruun Hansen.
In an email message, a PET press officer said the agency "generally does not confirm or deny whether a person is working or has worked as a source."
Instead of documents proving his relationship with state intelligence agents, Mr. Storm submitted voice recordings and proof of Western Union money transfers that included the names of PET operatives. His past claims about his undercover work have been taken seriously by the international news media and by Atlantic Monthly Press, which published his 2014 memoir, "Agent Storm: My Life Inside Al Qaeda and the C.I.A." A New York Times review called his account "highly credible."
Before he joined with militant Islamists, Mr. Storm, now 43, was an armed robber and, at 21, a prospective member of a criminal biker gang. In 1997, in his early 20s, he converted to Islam and moved first to Britain, and then to Yemen to learn Arabic. There, he befriended senior members of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
In 2006, according to his account, he lost faith in jihadism and turned on his terrorist comrades to become an informer for the Danish intelligence service, as well as for agencies in Britain and the United States.
Mr. Storm claims that information he provided helped lead to the drone killing of the American cleric and Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011 and also to the arrest that year of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali aiding Al Shabab, a terrorist group in Somalia, and Al Qaeda in Yemen. His claims have never been publicly confirmed by the C.I.A.
In 2012, Mr. Storm broke with PET and started speaking to the news media.
He said he had worked directly with American and Danish agents and received monthly payments, but never rewards or help to restart his life -- a source of great resentment to him.
Mr. Storm is apparently now hiding in a village in Denmark, saying he is fearful of his former comrades in the jihadist network who have threatened him online. In 2018, four people were convicted of threatening him on a Danish beach during a trip with his three children.
It was the strains of a dangerous double life, Mr. Storm said, that led to his PTSD. Today, he says, simple grocery shopping in the Danish countryside causes him fear.
"At night, I scream and kick," he said in a telephone interview. "Just talking about it now makes me uneasy."

Texto completo: President Trump on Tuesday ratcheted up a remarkable public spat with the husband of one of his top advisers, attacking Kellyanne Conway's husband as "a total loser" on Twitter in response to the lawyer's persistent questions about his mental health and competence.
"A total loser!" Trump wrote in the tweet targeting Conway's husband, a prominent conservative attorney. The president's tweet also included a dubious assertion from Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, that the president "doesn't even know" his senior adviser's husband.
But George Conway said in an interview Tuesday that he has had a number of notable interactions with Trump over the past decade, often concerning legal representation and sensitive legal matters since Trump became president. He described the president as "mendacious" and "incompetent" and predicted he would not win reelection.
Conway also suggested his own tweets questioning the president's mental health were aimed in part at avoiding conflicts with his wife.
"It's so maddening to watch," said Conway, a longtime Washington attorney who is well-known in conservative circles. "The mendacity, the incompetence, it's just maddening to watch. The tweeting is just the way to get it out of the way, so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day. That's basically it. Frankly, it's so I don't end up screaming at her about it."
Conway has been a persistent critic of Trump's policies and actions, frequently going on Twitter to question whether the president is operating within the Constitution and other accepted boundaries. But the criticism recently has become more personal, and he has often attacked Trump just after his wife defends the president on television.
Conway's tweets Monday included images from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, including pages with diagnostic criteria for "narcissistic personality disorder" and "antisocial personality disorder."
Although Conway had previously posted similar concerns on Twitter, "it stuck this time because of the utter bizarreness this weekend, his own conduct. It was so illustrative," he said, referring to a two-day span in which Trump sent out 52 tweets with a broad variety of attacks.
Kellyanne Conway did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but she said on Monday that she did not share her husband's concerns about Trump. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump has wanted to attack George Conway on Twitter before but has been talked out of it by aides, who argued it would embolden Conway and cause unnecessary drama, according to several current and former White House aides.
The president's change of approach was apparently prompted by a tweet sent Monday night by Parscale, who wrote about Conway: "We all know that @realDonaldTrump turned down Mr. Kellyanne Conway for a job he desperately wanted. He barely worked @TheJusticeDept and was either fired/quit, didn't want the scrutiny?"
George Conway said that contrary to Parscale's tweet, he opted against working at the Justice Department after Trump offered him a position heading the civil division because he watched Trump attack the department's leaders and then fire James B. Comey, the FBI director, in early 2017. Conway said he remembered riding down the West Side Highway in Manhattan and hearing on the radio that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had been appointed to lead an investigation of possible connections between Russian election interference and the Trump campaign.
"I'm thinking to myself, this guy is going to be at war with the Justice Department for the next two years," Conway said. "I'm not doing this."
In a conversation with Trump at the wedding of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in June 2017, Conway said, Trump approached him and complimented him for not taking a job under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
"He said to me, I remember it clearly, you were smart not to work for that guy," Conway said. "He is so weak."
Trump then complained for several minutes that Sessions should have never recused himself from the Mueller investigation, Conway said. "I told him, I'd heard the recusal issue was pretty clear, that Sessions had to recuse himself," Conway said. "He took great affront at that."
George Conway outlined a number of interactions with Trump that date back more than a decade and said his wife had known him for that long.
Shortly after they were married in 2001, Kellyanne and George Conway moved into an apartment in Manhattan's Trump World Tower. A few years later, George Conway made an impression on the future president at a condominium board meeting where he argued against removing Trump's name from the building. The speech earned him an offer to join the condo board, which he declined but passed on to his wife, who accepted.
In a 2006 letter shared with The Washington Post, Trump praised Conway for helping him keep control of the building.
"What I was most impressed with was how quickly you were able to comprehend a very bad situation," Trump wrote, praising Conway for "ridding Trump World Tower of some very bad people." In a postscript, Trump said Conway had "a truly great voice, certainly not a bad asset for a top trial lawyer!"
Conway said Trump also called him to thank him, and he told the president he was glad his name stayed on the building.
The two later met at a fundraiser in Alpine, N.J., where the Conway family owns a home, he said. After Trump won the election in 2016, Conway said that he flew with Trump to Washington for an inaugural dinner with his wife as they moved their belongings, which were on the plane.
During that flight, Trump quizzed Conway about whether he should fire Preet S. Bharara, then the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Conway said. "I said in general, it's better to have your people in terms of important positions than others," Conway said. He said the president did not appear motivated by anything other than political machinations. Trump eventually fired Bharara in the spring of 2017.
During the transition, Conway said he also rode in a black SUV with Trump, his wife and Stephen K. Bannon to a costume party at the home of GOP megadonor Rebekah Mercer. Trump had heard about the party and wanted to attend. During the car ride, Conway said the president was fixated on John Bolton's prominent mustache - and that it was a reason not to pick him as secretary of state. Since then, Trump picked Bolton as his national security adviser.
"He didn't like the mustache," Conway said. "He just went on and on about the mustache."
Conway later said he was surprised to get a call from Trump around the time he took office, when Trump was seeking legal advice about a lawsuit alleging that he was benefiting financially from the presidency in violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution. The call, Conway said, was arranged by his wife. "He wanted to know what I thought about the judge and what I thought about the case," Conway said.
In spring 2017, Conway said his wife arranged a call with himself, the president, Vice President Pence and senior adviser Jared Kushner to evaluate lawyers for the Mueller investigation. A speakerphone was used, Conway said.
"He wanted to know my opinions on a variety of lawyers who were being considered to be his outside counsel. He asked me for my opinions on each of them," Conway said, adding that there were "all these people in the room making it a nonprivileged conversation."
Some in the White House say Conway is selfish for posting so many tweets, making it difficult for his wife to work there and attacking her boss. "Now he hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success," Parscale said at the end of his tweet Monday night.
Kellyanne Conway went on a lengthy rant about her husband to several guests at a British Embassy party for members of Congress last month, including New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, NBC anchor Andrea Mitchell and former Post journalist Sally Quinn, according to two attendees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.
Conway told the group that she and the president think her husband is jealous of her, and that the president has kept her at a prominent place in the administration because he trusts her and wants to "protect her," the attendees said.
George Conway declined to comment on the state of his marriage - answering only that he wished his wife did not work for the White House.
He shrugged off Trump calling him "a total loser" on Twitter.
"I thought it was a perfect example of the point I was making," Conway said. "He can't concern himself with affairs of state. He's more concerned about what people say about him and waging little battles with everyone and everything."

Texto completo: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - The Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, echoed with the wailing of the bereaved Sunday morning. Mourners dressed in black had streamed into the vast churchyard, waving pictures of loved ones who died in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 a week earlier.
But the mourners did not have bodies to bury.
Many families do not expect to ever recover remains. The victims died in a fiery explosion when the plane hurtled to the ground minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 people - crew and passengers - aboard. In lieu of remains, witnesses have said, officials gave relatives scorched earth from the crash site.
On Sunday, empty coffins made their way into the churchyard on black vans while women beat their chests and screamed in anguish.
"They fell from the sky," one woman lamented of the crash victims when the vans inched by, trailed by somber airline employees in green uniforms. "Where will I go with my questions?"
An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the crash of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet near Addis Ababa last weekend. Over the weekend, French investigators said they had downloaded audio from the cockpit voice recorder and transferred it to their Ethiopian counterparts. On Sunday, Ethiopia's Transport ministry said information from the Ethiopian Airlines jet showed similarities to a crash of the same type of Boeing plane used by an Indonesian airline.
The crash in Ethiopia raised a host of questions about the safety of the aircraft and the training given to pilots around the world. It also prompted multiple nations to ground the Max 8 amid growing concern about what appears to have been a struggle by the pilots of Flight 302 to control the plane minutes after takeoff.
Families of the Ethiopian victims have visited the site of the crash to see the wreckage for themselves. The passengers aboard that day had come from more than 35 countries and included at least 22 employees of U.N.-affiliated agencies. Kenya suffered the single largest toll: at least 32 dead.
In Addis Ababa, mourners have sat in tents all week to receive visitors, in keeping with Ethiopian tradition. At the memorial, priests chanted a prayer for the departed. The patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox church, Abune Mathias, called out the names of the nine Ethiopian passengers and seven airline employees - including the captain, Yared Getachew, 29 - whose lives were being honored.
"This is so the families and friends can accept the end, so they can move on," said Samson Seyoum, 49, a humanitarian worker who had lost a friend of two decades, Getnet Alemayehu, in the crash. Getnet, who worked for the charity Christian Relief Services, had been flying to Nairobi, Kenya, for a training course when he died.
A separate memorial was held at a Muslim burial site for the co-pilot, Ahmed Nur Mohammod Nur.
Later, while, the empty coffins were lowered into the ground at the church, the captain's father, a dentist, muttered words of encouragement to other pilots who had come to offer their condolences. He looked dazed. His private grief had become a public fixture.
"I'm still processing it," said the captain's brother, Meno Getachew, 39, a corporate lawyer from Toronto who had flown in a day earlier. The loss has been especially hard for his father, he said, because the older man had relied heavily on his younger son, who had been "his right arm."
He added, "This is crushing."
As Boeing faces global scrutiny about the plane, some relatives of the victims - 18 of whom were Ethiopian - have hesitated to blame the manufacturer for the tragedy.
Seyoum, who is a frequent flyer on Ethiopian Airlines, noted Boeing's long record of safety and its decadeslong partnership with the carrier, which is a source of fierce pride for the nation.
"I imagine this could have happened with any type of plane," he said. "It could have happened to any airline. I will continue to use the airline."
Not everyone shared his views. Yonathan Menkir Kassa, a pilot and aviation writer who attended the memorial, said Boeing had departed from its ethos of safety when it resisted global calls to ground the Max 8 planes immediately after the Ethiopian crash.
"Boeing should have admitted its fault and sided with passengers," Yonathan said. "Instead, it chose to be stubborn."
By noon, the memorial had wrapped up and the mourners were streaming out onto the busy street. In the sea of black, men and women wearing T-shirts with the pictures of the crash victims emblazoned on the front and Bible verses across the back stood out.
"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they are spent without hope," one T-shirt read.

Byron York: Truth comes to light in Bezos spectacle

Texto completo: Sometimes stories are simpler than they're made out to be. That appears to be the case with Jeff Bezos.

When the National Enquirer reported that Bezos, the Amazon founder who is the world's richest man, was having an extramarital affair and had sent racy texts, including photos of his penis, to his girlfriend, Bezos assembled a high-priced legal and PR team to mount an aggressive defense.

All of a sudden, sympathetic commentators began suggesting Bezos had been hacked. There was word that a "government entity" had gotten hold of the texts and photos. There was dark speculation of international intrigue, that Saudi Arabia might have used the Enquirer to target Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, in retaliation for the Post's coverage of the murder of the columnist and Saudi regime critic Jamal Khashoggi. And of course, President Trump played some sort of behind-the-scenes role.

Bezos orchestrated it all, using his security consultant to feed information to his newspaper, and also writing a much-discussed personal statement published on Medium.

"This statement that [Bezos] has released tonight is absolutely extraordinary," MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell said on February 7, "and I think it is a gigantic moment, actually in this history of our digital communication, which everyone has known has been at risk for quite a while, that any one of us could be hacked. We could have private things revealed through stolen emails, stolen texts, that sort of thing. And here is someone who stands up and says, I'm not going to take it anymore."

"The Saudis are being brazen," MSNBC's Chuck Todd said on February 8. "We've caught them being brazen with Qatar. We've caught them being brazen with Jamal Khashoggi. This would not surprise if it ends up being more connected to them because they've been acting this way."

"The Saudi connection aspect of the allegation from Jeff Bezos," said CNN's Chris Cuomo, also on February 8. "Bezos says...that you had [National Enquirer chief David] Pecker go to the White House with a Saudi guy that he was trying to raise money from. The dinner was a reward from the president. The Khashoggi reporting that the Washington Post did would really bother the Saudis, the Saudis wound up giving Pecker the money. Pecker's now going after Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, maybe this has something to do with the Saudis, maybe even the president."

And so on. The Bezos team spun quite a story. But holes quickly appeared in their handiwork.

In early March, the New York Times published a detailed look at how the long-married Bezos came to be involved with his girlfriend, the former Los Angeles local news anchor Lauren Sanchez. As the two got together, the paper reported, a smitten Sanchez was not shy about sharing intimate details of the relationship with her friends.

"By last year, they were having an affair," the Times wrote. "Three people in Ms. Sanchez's extended social circle said she was giddy and in love, showing amorous texts to a number of Brentwood and Beverly Hills moms."

Sanchez was, to say the least, not particularly discreet in handing the revealing texts and photos Bezos sent to her. And then there was, in the Times' description, Sanchez's "fame-hungry brother-manager" Michael Sanchez, described as a "loose[] cannon" and an "incorrigible gossip even in a town full of them."

Now, the Wall Street Journal reports that Michael Sanchez, "a talent agent who has managed television pundits and reality-show judges" has also "long been a source for the Enquirer." And, according to the paper, Michael Sanchez sold the Bezos texts to the Enquirer for $200,000.

Imagine that. Mogul sends deeply private texts to gossipy L.A. girlfriend who has gossipy, fame-hungry brother, and somehow it gets out! No Saudis required.

It is not unusual for men caught sexting with women not their wives to claim they have been hacked, or that their texts have somehow been stolen. Remember that Anthony Weiner tried the same thing. But few have the resources of Jeff Bezos, and few could rely on so many media commentators to spread the story.

At the same time, the Bezos spectacle also attracted the attention of more serious journalists, who found out that the real Bezos story is much simpler than all the Saudi speculation. It is, in fact, an old story, of people acting foolishly in the course of an extramarital affair. All the money in the world couldn't change that.

Texto completo: Durante la preparación del juicio a Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , los fiscales federales sellaron varios temas relacionados con sus testigos, principalmente cooperantes, que pudieran afectar su credibilidad al ser cuestionados por los abogados del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa.
Los abogados del New York Times y de VICE News presentaron mociones para exigir que se diera a conocer esa información que se ocultó en la mayor parte del proceso que ocurrió entre el 5 de noviembre de 2018 y el 31 de enero de 2019.
Uno de los primeros documentos revelados fue parte del testimonio previo de Alex Cifuentes , exsocio de Guzmán Loera, quien reveló que el mexicano pagó por menores de hasta 13 años para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas en sus escondites en las montañas de Sinaloa.
Sin embargo, hay más secretos por revelar, debido a la presión jurídica de los medios mencionados. En enero, el juez Brian Cogan determinó que se diera a conocer esa información y los fiscales elaboran una lista de qué darán a conocer paulatinamente.
“Los fiscales federales revelaron parte de los documentos del juicio de ‘El Chapo'” , informó Keegan Hamilton, reportero de VICE News. “El material incluye información adicional de Alex Cifuentes y las actividades sexuales de ‘El Chapo’ con menores de edad”.
#BREAKING @vicenews: Prosecutors just unsealed a new batch of court documents from El Chapo's trial.

“Un hilo sobre la secrecía en el capo del Chapo: En enero el juez Cogan, respondiendo a abogado del NYT, ordenó a la defensa y a fiscales revelar algunos de los muchos, muchos documentos en el caso”, señaló el periodista Alan Feuer , del Times.

— Alan Feuer (@alanfeuer) March 16, 2019
Los documentos compartidos por Hamilton establecen una lista de temáticas sobre las cuales los fiscales no querían que se hablara en la corte, ya que pudo afectar la credibilidad de sus cooperantes. Los representantes del Gobierno de Estados Unidos indicaron que los hechos no estuvieran directamente relacionados con las acusaciones contra Guzmán Loera, por lo que eran irrelevantes para el juicio.
Por ejemplo, se menciona al cooperante CW1 –identificado como Cifuentes– y la violencia doméstica contra su esposa, incluso agresiones durante su embarazo, así como sus interés sexual en menores indistintamente del sexo.
En el punto se menciona la complicidad sobre asuntos sexuales que Cifuentes mantenía con “El Chapo”, pero no se brindan mayores detalles.
“Actividades sexuales de CW1 y demandadas con socios menores de edad (miembros del Cártel de Sinaloa)”, indica el documento. “El acusado también busca interrogar a CW1 acerca de detalles altamente escabrosos concerniente a la actividad sexual que él y el acusado tuvieron con parejas menores para dos razones: (1) presenta una inconsistencia con la forma en que CW1 vio el tratamiento de otros menores, a saber, hombres jóvenes entre las edades de 16 y 17 años ; y (2) lleva en la relación de CW1 con el acusado, aunque el acusado busca limitar el testimonio acerca de su propia persona “, indica el documento en referencia a que los abogados de Guzmán Loera quería desacreditar a Cifuentes sin afectar a su cliente.
También se habla de sacar a la luz aquellos temas relacionados con esoterismo y el culto a sectas como los Illuminati, la vida extraterrestre, así como homicidios desconocidos y otros casos que pudieran afectar a cooperantes y al propio Guzmán Loera, lejos de los 10 cargos en su contra por los que fue hallado culpable.
La sentencia de “El Chapo” está programada para el 25 de junio, pero en las siguientes semanas se espera que los abogados presenten una solicitud de nuevo juicio, luego de que un jurado revelara que no se siguieron las reglas ordenadas por el juez Cogan.

Texto completo: An announcement could be coming any day now.
It's become increasingly evident former Vice President Joe Biden is likely to declare his candidacy for president, especially after his comments at a Democratic fundraiser in Dover this past weekend.
Here are the five ways Biden recently has hinted at a possible presidential run:
The slip at the Democratic fundraiser Saturday During a fundraiser on Saturday night, Biden he told Delaware Democrats he has the "most progressive record of anybody running."
He quickly backtracked, saying he meant to say "anybody who would run."
The rest of his speech at the First State Democratic Dinner sounded like one he could make on the campaign trail. He criticized President Donald Trump and the Republican Party and emphasized the importance of restoring civility in American politics.
He's 95 percent there Speculation around Biden's presidential campaign intensified when The New York Times reported earlier this month that his strategist is telling Democrats the former vice president is 95 percent of the way to deciding to run.
The Times also reported that Biden's advisors are offering campaign positions and looking at sites for headquarters.
'Run, Joe, run' When Biden spoke last Tuesday at the International Fire Fighters Association in Washington, the crowd erupted into applause and chanted "Run, Joe, run" when he alluded to his candidacy.
Biden told the crowd to save its energy.
"I may need it in a few weeks," he said. "Be careful what you wish for."
Coons is 'confident' Biden is going to run U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del, has been serving as a quasi-Biden spokesman in recent weeks, speaking publicly about how he is "confident" and "all but certain" Biden is going to run for president.
"I'm optimistic he's going to run," the junior senator said on "CBS This Morning" last week. "Everything is put in place but that last decision, which understandingly is a big decision."
He's asking other Democrats for support Earlier this month, Biden called a senior Democratic lawmaker, telling congressman he is running for president and asked for his support, The Hill reported.
During this conversation, Biden asked if he "could bounce some campaign strategy ideas off the lawmaker and invited the lawmaker to sit down with him in person in the near future," The Hill reported.

Un “amor prohibido” podría ser el motivo de asesinato de capo neoyorquino

Texto completo: Tras la detención de Anthony Comello como presunto responsable del homicidio del capo Francesco “Frank” Cali se indicó que el caso podría no estar relacionado con la historia criminal de la víctima.
El New York Times revela que varios oficiales indican que las indagatorias se perfilan hacia un “amor prohibido”.
Los agentes indicaron que Comello tenía interés romántico por una de las familiares del Cali , pero el jefe de la mafia le dijo al joven de 24 años de edad que se mantuviera alejado de ella. Se desconoce la identidad de la mujer.
El rechazo fue lo que, indican, desató la furia del muchacho, pero oficialmente, el jefe de detectives del Departamento de Policía, Dermot Shea , dijo que su gente estaba examinando “múltiples ángulos” del posible motivo del homicidio.
Comello fue arrestado en una casa propiedad de su familia en Brick, Nueva Jersey el sábado y está recluido en la cárcel del Condado de Ocean.
Los detectives tienen una grabación del asesinato de una cámara de seguridad afuera de la casa del Cali, y las huellas dactilares de Comello coinciden con las que se sacaron de una placa que el pistolero recogió y entregó a Cali antes de abrir fuego, según la Policía.
El hombre de 24 años de edad era graduado de Tottenville High School, vivía con sus padres en la sección de Eltingville en Staten Island, dijeron los vecinos.
“Él limpiaba la nieve por nosotros”, dijo Victor Ujeck , un vecino. “He visto a sus padres varias veces, también gente muy agradable… Nunca me hubiera imaginado que pudiera hacer esto”.
Didar Janid , de 46 años, trabaja en la bodega Campos, a pocas cuadras de la casa del sospechoso en Staten Island, dijo que había conocido al Comello desde hace casi ocho años y lo describió como alguien con personalidad “fuerte”.

Ralph Hancock: Is civility overrated?

Autor: Hancock, Ralph.

Texto completo: At a time in our national life when everyone can see that the virtue of civility is in alarmingly short supply, no one makes a better case for this virtue than American Enterprise Institute President Arthur Brooks. I heard him make the case at BYU a few months ago, and he has just published a similar plea in a New York Times op-ed.
The force of Brooks’ case for civility lies especially in the fine personal example he represents. While making no apology for the generally conservative opinions he maintains on substantive policy questions, his generous outreach to those who disagree, his humility in recognizing the hard questions he has not answered, and, especially, the composed, guileless and benevolent disposition that his character exudes, bolster our confidence in the possibility that civic friendship can overcome partisan rancor.
Brooks finds the underlying cause of the annoyance of incivility in the deeper disease of contempt. Following the lead of bad media examples, we are sucked into the cycle of “motive attribution asymmetry”: those who agree with me are assumed to be moved by love and justice, and those who oppose me are haters, un-American, etc. To fix incivility we must then cure contempt. Brooks proposes that we recover mutual respect by recognizing that disagreement and competition are good for democracy. We all have good intentions, we just disagree — so let’s talk about it.
As men and women of goodwill we naturally want to rise to Dr. Brooks' virtuous challenge to dispel contempt and enter into the respectful competition of democratic debate. But doesn’t even vigorous debate depend upon some shared standards and common understandings? Our worries about the preconditions of respectful debate are confirmed, unsurprisingly, by a glance at the comments posted on Brooks’ article. We have only to scroll to the second comment to read this from a defender of homosexual marriage: “How can I feel anything but contempt for people who want to stop me from getting married?” Someone else might similarly ask: “How am I supposed to respect someone who argues that a baby should be killed if it interferes with its mother’s career choice?”
A political community is not a debating society; we don’t just make our best case, perhaps get awarded some points, and go home. In politics, someone wins, and who wins matters — it matters for the kind of lives we live and, if we happen to choose to raise children, for the kind of life that they may hope to live. And if such questions could be settled by simply respecting everyone’s right to live as he or she or “they” pleased, then we wouldn’t be having the “civility” problem that so concerns Arthur Brooks. Every system of “rights” accords with and favors a certain understanding of what is good, a certain common basis of respect, if you will, a certain regime of civility. Civility or civic friendship is not a mere procedural matter or a problem of good manners; it depends on preserving or achieving some common ground concerning the essential character of our community. Now that such common ground seems to be beyond our reach, Brooks’ invitation to those who fundamentally disagree to simply embrace the fun of argumentative competition can only seem a little quixotic. No doubt we can do better than contempt, but alarm and diffidence seem appropriate.
Arthur Brooks’ advice that we summon the better angels of our nature and enjoy the respectful competition of ideas may not be quite up to the challenge of fundamentally opposing worldviews in contemporary America. Certainly Brooks is right, though, that we should not let even profound disagreement become an excuse for intemperate or ugly behavior. Brooks rightly recommends that we ourselves will be happier if we learn to respond to contempt “with warm-heartedness and good humor…” If that is too optimistic, I would at least go as far as to recommend, say, an equable and temperate disposition even, or rather especially, where the gravest matters are concerned. A person at peace with himself does not lash out at others. Resolute opposition to bad ideas is essential to good citizenship, but anger and invective are even worse for the agent than for the intended object. Those who seek to honor the truth as well as to respect other persons should exhibit a reasonable confidence, without bluster or cruelty. This would not exclude a candid assessment of ideas that are unfounded and dangerous.
Christians, such as Arthur Brooks and myself, honor the transcendent obligation to love our enemies. But that is quite different from believing we don’t have enemies.

Kids aren't growing up: Shocking new poll says parents are killing kids' life skills

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
Meet the 'lawnmower parent,' the new helicopter parents
What type of parent are you? Lawnmower? Helicopter? Attachment? Tiger? Free-range?
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of young people ages 18 to 28.
Parents contacting their adult child's boss
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor’s appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn’t sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child’s grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
Growing up means making mistakes
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
“The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid,” Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's difficult for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you’re doing it in high school, you can’t stop at college,” she said. "If you’re doing it in college, you can’t stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life. "
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own lives. "You can’t just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. The survey was conducted between Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls it an "inspiring and consistently witty entertainment memoir."

Texto completo: Madeline Miller's "Circe," a retelling of the story of the goddess of magic from "The Odyssey" told from Circe's perspective, has been chosen as this year's Spokane is Reading book.
"A bold and subversive retelling of the goddess's story that manages to be both epic and intimate in its scope, recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her own right," the New York Times' Alexandra Alter wrote about the book, which was published in 2018.
Miller's first novel, "Song of Achilles," was released in 2011 and won the Orange Prize for Fiction. Her essays have appeared in the Guardian, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Telegraph, Lapham's Quarterly and npr.org, among other publications.
Miller will appear in Spokane for two free events on Oct. 24, which are both open to the public. The first is at 1 p.m. at the Spokane Valley Event Center, 10514 E. Sprague Ave., and the second is at 7 p.m. at the Downtown Library, 906 W. Main Ave.
Spokane is Reading is also planning a series of book discussions and programs related to "Circe" which will be announced later this year.
Previous Spokane is Reading events have featured Jess Walter, Chris Cleave and Maria Semple.
Spokane is Reading is a collaboration between the Spokane Public Library, Spokane County Library District and Auntie's Bookstore.
Support for Spokane is Reading comes from a grant from Humanities Washington and the Friends of the Library groups in Spokane County and the city of Spokane.

College bribe scandal highlights inequality gap

Texto completo: At 12:33 a.m. Tuesday, I received an email from an anonymous sender who questioned a point in a 2017 column I wrote about growing inequality in Nashville.
The column, "Can 'old Nashville' and 'new Nashville' co-exist?," began with this sentence: "Nashville is not the only city in America experiencing booming prosperity while simultaneously witnessing the widening gap of inequality."
The emailer curtly wrote: "Why do you clowns continue to snivel about 'inequality' as though there was a time when everyone and their position in life, status, income, opportunity and health were equal? Inequality has always existed and always will. It's what fosters competition and innovation. Stop your (expletive) sniveling."
The writer is correct that inequality and inequity have long been a part of life, but in a democratic society where we have striven over nearly 21/2 centuries to create a more perfect union, shouldn't bridging the inequality gap be in the interest of our nation?
To be clear, it is not about taking away someone's hard earned wealth or goods or, gasp, veering into socialism – a popular trope these days. Rather, it's about creating a level playing field.
And that means admitting that the field is not level.
The scandal that has embroiled 50 people, including celebrities, who were charged by federal authorities Tuesday, accused of paying bribes to get their children into elite colleges, is proof positive. Money, not merit, gave these kids an advantage.
Meanwhile, students who were actually disabled, who were athletes, who were underprivileged, lost out because they could not compete financially.
Bridging the income inequality gap should not be belong to one party or the other – it's a real American issue.
Former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam made it an issue when he pioneered the Tennessee Promise, or free community college or technical school for high school students – and then adults through TN Reconnect – to give them a leg up to compete in an economy that requires more training then a high school diploma provides.
Current Gov. Bill Lee has made technical and vocational training a priority for the same reason.
There is an economic reason to provide people who can't afford it the opportunity to compete in the American economy.
Part of it is that employees are not prepared for the jobs that 21st century employers offer.
A workforce that is educated and trained can help build wealth for communities and families.
But we also have to face the fact that our nation has created historic systemic barriers to advancement – be it people who were forced into slavery, indentured servitude or other menial labor because of racial, ethnic or socioeconomic reasons.
Even more than 150 years after enslaved African-Americans were freed, segregation in education, accommodations, transportation, housing and job opportunities have had an effect. White families have nearly six times in retirement savings than black families, according to a 2017 Forbes analysis.
When efforts to try to correct errors in equity have emerged – affirmative action, school desegregation, fair housing laws or, more recently, redistributing Title I federal funds to Metro Nashville public schools that need them more than others – the resistance has been based on people's sense of loss, or the feeling that someone else is benefiting at their expense.
When in 2016 both presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders talked about the system being rigged, they appealed to audiences who either felt that someone was taking something away from them or who felt that they never had a shot at trying to achieve that something.
In addition to historical barriers, people are also drowning in college debt ($1.56 trillion overall). Some Americans are still recovering – or have never recovered – from the Great Recession. New jobs have displaced workers in older industries like coal or newspaper publishing.
We are an unequal society where the top earners are benefiting far more from a revised tax code than the bottom 90 percent. The New York Times' opinion columnist David Leonhardt has effectively argued that the 90 percent to 99 percent are doing all right, if not quite as well as the 1 percenters.
The reason I write about income inequality is because this phenomenon is unhealthy for a democratic, capitalistic society that purports to making the American Dream accessible to anyone who will simply work hard for it.
It is not so simple when we have not successfully dealt with issues like concentrated poverty, in part, because people who can afford it would prefer not to live by people of a lower economic class – or historically, another race. It is not just a Southern thing.
Nashville, for example, is one of the nation's Top 10 most income segregated cities, according to urbanist Richard Florida in his 2017 book "The New Urban Crisis."
So, when people say they do not want people to move ahead unless they have "earned" it, what do you say about the parents and kids caught in the college bribe scandal?
They didn't earn it either. They just had the money to buy it.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Fifty years ago Sister Paulette LoMonaco, a young nun from Queens, went to work for a small social services agency called Good Shepherd Services, serving as a house mother at a group home for teenage girls in crisis near Union Square. Within a decade she was running the organization, building it into a one-stop services provider with a budget of almost $100 million. She worked with the city to shape its pilot after-school program, and was also a force behind transfer high schools, which offered adult dropout students a second chance. She also had a hand in reshaping the city's foster care system, shifting the emphasis from removing children from troubled homes to propping up those families to keep them together. Along the way she wrangled with five mayors and the archdiocese (over matters of birth control and sexuality, among others).
At the end of this year Sr. Paulette is stepping down from the organization she built. "'Cause I'm tired," she said. "I'm going to be 76. This is a grueling job."
But she won't leave completely. She plans to keep her apartment in the same group home where she first got her start. Recently, she spoke with The New York Times from her modest corner office in Midtown Manhattan.
The following interview is an edited and condensed version of the conversation.
The New York Times. I like to think that because you're stepping down now, that we can speak more frankly than you could in the past.
Sister Paulette. We'll see. Sure, I'm game. I'm still here until the end of the year, and then I'm going to help with fund-raising.
What do you see as the significant changes in the city over your 50 years?
When we first moved into Park Slope in 1972, Park Slope was an unsafe neighborhood. It had the highest number of kids that were being removed from their homes and put into foster care. That's why we put a family counseling program there. Today you can't get real estate there.
What are the biggest changes in the way we do social services?
I remember for the first time when more children were in preventive services than were in foster care. That was a monumental shift. The pendulum has swung from removal to keeping families together.
How has your relationship with the archdiocese changed over the years?
We're affiliated with Catholic Charities, but we have an independent board of directors. We're not really controlled.
How do your approaches to family planning issues go over with the archdiocese?
You had to ask that. We follow all of our government contracts, and not all the children that we work with are Catholic, and we respect their ability to make their choices.
Does that mean you can't make recommendations?
That means that I don't want to answer that question. My spirituality is my own. I don't speak for the Catholic Church.
What changes do you see in young people?
I think that young people are more stressed out today because of social media. We didn't grow up with cyberbullying. We didn't grow up worrying about what someone at school would put up on Facebook, and it'll be there forever. You run into many teenagers today who have seen or heard of a lot of mass shootings. Here in our city we've done a great job at keeping crime down, but it's just a more stressful environment now.
We remember when there were 2,200 murders a year in New York. Now there are 300.
But there's other trauma. At Good Shepherd, so many of the children and families we work with have gone through a lot of trauma. So we're very trauma-informed. We'll start out by saying to a young person, What happened to you, instead of, What's wrong with you?
What are the fixable problems that we're not fixing?
This administration wants low income housing to have community centers attached, but they haven't figured out how to give us money for operations. So we have no money to turn on the lights. That's a problem I have to fix.
I also want to fix summer day camps, because for some reason, this mayor never includes summer day camps for middle schools in the city budget. And middle school is when our kids first start getting attracted to gangs.
What drew you into the church?
When I was in college I had friends at Fordham and they introduced me to some Good Shepherd sisters, and when I visited them I just fell in love with the way they were working with young people.
One day I was volunteering at a hospital and I had to take a girl I'd known to an adult psych ward, and I was freaked. Because I had to leave her in this locked place with people who were very disturbed. And that's when I decided that that's what I was going to do.
What does a 21st century nun look like?
I hope it's somebody who looks like me. Real. Compassionate. Happy. Mission-driven. And who wants to be treated like a normal person. It's very annoying that whenever they want to describe a nun in the media, it's always somebody with a habit and veil. I wish that the media could have a more up-to-date visual of a sister.
The culture talks a lot about the effects of celibacy among priests, and whether it's a good idea. We rarely hear about whether it's a good idea for nuns to be celibate. Is it time to rethink that as well?
To be honest, I haven't thought about it that much. Religious women join a congregation knowing that that's a part of the deal. I can be warm and affectionate, but being married is out of the equation.
You don't have a business education. What corner-office advice would you give to other leaders?
I've always believed in the servant leadership theory, being a servant and helping other people grow. It was started by Robert K. Greenleaf at AT&T, and he wrote extensively about the best way to bring out the best in your people.
So many people when they retire have an abstract idea that they'd like to play golf. You actually play golf.
No. I have an abstract idea that I'd like to play golf. I play a couple times a year. It is a very frustrating game. What I like is that it's outside and you can walk. I now can hit the ball. How far is another story.
You have done battle with half a dozen mayors, starting with Koch. Who was the most engaging to fight with?
Giuliani was tough. Mike Bloomberg I consider a friend. But there were times when they wanted to eliminate one of our programs and I'd say, I am going to be fighting you on this. This administration is progressive, but we don't always see eye to eye. I feel it's my responsibility to hold their feet to the fire the way they hold us accountable.
It's mid-March. Have you done your taxes yet?
No, because I don't pay taxes. I don't get a salary. My salary goes to the community. But the community's responsibility is to make sure I'm okay.
Do you see a Jimmy Carter-type retirement for yourself, or a Gerald Ford type?
Jimmy Carter. I'm going to be building houses of one kind or another. He's really lived out his mission as a man of faith. I hope people can say that about me at the end.

Texto completo: Ethiopian Airlines crash analysis begins
HEJERE, Ethiopia - Analysis of the flight recorders of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines plane has begun, the airline said Friday, and The New York Times reported that the pilot requested permission "in a panicky voice" to return shortly after takeoff as the plane dipped up and down and appeared to gain startling speed.
President Donald Trump in a phone call with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed affirmed U.S. support Friday after Sunday's plane crash killed 157 people.
Forensic DNA work began in identifying remains, and Muslim families held prayers for the dead.
Algerians demand president step down
ALGIERS, Algeria - People of all ages marched Friday through Algeria's capital and other cities amid heavy security for what could be decisive protests against longtime leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
The crowds throughout central Algiers appeared bigger than a week ago, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets to demand an end to Bouteflika's 20-year rule.
Algerians have barely seen Bouteflika in public since he suffered a 2013 stroke, and many are angry at a power structure widely seen as corrupt. Millions struggle to make ends meet despite the country's gas wealth.
Slovakia could elect 1st female president
BRATISLAVA, Slovakia - Slovakia could get its first female president as voters elect a new head of state today.
The leading contenders are Zuzana Caputova, an environmental activist who is in favor of gay rights and opposes a ban on abortion in this conservative Roman Catholic country, and Maros Sefcovic, an establishment figure who is the European Commission Vice-President.
In all, 13 candidates are vying to become the country's fifth head of state since Slovakia gained independence in 1993 after Czechoslovakia split in two.
20 confirmed dead in building collapse
LAGOS, Nigeria - Twenty people are confirmed dead in the school building that collapsed in Nigeria on Wednesday, and most of them are children, an official said Friday.
Forty-three other people were rescued, officials said. The disaster occurred in the heart of Nigeria's commercial capital.
Officials have said the three-story residential building had been marked for demolition and that the school was operating illegally on the top two floors.
Israel-Gaza fighting ebbs
JERUSALEM - Cross-border fighting between Israel and Gaza's ruling Hamas group appeared to be winding down Friday, amid reports of an Egyptian-brokered truce and Israeli media saying a misfire was believed to be responsible for the rare Gaza rocket attack on Tel Aviv that triggered the exchange. Four people were wounded in Gaza.
The two rockets had struck late Thursday, taking Israel's military by surprise. Overnight Thursday into Friday, Israeli warplanes hit some 100 Hamas targets in Gaza. The army said targets included an office complex in Gaza City used to plan and command Hamas militant activities, an underground complex that served as Hamas' main rocket-manufacturing site and a center used for Hamas drone development.

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO — The past two weeks, this column has been obsessed with “socialism” because the concept has suddenly become fashionable again on the left. I brought up the devastation of various socialistic experiments, but was met with a variety of rebuttals. Some critics view socialism as something warm and fuzzy (free health care, like in Sweden!), while others drip with hostility at the inequality of market-based economic systems. There was widespread agreement, however, that U.S.-style capitalism has somehow failed.
There’s even a strain of conservatism — including some thinkers who have bolstered the Trump presidency — that is dismissive of capitalism. In January, this column focused on Fox News’ commentator Tucker Carlson, who argued that “Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having.” Many social conservatives dislike capitalism because it undermines their cultural values by promoting materialism, vulgarity and hedonism.
Even those in the political center, who might be expected to boisterously defend the market, have some doubts. They seem to view capitalism as a “lesser of two evils” and not a good in itself. New York Times columnist David Brooks in January defended capitalism, but described the way it has turned society into “an atomized collection of individual economic units pursuing self-interest.” He called for embedding it with “moral norms” to serve a “larger social good.”
In the words of my Russian grandmother, who was driven off her property by a government unconstrained by property rights or limits on its power, “Feh.” That’s a Yiddish term of disgust. Before you start penning your email, let’s get this out of the way: Obviously, the American system is no more a pure capitalist system than the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was a pure socialistic system. Even those vaunted Nordic countries aren’t exactly what people think. They are more capitalistic than America in some ways, although they have higher levels of social spending.
We’re talking generalities. Socialism puts the government in control of the economic system and redistributes wealth as the political authorities see fit. Some socialistic countries allowed the ownership of tightly regulated businesses and private property, while others didn’t. Market capitalism lets individuals and companies make society’s key economic decisions as they pursue — gasp! — profit. Every modern “capitalistic” system has extensive government regulation of the private sector. They all tax people and provide redistributionist programs.
Nothing is pure, but people like me — libertarians — believe there should be lower taxes, fewer programs and less government control of the economy. Whatever their ultimate societal vision, self-described socialists believe there should be more government control, more programs and more redistribution. They are winning the day because our side keeps making excuses for markets and the flaws in our society. Yet market capitalism truly is moral, even though it cannot provide what some moralists seek, which is something approaching nirvana.
Markets simply are the sum total of all the individual decisions that people make on their own. I want to buy a car. I value certain features. Companies offer products at different prices and try to sweeten the deal. I negotiate, then buy what I want. Everyone profits, including the tax collector. Wealthier people buy nicer cars than poorer people. So what? In capitalist societies, there are ways to get poorer people a decent ride as they work their way up the economic ladder. In socialistic countries, almost everyone (except the political elite) queues up to take the bus.
Are there shady car dealers? Of course. Bad people are part of life. There needs to be some regulation (e.g., against fraud, theft, violence). But those who complain about the behavior of some private actors gladly give immense power to equally flawed government officials. Markets are about cooperation. Individuals negotiate with others to get what they want. Government is about force, about other people deciding (through edicts or votes) how you must behave and punishing you if you resist. Which seems moral to you?
“Far from being an amoral arena for the clash of interests, as capitalism often is portrayed by those who seek to undermine or destroy it, capitalist interaction is highly structured by ethical norms and rules,” wrote libertarian scholar Tom Palmer, in an introduction to the book “The Morality of Capitalism.” “Indeed, capitalism rests on a rejection of the ethics of loot and grab, the means by which most wealth enjoyed by the wealthy has been acquired in other economic and political systems.”
A system that lets us make our own decisions about our own lives is more moral than one that transfers them to powerful strangers. Freedom is better than coercion. Prosperity is more uplifting than poverty. “The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries,” Winston Churchill said in 1945. Let’s not cede the moral high ground to people who tout utopian ideas that usually result in misery.

'There Was No Authority': Blackout Sent Parts of Venezuela Into Chaos

Texto completo: MARACAIBO, Venezuela -- The city was collapsing long before the lights went out. But then came the blackout -- and with it, anarchy.
For days and nights, unruly crowds sacked 523 stores in Maracaibo as residents stood on their porches wielding weapons to guard against looters. Dozens died in hospitals. Bodies decomposed in the morgue. And what little food remained in refrigerators rotted away as the nation went hungry.
I drove to Maracaibo with a photographer for The New York Times to witness the chaos wrought by a devastating blackout -- likely the largest ever in a country already crumbling from an economic crisis and a shortage of food, medicine and water. Along the way, smoke hovered over the road as business owners burned the trash left behind by looters. At night, only the car's headlights pierced the darkness, outlining the silhouettes of pedestrians.
The entire nation was plunged into darkness for six days straight. But here in Maracaibo, a sweltering coastal city, the nightmare continued beyond a week: Desperate people searched for food in stores laid bare or shuttered, and formed long lines in front of the few bakeries brave enough to open. Many businesses were reduced to shattered glass and smoldering piles.
Everto León, 58, sat on a pitch-black road where the power outage continued, a short drive from the worst of the looting. His silhouette, barely visible in night, showed the bulging tumors under his jaw from the cancer that was killing him.
"I don't have the medicine I need, and the chance of getting it is now nill," said Mr. León, saying the rioters had sacked every pharmacy around him.
The power failure has become the latest battleground in a country where two men now claim to be president.
Juan Guaidó, the opposition head who is recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's legitimate leader, has offered it as evidence that the state is failing. President Nicolás Maduro has blamed the United States, which it says worked with the opposition to sabotage the electrical grid -- putting Mr. Guaidó under investigation, and sending intelligence agents to detain a well-known journalist for an alleged role.
The spectacular power failure was most likely result of a simple brush fire that destabilized the country's electrical grid, union leaders said. It underscored the lack of maintenance of key infrastructure and the years of mismanagement of the country's economy, which have become the twin hallmarks of the nation's economic collapse.
And it laid bare Venezuela's grim reality: When there is no power, there is no rule of law.
"You could hear doctors in the hospital yelling at their patients in the dark: 'Bear with it!' 'Just hold on!' But that does nothing for the pain," said a doctor in a public hospital in Maracaibo, who asked not to be named, fearing government retaliation. "Six days without power in the 21st century, how is this even possible?"
It began so much like Venezuela's many other outages that few even took note at first.
Maracaibo sits in Venezuela's most populous state and was the first to receive electricity generations ago. But today it lies on the far western edge of the electric grid, a sweltering Caribbean city whose high energy consumption has left the power flickering on and off for the last three years.
When the lights went out, around 1 p.m. on a Thursday, David Ardila, a publicist, tried to go about his work as usual.
"We thought it was normal electricity rationing," he said.
The rolling blackouts usually ended before nightfall, Mr. Ardila knew. But then he got a call from his wife. This was no normal power outage. It was not confined to their neighborhood, she said.
The entire country -- all of its 30 million people -- was now without power.
"There was no television, no radio, there was no Wi-Fi, there was nothing," Iveth Figueroa said. "We were completely incommunicado."
Nevertheless, the problems seemed manageable. When cellphones began to power down on Friday, a neighbor fired up a generator and let others recharge.
But food, always in scarce supply in Venezuela, was becoming a concern in the neighborhood. On Saturday, many began to realize any meat they had in their refrigerators would soon be rotting. Using stoves still connected to the gas supply, some residents cooked the meat, while others tried salting and drying it.
As the day wore on, people began to rush the few gas stations that remained open as lines of hundreds of cars snaked around blocks in the sun. A protest called by the opposition was put down violently by police. Mr. Maduro, silent until the weekend, appeared on television but said little about how the government planned to address the issue.
"They gave us no information," Ms. Figueroa said, worrying that popular resentment would soon boil over. "It was like one of those disaster films they used to make, like 'Soylent Green' or 'Underworld.' We would have to develop our own ways to survive."
The first gunshots sounded on Monday outside Omar Chávez's neighborhood.
Mr. Chávez had just returned from looking for medicine for his daughter and stocking up on dollars when he heard the beginning of a riot. He got to a safe place and kept watch.
"We could see through binoculars they were looting everything," Mr. Chávez said. "The shop owners were trying to defend their stores by opening fire, not to kill, but I think there were many dead. No one was controlling this mob."
A group of more than a thousand people had descended on a nearby business district, breaking glass windows and raiding merchandise, according to merchants. Venezuela's national guard, plagued by months of desertions, was nowhere to be seen.
"In the middle of this blackout there was no authority," said Miguel Sierra, who was selling laundry detergent when the looters arrived.
As night fell, the crowd started setting stores alight.
"I think they started the fire because the lights were out -- there was no other way to see what there was to take," said Marbella Jiménez, who runs an informal stall.
As the riots continued, hospitals braced for the injured, who soon showed up with gunshot wounds or injuries from broken glass. But the hospitals, which barely had soap because of the shortages, now also had no electricity.
A top medical official, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisals, said 47 people died in Maracaibo's main medical center.
"At least half could be attributed to the crisis," the official said, citing patients who died of heart failure or complications from untreated diabetes.
The medical officials also said several young men who arrived with gunshot wounds received amputations rather than less severe treatments that could have resulted in fatal complications if the blackout continued.
"You were entering the lion's den, it was a dark cave," said another doctor about the hospital. He declined to be named fearing the government. "The worst was the smell: it was a dirty, bloody smell, and the heat made the atmosphere thick and awful."
In one hospital, powered only by a generator that lit up the emergency room, an armed group entered unseen and robbed patients on two floors, according to doctors. The maternity ward in another hospital had no windows, and pregnant women had to be relocated to an outdoor plaza, doctors said.
This week, Mr. Maduro explained what his government had determined to be the cause of the power outage: a "cyber electromagnetic attack," organized by the American government out of Houston and Chicago.
The explanation left Ms. Figueroa and many others unconvinced on the eighth day of the outage in her neighborhood. But then a miracle caught her attention: The lights at last flickered back on.
A cheer erupted as street lamps lit the faces of the neighbors who had been sitting around on a dark lawn. But no one knew how long the electricity would stay or when it would be gone again.
"It's something new, the great leveler that we all live through equally," Ms. Figueroa said.

Southern voice; Author Greg Iles takes a slight detour with 'Cemetery Road'

Texto completo: Fans of Greg Iles' Penn Cage series are likely to be surprised by the setting of the author's latest novel, Cemetery Road.

After setting many of his books in and around his hometown of Natchez, Miss., Iles turned his compass toward Bienville, Miss., a fictional community run by an old boys club rife with corruption.

"We get a lot of tourists in Natchez now because of the trilogy and I'm worried that people will begin looking for Bienville, Mississippi, which is the setting of this book, and it doesn't fit," he said. "I'm worried they might be angry about that."

Iles will discuss the change of scenery and other aspects of his latest book as part of the Toledo Lucas County Public Library's Authors! series at 7 p.m. Sunday at the Sylvania Branch, 6749 Monroe St., Sylvania. Tickets are $5. The series is presented by The Blade and Buckeye Broadband.

Cemetery Road centers on Marshall McEwan, who left his hometown of Bienville at 18 and eventually became one of Washington's most successful journalists. At the height of his career, McEwan finds that his father has terminal cancer and returns home to run the family's 150-year-old newspaper.

Marshall arrives just as a deal for a billion-dollar Chinese paper mill is about to save the Mississippi map-dot town from extinction. As information surfaces that could stop the mill's development, it's evident that the town's old-money ruling body will stop at nothing to ensure the deal goes through.

Marshall - along with much of Bienville - is soon at a moral crossroads as he investigates the murder of his mentor and finds himself between his high school love and a friend to whom he owes his life.

Iles said he will forgo the traditional reading and instead talk more about his craft.

"The book is the book, but why bore people with the book when they see you face to face?" he said. "I talk about the South, the country. I talk about race a lot, usually, because my trilogy dealt with that in such a frank way."

Sometimes Iles plays music. Before becoming a writer, he was a guitarist and songwriter and still plays with the lit-rock band the Rock Bottom Remainders, which includes writers such as Stephen King, Dave Barry, Amy Tan, Mitch Albom, and Matt Groening.

"I'm usually pretty frank and pretty intense," Iles said of his book tour stops. "A lot of times, I ask people to cut their phones so nobody records it - it's much more exciting that way."

Iles typically blurs real people and history in his stories, but setting his books in and around his hometown can be challenging.

It's a minefield in a lot of ways, he said. It becomes almost a blood sport to try to figure out whether characters of mine are based on real people.

The setting of the Penn Cage novels also inspired walking and bus tours in and around Natchez, the oldest city on the Mississippi River.

The thing about a small town is that there are people who just remember me as a musician, as a high school football player, he said. You know everybody. ... A tourist will just walk up to a Natchezian on the street and ask, 'Where does Greg Iles live?' And they'll say, 'Oh, right over there; just go knock on the door.' I've had people just walk into my office, walk into my house like it's a museum just open to the public.

That he became a writer at all might surprise some in Natchez. Iles said he was sort of on the path of following his father's footsteps as a doctor or pursuing music.

I didn't set out to write. It was just something I always could do, he said. Teachers would say, 'you really have this gift,' but I just didn't care. I just enjoyed playing music. But when I was about 30, I realized I wasn't going to be the best in the world at music and I don't want a real job, so I turned to the thing that people told me I could do.

Iles' first novel, Spandau Phoenix, was published in 1993 and became the first of 14 New York Times bestsellers. He began setting his stories in Mississippi with his third novel, Mortal Fear (1998), and introduced Penn Cage in Natchez in his fourth, The Quiet Game (2000).

Iles' career and his life were nearly cut short in 2011, when his car was struck by a truck on Highway 61 near Natchez.

I woke up out of a coma a week later missing my leg and having a torn aorta, Iles said. That pretty much changed my life and the process of finishing that trilogy changed my life. It was a great thing. It changed my career and how it was perceived.

He said he was reminded that what really matters is your family and your life.

Since then, he's published Natchez Burning (2014), The Bone Tree (2015), and Mississippi Blood (2017).

With Cemetery Road, Iles said it was just time to explore a new city not far from where he's from.

Even though Bienville is fictional, don't expect it to lack detail.

I provide a really dense historical matrix, Iles said. I try to make it so that I can fool even a historian.

For now, Iles said Cemetery Road is intended to be a standalone novel, but, then again, so was Natchez Burning.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump got a firsthand taste of aircraft safety risks in August 1989 when a Boeing 727 operated by the Trump Shuttle, which he had bought a few months earlier and rebranded with his name, failed to lower its nose gear as it prepared to land in Boston.
"He was quite terrified that we were going to have an airplane burning on the runway with his name splashed across it," said Bruce R. Nobles, who was the airline's president.
The Trump Shuttle jet landed safely, if in a shower of sparks, and a euphoric Mr. Trump hailed the pilots as heroes. But Mr. Nobles said his boss was nervous about flying to Boston on a shuttle flight the next day to demonstrate the airline's safety.
That same mix of swagger and uneasiness was on display in the White House on Wednesday, when Mr. Trump pre-empted the Federal Aviation Administration in announcing that the United States would ground Boeing's fleet of 737 Max planes after two deadly crashes.
Boeing, he said, was an "incredible company" and would find and fix the problem. But in the meantime, he said, "I felt it was important both psychologically and in a lot of ways" to ground the planes.
It was the latest illustration of Mr. Trump's longstanding, peculiar affinity for aviation -- an industry he knows as an owner and frequent flier, but often claims to understand as an aeronautical engineer.
Whether it is the merits of Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet, the cost of a new Air Force One or Mr. Trump's frequent assertion that the F-35 stealth fighter is "literally invisible," the president barges into the technical details of aviation with more enthusiasm than expertise.
A day before grounding the 737s, Mr. Trump declared that modern planes were too complex for anyone but "computer scientists from MIT" to fly. Aviation experts pointed out that the problem with the 737 Max might be exactly the opposite: Boeing designed the modified 737 so that it would require minimal additional training of the pilots.
People who have worked with Mr. Trump said his knowledge of aviation reflected someone who had owned private planes -- first a 727 and later a 757 -- but little more than that. His older brother, Fred Trump Jr., was a pilot for Trans World Airlines and married a flight attendant. But Mr. Trump channeled his passion into real estate development.
"He knows more about airlines and aviation than the average person, but he doesn't know as much as I do," said Mr. Nobles, who ran Hawaiian Airlines and Air Jamaica after his time at the Trump Shuttle. "Then again, I don't know as much as him about real estate."
Mr. Trump's short-lived tenure as an airline executive captures his strange relationship with the industry. He was drawn to the shuttle less because he loved flying than because he saw it as a "diamond" -- a prestigious, pre-Acela system of transportation for the nation's East Coast elite.
After buying the shuttle from financially strapped Eastern Air Lines for $365 million in 1989, Mr. Trump proceeded to polish it by fitting out its fleet of 21 planes with maple wood veneer and gold-colored lavatory fixtures. He offered passengers free food, coffee, magazines and newspapers.
"I'll spend more money and I'll give the people more than they anticipate even," he told The New York Times in 1989, vowing, with characteristic immodesty, to create "the best transportation system of any kind in the entire world."
Mr. Trump brought bare-knuckle tactics to the Avis-Hertz competition with his rival, Pan Am Shuttle. At one point, he warned that Pan Am might not have the financial resources to maintain safe planes -- a statement that violated the industry's informal code and drew protests from Mr. Nobles, who had run the Pan Am Shuttle before jumping over to Mr. Trump.
"I said to Donald: 'Look, most people are uncomfortable flying. You're up in the air at 35,000 feet, and the only thing between you and death is a piece of aluminum,"' Mr. Nobles recalled. "'Anything you do to make flying seem more risky and less safe is bad for all of us."'
For a while, Mr. Trump's innovations fueled a lively competition between the two carriers. But the economy in the Northeast ran out of steam in the fall of 1989, and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait caused oil prices to spike the next summer. Mr. Trump looked for ways to economize.
He pressed Mr. Nobles to cut the flight crews in the 727s from three to two. His personal 727 had only two pilots, he pointed out. Mr. Nobles said he explained to Mr. Trump that the 727s used by the Trump Shuttle were configured for a pilot, a co-pilot and a flight engineer. The planes would require a costly redesign to be certified for only two pilots. Mr. Trump replied that he suspected Mr. Nobles was trying to protect the pilots' jobs.
In December 1991, USAir struck a deal with Mr. Trump's banks to take over the Trump Shuttle. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Trump was relieved of the bulk of the $135 million in loans he had guaranteed personally to buy the airline from Eastern. Mr. Trump has told friends he got out of the airline industry at the right time, though the economics of the industry were in a free fall by the time Mr. Trump unloaded the shuttle.
"He's not going to be remembered in the annals of the airline industry," said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group. "He is known as the temporary caretaker of something that was heading into oblivion. That doesn't make you an aviation industry executive."
Mr. Aboulafia said the president's pattern with aviation, as in other areas, had been to declare a crisis and then take credit for fixing it.
"The F-35 was a disaster until he could take credit for cost savings," he said. "Air Force One was a disaster until he got major cost savings from Boeing. The Super Hornet was a terrible plane until he could take credit for putting it back into the defense budget."
After selling the Trump Shuttle, Mr. Trump's involvement in aviation was mainly through his 757-200, which is equipped with a big-screen entertainment system and 24-karat-gold fixtures. The plane, once owned by Microsoft's co-founder, Paul Allen, became known as "Trump Force One" after Mr. Trump used it to hopscotch between rallies during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mr. Trump was so fond of the 757 that he briefly considered using it instead of Air Force One after he took office. That coincided with Mr. Trump's bitter complaints about the cost of a plan to replace the two Boeing 747s that currently operate as Air Force One. He also floated the prospect of naming his personal pilot, John Dunkin, to be the head of the F.A.A.
Those ideas have vanished like a jet's contrails, but Mr. Trump remains opinionated about airplanes and the industry.
In January 2018 he tweeted: "Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news -- it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record!" In fact, there had not been a fatality on a commercial airliner in the United States since 2013.

Texto completo: Selecting the sequel to the 2003 novel “The Five People You Meet in Heaven” as the Palm Beach Book Festival’s book of the year is organizer Lois Cahall’s way of sending a message.
Mitch Albom’s “The Five People You Meet in Heaven” vaulted to No.1 on The New York Times bestseller list, stayed on the list for 95 weeks and inspired a movie by the same name. The sequel, “The Next Person You Meet in Heaven” recounts the story of Annie, the little girl Eddie, the hero of the first book, gave his life to save.
The festival’s theme is Conviction of the Heart — a sort of antidote to the political divisiveness that’s pervading the publishing industry as well as the country, said Cahall, founder and creative director.
Albom’s “The Next Person You Meet in Heaven” goes beyond conviction of the heart to conviction of the soul, she said. “His book is about what legacy you’ll leave on this Earth when you go.”
The festival will kick off on Friday in West Palm Beach with a warm-up event during the Norton Museum’s Art After Dark. Stuart Woods, who recently released “A Delicate Touch,” the latest in his Stone Barrington mystery series, will participate in a Q&A with Andrew Gross, James Patterson’s frequent collaborator.
The festival will be held 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday at the University Theatre at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, the formerly nomadic festival’s new home.
Patterson, Palm Beach’s own best-selling novelist and a longtime supporter of the festival, will be one of the seven featured authors.
He’ll talk about his new book “The Chef.” The novel is about a New Orleans police detective and food truck chef who comes under investigation for a murder he’s accused of committing in the line of duty.
Back in November, when Patterson was looking for a chef to help him promote the book, he asked Cahall if she knew any chefs. It so happens her cousin is celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian. He jetted down for a Facebook Live post with Patterson in the kitchen at BrickTop’s.
“I could not do the festival without him,” Cahall said. “This is a way for me to pay him back.”
Boca Raton developer James Batmasian and his wife, Marta, have joined Patterson as major sponsors this year.
Here’s the lineup:
• 10-10:45 a.m.: “O Magazine” panel featuring Tayari Jones, author of “An American Marriage”; Idra Novey, author of “Those Who Know,” and moderator Leigh Haber, books editor of “O Magazine.” “An American Marriage” deals with an upwardly mobile black couple whose lives are derailed when the husband is wrongly
convicted of rape. “Those Who Know” explores the dynamics that muzzle the exposure of a popular politician’s involvement with the death of a young woman.
• 11:15 a.m.- noon — Susan Orlean, author of “The Library Book,” with Christopher Bonanos, city editor of “New York” magazine. Orlean’s nonfiction book dips into memoir, biography, history and science to celebrate the role libraries have played throughout time. At its heart is the story of a seven-hour fire in 1986 that destroyed or damaged more than a million books at the Los Angeles Central Library.
• 12:15-12:45 p.m. — James Patterson with moderator Robert Scheer, founder of Comfort Cases, a charity that assists youth in foster care.
• 2-2:45 p.m. — Ben Bradlee Jr., author of “The Forgotten: How the People of One Pennsylvania County Elected Donald Trump and Changed America,” and Ben Fountain, author of “Beautiful Country Burn Again: Democracy, Rebellion and Revolution.” Bradlee uses the stories of 12 Trump voters in Luzerne County, Pa., to build a case for how the Democratic Party’s desertion of the white working class cost it the 2016 election. Fountain’s collection of essays reflecting on the 2016 campaign “argues that the United States may be facing a third existential crisis, one that will require a ‘burning’ of the old order as America attempts to remake itself,” according to Harper Collins’ website.
• 3:20-4 p.m. — Mitch Albom, author of “The Next Person You Meet in Heaven” in a Q&A with Cahall.

Cal Thomas: The Democrats’ Jewish problem

Información de publicación: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]. 14 Mar 2019.

Resumen: After heated debate within their caucus, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership released a separate statement: “Congresswoman Omar’s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters is deeply offensive. According to The Daily Caller, Maher Abdel-qader, a key fundraiser for Tlaib, shared an anti-Semitic video which described Jews as “satanic.” In a New York Times column last week, Bret Stephens, who is Jewish, wrote: “If Pelosi can’t muster a powerful and unequivocal resolution condemning anti-Semitism, then Omar will have secured her political future and won a critical battle for the soul of the Democratic Party.

Texto completo: Rep. Ilhan Omar’s (D-Minnesota) comment that the influence of the Israeli lobby in Washington pushes lawmakers to take a pledge of “allegiance to a foreign country” was bad enough. A watered-down House resolution condemning, not Omar, but “all hatred” was as tepid as denouncing drunk driving.
After heated debate within their caucus, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership released a separate statement: “Congresswoman Omar’s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters is deeply offensive. We condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments.”
Omar complied, but this is not the first time she’s had to walk back controversial comments about Israel.
In 2012, Omar tweeted: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.”
The implication was that Israel and its backers are being manipulated to support the Jewish state. This old anti-Semitic trope will be familiar to anyone with a minimal understanding of the history of the Jewish people and the genocidal goal of their enemies. Yes, Omar apologized, but not until she got to Congress. This assumes her apology was more political, than sincere. Consider her appeal to “Allah.” Why would she, or any Muslim, disobey Allah?
Sarah Stern, who heads Endowment for Middle East Truth, which bills itself as “a Washington, D.C.,-based think tank and policy center with an unabashedly pro-America and pro-Israel stance,” emailed to say, “We Jews have learned from our long and painful history that words matter. Violence against Jews does not erupt in a vacuum; and the increasing ease with which anti-Semitic comments are uttered within certain segments of our society is deeply painful and disturbing.”
That truth can also be seen in Israel where Palestinian Arafat Irfayia, the prime suspect in the murder of Israeli teenager Ori Ansbacher, was indicted last week. World Israel News reports his explanation for stabbing and then raping the girl: “Because she was a Jew.” The publication says Irfayia left his home in Hebron with “the express intention of killing a Jew.”
You have to be taught to hate, as Oscar Hammerstein wrote in the musical “South Pacific,” and hatred is at the heart of anti-Semitism, most notably in radical Islam. It can only get worse if those who harbor anti-Semitic sentiments — like Omar and her colleague and fellow Muslim, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) — are elected to Congress.
According to The Daily Caller, Maher Abdel-qader, a key fundraiser for Tlaib, shared an anti-Semitic video which described Jews as “satanic.” The clip included this comment: “Research the truth about the Holocaust, and you’ll definitely start to question what you thought you knew.” The video’s narrator went on to question whether 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust. The Caller writes, “Abdel-qader shared the video both on his personal Facebook page and within the group that now includes Tlaib.”
Morton A. Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), the oldest pro-Israel group in the U.S., told Mark Levin on Levin’s radio show: “…the Democrat party has shown a lack of will to tell the truth of the Arab-Islamist war against Israel. In a recent BDS vote to stop BDS, boycotting Israel, the innocent Israel, half of the Democrats voted against that bill. Virtually every Republican voted for it. …So we have a real problem with the Democratic party.”
In a New York Times column last week, Bret Stephens, who is Jewish, wrote: “If Pelosi can’t muster a powerful and unequivocal resolution condemning anti-Semitism, then Omar will have secured her political future and won a critical battle for the soul of the Democratic Party. At that point, the days when American Jews can live comfortably within the Democratic fold will be numbered.”
I wish, but the history of Jewish loyalty to the Democrats is long, which is a mystery since in the end we are again talking about their survival, not just as a Middle East nation, but as a people.

Beh-toh? Comma-lah? Here's how to pronounce the names of Democratic presidential hopefuls

Texto completo: Have you heard?
Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, officially tossed his hat into the 2020 presidential race Thursday.
If you have heard the news, there's a good chance you've heard it a few different ways.
Someone may have told you that Bay-doh launched his presidential campaign. Or perhaps a friend informed you that Beat-oh is gearing up for the election.
The name, to some, can be hard to figure out. It was even a talking point during O'Rourke's failed US Senate campaign against Senator Ted Cruz last year. (For the record, it's BEH-toh.)
But with a growing number of Democratic hopefuls announcing that they're running for president, O'Rourke's first name is no longer the only one tripping up talking heads and voters.
Many people are not only wondering where the emerging candidates stand on the issues — they're also figuring out how to pronounce their names properly.
Among the contenders seeking to clinch the Democratic nomination are Kamala Harris, senator from California;Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii;New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand;Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar;Julian Castro, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Did you get all of those right? Don't worry, you're not alone.
Seemingly trying to get ahead of any potential confusion moving forward, CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday tweeted out a helpful pronunciation guide to his followers.
In response to Tapper's tweet, Steve Koczela, president of MassInc Polling Group, a research company that conducts telephone surveys about candidates, said pollsters spend a significant amount of time scouring the Internet for videos of candidates pronouncing their own names.
They do this, he said, so MassINC can “make good pronunciation guides for telephone interviewers" reaching out to potential voters.
“Exactly how to make it the most easy to understand and read out loud, that's what you're looking for when making a pronunciation guide," Koczela told the Globe. “That's why it's best to find the candidate saying their own name if you can."
While MassINC hasn't done any Democratic polling yet for this cycle, Koczela said the company will be having discussions about a pronunciation guide relatively soon.
Because the name confusion is nothing new for many of the candidates hoping to unseat President Donald Trump (they've dealt with it while running for lower office), here's a quick look at how the pronunciations have been explained over the years.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Buttigieg penned an essay on Medium in 2016 that addressed the subject head on.
“Most people have trouble pronouncing my name, so they just call me 'Mayor Pete,' " he wrote. “My surname, Buttigieg (Boot-edge-edge), is very common in my father's country of origin, the tiny island of Malta, and nowhere else."
To drive the point home, in December, Buttigieg's husband, Chasten Buttigieg,tweeted a helpful guide to get it right.
Still, Buttigieg was asked again about his name during an interview with reporters a month later. He seemed happy to clarify.
Senator Kamala Harris
For her part, Harris addressed any uncertainty about how to pronounce her name back in 2016. She did it by tweeting a campaign video of kids saying it out loud.
It's not “Cam-el-Uh," or “Kuh-Mahl-Uh," or even “Kar-mela," the kids say in the video.
It's “Comma-luh."
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand
When Gillibrand was appointed New York senator in 2009, one of her first tasks in office, according to The New York Times, was to teach people how to say her name right.
“It's a sibilant G," an aide told the newspaper at the time. “Jill-uh-brand."
No gill, as in the things that help fish breathe.
As for her first name? People seem to struggle with that, too. It's Keer-sten, according to the report.
Senator Amy Klobuchar
In a campaign video on her website, Klobuchar introduces herself at the very start, making clear that it's pronounced “Klo-bush-ar."
According to TwinCities.com, the name Klobuchar is Slovenian, and it's pronounced with a bit of local flair.
“That 'ch' is pronounced like an 'sh,"' the website reports. “And in Minnesotan, the 'bush' is really quick."
Say it again: Klo-bush-ar.
Representative Tulsi Gabbard
Is it Tull-see Gah-bard? Or Tool-see Guh-bard?
According to introductions at events and during interviews on national television — including an appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" this month — it's fair to surmise that her name is pronounced “Toll-see GAB-urd."
Julian Castro
Like many other news outlets that have doggedly covered their local politicians, the San Antonio Express-News is well ahead of the pack when it comes to clarifying how to pronounce former secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro's name.
In 2012, when Castro was mayor of San Antonio and a keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention, the newspaper wrote about how to say Castro's first name, after hearing an XM radio DJ apparently botch the pronunciation.
The reporter put together an “easy, cheesy pronunciation guide for CNN and other Yankee-based journalists."
“Think of a baby owl who goes 'Whoooooooooooooo,' " when trying to say Julian, he wrote.
WHO-lee-an Castro — there is no hard “J," like the one in Julian Edelman.

Texto completo: The Tallahassee Scientific Society's eighth annual spring speaker series, Horizons 2019, kicked off on Thursday, Feb. 28, at the IMAX Theater on Kleman Plaza. Professor David Kaiser, a physicist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, presented "Quantum Jitters in the Sky: The Big Bang, Cosmic Inflation, and the Latest Observations."
Kaiser's articles have appeared in such magazines as Science, Nature, New Yorker as well as The New York Times. His work also has been featured on NOVA television programs, National Public Radio and the BBC.
Kaiser's research interests include early cosmology when the universe underwent a period of rapid and violent expansion known as "cosmic inflation." He has helped design and conduct novel experiments to test the foundations of quantum theory.
After his talk at the IMAX, Kaiser met with physics and geometry students from SAIL High School on Friday as the Horizons Series extends its outreach to the community. FSU's Department of Physics served as co-host for Kaiser's visit to Tallahassee.
Horizons is a series begun by the local, nonprofit Tallahassee Scientific Society in 2012 to further its mission to promote public interest in science and technology.
The series features one presentation per month beginning February and running through May. All presentations are held at the Challenger Learning Institute's IMAX Theater at 7 p.m. with doors open at 6 p.m. For tickets and more information, go to tallysci.org. Free admission for high school and college students.
Here's a summary of the rest of the Horizons schedule this year:
March 28: "Student-Sourcing the Discovery of New Antibiotics in the Soil" with Sam Rikkers, Executive Director, Tiny Earth, and Colleagues, Brittany Gasper and Eric Warrick. Tiny Earth is working to reverse a global health crisis resulting from multi-drug resistant microbes through a global network of nearly 10,000 student-scientists across 44 states and 14 countries.
The presenters will lead us into a conversation about antibiotic resistance, discovery, and innovations in STEM education and how Tiny Earth is helping to produce citizenry that values scientific research and discovery. The Tiny Earth partners will meet with faculty from Thomas University, Tallahassee Community College, and Florida A&M University to explore research opportunities for undergraduate students in biological, earth and agricultural sciences.
April 25: "Project Remote: Where the Road Ends" with Ryan and Rebecca Means, conservation and wildlife ecologists in the local non-profit Coastal Plains Institute. Their professional interests include wetland ecology, herpetology and science education.
Project Remote is a personal quest to determine the most remote region within each state and mount documentary expeditions to raise public awareness about the extent of roads in our country and the importance of preserving the remaining remote areas. The presentation will allow the audience to journey with the Means and experience what's left between the roads in our country.
May 23: "Discovering a Lost World of Birds: Fossils in Hawaii's Lava Caves" with Helen James, curator of Birds for the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. James oversees one of the largest museum collections of birds in the world and she and her collaborators have discovered over 60 species of extinct fossil birds in the Hawaiian islands.
She will share the stories of discoveries such as birds with odd traits like the inability to fly and how this changed what we think about extinction, as well as how to prevent it. She will meet with colleagues from FSU's Department of Biology and middle school students during her visit to Tallahassee.
MIT Professor Dr. David Kaiser works with SAIL students at the Science Speaker Series on Feb. 28.

Dartmouth biomass plant won’t be an improvement

Texto completo: Dartmouth biomass plant won’t be an improvement
A projected expenditure to change Dartmouth College’s heat and power source to another carbon-based system is being promoted (“Search for biomass developer begins,” Feb 21). The proposed system will cause increased particulate pollution and significant CO2 emissions — hardly the improvement it is touted to be.
Bioenergy plants have been in New Hampshire for more than 30 years and still must be subsidized by ratepayers. The wood chip supply for the proposed plant will require at least 15 immense diesel-powered trucks a day on local roads. Since many roads throughout New England are weight-limited for up to 60 days a year, a massive inventory of 450 truckloads of chips would have to be stored on site.
Technological advancements will probably provide an eventual solution for the college. Given the brain power of the Thayer School of Engineering, couldn’t a reasonable alternative to a $200 million interim step be found?

Panic and save the planet

On Feb. 17, The New York Times, often viewed as the unflappable “Gray Lady” of American journalism, covered the front page of its Sunday Review issue with an arresting picture captioned “Time to Panic,” and the words “The planet is getting warmer in catastrophic ways. And fear may be the only thing that saves us.”
Salvation by panic and fear? I recalled, years ago, when our 3-year-old granddaughter used to exclaim over and over — to the amused reactions of nearby adults — “This is no time to panic!” (The cautionary advice seems to have come from Buzz Lightyear and the Disney movie Toy Story.)
“Don’t panic” is, indeed, sound advice if you have to ditch your jetliner in the Hudson River, or escape a flood or wildfire. On the other hand, if you’re dozing when disaster strikes, panic may be what prompts an effective response. Consider Pearl Harbor, or Sputnik, signaling in 1957 that the U.S. was lagging the Soviets in space science.
Last October, the U.N. released a dire climate change report and a U.N. official said world leaders should imagine “a deafening, piercing smoke alarm going off in the kitchen.” Panic and fear may indeed be what’s needed to awaken a dozing American electorate and our inattentive political leaders about climate. But then a sufficient response will have to combine scientific awareness, political courage and legislative savvy. The Green New Deal resolution reflects both an awakening and political courage. Fortunately it is already adding momentum to bills such as HR 763, The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act of 2019.
For Upper Valley readers, it’s good news that both U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., and U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., now have seats on the important House Subcommittee on Energy. Let them know we’ve heard the alarms and are looking to them for political courage and legislative savvy. It’s a good time, too, to join the local Citizens Climate Lobby chapter, (email ccluppervalley@gmail.com, 802-432-8494).

Shame on Shaheen, Hassan for their abortion votes
Democrats, including New Hampshire U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would protect babies born alive after an attempted abortion, require that they get the same care as any other child born alive and ensure they’re admitted to a hospital immediately.
Shame on them. This is infanticide and has nothing to do with the woman’s “rights.” The baby, born alive, surviving the abortion, has equal rights under the Constitution.

Bill protects coyote pups
HB 442, the Coyote Pup Protection Bill, will come before the New Hampshire House this month. HB 442 will close coyote hunting during pup rearing months, from April to August. Year-round hunting of coyotes increases the population due to responsive breeding and destabilizing established packs. Orphaned pups seek food in new territories, where they may be more likely to have conflicts with humans, livestock and pets. Stable coyote packs help to balance the New Hampshire forest ecosystem.
Typical coyote prey consists of animals that may carry Lyme disease, such as rodents and sickened members of a deer herd.
HB 442 would not change a landowner’s right to remove a nuisance coyote. It would change language regarding the night hunting of coyotes from “shall” to “may” so that New Hampshire Fish and Game has more flexibility in the regulation of night hunting of coyotes, if necessary.
Please ask your state representative to compassionately support HB 442.

America is addicted to war
I am writing to agree with Neil Meliment’s Jan. 30 letter about 9/11 (“20 Years of Pretending”). It has been my experience that many Americans refuse to face the truth that becomes evident when we take time to investigate this crime.
It seems beyond imagining that people in our government planned and executed an event that killed 3,000 Americans in order to initiate the longest run of war in our country’s history. Many of us feel we must believe the improbable story of this intricately planned event being directed by a diabetic Arab jihadist who hated the Internet and was hiding in remote Afghanistan. I admit we’d better have a good excuse for 18 years of unlawful destructive war in the Middle East, but for those who take time to investigate, this story doesn’t cut it.
Since October 2001, when we invaded Afghanistan, our country has justified continuous war and the export of war by selling weapons, which is extremely profitable for the large defense industries that keep our economy humming. It also cuts down on the number of poor people who might otherwise be unemployed. And now we are aiming for yet another war in Venezuela?
Contact your representatives, but know that until we insist on campaign finance reform, we can’t depend on Congress to stop the wars we are economically addicted to.

Beware of those with lists
For the past several election cycles, Republican officeholders deemed insufficiently conservative have been threatened regularly with primary challenges from candidates even farther on the right. Now we Democrats have our own Robespierre, who is lining up the tumbrels to cart off any of her colleagues who dare to make the slightest compromise.
When will we learn to beware of anyone who warns colleagues — or anyone else — that they are “putting themselves on a list”? Haven’t we had enough of lists?

Texto completo: If you put your life on social media, you may have to worry about security. Social Security.
While Russian hackers and Chinese cyberattacks get all the attention for how they break into a system, the government here at home can use what you put out there without resorting to ransomware or brute force.
"The Trump administration has been quietly working on a proposal to use social media like Facebook and Twitter to help identify people who claim Social Security disability benefits without actually being disabled," a New York Times article stated, citing a 2018 budget request.
So is that a bad thing? Social Security has been on rickety legs for years. We have borrowed shamelessly from funds that were never meant to be a raidable cookie jar. The 2018 Social Security annual trustees report predicted the retirement and survivors benefit trust fund would be depleted by 2034 and the disability trust fund by 2035. After that, payments will drop by as much as 23 percent.
While President Trump has been roundly criticized for increasing the federal deficit, the disability fund picture has been better under his tenure. According to the Social Security Administration, the depletion date for that fund was six years sooner in 2017. The difference was credited to declining applications and lower benefit amounts.
The SSA says there is little crime, but "we believe any level of fraud is unacceptable." At the volume payments are put out, even a fraction can be a lot of money. In January, the agency reported more than $11 billion in disability payments, with an average monthly check of $1,097.
If just one-hundredth of one percent of the beneficiaries each month were fraudulent, that would be $1.09 million. In a year, it would top $13 million.
So the idea of trolling Facebook for pictures of people too disabled to work but not to water ski or golf makes sense. Law enforcement agencies have regularly found scofflaws because of social media crowdsourcing or investigation.
But there is still reason for caution -- and not just for disability recipients. The government has to exercise it, too.
A social media account isn't a deposition. It's not under oath. What people put out there is often their best day, not the worst one. It might just raise questions and offer little to no proof. It should, at best, be a tool and not a testimonial.

Stacey Abrams: On second thought, maybe I will run in 2020

Texto completo: If you think Stacey Abrams had a hard time accepting her loss in Georgia's gubernatorial race last year, you should see how difficult she's finding it now to make up her mind about 2020.

She announced over Twitter that she is still considering running for president next year after having just said she’d do no such thing until at least 2028.

If you can figure that one out, then props to you.

“20 years ago, I never thought I’d be ready to run for POTUS before 2028,” Abrams said this week on social media. “But life comes at you fast – as I shared in Q&A w [PBS’ Yamiche Alcindor] at [South by Southwest]. Now 2020 is definitely on the table.”
That's simple enough. But a few hours before that tweet, during her South by Southwest interview, she had explained that she relies on a spreadsheet to map out her political career, including the year she might run for president.

“The year in the spreadsheet is 2028,” Abrams told PBS’ Alcindor. “2028 would the earliest I will be ready to stand for president because I would have done the work I thought necessary to be effective in that job.”

Rewind again to last Thursday, when the New York Times reported specifically that Abrams was considering her options for 2020.

Abrams “is mulling whether, like so many other Democrats, she wants to run for president in 2020,” the paper reported in an article titled, “Stacey Abrams, Star Trek Nerd, Is Traveling at Warp Speed.”

Rewind the clock even further, and there’s Politico reporting in January that top Senate Democrats are courting Abrams to challenge Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., in 2020.

In summary, Abrams appears to be all over the map about her plans. She was at least decisive in her unwillingness to concede she had lost the 2018 Georgia governor’s race. Recall that Abrams fell last year to Georgia’s then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who won 50.2 percent of the vote compared to her 48.8 percent. Abrams didn’t go quietly. Her eventual admission of defeat came only after she called for a new election and only after waited to see whether absentee and provisional ballots triggered a runoff (they didn’t). And even then, after she announced she would end her campaign, she refused to concede to Kemp.

"I acknowledge that former Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election. But to watch an elected official—who claims to represent the people of this state, baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote—has been truly appalling," she said in November 2018.

She added, "So, to be clear, this is not a speech of concession. Concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper. As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede. But my assessment is that the law currently allows no further viable remedy."

Abrams and her supporters maintain to this day, without evidence, that Kemp stole the election by suppressing voter turnout. I imagine she'll be a similarly gracious loser in the end, should she win the Democratic Party nomination in 2020.

Texto completo: Un grupo de lectores, mayormente venezolanos, se reunió el lunes al mediodía frente al edificio del diario The New York Times para protestar lo que calificaron como política editorial “tendenciosa” y “desinformativa” sobre la crisis humanitaria y política que se vive en ese país suramericano.
En particular la protesta fue motivada por un reporte publicado el domingo donde acusaban a la oposición venezolana y el gobierno del presidente colombiano Iván Duque de ser responsables de la quema de un camión con ayuda humanitaria en la frontera el pasado 23 de febrero, acción que el mandatario Donald Trump adjudicó a seguidores de Nicolás Maduro, opuesto a la entrada de auxilio internacional en un tono hostil.
De hecho, la vicepresidenta de Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez, confesó al día siguiente que la violencia vivida en la frontera fue sólo “un pedacito de lo que nosotros estamos dispuestos a hacer”.
Pero The New York Times publicó que su investigación había determinado lo contrario. En el pasado, el diario neoyorquino, el más importante de Estados Unidos, se ha destacado por su crítica al gobierno de Trump, tanto en política interna como exterior.
Al bajar a conversar con los manifestantes, la reportera Deborah Acosta afirmó que lo publicado había sido producto de una investigación exhaustiva de análisis de videos, aunque admitió que la situación ese día fue confusa y que el diario estaba enviando más periodistas a la zona para cubrir la tensa situación.
Además del reporte en sí, los manifestantes cuestionaron que haya sido publicado justo el fin de semana, mientras en Venezuela se vivía una “situación desesperada” de muertes en hospitales, saqueos e incomunicación durante el mayor apagón en la historia del país; algo que, según ellos, The New York Times no había desplegado de manera proporcional “por su oposición permanente a Trump”, comentó la activista Gloria Requena.
Acosta insistió ante los presentes que el reporte se había publicado el domingo 10 de marzo porque fue entonces cuando habían concluido su investigación.
“¿Cómo se refieren ustedes a Guaidó?”, preguntó Acosta a los presentes sobre el presidente del Parlamento, que declaró ilegal el mandato de Maduro. A coro, la mayoría respondió: “Es el presidente encargado de Venezuela”. Y la reportera tomó nota.
“Pedimos al New York Times que dejen de usar nuestra crisis en su juicio político en Estados Unidos”, declaró a la agencia EFE Erick Rozo, coordinador en Nueva York del partido venezolano Voluntad Popular, al que pertenece el ingeniero Guaidó,
Rebeca Zambrano, miembro de la asociación “Independent Venezuelan American Citizens”, denunció que “en vez de hablar de cuánta gente está muriendo en Venezuela, de cuántos niños necesitaban esa ayuda, el New York Times decidió hablar de un video no concluyente”.
“Maduro dijo que no los iban a dejar entrar (los camiones con ayuda humanitaria), la canciller Delcy Rodríguez dijo que lo que vimos era sólo una muestra de lo que eran capaces de hacer”, resumió la activista, preguntándose entonces cómo en su reportaje el New York Times los eximió de culpa, por acción u omisión.
En septiembre pasado, un venezolano se desnudó frente a la sede del New York Times, también reclamando una cobertura a la crisis de su país que no fuese usada como excusa para juzgar a Trump.

Texto completo: Sen. Mitt Romney shared video of himself celebrating his 72nd birthday on Tuesday and was rewarded with social media mockery.
Twitter users pounced on two aspects of Romney's post about the surprise cake given to him by staffers: 1) Romney's favorite snack is Twinkies and 2) He has a very unusual method of blowing out birthday candles.
"My team surprised me with a cake made out of my favorite snack – twinkies! Looking forward to all this year has in store," Romney tweeted along with the video. The Utah Republican seemed genuinely thrilled at the surprise, laughing happily as his staff sings "Happy Birthday. "
"Look at that! Holy cow!" Romney says as he eyes his cake, constructed with a couple dozen vertically arranged Twinkies that are topped with birthday candles.

But it all goes awry about 30 seconds into the approximately minute-long clip when the senator proceeds to pluck out the candles and blow them out one-by-one.
"These are all wishes I'm getting," Romney says, as one staffer warns him not to burn himself. "All these wishes. "
While it is possible Romney was motivated by a concern that he might blow the Twinkies over, users on Twitters afforded the senator no such consideration.
"This is the most bizarre technique for blowing out birthday candles that I’ve ever witnessed. Mitt Romney is a deeply weird dude," tweeted journalist Bradford Pearson.
"Just think if this had surfaced during the 2012 election," imagined The New York Times' Julie Davis.
"Mitt Romney blows out birthday candles like a serial killer," tweeted the Barstool News Network.
Some users speculated Romney's method was about hygiene concerns and applauded him for it.
"Mitt Romney and I once bonded over our OCD about food. We both have a number of them," tweeted Reuters correspondent Ginger Gibson. "And now I'm unsure I'll be able to ever not do this with birthday candles. Not all heroes wear capes. "
Here are some other Twitter reactions to Romney's birthday wishes:

Texto completo: A biographical drama starring Keira Knightley is streaming on Amazon. And "Terrace House: Opening New Doors" returns on Netflix.
What's Streaming
COLETTE (2018) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. The French author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (Keira Knightley) broke boundaries in more ways than one. This period drama by Wash Westmoreland charts her evolution from a country girl to a fearless game-changer whose somewhat risqué novels about strong women earned her a nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature. But many hurdles came before success, most notably those created by her first husband, Henry Gauthier-Villars (Dominic West), a brash Parisian writer with the pen name Willy. When he starts running out of money to pay his writers, Willy asks Colette to ghostwrite a novel for him. It becomes a huge success and Willy forces Colette to keep the words coming. That pressure, and a few affairs, strains their relationship, but it also inspires Colette to strike out on her own. In her review in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that Colette "is never as wild as you might hope for a literary titan and voluptuary who first writes herself into history with her 'Claudine' novels while bedding men and women alike. But she's consistently, gratifyingly, full-bodied company."
TERRACE HOUSE: OPENING NEW DOORS Stream on Netflix. Some questions to keep in mind during Part 6 of this addictive Japanese reality series about a group of strangers under a single roof: Has the crew moved houses? Will this batch of episodes be the last in "Opening New Doors?" Who are some of the new faces that will be joining the fun? And of course, who's going to find love, or something like it, this time around?
JIMMY CARR: THE BEST OF, ULTIMATE, GOLD, GREATEST HITS (2019) Stream on Netflix. The British comedian Jimmy Carr delivers a compilation of his best one-liners and provocative jokes in this new special. Carr is also the host of the Netflix game show "The Fix," in which comics gather to try to solve gargantuan problems -- climate change, the wealth gap -- in under 30 minutes.
What's on TV
PROJECT BLUE BOOK 10 p.m. on History. This season finale reimagines the panic after multiple U.F.O. sightings paralyzed Washington in 1952. Racing against the clock, top officials enlist Hynek (Aidan Gillen) and Quinn (Michael Malarkey) to find out exactly what had been spotted.
THE BACHELOR 8 p.m. on ABC. For dramatic moments this season, nothing tops the time our bachelor, Colton, tried to escape the compound by jumping the fence. Then again, this is Bachelor Nation. That former football player felt crushed after Cassie said she couldn't reciprocate his love. Season 23 wraps up with the heartbroken bachelor dishing on his last days on the show.
CORPORATE 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. The second season of this nihilistic workplace comedy ends with two back-to-back episodes. Jake (Jake Weisman) gets an irritating co-worker, and after their boss ups the ante on a project, Matt (Matt Ingebretson) and Jake forge their own paths.

Federal court moves to unseal documents in Jeffrey Epstein sex scandal

Texto completo: MIAMI -- A federal court of appeals in New York on Monday took the first step in unsealing documents that could reveal evidence of an international sex trafficking operation allegedly run by multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein and his former partner, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.
The three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit gave the parties until March 19 to establish good cause as to why they should remain sealed and, failing to do so, the summary judgment and supporting documents will be made public. The court reserved a ruling on the balance of the documents in the civil case, including discovery materials.
"We're grateful that the court ruled the summary judgment papers are open and they are moving to expedite having them unsealed," said Sanford Bohrer, the attorney representing the Miami Herald, which filed the motion last year to have the entire case file opened. The Herald's appeal is supported by 32 other media companies, including The New York Times and The Washington Post.
The case, which was settled in 2017, contains more than 1,000 documents, lawyers said during oral arguments Wednesday in New York. Maxwell is the sole party fighting to keep the case sealed.
Most of the documents, including court orders and motions, were filed under seal or heavily redacted, similar to other cases in New York and Florida involving Epstein, a wealthy, politically connected money manager. Epstein, 66, was not a party to the lawsuit, which was filed against Maxwell in 2015 by Virginia Roberts Giuffre.
Giuffre claimed in the lawsuit that she was recruited by Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Fla., when she was 16 years old. Giuffre had been working at the resort's spa when Maxwell approached her and asked her whether she wanted to become a masseuse for Epstein. Giuffre claimed that the massages were a ruse for Epstein and Maxwell to sexually abuse her and other underage girls, some of whom were trafficked to other influential people, from 1999 to 2002.
Maxwell settled the case before trial, resulting in several millions paid to Giuffre, sources have told the Herald. Maxwell, now an environmentalist, has denied all the allegations. Epstein's attorney, Martin G. Weinberg, has not responded to emails and calls made by the Herald seeking comment.
But in an op-ed letter to The New York Times last week, Weinberg and three of Epstein's other lawyers -- including Kenneth Starr, known as the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton -- denied that Epstein ever ran a sex trafficking operation.
"The number of young women involved in the investigation has been vastly exaggerated, there was no 'international sex-trafficking operation' and there was never evidence that Mr. Epstein 'hosted sex parties' at his home," the lawyers wrote.
Lawyers for attorney Alan Dershowitz and conservative social media blogger Michael Cernovich, two other parties to the appeal, also argued to unseal the entire case file. Dershowitz's lawyer, Andrew G. Celli Jr., wanted the court to release three documents immediately, saying they were necessary to clear the name of his client, who has been accused of being involved in Epstein's crimes.
Dershowitz was among a team of lawyers who represented Epstein when he came under criminal investigation in Palm Beach in 2005. Epstein was accused by more than three dozen girls, most of them 13 to 16, of luring them to his mansion to give him massages that turned into sex acts. He then used those same girls to recruit more girls over a period of several years, court and police records show.
Giuffre said she was directed by Epstein to have sex with Dershowitz when she was underage. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard University and constitutional law scholar, claims the case file contains documents that will prove that she is lying.
Giuffre's lawyer, Paul Cassell, however, told the appeals court that the case file will establish that she is telling the truth.
In 2008, Epstein received a controversial plea deal that gave him and an untold number of others who were not named immunity from federal prosecution. The non-prosecution agreement, brokered by former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, is now the focus of a Justice Department investigation.
WaPo
Acosta, now Trump's secretary of labor, has said that the deal was approved at the highest levels of the agency.
A federal judge ruled on Feb. 22 that the deal was illegal because Acosta kept it from Epstein's victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act, a federal law that grants victims certain rights, including the right to be told about a plea deal and to appear at sentencing.
Miami Herald
A Miami Herald investigation, "Perversion of Justice," showed that Acosta and other prosecutors deliberately kept Epstein's victims in the dark so that they could not appear at his sentencing and possibly derail the deal. The sentencing judge was also misled about the scope of Epstein's crimes and how many girls he abused, records indicate.
The U.S. attorney in Atlanta has been assigned to review the non-prosecution agreement in the wake of the Feb. 22 ruling. Epstein's victims want the deal thrown out -- which would set a precedent.
As part of the deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to two prostitution charges in state court.
Epstein's lawyers indicated that they intend to fight any effort to void his immunity agreement.
"Mr. Epstein has gone to prison and made enormous monetary settlements relying on his negotiated agreement. He is entitled to finality like every other defendant," the lawyers said.
Epstein did not go to prison, but served 13 months in a private section of the Palm Beach County jail, where he was allowed to leave for 12 hours a day to go to his office in West Palm Beach under a work release program that is normally not granted to convicted sex offenders.

NY attorney general subpoenas Deutsche Bank, Investors Bank for documents on Trump Organization projects

Texto completo: Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank were subpoenaed by the New York attorney general’s office, prompted by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s public testimony to Congress last month.

New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office issued the subpoenas late Monday pressing for documents related to the financing of four Trump Organization projects, along with an attempt to purchase the Buffalo Bills of the NFL in 2014, according to the New York Times.

The inquiry, which is a civil investigation, seeks records from Deutsche Bank regarding loan applications, mortgages, lines of credit, and other transactions related to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., the Trump National Doral near Miami, and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago.

Trump conducted business with a small U.S.-based branch of Deutsche Bank, which loaned Trump more than $100 million for the Doral golf resort, and $170 million for the Trump International Hotel in Washington.

The subpoena also requested Deutsche Bank provide documents from President Trump’s unsuccessful attempt to purchase the Buffalo Bills, where he provided the bank with basic personal financial statements.

Separately, investigators asked Investors Bank for documents related to Trump Park Avenue, a project Investors Bank backed.

The impetus for the moves stems back to Cohen's testimony last month before the House Oversight Committee in which he said Trump exaggerated his assets in financial statements. Cohen, who is set to serve a three-year sentence for campaign finance crimes and lying to Congress, shared copies of statements he said were sent to Deutsche Bank.

Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank declined to comment to the Times, and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.

James has signaled on multiple occasions that she intended to delve into Trump’s business dealings. “I will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn,” she said when she was elected in November.

How to stop fighting about money in your marriage

Texto completo: Nobody wakes up on their wedding day and thinks, I bet we'll be divorced by this time next year. At least, I hope not.
Most of us have the highest hopes and dreams for our marriages. Sometimes, though, after a few years, reality sets in — in the form of debt, credit cards and financial infidelity — and we give up hope. That's why money problems are a leading cause of divorce in America, and it's why I'm so passionate about helping people take control of their money.
When I speak at events or talk to couples across the country, I hear time and time again that money is at the root of so much marital stress. It's amazing how appearance, status and stuff can take over our lives and ruin our relationships if we aren't careful. The good news is that there is an antidote. It all comes down to common sense.
Whether you're just dating or are already an "old married couple," here are a few tips to make money a blessing in your relationship — not a cause of stress and fights.
Work together, not separate How can you be on the same page about money if you have two separate bank accounts? Didn't the pastor at your wedding ceremony say, "You will become one"? Keeping your accounts separate is one of the most effective ways to completely wreck your financial life — and maybe even your marriage. If you want to win with money in your marriage, you must be on the same team.
Make a routine At the end of every month, sit down with your spouse for your monthly budget meeting. Plan out how you will spend every dollar for the coming month — groceries, gas, bills, everything. And don't forget to budget a small percentage of "fun" money!
Stay involved It's okay if one of you is in charge of budgeting and paying bills, but you both need to communicate and know what's going on. My husband and I use the budgeting app EveryDollar, because it's easy to use and gives us both visibility into what's going on with our money.
Be willing to say "no" If it's not in the budget, then it's not in the budget. That might mean you can't have the latest iPhone or designer shoes. Remember, it's only no for now. Once you're debt-free, you'll have more freedom to afford the things you really want. My dad, Dave Ramsey, taught me to "Live like no one else, so later, you can live like no one else."
Don't compare your marriage to anyone else's You may think other couples have it all together based on what you see on social media, but their marriage may very well be stressed. Maybe they have no margin with their money, because their paycheck comes in and goes right back out in payments. Their "perfect life" may be just one money fight away from divorce. Stay focused on your marriage and your goals.
If you and your spouse are struggling right now, change won't come overnight. But you've got to start somewhere. Getting started is the hardest part, but once you start those conversations with your spouse, it will change your marriage. If you're struggling with how to approach it, check out my list of six money conversation starters to help.
So, sit down for a heart-to-heart with your spouse, be honest, and be proactive. Don't let your marriage fall apart because you're not paying attention to money issues.

Texto completo: EAST LANSING - Ellis Hay knew one of answers had to be "Bea Arthur."
"She is only Bea to be kind of famous enough for a crossword that I could find," he said.
The 2016 graduate of East Lansing High School made his New York Times debut March 4 with the publication of his B-themed crossword puzzle.
Hay began work on the puzzle nearly a year ago. The Temple University music composition junior fittingly used music terms and homophones as well.
Clue topics ranged from pop culture, as in "Backstreet Boys member ____ Dorough," to political, "Brooklyn-born Supreme Court Justice."
It took Hay more than a week to finish the puzzle. He submitted it last spring and learned in July that it would be published. The puzzle ran in the New York Times on Monday.
"My mom was excited to tell everyone she knows about it," he said.
The former quiz bowl team member said he can usually complete the New York Times crossword Monday through Thursday. The puzzle gets increasingly challenging as the week progresses. He can sometimes complete the Friday and Saturday puzzles, though not always.
Hay isn't a lifelong crossword puzzle fiend. He started in earnest in college and has submitted a few puzzles to the Times.
"I haven't submitted any in a few months, but, probably during the summer, I can focus a little bit more on puzzles."

The rise, set and rise of daylight saving time; Why we spring ahead so it stays light later has to do with war - and hobbies

Texto completo: As you grumble about your lost hour of sleep this weekend, just remember: Don't blame Benjamin Franklin. Despite legend, the nerdiest founding father did not invent daylight saving time. (He suggested cities wake residents earlier on summer mornings by the sound of cannon fire, so perhaps it's best he didn't get his way.)
No, the reason you may need an extra cup of coffee Sunday is because of World War I. And golf.
Changing clocks in the summer was first proposed around the turn of the 20th century by two guys who came up with it separately, though for the same reason. New Zealander George Hudson and Englishman William Willett both wanted more time after work in the summer for their sunlight-required pastimes - in Willett's case, hitting the links, and in Hudson's, collecting bugs. And really, why let time itself keep you from your hobbies?
Neither men's proposals gained much traction, however, until the outbreak of the World War I. The Germans were the first to do it, on April 30, 1916, as a way to save on coal-powered lighting in factories. British politicians moved to follow suit two days later and had set their clocks forward by the end of May. Most other European countries weren't far behind.
Time was a little slower to change in the United States, which did not join the war until 1917. Stockbrokers and manufacturers made a flurry of patriotic posters in support of daylight saving. But railroad companies, afraid confusion around the time change could cause a deadly crash, were adamantly against it. So were farmers, who worked by the sun anyway and did not want interactions with the clock-keeping world to get screwy.
"If you're a farmer, you can't just go work an hour early, because you need the sunlight to see what you're doing, especially in those days," says David Prerau, author of "Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time." This was especially hard on dairy farmers, who would have to start milking cows in the dark to meet train schedules for delivery.
"Plus, the sun, beside giving light, it gives heat, and it drives off the dew on a lot of the things that have to be harvested. And you can't harvest things when they're wet," Prerau says.
The stockbrokers won; a bill passed Congress and President Woodrow Wilson signed it. But the first nationwide time change suffered from some seriously unfortunate scheduling. It was March 31, 1918 - Easter Sunday. Newspapers published instructions on how and when to set clocks forward, and churches posted signs out front warning parishioners.
The Chicago Tribune called it "a lie that will benefit you and your country," which is a pretty weird way to put it.
At 2 a.m., a reception at Madison Square Garden marked the occasion, and in the U.S. Capitol, a few senators stayed awake with the Sergeant-at-Arms to reset the Ohio Clock.
The next day, things went surprisingly smoothly. "Some churchgoers were an hour late, but no baseball games were called on account of darkness," reported The New York Times. "Those looking to the sky at nightfall expecting to see a miracle were disappointed."
By the next year, the war had ended, and many thought daylight saving time should end with it, Prerau says. Lawmakers representing farmers introduced nearly two dozen bills to repeal it; one Mississippi congressman urged, "Repeal the law and have the clocks proclaim God's time and tell the truth!" A New Jersey congressman who supported it told people to think of the veterans coming home from the war, "Are they not deserving of the extra hour of recreation?"
A repeal sailed through the House, cleared the Senate and landed on Wilson's desk. He vetoed it, saying it could cause an economic downturn.
A vote to override the president's veto failed, but haters were unbowed. They passed another repeal bill, which the president vetoed again. But this time, they were better prepared, getting the two-thirds majority in the House and Senate needed to override the president. (All of this happened in a month; Congress used to be productive!) Daylight saving time was dead.
So if they got rid of it, then why are you late to brunch now?
Cities like New York and Pittsburgh passed their own daylight saving time laws, and it was brought back nationally for a little while during World War II. As The Post's Michael S. Rosenwald has written, all the time laws among cities and states got so messed up that in Iowa, there were 23 different daylight saving dates, depending on what town you were in. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson finally smoothed it out, making daylight saving time the law of the land.

Texto completo: Today is Saturday, March 9, the 68th day of 2019. There are 297 days left in the year.
Today's Highlight in History:
On March 9, 1933, Congress, called into special session by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, began its "hundred days" of enacting New Deal legislation.
On this date:
In 1796, the future emperor of the French, Napoleon Bonaparte, married Josephine de Beauharnais (boh-ahr-NAY'). (The couple later divorced.)In 1841, the U.S. Supreme Court, in United States v. The Amistad, ruled 7-1 in favor of a group of illegally enslaved Africans who were captured off the U.S. coast after seizing control of a Spanish schooner, La Amistad; the justices ruled that the Africans should be set free.In 1916, more than 400 Mexican raiders led by Pancho Villa attacked Columbus, New Mexico, killing 18 Americans. During the First World War, Germany declared war on Portugal.In 1935, the animated cartoon character Porky Pig first appeared in the Warner Bros. animated short "I Haven't Got a Hat.In 1945, during World War II, U.S. B-29 bombers began launching incendiary bomb attacks against Tokyo, resulting in an estimated 100,000 deaths.In 1954, CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow critically reviewed Wisconsin Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy's anti-communism campaign on "See It Now.In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court, in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, raised the standard for public officials to prove they'd been libeled in their official capacity by news organizations.In 1976, a cable car in the Italian ski resort of Cavalese fell some 700 feet to the ground when a supporting line snapped, killing 43 people.In 1977, about a dozen armed Hanafi Muslims invaded three buildings in Washington, D.C., killing one person and taking more than 130 hostages. (The siege ended two days later.)In 1989, the Senate rejected President George H.W. Bush's nomination of John Tower to be defense secretary by a vote of 53-47. (The next day, Bush tapped Wyoming Rep. Dick Cheney, who went on to win unanimous Senate approval.)In 1997, gangsta rapper The Notorious B.I.G. (Christopher Wallace) was killed in a still-unsolved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles; he was 24.Ten years ago: President Barack Obama lifted George W. Bush-era limits on using federal dollars for embryonic stem cell research.Five years ago: The search continued for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 that had gone missing the day before while over the South China Sea with 239 people on board. (The plane was never found.)One year ago: A combat veteran who'd been expelled from a treatment program at a California veterans home fatally shot three mental health workers there before taking his own life. Weeks after the shooting that left 17 people dead at a Florida high school, Gov. Rick Scott signed a school-safety bill that included new restrictions on guns, prompting a lawsuit from the National Rifle Association; the bill raised to 21 the minimum age to buy rifles and created a program enabling some teachers and other school employees to carry guns. Martin Shkreli, the former pharmaceutical CEO who'd been vilified for jacking up the price of a lifesaving drug, was sentenced in New York to seven years in prison for securities fraud. A Kentucky neighbor of U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, Rene Boucher, pleaded guilty to a federal charge for tackling the lawmaker in an attack his attorney said was triggered by a dispute over lawn maintenance; Boucher served a 30-day prison sentence.

Trump Says Cohen Asked for a Pardon; Cohen Denies It

Texto completo: President Trump claimed on Friday that his former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, "directly" asked him for a pardon, a sharp escalation of a fight over the veracity of Mr. Cohen's testimony last week to the House Oversight and Reform Committee.
Mr. Trump made the claim on Twitter, referring to Mr. Cohen's testimony to Congress in which Mr. Cohen said the president lied to the public about business interests in Russia, lied to reporters about stolen Democratic emails and told Mr. Cohen to lie about hush payments to cover up sexual misconduct.
Mr. Cohen quickly responded in a tweet of his own, calling Mr. Trump's assertions "lies."

Mr. Cohen was referring to two women who had claimed to have had affairs with the president, and who were paid to keep quiet about them during the 2016 presidential campaign.
The exchange was the latest example of how the potential for pardons -- whether hinted at by Mr. Trump and his team or sought after by people caught up in the investigations swirling around him -- has become a more public flash point.
The question of whether Mr. Cohen sought a pardon has been a subject of contention since his testimony last week, when he said under oath that he had never sought one.
His current lawyer, Lanny J. Davis, acknowledged this week that Mr. Cohen's previous lawyer had inquired about a pardon soon after the F.B.I. searched Mr. Cohen's home and office in April 2018. But Mr. Davis said that inquiry came about because the president's team had "dangled" the possibility of one in implicit statements.
Mr. Cohen has told associates that the signals from Mr. Trump about a pardon date back more than a year, soon after Mr. Cohen had publicly disclosed making what he said at the time were unreimbursed payments out of his own pocket in 2016 to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film star who had claimed to have had an affair with the president a decade earlier.
Mr. Cohen has told the associates that last March, before his office and homes were raided, he had dinner with Mr. Trump, and that he and the president talked on the phone after the raids in April. After those conversations, Mr. Cohen told the associates that he anticipated he would be given a pardon or some form of protection if he would remain silent about having been reimbursed by Mr. Trump for making the payments, according to people told of the discussions.
Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump were part of a formal agreement in which their lawyers worked together to review documents that the F.B.I. had seized to determine what could be declared off limits to law enforcement officials because of attorney-client privilege. But that joint effort ended in July 2018, as Mr. Trump's aides balked at paying parts of Mr. Cohen's legal bills.
The exchange between the two men on Friday highlighted the stakes for both in establishing whether Mr. Cohen was credible in the accusations he has made against the president in his congressional testimony and in providing information to federal prosecutors. Republicans and Mr. Trump's allies have noted that in the testimony he said he had never sought a pardon. At the same time, Mr. Trump has often said things that are not true, including statements related to his knowledge of the payments to Ms. Daniels.
The questions about the credibility of Mr. Cohen's public testimony stands in contrast with how some prosecutors working with him have described him. A memo to the federal court judge overseeing Mr. Cohen's case in Manhattan from the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, said that Mr. Cohen had been truthful and provided useful information in connection with their work. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan were more questioning about the timing and motivation for Mr. Cohen's help, but they also have used information he provided that they were able to corroborate.
The volleys between the two men on Friday also highlighted the continued questions about Mr. Trump's pardon power and how he might use it as Mr. Mueller wraps up his investigation, as other federal prosecutors and Democrats in Congress intensify theirs and expand their scope into the president's business career.
The New York Times reported in March 2018 that Mr. Trump's previous lead lawyer, John Dowd, had raised the possibility of pardons with lawyers for Paul Manafort, the president's former campaign chairman, and Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, after they had been charged in cases brought by Mr. Mueller's team.
Mr. Trump was asked Friday about the possibility of a pardon for Mr. Manafort. Mr. Manafort was sentenced to 47 months in prison on Thursday in one of two cases brought against him by Mr. Mueller's prosecutors.
"I haven't discussed it," Mr. Trump said, referring to a pardon for Mr. Manafort.
Speaking to reporters outside the White House before leaving on a trip to Alabama and Florida, Mr. Trump elaborated in his comments about what he said were Mr. Cohen's discussions about a pardon.
"It was a stone-cold lie," Mr. Trump said about Mr. Cohen's claims that he had never sought a pardon. "And he's lied about a lot of things, but when he lied about the pardon, that was really a lie."
Mr. Trump continued: "His lawyers said that they went to my lawyers and asked for pardons. And I can go a step above that, but I won't do it now."
Mr. Trump's current lead lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has said the president is not focusing on pardons right now because it would not be appropriate -- but he has also left open the possibility that the president might invoke that power down the road.

For Democrats to win, they must avoid leftist mythmaking

Texto completo: At 29, with her Puerto Rican heritage, megawatt smile and 3 million-plus Twitter followers, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embodies the rising power of younger female nonwhite digital natives in American politics. If Hillary Rodham Clinton, or HRC, reflects the past, AOC foreshadows the future.
But as a role model for Democrats who desperately want to defeat Donald Trump, AOC is not A-OK. She represents New York City, one of the most liberal cities in the country, and as a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, her radical views on issues like "Medicare-for-all" and a "Green New Deal" fall far outside her party’s mainstream — let alone the national consensus. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 18 percent viewed the term "socialist" favorably.
"There is, without a doubt, a myth that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez somehow represents the narrative of Democratic primary voters in the country," Democratic pollster John Anzalone told The Washington Post. "Almost half of them identify themselves as moderates or conservatives."
Moreover, she reflects an intolerant impulse among Democratic leftists to purge the party of moderate heretics. After 26 of her fellow House members voted with Republicans to make it harder for undocumented immigrants to purchase guns, AOC threatened to put them "on a list" for primary challenges.
"Since when is it OK to put you on a Nixonian list?" Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, co-chair of the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus, protested in the Post. "We need to have a big tent in our party, or we won’t keep the House or win the White House."
The myth Anzalone identifies has bedeviled the Democratic Party since the death of Franklin Roosevelt 74 years ago. Liberals do form a critical component of the party’s "big tent" coalition, and no Democratic nominee can win the White House without their support. That’s why the far-too-late and far-too-grudging endorsement of Clinton by Bernie Sanders (or BS) was so damaging.
That said, Democrats cannot capture the presidency or either branch of Congress by lurching leftward. A candidate in the AOC/BS mold would be a hero in New York, California and Massachusetts — and a disaster in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which handed Trump the presidency in 2016 and will be critical again next year.
Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania, stressed this point to The New York Times: "The more we have presidential candidates or newly elected congresspeople talking about the Green New Deal, talking about ‘Medicare-for-all,’ talking about socialism, the more that plays into the Trump campaign’s hands."
Christopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, added: "If you want to lock up Pennsylvania for a Democrat, the more moderate Democrats are the key."
The numbers support them. A Gallup poll in January reported that 35 percent of Americans call themselves conservatives, the same number that identify as moderates. Only 26 percent are self-described liberals, the same portion who chose that label in 2016 exit polls.
It’s true that within the Democrats’ ranks, the percentage of liberals is rising, hitting 51 percent this year according to Gallup. But pragmatists still dominate the party. Fifty-four percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the party to "move closer to the center" while 41 percent "would rather it shift further left."
The same tension between purists and pragmatists is playing out in the House, where the AOC types are calling for the rapid impeachment of the president. But Democratic leaders are taking a much slower approach, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, insisting that impeachment must meet a "very high bar."
No president has ever been removed through impeachment (although Richard Nixon probably would have been the first, had he not resigned). The bar is and should be "very high."
But denying a president a second term through the ballot box is quite common, and in fact happened three times in five elections between 1976 and 1992. That bar is much lower and well within the reach of Democrats if they can avoid the mythmaking of leftists like AOC and BS and focus on political reality.

Texto completo: One town justice went into a home at the center of a mortgage dispute, took photographs of the house's interior, and posted them on a Facebook page with comments berating the home's conditions.
Another town justice didn't mechanically record any court proceedings for more than eight years, despite a requirement and the technical equipment to do so. He also didn't hold a hearing on a small claims matter before him for 17 months.
Yet another town justice spent seven years ignoring thousands of "unidentified" dollars in his court's bank account, even after twice being questioned about its original source by the state's comptroller.
These three cases, all of which involve judges disciplined by the New York's judicial watchdog agency, have something in common: None of the judges who committed the ethical lapses is a trained lawyer.
In its latest annual report, the state watchdog agency, the Commission on Judicial Conduct, repeats what has become a common refrain: While law-trained judges and non-lawyer judges all run afoul of ethical standards and even the law each year, the most common lapses come from non-lawyers who are on the bench.
Town and village justices do not have to be lawyers, and can hear no crimes above a misdemeanor level. In New York, City Court and upper-level judges must be lawyers.
Town and village justices who are not lawyers are "more likely than law-trained justices" to violate legal courtroom norms and mandates, the commission says in its annual report, released this week and covering 2018 disciplinary cases.
Recommending additional ethics training Because of this, the commission is recommending additional enhanced ethics training for non-lawyer judges at the town and village levels. Though the commission and state Office of Court Administration have taken significant steps in recent years to help judges who do not have a law degree, there is more work to be done, the commission maintains. (OCA is the administrative agency of the state's court system.)
"It's the commission's view that, in addition to all of this activity, further improvements need be made because the statistical record over 40 years shows that town and village court justices, and particularly the non-lawyer town and village justices, are more likely to get into ethical trouble than the rest of the state's judiciary," commission administrator Robert Tembeckjian said Wednesday.
The commission investigates complaints against judges and metes out discipline.
According to the report, over the past decade about 20 percent of complaints received by the commission were against town and village justices, while 59 percent of its investigations and 72 percent of its disciplinary decisions — or 120 out of 167 — involved those judges.
Of those 120 disciplinary decisions over that decade, 90 of them — or 75 percent — involved non-lawyer judges, according to the report.
Still, Tembeckjian said, the non-lawyer judges aren't alone.
"There is virtually no kind of ethical trouble that town and village justices have gotten themselves into that full-time law justices have not gotten themselves into," he said.
In fact, in Monroe County, the commission disciplinary decisions over the past decade have involved judges who are lawyers. Last year, the commission removed Rochester City Court Judge Leticia Astacio after her drunken driving conviction and commission decisions that she tried to use her judgeship as leverage during the arrest and that she had instances of poor judgment while on the bench.
The Court of Appeals upheld the decision. Only one other judge was removed from the bench last year — New York City Civil Court Judge Terrence O'Connor, who had a lengthy history of questionable statements and actions from the bench and who refused to attend his disciplinary hearings.
Often non-lawyer judges can be ex-cops Still, the statistics do show that non-lawyer judges are more likely to exercise poor judgment. Twelve town and village judges — seven of them non-lawyers — agreed last year to leave office because of disciplinary findings.
Just last week two Wayne County justices were disciplined by the commission; neither are lawyers,
Huron Town Court Justice Kathy Wachtman was censured after denying a defendant a lawyer at a preliminary hearing, and Palmyra Town Court Justice William Abbott was disciplined after he threatened to slow criminal arraignments if police did not immediately help him recover keys he'd locked inside of his car.
In Monroe County, town and village justices receive training beyond that initiated by state court officials, according to Irondequoit Town Justice Joseph Genier, who is not a lawyer and has been a judge for 26 years.
The county Magistrates Association, an organization of town and village justices, provides monthly training at its meetings, including updates on legal changes and how they might impact courts, said Genier, who was in police work with the Monroe County Sheriff's Office for 20 years before his judicial election.
"I think a majority of the non-lawyer judges in Monroe County are ex-police officers," he said. "They not only bring the background on legal stuff but they bring common sense from the street. They've seen the outside world to a degree sometimes more than attorneys have."
Since 2006, after a series from The New York Times highlighted serious ethical missteps by town and village judges across the state, the "Legislature and the Office of Court Administration made a serious commitment to assistance with town and village courts," Tembeckjian said.
Officials enhanced a once-a-year training program, provided equipment to ensure court proceedings are recorded, and also created uniform software to ease financial record-keeping.
These steps were taken to try to combat the most prevalent ethical issues in the courts — among them laggard and unreliable fiduciary records, failure to record arraignments, and special treatment for family and friends of judges.
While the statistics show that non-lawyer judges stray from ethical guidelines more than their legal-trained counterparts, there is no move afoot to change the system. There are 22 states that allow non-lawyers to be judges, but many of those, unlike New York, permit the intervention of a lawyer-judge in a misdemeanor case if the defendant chooses.
"I'm not aware of any proposal" to prohibit non-lawyers from being judges, Tembeckjian said.

Texto completo: "If I'm going to do wedding ceremonies for straight people then, I feel called that I'm going to do them, want to do them, for same-gender people."
Rev. Mark Thompson
LANSING — The Rev. Mark Thompson is openly gay. He serves Lansing Central Methodist Church.
And after the decision last week by the United Methodist Church to continue its ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy, he is speaking up about his sexual orientation and continuing to protest the church's position.
Thompson, who said he is celibate, is the only active openly gay Methodist minister in the state, according to the state's top Methodist leader, Bishop David Bard. There are more than 800 Methodist churches with 130,000 members in Michigan.
"While our Book of Discipline limits the ordination of gay and lesbian persons, it has always allowed gay and lesbian persons who are not in relationships to be ordained and appointed," Bard said in a written statement to the Lansing State Journal.
Thompson said he will perform same-sex weddings and is discussing with his congregation whether those ceremonies can take place in the church in defiance of church law.
"I'm very clear. I've thought about it, prayed about it. If I'm going to do wedding ceremonies for straight people then, I feel called that I'm going to do them, want to do them, for same-gender people," he said.
As of now, he will only do those outside the church. He declined to say if he's already presided at same-sex weddings. Same-sex marriage was ruled legal by the United States Supreme Court in 2015.
The Methodist General Conference met in St. Louis last week. More than 800 conference members from around the world voted 53 percent to 47 percent to keep the traditional ban in place and strengthen punishment for violating it.
Many Methodists in the U.S., including Thompson, supported a "One Church Plan" that would have allowed individual congregations to decide whether to allow gay clergy and same-sex weddings.
Thompson, 61, was already an ordained pastor and married with a family when he came out at age 50. He said he's able to keep his job in the church by remaining celibate.
"I've not made a big issue out of it, but, currently, because of the General Conference situation, I've been speaking out more. I want people to know that I support them, whether they be allies or be LGBTQ people," he said.
Thompson said he was at his last church, Faith United Church in Grand Rapids, for two years before he told the congregation that he was gay. When he was appointed to Central Methodist in Lansing, a church that dates back to 1888, he asked that he be introduced as openly gay. That was 18 months ago.
A few church members protested and left, he said, but mostly the 230-member congregation accepted him. A monthly support group meets at the church for LGBTQ people and their allies.
Thompson said he grew up in a small community near Midland. He knew at age 10 that he was gay but said he didn't have the words for it.
"I kept it hidden. I didn't want to even look in the mirror and say I was gay," he said.
After he was ordained in 1987, he led Methodist churches around the state. He and his former wife raised three children, who are now adults.
Thompson attended the General Conference meeting last week as a protester, not a delegate.
He wore his rainbow stole, a long ecclesiastical scarf that signals ordination, and shook hands with delegates as they arrived from around the world.
When it became clear that the conference was only going to take up what was called the Traditional Plan, Thompson left in shock and in pain before the final vote. He took 14 hours to make the eight-hour drive, stopping to sleep in his car and hurting.
On Sunday, he shared his experiences at the conference with the congregation but also read a letter from Bishop David Bard, the leader of the church in Michigan. Bard acknowledged the pain of LGBTQ church members and asked for calm. The General Conference's decision is under review of a church judicial body. Bard said he atttended Thompson's Sunday service as a show of support for the pastor.
"I live in the Lansing area and attend area churches any time I have an open Sunday. Following General Conference, I knew that LGBTQ persons were especially in pain, as were those hoping for more space for LGBTQ persons within The United Methodist Church. In attending Lansing Central, I wanted to be among some who might be especially hurting, including Rev. Thompson," Bard said.
Thompson said members of his church will soon begin discussing whether to defy the ban on same-sex weddings. And Thompson is joining other pastors in an upcoming ad in the New York Times stating their opposition to the Traditional Plan. He also joined a gathering of more than 500 like-minded Methodists Sunday evening in Royal Oak for a healing service.
Thompson said he's uncertain what will happen to the church he's served for more than three decades.
"We just know it can't stay the way it is now," he said

The wall won't matter so long as the asylum loophole goes unfixed

Texto completo: It’s not until you get eight paragraphs into a new Wall Street Journal report about illegal aliens storming the U.S. southern border, overwhelming agents and hospitals, that you find the key: our abhorrent asylum law.

More border wall construction is crucial in defending America from an endless flood of unknown people coming from Guatemala (poverty stricken), El Salvador (overrun by the violent MS-13 gang), and Honduras (completely destitute). But forget about saving American schools and neighborhoods from these broken countries so long as we have an immigration system that says anyone who sets foot on American soil has instant legal protection to stay.

The Journal reported that for the past five months, illegal border crossings “were the sharpest evidence yet that, despite [President] Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, the flow of migrants is only growing.”

The report quotes Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, saying, “This situation is not sustainable. The system is well beyond capacity and remains at the breaking point.”

The New York Times’ own report laughably describes the crisis as not a matter of a broken immigration system draining money that might otherwise go to benefit the lives of actual U.S. citizens (imagine that), but as simply a “challenge” to overcome by dumping more money into free child care and medical attention for any foreigner who shows up wanting it.

“The main problem is not one of uncontrolled masses scaling the fences,” wrote the Times, “but a humanitarian challenge created as thousands of migrant families surge into remote areas where the administration has so far failed to devote sufficient resources to care for them, as is required under the law.”

That reference to "the law" is the the asylum monstrosity we’re living with. Is anyone asking why we can’t change it?

The Rio Grande Valley sector in Texas is most affected by this gaping hole in our system. Although agents there are demanding more border wall, construction cannot take place on the actual border, which is the Rio Grande. Natural geography has it so that anyone illegally entering from Mexico simply floats a short distance across the width of the river, hits the U.S. bank and finds an agent to make a meritless asylum claim. They come by the hundreds, unabated, day in and day out.

Data provided to me by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said that in 2018, nearly 70 percent of asylum claims were made by people from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Though just 10 percent of asylum seekers from those places (countries ravaged by gang violence and poverty) were granted legal protection to remain in the country as a refugee, 90 percent of those who pass an initial first interview with authorities were simply released into the country after they promised to appear in court.

According to the Center for Immigration Studies, 70,000 people from Central America applied for asylum last year. You can expect up to 40 percent of them not to show up for their court date, meaning that as many as 30,000 people from these broken places have simply vanished into the U.S.

The actual text of the asylum law says that people with a legitimate claim must be “unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”

Notice that there's nothing in there about “fleeing your awful country because it’s poor and overrun by gang members.” Nonetheless, thanks to the manner in which judges have interpreted this law, everyone south of our border knows if they just claim asylum, they can stay.

President Trump can make all the noise he wants about a wall, but so long as the asylum hole goes unfixed, it will barely matter.

Democrats accuse Interior of helping companies evade offshore drilling safety rules

Texto completo: Democrats criticized Interior Department officials Wednesday for allowing companies to deviate hundreds of times from Obama-era offshore oil and gas drilling safety rules established after BP’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Democrats questioning Interior officials at a House Natural Resources subcommittee hearing said Interior’s granting of nearly 1,700 waivers to companies over 20 months to the Well Control Rule demonstrates the Trump administration’s bias in favor of oil and gas companies.

Interior’s granting of the waivers, which was reported by Politico last month based on a public records request, comes as the Trump administration has proposed weakening the offshore drilling safety rules in question.

“It has dumbfounded our entire delegation after we put these rules in place to see them shredded to Swiss cheese right now,” said Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., of his fellow Florida lawmakers, all of whom oppose offshore drilling. “In the meantime, the administration has a duty to comply with current rules to make sure we don't see 1,700 exemptions that could fail to protect Florida and other Gulf states from another BP oil spill.”

The original Well Control Rule, issued in 2016 by Interior’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, or BSEE, set minimum standards for drilling, well design, and equipment maintenance in hopes of preventing another major oil spill. Interior officials say the proposed changes reflects technical modifications sought by the industry, which oil and natural gas groups say are modest and meant to align with industry standards and are not a rollback of the regulation.

One proposed change to the rule would eliminate a requirement that BSEE must certify the third-party vendors who inspect offshore oil equipment, such as blowout preventers, for safety.

The 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill was caused by BP's lack of maintenance of the blowout valve. The device is meant to prevent a surge in pressure from causing catastrophic explosions and spills.

According to Politico, the most common waivers to the Obama-era rule granted by Interior were intended to allow companies to veer from stricter rules for blowout preventers.

Interior officials, however, defended the granting of waivers, saying the exceptions are explicitly allowed in the Well Control Rule. Doug Morris, the chief of BSEE’s Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs, disputed the term "waivers," saying the agency actually granted “alternative compliance requests” which are reviewed carefully by regional offices of the offshore safety agency to ensure the proposed action remains safe.

Republicans also defended Interior’s actions, saying companies have sought ways to work around the safety rules because they are overly burdensome.

“It’s evidence that the rule clearly imposes unrealistic requirements and waivers are necessary,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla.

Rep. Alan Lowenthal, D-Calif., the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, suggested the waivers and Interior’s revisiting of the safety rules show the agency favors the oil and gas industry. He criticized BSEE Director Scott Angelle for not complying with his request to testify at the hearing and instead sending career officials.

“The director in charge [of BSEE] is supposed to be the nation’s top offshore cop, to hold industry accountable for lapses in safety and environmental protection,” Lowenthal said. “Instead, Director Angelle has referred to the oil and gas industry as partners and encouraged them to call him on his cell phone so it won't generate public records.”

Lowenthal and Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, sent a letter to Angelle Wednesday reiterating a prior request of his phone records. They cited a New York Times report that Angelle offered his cell phone number to attendees of an energy conference in 2017 so conversations with industry officials could not be subject to public records requests.

Texto completo: Carlos Slim perdió $3,000 millones de dólares entre 2018 y 2019, pero eso fue como “quitarle un pelo a un gato”, ya que el empresario no bajó en su posición del ranking de Forbes sobre los más ricos.
La revista señala que Slim tiene una fortuna de $64,000 millones de dólares , cuando en el mismo mes de 2018 ascendía a $67,000 millones.
Parecería que eso lo haría perder posiciones, pero en realidad ganó dos lugares, al ocupar la posición 5 este año.
Slim es el mexicano más rico, de acuerdo con el conteo de Forbes, la cual destaca que él y su familia controlan América Móvil, la mayor empresa de telecomunicaciones telefonía celular de América Latina.
También que con socios de telecomunicaciones extranjeros, Slim compró una participación en Telmex, la única compañía telefónica de México, en 1990.
Además de poseer participaciones en empresas mexicanas de construcción, bienes de consumo, minería e inmobiliarias y el 17% de The New York Times.
En los últimos meses, Slim se enfrentó públicamente al presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador por la cancelación del Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de México (NAIM), donde su empresa tiene alta participación.

CAP TIMES MEMBERSHIP HAS REWARDS - SOME TANGIBLE, SOME EMOTIONAL; EDITOR'S COLUMN

Texto completo: Arecent headline in the media section of "The Week" magazine was blunt but accurate: "Apple wants half the news business."
It explained how the tech giant was "going for the jugular," as the Columbia Journalism Review columnist put it, with a subscription model that will pool the content from dozens of news sources into a single app. It will charge $10 per month, in theory a paid-content play that will help news organizations be less reliant on the vagaries of advertising revenue.
But alas, Apple wants to keep 50 percent of the money consumers spend to get all of that reporting and editing and journalistic ingenuity.
Why? Because it can.
Apple has the technical wherewithal to act as a conduit in a manner that all but the largest outlets the Washington Post and New York Times, for example lack. The columnist calls it a "Faustian bargain," much like those that allowed Facebook and Google to prosper on the backs or at least the work of real journalists in exchange for enhanced online traffic.
If you care about the future of local journalism, which, if you are reading this seems likely, there is something you can do right now to help: Become a first-wave member of the Cap Times.
For the first time ever, we are announcing a membership program with tiered rates that will bring you closer to what we consider to be a jewel of local media. Your membership will help sustain a band of the finest journalists I have worked with in my decades in the profession.
As a refresher, the Cap Times celebrated its 100th anniversary in December 2017 with a birthday party that attracted hundreds to the Monona Terrace Convention Center.
It was a joyful evening that celebrated our truly homegrown Madison institution.
We honored William T. Evjue, who founded the newspaper in a small storefront on King Street to fiercely advocate for progressive causes around social justice and against unjust wars in the spirit of his hero, Robert M. "Fighting Bob" La Follette.
Through time, Evjue's paper became a place for readers to learn about Madison. It also became home to highly professional, objective reporters doing investigative stories, covering institutions such as the Capitol and city hall, but also reflecting popular culture.
Those traditions are alive and well, thanks in part to our optimistic and versatile staff of journalists, many of whom were born two decades or more after Mr. Evjue's 1970 death.
Our founder's death, it turns out, created an important third pillar of the Cap Times of 2019: It is a source of amazing philanthropy for Madison's most deserving causes.
Twice a year, the Evjue Foundation board chooses from among more than 100 grant applications and gives more than $2 million annually. That totals more than $60 million since Mr. Evjue's will created the foundation to benefit the city he loved, in particular to benefit children and to pursue racial equity and social justice.
So why, you might be thinking, don't those of us on the Cap Times Board of Directors support our journalism with some of that money?
It doesn't work that way.
Mr. Evjue could not have dreamed how the newspaper business model would be so disrupted by the internet, so his philanthropic creation is legally walled off from the editorial voice and the news operation he cherished.
That brings me back to why I invite you to consider our membership pitch, which offers advantages including new experiences. In our marketing campaign, we will point to five good reasons to join:
Support real journalism: Your membership will help us produce first-rate investigative journalism, keep you informed and hold the powerful to account. There are many sources to get superb national and international journalism, far fewer to get the local kind.
Give back to Madison: Your subscription will indirectly support the long-term health of the aforementioned Evjue Foundation.
Meet and interact with Cap Times staff: At higher membership levels, members get admission to members-only events featuring Cap Times reporters and editors. We plan to have our first one in May here at our offices, including a tour of the press running the next day's paper.
See fewer ads: At every level, members get an "ad-lite" digital experience in which they encounter fewer ads, especially what we call "programmatic" ads usually not for local businesses. Members also will not see surveys in front of stories. (And in case you didn't know, our journalism is already not behind a pay wall.) Get free stuff: Member benefits include Food Fight gift cards and free or reduced-price admission to events such as our annual Cap Times Idea Fest, already a premier gathering for curious people seeking in-person sessions on a wide range of topics. Our highest subscription level comes with an autographed copy of a recent book on the history of the Cap Times produced for our centennial.
Look, there's no denying that the media business hardly resembles the print, radio and television landscape of my early career. Less publicized than the challenges of newspapers has been the fact that radio and television audiences have been, as they say, "atomized." There are hundreds, even thousands, of options, including limitless content to stream.
What you have in The Cap Times is, by far, the second-largest real news-gathering organization in the city behind the Wisconsin State Journal. We cover the news fairly and aggressively and through innovations such as our podcasts on topics from politics to dining offer a metropolitan approach to the news.
We also, of course, are proud of opinion voices we believe are often proven "right" not in the leftversus- right political sense, but in the sense of being ahead of the curve in embracing meaningful causes like civil rights, worker rights and feminism.
Recently, we asked you to complete a somewhat burdensome marketing survey to help us better appeal to local advertisers. Hundreds of you did, and you have my sincere thanks. This "ask" is bigger, as it is about money.
My pledge is that we will continue to innovate as a 21st century local media entity to inform, entertain and probably, sometimes, to infuriate. You have almost an infinite number of national and international choices with those qualities. Nearer your home, there are few. Humbly, we see this as a cool and noble undertaking. We hope you agree.

Texto completo: En una entrevista con ABC News, Ivanka Trump afirmó que su padre, el presidente Donald Trump , no tuvo nada que ver con la autorización de seguridad y la de su esposo, Jared Kushner .
“Hay información anónima de que mi padre presionó, pero el presidente no ha estado involucrado sobre mi autorización de seguridad” , afirmó a la televisora la llamada Primera Hija.
Sin embargo, reportes de CNN señalan que el presidente Trump presionó a su entonces jefe de personal, John Kelly, y al abogado de la Casa Blanca, Don McGahn , para que concediera a su hija la autorización, según tres personas familiarizadas con el asunto.
Aunque el mandatario tiene la autoridad legal para otorgar las autorizaciones, la mayoría de los casos se dejan en manos de la oficina de seguridad del personal de la Casa Blanca.
El proceso tiene que pasar primero por el FBI, que deberá verificar los antecedentes de los funcionarios de distintos niveles.
Segrún el reporte de CNN, el presidente Trump presionó a Kelly y McGahn para que dieran la autorización correspondiente, pero eso no ocurrió y él las autorizó.
La historia de la televisora da seguimiento a lo revelado por New York Times sobre la presión del presidente Trump a Kelly, para conceder a Kushner una autorización de seguridad de alto secreto, a pesar de las preocupaciones planteadas por los funcionarios de inteligencia.

Trump pressured staff to grant Ivanka a security clearance

Texto completo: President Trump reportedly pressured White House staff to grant his eldest daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump a security clearance.

Three sources familiar with the matter told CNN that Trump demanded former chief of staff John Kelly and White House counsel Don McGahn approve clearances for his daughter.

Presidents have the authority to grant security clearances, but most instances fall on the White House personnel security office, which makes its determination after the FBI has completed a background check of the individual.

The CNN reports comes after the New York Times reported last week that Trump ordered Kelly to grant Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, a top security clearance even though intelligence officials expressed concerns.

The sources said that Trump pushed Kelly and McGahn to make the decision regarding Ivanka Trump and her husband’s clearances after the personnel offices expressed concern that the president could be tainting the process in favor of his family.

After both refused to comply, Trump moved forward with getting his daughter and son-in-law security clearances.

Sources told CNN that it’s possible Ivanka Trump was unaware that there were any red flags raised during her background check.

"[She] did not seek, nor have, outside counsel involved in her process as no issues were ever raised," a source familiar with the process said.

Last month, she denied to ABC News that the president was involved in her husband’s clearance.

Texto completo: Desde hace varios meses, la Agencia de Seguridad Nacional ( NSA , en inglés) ha cerrado un sistema que analiza los registros de las llamadas y mensajes de texto de los estadounidenses.
Según un alto asesor republicano del Congreso, el programa que ha provocado disputas sobre la privacidad y el estado de derecho desde los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001 ha sido detenido y el presidente Donald Trump no pedirá que sea reactivado, publicó el New York Times.
Oficialmente, el sistema no ha sido concluido, indica el Times, ya que expirará a fin de año, según el asistente, Luke Murry , asesor de seguridad nacional de la minoría en la Cámara.
La administración del presidente George W. Bush inició el programa a fin de evitar ataques terroristas, luego del 9/11 . La existencia del programa fue revelado hasta 2013 por el contratista Edward Snowden .
A través del sistema, los analistas de inteligencia han tenido acceso a registros masivos de llamadas y mensajes de texto de los estadounidenses con el objetivo de detectar posibles planes terroristas. No está claro cuántos ataques se evitaron con el programa.
Tampoco hay certeza de su continuidad, algo que el presidente Trump podría solicitar al Congreso, aunque Murry lo desconoce y afirma que el programa no ha sido utilizado desde hace seis meses, debido a que la NSA enfrenta problemas de autoridad para recopilar las llamadas y mensajes.

Texto completo: CAIRO -- Egypt on Monday freed a prominent photojournalist who had spent five and a half years in prison for taking pictures during a crackdown in 2013 that culminated in the killing of more than 800 protesters.
The photojournalist, Mahmoud Abou Zeid, known as Shawkan, was returned to his family home in Cairo, where he vowed to continue working despite a five-year probation that requires him to spend every night at a police station.
"I can't describe how I feel," he told Reuters soon after his release at dawn. "I am free."
Mr. Abou Zeid was probably the best-known of the dozens of Egyptian journalists jailed under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has slowly suffocated free speech since he came to power in 2013. Mr. el-Sisi has muzzled critical news outlets and, of late, expelled or refused entry to foreign reporters.
While in prison, Mr. Abou Zeid has received numerous international awards; last year, he won the Unesco Press Freedom Prize. That award drew fury from the Egyptian authorities, who said Mr. Abou Zeid was suspected of being a terrorist; the Foreign Ministry blamed Qatar for promoting his cause -- a common Egyptian response to outside criticism.
Mr. el-Sisi's disregard for international criticism appears to have grown in the absence of any censure from President Trump, who has disparaged the news media as "enemies of the people" and hailed the Egyptian leader as a "fantastic guy."
Mr. Abou Zeid was arrested during the tumult that followed the July 2013 military takeover. In August, protests led by Muslim Brotherhood supporters filled a square in central Cairo, culminating in a bloody clear-out by the security forces that left hundreds dead.
Mr. Abou Zeid, who was on assignment for a British photo agency, was arrested on Aug. 13, alongside journalists from France and the United States. The Westerners were released later that day, but Mr. Abou Zeid was detained at the maximum security Tora Prison, south of Cairo.
He was eventually put on trial with 739 other defendants, in one of the largest mass hearings since the Arab Spring in 2011, facing 24 charges including weapons possession, illegal assembly and murder.
"My passion is photography, but I am paying the price for my passion with my life," he wrote in a letter to observe his 600th day in detention in March 2015. "Tora Prison is like a cemetery. It is a place where dreams come to die."
Mr. Abou Zeid kept a brave face during his trial, and photographs of him holding an invisible camera to his face from behind a cage acquired an iconic status. He was convicted in September and sentenced to five years in prison, which he had already served, and handed a fine.
A six-month prison term was added to his sentence because he could not afford to pay the fine, supporters said.
On Monday, Mr. Abou Zeid was hugged by family members after he returned to his home in Giza. He vowed to continue working. "All journalists are at risk of being arrested or killed while doing their work," he told Reuters. "I am not the first, and I will not be the last."
But his ability to work will be circumscribed by the conditions of his detention, which stipulate that he must stay at a police station between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. every night for the next five years.
In a statement, Amnesty International said those measures were "ludicrous" and called for them to be lifted immediately. "As a prisoner of conscience, he should never have been forced to spend a single minute behind bars -- let alone five and a half years," said Najia Bounaim of Amnesty's North Africa division.
China, Egypt and Turkey were responsible for about half of the 251 journalists who were imprisoned for their work in 2018, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Mr. el-Sisi, whose supporters in Parliament recently began moves that would allow him to extend his rule until 2034, has sought to control debate in Egypt by using his powerful security agencies to pressure newspapers and broadcasters and by prosecuting or arresting those who step out of line.
Egyptian journalists have borne the brunt of his crackdown, but foreign reporters have recently been subject to harsher measures as well. In February 2018, Egypt expelled without explanation a journalist from The Times of London. Last month, David D. Kirkpatrick, a former Cairo bureau chief for The New York Times, was turned back.
Mr. Kirkpatrick was held overnight at Cairo's main airport and put on a plane back to London. Officials gave no explanation for their actions.

Texto completo: Webdesk, please embed intragram pics or tweets (can't remember which they are) of the cake and the drag queen bridal shower. th
What do wealthy Never Trumpers who seem to have everything want from their friends?

Wedding registries for last Saturday’s star-studded nuptials between Nicaragua-born Ana Navarro, 47, and Cuba-born Al Cardenas, 71, show that the two asked for an array of household goods. Until recently, Navarro shared a home with then-boyfriend Gene Prescott, 75, the owner of the Biltmore Hotel. Cardenas is divorced with four children.

The couple, who are both virulently anti-Trump and have close connections to Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor defeated by the president in the 2016 GOP primaries, registered publicly at Macy's, Crate and Barrel, and Pottery Barn. They requested a wide variety of items ranging from pool towels to dinnerware and gift cards.

Among the gifts people bought the couple were "Michael Aram Palm Cocktail Napkin Holders" ($65), "sustainably sourced" striped pool towels at $39.50, a dozen "Villeroy & Boch Buffet Plate Mandarin Chargers ($89.99 each), three "Squared Zen Melamine Large Green Leaf Platter" ($46 each) and a "Bedgear Dri-Tec King Sheet Set" at $248.99. The most expensive item still visible was a tall black "Pedestal Planter" at $379 and Macy's tableware totaled $6328.08.

Navarro, a highly paid Republican campaign strategist, CNN commentator, and guest host of "The View," married Cardenas at the plush Indian Creek Country Club on a private island off the coast of Miami. Cardenas is a multimillionaire and works as a top GOP lobbyist. Voter records indicate that Navarro and Cardenas live together in a $1.6 million house in Coral Gables, Fla.

The couple’s wedding was a star-studded affair. Attendees included CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, Anderson Cooper, and Don Lemon, singer Gloria Estefan, actress Eva Longoria, and U.S. Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Bob Menendez, D-N.J., a client of Navarro's whose political career survived two recent trials in which juries were deadlocked on corruption charges.

Exclusive rights to cover the wedding were granted to People en Espanol for an unknown fee. Navarro told the magazine that she had first met her future husband more than 25 years earlier. “It wasn’t the right time back then, so we became very good friends through the years and through the decades. Finally, things fell into place, things worked out and we’re able to be here today.”
Instagram

Navarro appeared to marvel at the mashup of political and pop culture figures at the wedding. “Somebody said to me last night, ‘I’m not sure where else I could be dancing next to @gloriaestefan, @evalongoria, Isaiah Thomas and @mittromney while @willychirino sings the 'Guantanamera' other than your wedding. Yup. That happened,” she wrote on Instagram. She also posted a photo of her wedding cake, which appeared to be several feet tall.
Instagram
Despite the political heavyweights at the event, Navarro tweeted that she was hoping to escape the glare of politics during their nuptials, declaring that she was in a “no-politics zone” Saturday.

Navarro announced her engagement on “The View” late last year. Some of the hosts from the show also attended the wedding. Blitzer snapped a photo with co-hosts Sunny Hostin and Joy Behar.

Both Navarro and Cardenas have been vocal critics of President Trump. Navarro said she believes Trump is a racist. And Cardenas, a former chairman of the American Conservative Union, said Trump is “the worse social poison to afflict our country in decades.”

Navarro worked on former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush’s inaugural transition team in 1998 and on late Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. Cardenas served as the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida while Bush was in office and is now a partner at lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs. He has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republican causes and candidates..

His previous wife Diana Cardenas and Navarro, who is a staunch defender of gay rights, publicly disagreed on the issue over Facebook in 2011. Navarro was seen in mid-February celebrating her marriage to Cardenas at a brunch complete with drag performers.

Cardenas proposed to Navarro in October, with Navarro taking to Instagram to show off the engagement ring, complete with huge diamond.
Instagram
In 2017, New York Times columnist David Brooks, like Navarro and Cardenas a self-styled anti-Trump conservative, was widely mocked for his lavish wedding registry when he married his former research assistant, who was 23 years his junior.

Did Bolton blow North Korea talks?

Texto completo: President Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last week was criticized by both parties in Washington long before Air Force One even touched down in Hanoi. Washington’s political class seemed terrified that the nearly 70 year state of “war” with North Korea might actually end. In the end the only positive thing they could say about the meeting was that Trump apparently walked away with nothing to show for it.
The location of the meeting – Hanoi, Vietnam – serves as a great example of what can be won in peace versus what is lost in war. After losing nearly 60,000 US service members in an unnecessary war that took a million Vietnamese lives, the US loss of the Vietnam war resulted not in a communist takeover of southeast Asia but something very different: the domino theory failed because communism was destined to fail. Now we are close trading partners with an increasingly pro-market Vietnam. The result of trade and exchange versus war is a better life for all.
Unfortunately for Washington, the real lesson of Vietnam has not been learned. That is why the Republicans, Democrats, and the entire mainstream media spoke as one against President Trump’s decision to take a bold step and actually meet again, one-on-one, with one of our “enemies” to see if we can avoid nuclear conflict.
One leading Democrat, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), attacked Trump for meeting with Kim because speaking to the North Korean “gives him legitimacy.” Does it make any sense that we should not even speak with our nuclear-armed adversaries because it gives them “legitimacy”? He’d rather have a nuclear war as long as Kim remains “illegitimate”? This is sadly the kind of thinking that prevails in Washington.
The media reported that Trump walked away from the meeting before the scheduled signing ceremony and closing press event. The talks broke down, it was reported, because Kim demanded an end to all sanctions before any reduction in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. Washington sighed with relief and said all together, “better no deal than a bad deal.”
Meanwhile the North Koreans held a rare press conference clarifying that they only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling one of their main nuclear facilities. Further, press reports began to surface that National Security Advisor John Bolton threw additional demands on the table which led Kim to draw the meeting to an early close.
Who’s telling the truth? We likely won’t know. But given Bolton’s strong opposition to any kind of peace agreement with North Korea it’s hard to doubt that he had something to do with the blow-up of the summit. As the New York Times reported over the weekend, while Trump’s advisors were shocked when he decided to meet Kim face-to-face the first time for negotiations, John Bolton wasn’t worried at all. As the Times writes, “Mr. Bolton told colleagues not to worry. The negotiations, he said, would collapse on their own.” And so they did.
Will Trump continue to allow his diplomatic efforts to be undermined by his own staff? Let’s hope the president will ignore Washington, ignore the neocons, and continue to work for peace with North Korea.

Resumen: Golden’s opposition to expanded background checks spurred supporters of the measure to run advertising accusing him of siding with the gun lobby while his backing of a GOP-sponsored amendment to bolster the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raised hackles from at least one of the party’s most high-profile newcomers. Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, a group devoted to what it calls “common sense” gun regulation, has taken out at least 135 social media advertisements in the past few days on Facebook alone to go after the first-term, 2nd District member of Congress. According to the The New York Times, Ocasio-Cortez “implored moderates to vote against the Republican-led motions and, in an implicit threat, added that she would make it clear to liberal activists which members supported the Republican measures.”

Texto completo: With votes last week against more gun control and in favor of a proposal to help crack down on undocumented immigrants, Maine Democrat Jared Golden is drawing fire from his party’s left wing.
Golden’s opposition to expanded background checks spurred supporters of the measure to run advertising accusing him of siding with the gun lobby while his backing of a GOP-sponsored amendment to bolster the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raised hackles from at least one of the party’s most high-profile newcomers.
Golden is among a small group of Democratic lawmakers whose votes have upset liberal firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term Democrat from New York, enough for her to speak out against them.
She said she is unhappy with a small “moderate wing,” which includes Golden, because its supporters opposed California Democrat Nancy Pelosi for speaker, supported compromise on President Donald Trump’s proposal wall and backed ICE.
Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, a group devoted to what it calls “common sense” gun regulation, has taken out at least 135 social media advertisements in the past few days on Facebook alone to go after the first-term, 2nd District member of Congress.
In its ads, the group insists Golden “failed us” and “sided with the gun lobby” in his opposition to background checks on most private gun transfers and for another bill to give the FBI more time to carry out the checks before a sale goes through.
Though neither bill is expected to secure backing in the Senate — and President Donald Trump has already vowed to veto them should they reach his desk — their passage marked the first time in more than two decades a piece of major gun control legislation passed either chamber of Congress.
Golden, one of two Democrats to oppose expanded background checks, said in a prepared statement he voted against them because the proposal is nearly the same as a 2016 Maine ballot question opposed by constituents in all of the counties he represents.
“Maine isn’t Chicago, Washington or New York,” he said. “For many of my constituents, access to firearms is a necessary part of daily life and we have a tradition of responsible gun ownership.”
Everytown responded to the win by targeting eight lawmakers who voted against the bill, including both Democrats who opposed expanded checks: Golden and Collin Peterson of Minnesota. It said it planned to spend $200,000 assailing the bill’s opponents in swing districts.
“For those elected leaders who put the gun lobby ahead of the safety of their constituents, we’re sending a clear message: Do so at your own peril,” the president of the group, John Feinblatt, said in a prepared statement.
The pro-gun control group said Golden voted against the proposal “even though background checks reduce gun violence and save lives.”
In one of the ads against Golden, Everytown called on 2nd District voters to “let him know how disappointed you are that he put the interests of the gun lobby over the safety of his constituents.”
Golden, though, did not hesitate to defend his vote.
He said Monday: “Mainers in every county in my district were very clear: They don’t support expanding background checks to make some transfers between friends and family illegal. This one-size-fits-all approach to gun control doesn’t work for our state.
“Special interest groups can ignore the will of Mainers in the 2nd District all they want, but I stand by my vote and I stand with my constituents.”
Mainers rejected virtually the same proposal when it reached the 2016 ballot as a citizens’ initiative, with the 2nd District voting it down by a nearly 2-1 margin.
It is not just Golden’s vote on the gun measure that is drawing criticism.
Before the final vote, Golden also sided in favor of an amendment pushed by Republicans aimed largely at putting swing district representatives like him on the hot seat.
The GOP’s amendment called for ICE to be notified whenever undocumented immigrants barred from possessing firearms attempt to purchase one.
That amendment passed 220-209, serving to add the proposal to the overall bill that Democrats enacted shortly afterward with only a smattering of Republican support.
In seeking the amendment, U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, said anyone voting against the notification provision would be “voting to allow someone who should not have a firearm to get away with it and not be prosecuted for it.”
But a senior Democratic legislator, U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, called the amendment “a total red herring” that was not needed.
Nadler told colleagues if someone fails a background check “because he is illegally in the
country, that means the system knows he is illegally in the country.”
“So what is the point of reporting him?” Nadler asked. “He has to be in the system as illegally in the country in order to fail the background check.”
Nadler said the amendment was merely a bid by the GOP “to try to mix up the immigration issue with the gun violence issue, and they really have nothing to do with each other.”
Necessary or not, the provision was included in the final version of the background checks legislation endorsed by the House.
Some activists were angry Democrats helped hand the GOP a win that bolstered ICE.
According to the The New York Times, Ocasio-Cortez “implored moderates to vote against the Republican-led motions and, in an implicit threat, added that she would make it clear to liberal activists which members supported the Republican measures.”
On her Twitter feed, the lawmaker said she was “upset that 26 Dems forced the other 200+ to vote for a pro-ICE provision at the last min without warning” because “I think an agency that pins children down + forcibly injects them w/ antipsychotic drugs shouldn’t be given more power.”
“We can have ideological differences and that’s fine,” she said in another statement on Twitter. “But these tactics allow a small group to force the other 200+ members into actions that the majority disagree with. I don’t think that’s right, and said as much in a closed-door meeting.”
Ocasion-Cortez also mentioned “the same small splinter group of Dems” that sought to block California Democrat Nancy Pelosi from the speakership and “fund the wall during the shutdown when the public didn’t want it” had voted for the ICE amendment.
Though Ocasion-Cortez did not cite any names, Golden voted against Pelosi, favored compromise to end the shutdown and backed the controversial amendment.
Golden has repeatedly vowed to do what he thinks is best for his rural, sprawling district regardless of what Democratic leaders and activists want.
He is expected to face a tough re-election challenge in 2020, perhaps from the Republican he defeated last year, ex-U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, who served two terms before losing in a cliffhanger in the first-ever ranked-choice voting election for a federal office.

Texto completo: Nobody wakes up on their wedding day and thinks, I bet we'll be divorced by this time next year. At least, I hope not.
Most of us have the highest hopes and dreams for our marriages. Sometimes, though, after a few years, reality sets in — in the form of debt, credit cards and financial infidelity — and we give up hope. That's why money problems are a leading cause of divorce in America, and it's why I'm so passionate about helping people take control of their money.
When I speak at events or talk to couples across the country, I hear time and time again that money is at the root of so much marital stress. It's amazing how appearance, status and stuff can take over our lives and ruin our relationships if we aren't careful. The good news is that there is an antidote. It all comes down to common sense.
Whether you're just dating or are already an "old married couple," here are a few tips to make money a blessing in your relationship — not a cause of stress and fights.
Work together, not separate How can you be on the same page about money if you have two separate bank accounts? Didn't the pastor at your wedding ceremony say, "You will become one"? Keeping your accounts separate is one of the most effective ways to completely wreck your financial life — and maybe even your marriage. If you want to win with money in your marriage, you must be on the same team.
Make a routine At the end of every month, sit down with your spouse for your monthly budget meeting. Plan out how you will spend every dollar for the coming month — groceries, gas, bills, everything. And don't forget to budget a small percentage of "fun" money!
Stay involved It's okay if one of you is in charge of budgeting and paying bills, but you both need to communicate and know what's going on. My husband and I use the budgeting app EveryDollar, because it's easy to use and gives us both visibility into what's going on with our money.
Be willing to say "no" If it's not in the budget, then it's not in the budget. That might mean you can't have the latest iPhone or designer shoes. Remember, it's only no for now. Once you're debt-free, you'll have more freedom to afford the things you really want. My dad, Dave Ramsey, taught me to "Live like no one else, so later, you can live like no one else."
Don't compare your marriage to anyone else's You may think other couples have it all together based on what you see on social media, but their marriage may very well be stressed. Maybe they have no margin with their money, because their paycheck comes in and goes right back out in payments. Their "perfect life" may be just one money fight away from divorce. Stay focused on your marriage and your goals.
If you and your spouse are struggling right now, change won't come overnight. But you've got to start somewhere. Getting started is the hardest part, but once you start those conversations with your spouse, it will change your marriage. If you're struggling with how to approach it, check out my list of six money conversation starters to help.
So, sit down for a heart-to-heart with your spouse, be honest, and be proactive. Don't let your marriage fall apart because you're not paying attention to money issues.

House Democrat to Seek Documents From Trump Contacts

Texto completo: Representative Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Sunday that he planned to request documents from more than 60 people with ties to President Trump, his administration and his businesses, including the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., as part of the committee's investigation of the president.
Using the language of a prosecutor, Mr. Nadler said his goal was to present "the case to the American people about obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power," which could lay the groundwork for eventual impeachment proceedings or other congressional action. He added that it was "very clear that the president obstructed justice."
Mr. Nadler, Democrat of New York, told ABC's "This Week" that he would also request documents from Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer for the Trump Organization. Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, repeatedly referred to Mr. Weisselberg's central role in Mr. Trump's business transactions during his testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform last week.
Mr. Nadler said Mr. Cohen "directly implicated the president in various crimes, both while seeking the office of president and while in the White House," singling out as a particular concern Mr. Cohen's claim that he was reimbursed for hush money payments to keep quiet Mr. Trump's affairs.
Mr. Nadler said it would be an "impeachable offense" if Mr. Trump were found to have participated in any scheme to "sabotage a fair election." He cautioned, though, that "impeachment is a long way down the road."
"We don't have the facts yet," he said.
The Judiciary Committee plans to lay out a more detailed account of its investigation when it makes the requests on Monday. But Mr. Nadler's remarks on Sunday underscored the ever-widening nature of House Democrats' inquiries into Mr. Trump's businesses, campaign and administration.
Without naming Mr. Nadler, Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday morning that he was being "persecuted by some very bad, conflicted & corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal & should never have been allowed to start -- And only because I won the Election!"
Mr. Nadler and other top leaders in the Democrat-controlled House are proceeding with caution, and believe that any attempt to bring impeachment charges against the president -- or even discuss them as a significant possibility -- could prompt a political backlash or lend credence to the president's charge that the investigation is a witch hunt.
"There may be a lot to find," Mr. Nadler said in an interview with The New York Times on Thursday, discussing the need for investigations rather than impeachment for now. "We've got to know what we're dealing with, and it's not just about paying off hush money to women about affairs."
"It's about abuse of power. It's about obstruction of justice. These are more important, more fundamental things," he said.
When asked how far he was willing to go, Mr. Nadler said: "I've been in politics a long time, and I am here to defend civil rights, civil liberties, due process and the rule of law. And if I think that impeachment will help that, I will support impeachment. And if I think impeachment is the wrong way to go to that, I will oppose it."
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, said on "This Week" immediately after Mr. Nadler's appearance that the chairman's caution on impeachment was masking his true intentions.
"I think Congressman Nadler decided to impeach the president the day the president won the election," Mr. McCarthy said. "He talks about impeachment before he even became chairman and then he says, 'You've got to persuade people to get there.' There's nothing that the president did wrong."
Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and he lit into those investigating him -- including the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III -- in a fiery and rambling speech of more than two hours at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday.
"So now we're waiting for a report, and we'll find out," Mr. Trump said of the conclusion of Mr. Mueller's investigation, which is expected soon. "You put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there, and all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out."

DEMOCRATS WANT DETAILS OF TOP SECURITY CLEARANCES

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A powerful Democratic House committee chairman investigating possible abuses of the government's security clearance process stepped up demands on Friday to see key documents and interview potential witnesses from the White House in light of a report that President Donald Trump personally intervened to grant his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a top-secret clearance despite legal and national security concerns.
Mr. Kushner received the security clearance despite concerns from intelligence and White House officials about his contacts with foreign individuals and his failure to disclose them on his clearance application. Both of those factors ordinarily would all but guarantee that an applicant not be given access to government secrets.
News reports said that Mr. Trump's intervention so concerned senior administration officials that John F. Kelly, then the White House chief of staff, documented the action in a contemporaneous internal memo that said he had been "ordered" to grant Mr. Kushner a top-secret clearance.
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who leads the House Oversight and Reform Committee, accused the White House in a letter Friday of stonewalling his requests for information and implied that if it did not comply voluntarily, he would issue a subpoena.
He said the report, published by The New York Times, added new concerns that Mr. Trump was not honest to the public about his role in the clearance process and broader questions about irregularities surrounding who should have access to sensitive government secrets.
The Times also reported that Donald F. McGahn II, then the White House counsel, wrote a memo of his own documenting concerns raised by the CIA and other officials about Mr. Kushner. Mr. McGahn, the memo noted, had recommended against giving him such broad access to the government's secrets.
Mr. Trump told The Times in January that he had no role in Mr. Kushner's clearance.
Mr. Cummings has been pursuing reported irregularities since 2017, when Republicans were in control of the House. He started a broad inquiry last month after taking control of the panel, Congress's most muscular investigative body.
"If true, these new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation's most sensitive secrets," Mr. Cummings wrote in a letter to Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel. The letter went on to ask about "why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this Committee."
House investigators are demanding that the White House turn over documents related to security clearances of top officials by Monday.
Mr. Cummings has also asked for documents related to a review of the security clearance process that Mr. Kelly conducted in 2018 that concluded there were serious flaws in the system.

Police seek money for Rapid DNA; System would help solve cases faster, but some wary results wouldn't be as accurate as state lab

Texto completo: The Orlando Police Department is seeking state fundingto buya newDNA-testing technology that would allow officers to test and compare evidence in less than two hours, without shipping it to a state lab.
In its pitch for $250,000to Orange County's legislative delegation, the agency said the technology, known as Rapid DNA, "has the potential to change the paradigm for law enforcement and its capacity to solve cases," including by identifying suspects or linking crime scenes.
"By identifying suspects quickly, Rapid DNA testing has the potential to identify criminals, dramatically reducing the rate of violent crimes," OPD said. "A major cause of DNA backlog is due to conventional DNA testing, which again requires highly skilled scientists to perform numerous manual procedures."
Critics are wary of the new technology, unconvinced the underlying science is sound or its results areas accurateas those produced by the state forensic lab.
"Rapid DNA is a privately owned testing system, meaning that no one knows the methodology they use to compare the DNA against the nationwide and Florida databases of DNA samples," said Richard Hornsby, anOrlando criminal defense attorney.
The concern is similar to one some lawyersshare over the breathalyzer system used to determine if drivers are inebriated, said attorney Stuart Hyman, whoin 2014 was among a group of defense attorneys who successfully argued for greater access to the software underlying the Intoxilyzer 8000 device.
Without knowing how it works, a positive test by a device like the Intoxilyzer 8000 or Rapid DNA can be difficult to challenge in court, he said.
"It's sort of like it's guilty by machine," Hyman said. "... The worst-case scenario is that someone gets convicted of a crime they didn't commit, unless you can assure it's doing its analysis properly."
ANDE, the company that makes the Rapid DNA system OPD is eyeing, received approval from the FBI based on the federal agency's quality standards required to compare DNA results against its national database. In tests, ANDE produced results that matched those from six accredited labs 99.99 percent of the time, according to a study.
The results show the system "successfully produced accurate, reliable, reproducible, and robust results without manual processing," the company said on its website.
Rapid DNA works like this, according to Annette Mattern, a spokeswoman for ANDE: When a DNA specimen is enteredinto the machine, either from a crime scene sampleor a cheek swab, it spits out a code.
"Think of it like a VIN number," Mattern said, referring to the unique identifying code assigned to vehicles. "It's only data, so nothing biological is coming out ... and when it's compared to a database, it's comparing code to code."
The Rapid DNAoutput can be compared against an agency's database or, in ANDE's case, the FBI's national database, as long as the DNA tested for FBI comparison is analyzed by an accredited laboratory for confirmation, according to the FBI's standards.
OPD will find out by May 3, the end of the legislative session, whether it has been approved to receive the funds from the Appropriations Subcommittee on Criminal and Civil Justice. It's likely the money would become available by the end of the year if the request is granted, city spokeswoman Karyn Barber said.
If OPD is granted the money, it will be the first major Central Florida agency to acquire Rapid DNA. The Osceola County Sheriff's Office is also looking into the technology, a spokesman said.
Asked how many law enforcement agencies are using the ANDE system, Mattern said she couldn't comment.
OPD declined interview requests from the Orlando Sentinel to discuss how it plans to use Rapid DNA. OPD spokesman Sgt. Eduardo Bernal described the potential acquisition as still "in its infancy."
It's unclear whether the agency will use a positiveRapid DNA matchas probable cause to arrest a person. Hornsby said he anticipates, if that happens, the state lab would need to confirm the results with forensic analysis in order to bring formal charges against the person.
But thatprocess isn't quick.
"You'll have people arrested on these presumptive DNA tests and held in jail for months, only to find out later it wasn't actually them or the testing was inaccurate," he said.
But the Florida Department of Law Enforcement anticipates OPD will use the machine primarily as a"pointer system," to allow officers at a crime scene to siftthrough potentially hundreds of pieces of DNA evidence and narrow the findings to a handful of promising samples, helping reduce the backlog at the state lab, FDLE Special Agent Danny Banks said.
"They say, 'Look, we used Rapid DNA at the scene, here's the 10 (samples)that would appear they have DNA of someone other than the victim,' " Banks said. "And then we'd prioritize looking at those 10."
Hornsby questionedhow the state lab will confirm Rapid DNA'stest results, since the testing process effectively destroys the sample it's analyzing.
"It's not like you can use the same sample over and over again," he said. "So if there's not sufficient portion of that evidence available, you run the risk of using the sole sample of DNA in this instant DNA kit."
Banks said that shouldn't be a problem.The FDLE lab can use "a very, very small, minute piece of evidence," he said. "A skin cell that is not even visible to mine or your eyes, we can build a DNA profile off that."
The law governing Florida's DNA database has expanded in recent years the list of offenses for which a person accused of a crime is required to provide a DNA sample. As of this year, the requirement applies toanyone arrested on a felony charge, as well asthose convicted on certain misdemeanor charges.
The federal Rapid DNA Act of 2017 required the FBI to create standards for Rapid DNA testing to take place in the booking process at jails, which will be able to directly compare cheek swabs to the FBI's national database. The New York Times reported last month that Florida will be among the first five states to see Rapid DNA set up under the FBI's standards in select booking stations, as soon as this year.
But anyone can consent to a cheek swab. And some may not know that they have the option to decline to provide one when asked, said Orlando attorney David Frakt.
"Many people feel pressured to consent or don't know that they can refuse, or feel that something bad will happen if they do refuse," Frakt said in an email.
However, Frakt said there's only a "small danger" of police testing people during routine interactions or to build their database, primarily because a Rapid DNA test is expensive. A single ANDEtest kit costs $250 on average, Mattern said.
OPD's proposalcited other uses for the machine, including identifying victims, especially in mass-casualty incidents. Law enforcement agenciesin California used Rapid DNA to identify those killed in recent wildfires, Mattern said.
The machine also has the power to quickly determine a person is not linked to crime, OPD said in its funding request.
"Samples from a crime scene can then be immediately compared against evidence found on scenes. This information can either link a person to a crime or exonerate a person from a crime," the agency said. "The impact on solving crimes and relieving the crime lab backlog is profound."

Texto completo: The character sketch of Donald Trump by the keeper of his secrets was no surprise to anyone who has given a passing glance at the hulk of malevolence in the Oval Office. He cheats. He defrauds. He lies by way of respiration.
We knew all of that. Getting it under oath from a man who was once executive vice president and special counsel to Trump just gave historians a formality for the obvious.
But if Michael D. Cohen's description of a president who morphed into "the worst version of himself" was not news, certainly the way Republicans took the baton from the ex-loyalist was. They have now become Trump's fixer, doing his dirty work, issuing threats and ditching long-held principles like so many empty beer bottles thrown from a car.
Cohen's portrayal of the fraud in the White House, and the details of a Trump Organization run like a criminal enterprise, are not disqualifying to Republicans. Just the opposite. Trump is a racist, a con, a cheat, in Cohen's words - but those are among the reasons people voted for him. Proving it only strengthens his standing with a large sector of the electorate and many members of Congress.
When Cohen described how Trump would fail to pay people who'd done work for him, or weaseled his way out of his share of taxes, or inflated his assets for what sounds like insurance and bank fraud - well, those are marks of a good businessman who knows how to game the system.
"Every day, most of us knew we were coming in and we were going to lie for him," Cohen said of a typical shift at Trump Tower. Professional prevarication on behalf of Trump "was normalized," he said. "And no one around him questioned it. In fairness, no one around him today questions it, either."
The hearing before the House select committee proved his point. Did one Republican stand up and decry Cohen's litany of presidential lies? They blasted Cohen the liar, but not the man he lied for. Did one Republican decry the $35,000 check - proof, as Cohen said, that "The president of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws"?
It's been clear, ever since the last of the never-Trumpers were rooted out of the party, that the GOP would be an extension of the grime and grift of Trump's personal brand. But now the enablers are willing to do what Cohen said he once did for Trump - take a bullet for him.
Among Cohen's duties as Trump fixer was to threaten people; he did this maybe 500 times, by his recounting. That job has been taken over by Republican elected officials like Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida. He threatened Cohen on the eve of his testimony, mentioning his family in an ominous tweet.
Initially, Gaetz compared witness intimidation to the "marketplace of ideas." Gaetz has taken his tweet back, but his crude attempt at thuggery stands out for how loathsome his party has become.
Republicans who started down this road by making excuses for Trump's most repulsive personal traits have moved on to bedrock principles. The party of deficit hawks didn't blink at the billion-dollar hole in the budget that came with the tax cut, so long as it gave Trump a "win." They were fine with a president who sided with Vladimir Putin in a traitorous exchange in Helsinki. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has fashioned himself as an institutional guardian of the Constitution, threw that document in a dumpster after he backed Trump's brazen violation of the separation of powers.
They are headed for a reckoning. In years to come, people will ask, "What did we do to make sure our democracy is intact?" as Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the committee chairman, put it. For Trump's new fixers, Cohen gave them an answer: "I did the same thing you're doing now."
Timothy Egan, based in the Pacific Northwest, writes a column for the New York Times.

Is N-Word Slur in Annapolis the American Way?

Texto completo: Headnote Race and Politics
The "revelation" that Del. Mary Ann Lisanti from Harford County (who is White), referred to an area in predominantly Black Prince George's County as a "nigger district," has taken Annapolis by storm. The mandatory shock and outrage has ensued.
Here we go again.
According to the Washington Post, Lisanti was at Annapolis Cigar (stating the obvious, a cigar bar in Annapolis) in late January when she allegedly made the comment in the presence of a small, racially mixed group of fellow lawmakers. Specifically, Lisanti allegedly told a White colleague at the after hours gathering that when he campaigned in Prince George's on behalf of a candidate last fall, he was door-knocking in a "n- district."
"This morning (Feb. 26), Delegate Mary Ann Lisanti apologized to the House Democratic Caucus for her use of the n-word," said Speaker of the House Michael Busch in a statement. "While I believe her apology was heartfelt, the damage among her colleagues and the public has been done."
Apparently, the knowledge of Lisanti's alleged use of the so-called "n-word" is even more stinging in the midst of Black History Month.
"The month of February marks the commemoration of Black History Month. Astoundingly, racial transgressions have been a staggering theme in a month which celebrates the rich history, culture, and progressions of African-Americans," said Del. Darryl Barnes of Prince George's County and chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland, in a letter to Speaker Busch. "The blatant act of racism by Delegate Mary Ann Lisanti has blanketed a time where we should be recognizing achievements in the African-American community."
I don't mean no harm, as we say in West Baltimore and pardon my cynicism but, why are we flabbergasted by a White woman from Harford County referring to a community in Prince George's as a "n-- district?"
Don't get me wrong, we shouldn't let Lisanti slide for disrespecting the people of one of the most prosperous Black counties in America. If she can be forced to resign, that seems appropriate to me; racist statements by public servants (while in office especially) shouldn't be tolerated ever. But, why are we shocked? Why are we in our feelings?
Afterall, this is Trump's America.
For the record, I covered Annapolis as a reporter for years and over time I've forged relationships with dozens of state legislators, the vast majority of them Black. Most of the Black legislators from the venerable, to the backbenchers have confided that the Maryland General Assembly operates like a legislative plantation. So, allegations of White legislators spewing racial slurs seems like par for the course in many ways. However, within the nation's broader current political arena the machinations of the 45th President of the United States dominates the American political scene and gives expansive cover I believe, to people like Harford County's Lisanti and so many others. Take Iowa's Steve King, for example.
His phalanx of breathtaking racist statements over the years culminated recently with the Iowa Congressman finally coming clean when he declared to the New York Times in January, "White nationalist, White supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" he asked.
Trump seems baffled by that question as well.
While campaigning for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the heat of Cruz's battle against Rep. Beto O'Rourke during an Oct. 22 rally in Houston, Trump proclaimed, "You know, they have a word - it's sort of became old-fashioned - it's called a nationalist. And I say, really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, okay?" Trump proudly proclaimed. "I'm a nationalist. Nationalist. Nothing wrong. Use that word. Use that word."
Trump isn't a Hispanic nationalist. He's not an Asian nationalist. He's not an Indigenous nationalist. He damn sure ain't a Black nationalist. Donald John Trump is a White nationalist and he's proud of it. Are we all clear now?

Texto completo: ALBANY – Gov. Andrew Cuomo and supporters of bringing an Amazon headquarters to New York City have bolstered their efforts in recent days to try to get the online retail giant to reconsider the decision to drop its plans for the city.
Cuomo has talked with Amazon officials to try to get the Seattle-based company to come back to Long Island City in Queens after it pulled out of the deal Feb. 14 amid local opposition.
But he said the company has not suggested it has been swayed.
"They have given no indication that they would reconsider," Cuomo said Friday on WNYC, a public-radio station in Manhattan. "So I think the point was more not that Amazon is going to change its mind. I don't think that they do. But the truth should be known. Because this was a national story, and it had damning consequences for New York."
Cuomo's pursuit of Amazon was coupled Thursday with an open letter to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos from more than 70 business groups, politicians and unions imploring him to reconsider the decision to dump its plans for a headquarters in the city that promised at least 25,000 jobs.
"New York attracts the best, most diverse talent from across the globe," the letter said. "We are a dynamic new center of the country's most inclusive tech economy. We all hope you reconsider and join us in building the exciting future of New York."
Can it work? Cuomo has been working behind the scenes with Amazon officials, including Bezos, to try to salvage the deal, the New York Times reported Thursday.
So far, though, it appears Amazon hasn't budged.
The company declined to comment Friday.
While some unions signed onto the letter, other unions and some local political leaders remain opposed to the Amazon deal.
They have criticized the $3 billion that New York City and the state pledged to the company and worrying about the impact on local housing prices and services if Amazon were to move in.
And some state senators took exemption to Cuomo's pledge to Amazon that he would make sure that if Amazon returns, he would personally shepherd the deal with the state bureaucracy.
"'The Governor will take over the process.' Smh, what a tyrant," Sen. Julia Salazar, D-Queens, wrote on Twitter.
But Cuomo said Friday he's trying to salvage the deal and also let businesses know that New York is welcoming.
"We want all businesses nationwide to know that this was an oddity," he said. "Don't think that if you come to New York, the same thing is going to happen that happened to Amazon. That was a small, vocal minority that was local, petty politics that governed the day. And we don't operate that way."
Cuomo's pledge The letter and a statement from Cuomo's spokeswoman indicated he would be more directly involved if Amazon were to revive its plans for the city.
"Governor Cuomo will take personal responsibility for the project's state approval and Mayor de Blasio will work together with the governor to manage the community development process," the letter said.
Cuomo's spokeswoman Dani Lever put the blame on Senate Democrats for their opposition to Amazon, particularly Queens Sen. Mike Gianaris.
"The state Senate made a terrible blunder — everyone, including their members, knows it — and 70 percent of New Yorkers affirmed it," Lever said. "The governor will take over the process and can comfortably assure Amazon the approval will get done."
Senate Democratic Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, indicated Thursday night the Senate would be receptive to talking again with Amazon.
"I have always been clear that I support job creation and was disappointed with Amazon's decision and hoped they would reconsider," she said in a statement. "I have also repeatedly indicated my willingness to work with Amazon in the best interests of our state and affected communities. It is clear that this process exposed serious flaws in our economic development programs that need to be reformed for future projects."

"Governor Cuomo will take personal responsibility for the project's state approval and Mayor de Blasio will work together with the governor to manage the community development process," the letter said.
Cuomo's spokeswoman Dani Lever put the blame on Senate Democrats for their opposition to Amazon, particularly Queens Sen. Mike Gianaris.
"The state Senate made a terrible blunder — everyone, including their members, knows it — and 70 percent of New Yorkers affirmed it," Lever said. "The governor will take over the process and can comfortably assure Amazon the approval will get done."
Senate Democratic Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, indicated Thursday night the Senate would be receptive to talking again with Amazon.
"I have always been clear that I support job creation and was disappointed with Amazon's decision and hoped they would reconsider," she said in a statement. "I have also repeatedly indicated my willingness to work with Amazon in the best interests of our state and affected communities. It is clear that this process exposed serious flaws in our economic development programs that need to be reformed for future projects."
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has talked with Amazon officials to try to get the Seattle-based company to come back to Long Island City in Queens.

Texto completo: Another day, another town justice from Wayne County was in the crosshairs of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct for falling short on the job.
This time her honor was Huron Town Court Justice Kathleen Wachtman, whom the commission recommended be censured for running roughshod over a criminal defendant's due process rights by denying him a lawyer at his preliminary hearing.
News on Tuesday of her impending censure — Wachtman agreed to the sanction — came a day after the commission recommended the same punishment for Palmyra Town Court Judge William Abbott for bullying police into helping him get his keys from his locked car.
Such announcements by the commission are issued once or twice a month, and most of them contain a fact that raises eyebrows: The judges being disciplined don't have law degrees. Wachtman and Abbot are no exception.
New York doesn't require town and village judges to have any legal training whatsoever. They can be college dropouts. They can be beauty school dropouts. All they need is a mandate from voters to take the bench.
With that, and a weeklong crash course in how to be a judge and refresher training annually, they can preside over matters as mundane as a traffic violation and as serious as misdemeanor criminal cases. They can issue orders of protection, evict tenants from their homes, and sentence people to jail.
Is it any wonder, then, that so many of them run afoul of the laws and ethical standards they're obligated to uphold?
Town and village justices comprise less than two-thirds of the roughly 3,400 judges in New York, yet account for 70 percent of the discipline cases brought by the commission. Of those cases, 80 percent of the disciplined judges are non-lawyers, according to the commission.
Why the imbalance? The answer is obvious: Too many town and village justices don't have a firm enough grasp of the legal complexities of their jobs to avoid fouling up and, in the process, robbing people of their rights and eroding confidence in the judiciary.
Wachtman denied a defendant legal representation. Abbott threatened to stop doing arraignments if local police didn't retrieve the keys he locked in his car.
In 2006, The New York Times published an eye-opening series on town and village courts that prompted some badly needed reforms, namely a new rule that all proceedings be recorded and archived.
Before that, there was no audio or transcript of what transpired in a town or village courtroom. Cave drawings depicted a more complete narrative.
But the Times' reporting failed to change the real problem — allowing non-lawyers to play judge. There are roughly 1,100 of these justices in town and village courts. Judges at higher levels of courts are required to hold law degrees.
In January, the head of the judicial conduct commission, Robert Tembekjian, testified before the state Legislature, where he was asked about the discipline imbalance.
"I think there is an advantage to being trained in the law if you're going to be judge, beyond the obvious," Tembekjian replied, eliciting a chuckle from legislators. "I probably don't have to say anything more than that. I think you get it."
Neither the commission nor the Office of Court Administration, the administrative arm of the state's court system, will take a public position on whether judges should be lawyers.
Officials rationalize that making their opinion known could taint public perception of their handling of discipline cases, in the case of the commission, and their support of town and village courts, in the case of the Office of Court Administration.
Non-lawyer justices are a vestige of the colonial era, when lawyers were scarce. Back then, a well-informed citizen with good sense and integrity sufficed. Not anymore.
By the mid-20th century, as criminal procedure grew more complex and law schools flourished, most states moved to populate their benches with judges schooled in jurisprudence. New York stayed in the past.
Twenty-eight states now require all judges presiding over misdemeanor criminal cases to be lawyers. In 14 of the remaining 22 states, criminal defendants sentenced to jail by a non-lawyer judge have the right to seek a new trial before a lawyer-judge.
New York isn't one of them.
Critics of overhauling the system here argue there simply aren't enough lawyers to go around. Of the 182,000 lawyers in New York, 117,000 are in New York City, according to the Office of Court Administration.
But large states, both in population and land area, have managed to modernize. California, Florida, Illinois, and Michigan require their judges to be lawyers. Pennsylvania allows non-lawyer judges to handle only minor civil cases.
Catching up here is a matter of political backbone. Until legislators get one, expect more headlines about small-town judges exercising poor judgment.

ALBANY - Dozens of New York political, union and business leaders are trying to get Amazon to reconsider its decision to abandon its plans for a major campus in Queens.
They have signed an "open letter," set to run in The New York Times on Friday, asking the company to reconsider canceling the Long Island City project. The letter, which Newsday also obtained, says Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo "will take personal responsibility for the project's state approval, and Mayor de Blasio will work together with the governor to manage the community development project." The signees include several members of Congress, including Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-Queens).
Further, the Times reported Cuomo has had several telephone calls with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, pitching him to reconsider. A Cuomo aide declined to confirm the story's account but added the governor has had multiple conversations with company officials.
Cuomo, at an unrelated event Thursday in Old Westbury, said he is trying to get Amazon to reconsider, but said there is no indication it will do so. He didn't say if he had spoken to Bezos. "I've had many conversations with Amazon," he said. "Up until now, we haven't seen any change in their position."
Amazon cited local opposition when it made the shocking Feb. 14 announcement. Critics decried the nearly $3 billion in tax abatements and grants offered by Cuomo and de Blasio to one of the world's richest companies. They also criticized Amazon for saying it would oppose any move to unionize workers and complained that Cuomo and de Blasio put together the offer without any local input.
Amazon pulled out of the deal shortly after a series of tense, closed-door meetings with union and state officials who thought they were making progress with the company. The firm also faced a vocal opponent in State Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens), who represents Long Island City and had been nominated to serve on a state panel that had power over granting some of the incentives offered to Amazon. His nomination since has been withdrawn.
Long Island's six Democratic state senators including Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach) voiced support for the effort Thursday. Cuomo had lashed out at them, and Kaminsky in particular, for not supporting the project with enough enthusiasm and had partly blamed the departure on the Senate's Democratic majority.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday confirmed Andrew Wheeler to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, giving oversight of the nation's air and water to a former coal lobbyist and seasoned Washington insider.
The confirmation formalized a role Wheeler has held in an acting capacity since the summer when President Trump's first administrator, Scott Pruitt, resigned amid multiple ethics inquiries.
The vote, 52-47, went mostly along party lines and underscored partisan divisions over the Trump administration's continued commitment to repealing environmental regulations under Wheeler.
Senator Susan Collins of Maine was the only Republican to vote against Wheeler.
“The policies he has supported as acting administrator are not in the best interest of our environment and public health, particularly given the threat of climate change to our nation," Collins said.
Nearly eight months after taking over the chief role from Pruitt, who was known for his combative style, analysts said Wheeler had brought a change in demeanor to the agency but virtually no difference in policy direction from his predecessor.
Jonathan Adler, a professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law, characterized Wheeler's soft-spoken style and willingness to listen to criticism as genuine. But, he said, “It's not going to mean that his priorities suddenly go away or that he's suddenly going to abandon the regulatory philosophy that the administration from the very top has embraced."
“This is an administration that would like to reduce the overall regulatory footprint of the federal government," Adler said.
New York Times
More in GOP oppose emergency declaration
WASHINGTON — GOP opposition to President Trump's emergency declaration at the border grew in the Senate Thursday, even as Trump warned that fellow Republicans who vote to overturn it are putting themselves "at great jeopardy" politically.
Two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined two Democrats in introducing a disapproval resolution identical to one that passed the House earlier this week. Collins and Murkowski had already announced plans to support a disapproval resolution when it comes to a vote in the Senate, which is expected sometime in the next two weeks.
Trump's move would "turn a border crisis into a constitutional crisis," veteran Senator Lamar Alexander said on the Senate floor. But he stopped just short of saying he'd support a resolution blocking the president's move. Had Alexander pledged his vote, it would probably be enough for the Senate to pass a measure repealing the emergency declaration.
Speaking later to reporters, the Tennessee senator warned of repercussions if Trump doesn't settle for using other money he can access without declaring an emergency.
And Senate Armed Services Committee chairman James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and typically a staunch Trump supporter, said that if he determines Trump's emergency declaration would jeopardize military construction funds, he would be inclined to vote to overturn it.
Along with Collins and Murkowski, Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, has also announced plans to support a disapproval resolution to nullify Trump's emergency declaration.
The disapproval resolution requires only a simple majority vote to pass the Senate, meaning only four Republicans would have to break ranks to ensure its passage, given unified Democratic support for overturning Trump's move.
Yet, it seems unlikely that the House and Senate could garner the two-thirds majorities that would be needed to override a veto.

CONFRONTING ACADEMIA'S TIES TO SLAVERY AND REPARATIONS

Texto completo: Headnote * A BLACK PERSPECTIVE LARRY AUBRY
Reparations for the descendants of African slaves has been talked about ad infinitum, yet there has been virtually no legislative action taken to make this happen. (Congressman John Conyers could not even to get a reparations bill out of committee for more than twenty years-to simply do a study on reparations.) Today's column summarizes a "major" conference at Harvard University about slavery, universities and reparations. A New York Times article by Jennifer Schussler, Confronting Academia's Ties to Slavery, recaps the conference.
In my opinion, the most important thing is whether this, and similar conferences, actually commit to advocating for reparations for the descendants of African Slaves in America.
"In 1976, archivists at Harvard's Natural History Museum opened a drawer and discovered a haunting portrait of a shirtless enslaved man named Renty. Taken on a South Carolina plantation in 1850, it had been used by the Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz to formulate his nowdiscredited ideas about racial difference.
On March 3, 1917, Harvard's president Drew Gilpin Faust headed a "major" public conference exploring the long-neglected collaborations between universities, slavery and reparations. Harvard had been "directly complicit" in slavery, Ms. Faust acknowledged. 'Only by coming to terms with history can we free ourselves to create a more just world," she said. The gathering, which drew an overflow crowd of about 500, featured a keynote address by writer Ta-Nehisi Coates. The audience included researchers from more than 30 campuses. Between sessions, one scholar was heard saying that "something we've been talking about for 200 years has suddenly become urgent."
Alfred L. Brophy, a legal historian at the University of North Carolina and the author of University, Court and Slave, a study of proslavery thought at antebellum Southern colleges, described what he called a "sea change" in attitude. "Now the people doing this work are lifted up." (Really?)
The historical connections between universities and slavery first came to the fore in 2001, when a group of Yale graduate students issued an independent report aimed at puncturing what they saw as the school's selective celebration of its abolitionist past. In 2003, the Brown University president announced a major effort to research that school's extensive historical ties to the slave trade. While the move grabbed headlines, "there wasn't a single peep from another university."
Since then, scholars at Harvard, Princeton, William and Mary, Georgetown, the University of Virginia, Rutgers and numerous other schools have done slavery research, sometimes seeing it embraced by administrators only in response to campus activism- the students have been the one group to keep the conversation alive.
Research on the topic has been shadowed by the specter of reparations. In his address, Mr. Coates, who wrote "The Case for Reparations," a widely discussed 2014 article in The Atlantic, recalled when whites reacted to the mere mention of reparations, it was as if "You'd just suggested human sacrifice or something."
The dismissal in 2004 of a major reparations lawsuit against corporations seems to have removed the legal threat against universities, which had also been identified as potential targets. But Mr. Coates said that the moral claim was undeniable. "I think every one of these universities needs to give reparations.I don't know how you conduct research showing your very existence is rooted in a great crime and then you say 'Well, sorry and walk away.'" No other speakers explicitly endorsed financial reparations, but it was a sentiment shared throughout the audience.
The Harvard conference, organized by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, was an initiative of Ms. Faust, a distinguished historian of the Civil War and the American South. Last March, (1916) after student protests over racially charged symbols on campus and related issues, she published an oped article in the Harvard Crimson calling for fuller acknowledgement of the "mostly untold story" of Harvard and slavery.
Research published, without any Harvard imprimatur, in 2011 and now incorporated into an official university website unveiled for the conference, described the ways Harvard "was built at least partly on the violence on the slave trader, the Middle Passage, the auction block and the whip." There were gasps when a panelist recounted how Isaac Royall, Jr., a West Indian planter whose financial gifts led to the founding of Harvard Law School, helped brutally put down a slave rebellion on Antigua, during which dozens were drawn and quartered or burned at the stake.
Other speakers brought the story closer to the present, described how Harvard in 1899 created a tropical research station on a sugar plantation in Cuba, owned by a planter made rich from slavery. (Slavery had been abolished in Cuba only 13 years earlier.) The plantation owner also made significant donations to the school in what was just one of many ways that slavery helped build "the vast educational resources Harvard still enjoys today."
The question of who gets access to those resources hung over the day's events. An M.I.T. participant said that research into universities and slavery can promote not just knowledge of the past but justice and inclusion in the present. Universities once worried that studies of slavery and reparations which somehow "tarnish our gates" In fact, they opened them.
The most important thing is that universities and colleges commit to concrete actions supportive of their research findings that confirm the need for reparations for the descendants of African slaves in America.

Texto completo: Nothing can warm the soul of a winter-ravaged Iowan more than a good laugh.
Thank God for Floodwater Comedy Festival, because it's been a bit too cold for most Iowa City residents. The annual comedy festival is back this week to provide three days of comedy events sure to have audiences rolling on the floor laughing, or at least chuckling a bit.
Running Thursday through Saturday at various venues across downtown, the event features Hollywood comedy stars, rising New York City comedy scene talents, comedy veterans and locals showing off their comedy chops.
For those interested in attending multiple events, a pass that will get you into all shows is available for $55 online through littlevillagetickets.com. Tickets for individual events can be bought as well.
All proceeds raised by the festival go towards the Johnson County Crisis Center and the National Alliance on Mental Illness. So don't be stingy, Iowa City. Pony up some money to laugh and raise money for good causes with Floodwater.
Here are the highlights that will make you kick yourself in the keister if you miss them:
An Evening with Paul Rust Paul Rust is a comedian and actor who graduated from the University of Iowa in 2004. You probably know him as co-star of the Netflix show "Love," created by Rust, his wife Lesley Arfin and comedy legend Judd Apatow.
Rust is returning to town in a collaboration between Floodwater and the UI Theatre Department. Held at 6:30 p.m. Saturday at The Mill, the event will feature Rust and students from the department recreating sketches he wrote while a member of the Upright Citizens Brigade comedy troupe. Following will be a question-and-answer session. The event is $8 for online pre-sale tickets, $10 at the door. Doors open at 6 p.m.
Musical comedian Catherine Cohen One of the rising stars of the New York City comedy scene, Catherine Cohen is part of a new wave of comedians combining stand up with with their musical skills.
She was recently featured in a New York Times story about the resurgence of musical comedians, calling her performance character "a preposterously preening, rigorously self-regarding, sexually arrogant diva in Lululemon leggings" who makes "jokes you can hum." Her performances sometimes resemble more of a musical than a stand up performance.
Cohen will perform at 9 p.m. Friday at Blue Moose Tap House with comedian Henry Koperski serving as an opener. Tickets are $12 online or $15 at the door.
Dante Powell album recording Originally from Louisiana, comedian Dante PowellI has been working the comedy scene in Des Moines lately, telling plenty of jokes about the extreme differences between the South and Iowa.

Other comedians performing include host Jake McDowell, Amanda Cohen of Los Angeles and Robert Flanagan of Chicago.
Tickets are $5 online, $7 at the door.
Solomon Georgio Hailing from Seattle, comedian Solomon Georgio is one of the most nationally respected comedians performring at Floodwater.
He's appeared on Conan O'Brien's late night show and been featured as an actor on Comedy Central's "Drunk History" and HBO's "Crashing." He's even worked as a writer on "SpongeBob SquarePants."
Georgio will perform 9 p.m. Saturday at The Mill. Opening acts include host Matt Jacobsen, Kristin Lytie of Green Bay, Wisconsin and Dan Umthun of Des Moines. Tickets are $12 online pr $15 at the door.
Student showcase at the Yacht Club While the festival is bringing nationally-touring comedians to town, Floodwater will also spotlight a series of UI student comedians.

The UI students who will perform are: Max Alders, Elin Dejus, Amy Evans, Ryan Foy, Reagan Hansen, Keegan Konsor, Brigid Martin, Griffin Murray, Clara Reynen, Brian Shaw, Paige Stevens and Austin Yerington. Four ISU student comedians will also perform.

Iowa City Police Log Chris Patton started one of the most popular Iowa City Twitter accounts, Iowa City Police Log, years ago as a way to show the weird crimes police respond to on a daily basis.
For Floodwater, Patton will read and share some of the more ridiculous posts on the ICPD Police Activity Log and have the scenarios acted out by 12 different comedians.
The event will be held at 10 p.m. Thursday at The Mill. Tickets are $5 in advance, $7 at the door.
Panic! at Floodwater One of the more unique events at the festival, Panic! is an event where eight different comedians will take the stage standing in front of a screen. Images will be projected behind them and they will have to improvise what happens next.
Panic! starts at 7 p.m. Friday at the Yacht Club. Tickets are $5 in advance and $7 at the door.
Local improv showcase Three different Iowa City-based improv comedy troupes will be at the center of the Organic, Homegrown Improve event.

Texto completo: Getting noticed: Midwestern blues singer-songwriter Samantha Fish will perform an 8 p.m. March 15 show at downtown Bloomington's Castle Theatre.
Fish is just 29 but has already racked up rave reviews for her work. The New York Times called her "an impressive blues guitarist who sings with sweet power" and "one of the genre's most promising young talents." Her hometown paper, The Kansas City Star, said Fish "displays more imagination and creativity than some blues veterans exhibit over the course of their careers."
Her fifth studio album, 2017's "Belle of the West," showcases both her acoustic guitar skills as well as her rootsy, emotional songwriting.
Tickets for Fish's show are $17 in advance or $20 the day of show, and on sale now via Ticketfly.com.
Southern rock in Central Illinois: 90s rockers Gov't Mule will headline a spring show at Peoria's Monarch Music Hall at 8 p.m. April 19.
Mule, as the band is known, will spend three months on the road this spring and summer in celebration of its 20th anniversary. Its roots began in 1994 as a side project by Allman Brothers Band members Warren Haynes and Allen Woody, who died in 2000.
Today, the quartet includes Haynes, drummer Matt Abts, bassist Jorgen Carlsson and Danny Louis on keyboards and guitar. Mule's latest album, 2017's "Revolution Come Revolution Go," threads together country, soul and rock to become what Haynes called, "probably the most diverse record weve ever made."
Tickets for Mule's Peoria show are $30 in advance, $35 at the door, and go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday via Ticketfly.com.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The attorney general for the District of Columbia has subpoenaed documents from President Trump's inaugural committee, the third governmental body to delve into how the fund raised $107 million and spent it to celebrate Mr. Trump's swearing-in.
The latest subpoena follows similar demands for documents by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and by New Jersey's attorney general. It cites a civil statute that governs the operation of nonprofit organizations like the inaugural committee.
No other recent inaugural committee has generated such intense scrutiny of its finances. Typically short lived, the committees are charged with staging balls, concerts and black-tie dinners in the nation's capital during inauguration week.
Mr. Trump's inaugural committee raised and spent at least twice as much as its predecessors, but it ended in acrimony amid allegations of misspent funds. Federal prosecutors are examining whether foreigners illegally contributed to events using Americans as straw donors, a possible violation of criminal law. New Jersey authorities appear to be examining whether the committee obeyed civil statutes governing how nonprofit organizations raise funds, among other matters.
Karl A. Racine, the Washington attorney general, appears to be looking for any evidence of self-dealing. Under the local statute, a court can dissolve a nonprofit organization for a variety of reasons, including if a judge finds that it has misspent or squandered money.
According to a copy of the subpoena obtained by The New York Times, investigators are seeking to determine whether funds "were wasted, mismanaged and/or improperly provided private benefit, causing the committee to exceed or abuse its authority or act contrary to its nonprofit purpose."
It seeks documents showing payments to the Trump International Hotel or the Trump Organization, including any communications related to "the pricing of venue rentals." The committee, which is registered as a business in the District of Columbia, paid Mr. Trump's hotel $1.5 million for guest rooms, meals and the use of a ballroom.
The subpoena requests documents identifying what role three of Mr. Trump's adult children -- Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump -- played on the committee. None of them had any official role in running the committee, which was overseen by Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a billionaire and friend of Mr. Trump.
Investigators also named the Fairmont Hotel and AccorHotels, a firm that owns the hotel's management company. The Fairmont received $1.56 million in inaugural funds for guest rooms that the Republican National Committee booked, together with rooms at other hotels, before the inaugural committee was formed, former officials said.
Mr. Barrack's investment firm owned less than 5 percent of AccorHotels and sold it in February 2017 in a transaction planned long before the inauguration, a representative said.
The subpoena seeks records of any payments to any committee official or official's business, any agreements with a vendor in which a committee official had a financial interest and the committee's conflict of interest policies.
The bulk of the Trump committee's funds came from major corporations, such as AT&T, or wealthy Republican donors, such as Sheldon G. Adelson. Much of the money was spent on a concert at the Lincoln Memorial, three inaugural balls, several candlelight dinners and payroll.
A spokesman for Mr. Racine declined to comment on the subpoena. A spokesman for the committee said officials were in touch with Mr. Racine's office about the inquiry.
Mr. Racine and Brian E. Frosh, the Maryland attorney general, have been pursuing a lawsuit claiming that Mr. Trump's continued involvement in his business empire violates anticorruption clauses of the Constitution -- a groundbreaking case that appears ultimately headed to the Supreme Court.

Texto completo: “Si Maduro no podía aguantar una entrevista de Jorge Ramos, no se debió sentar con él”, afirmó tras llegar a Miami, deportada desde Venezuela, la productora María Martínez-Guzmán, vicepresidenta de Univision Noticias , miembro del grupo retenido el lunes durante una entrevista fallida con Nicolás Maduro en el Palacio de Miraflores.
“Pensábamos que (Maduro) se podría parar” de la entrevista, “pero nunca pensábamos que nos iban a confiscar los equipos. Confiscar no es la palabra. Nos robaron nuestros equipos “, dijo Martínez-Guzmán. “Los que más bruscos estaban, los más toscos, eran cubanos”, afirmó convencida sobre el entorno de Maduro, por ser ella cubano estadounidense.
Maduro interrumpió la entrevista luego de 17 minutos, dijo el mexicano Ramos. “Para frustración de los agentes de seguridad, María (Martínez-Guzmán) se las arregló para hacer una llamada fugaz al presidente de Univisión News, Daniel Coronell, quien a su vez le advirtió al Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos y anunció a muchos medios de comunicación lo que estaba pasando”.
“Si le hacen esto a Jorge Ramos, imagínate lo que les pasa a otros periodistas en Venezuela”, comentó Elyangélica González, corresponsal venezolana de Univision, asilada en Florida.
“Nos apuntaron con una pistola en la cabeza por 30 segundos”, declaró el también periodista mexicano Pedro Ultreras en referencia a otro episodio durante su estadía el fin de semana en la zona fronteriza con Colombia. “Pensamos que nos iban a matar”.
“El gobierno de Maduro se aferra a que el mundo no conozca lo que pasa en ese país”, sentenció Ultreras en referencia a la difícil labor de los periodistas locales y extranjeros en esa nación. “Los colectivos son sicarios del gobierno”, agregó.
Ultreras viajó a Venezuela para cubrir la crisis que atraviesa el país suramericano y allá comenzó a ser perseguido por unos sujetos con perdigones. Según el canal, él no sabía si eran miembros de la Guardia Nacional o colectivos paramilitares fieles a Maduro.
Logró escapar, pero luego enfrentó otro momento de pánico cuando le apuntaron con una pistola. “Era (una situación) muy difícil, para luego llegar a Caracas”, relató en referencia al episodio que vivió el equipo de Ramos el lunes.
Según el Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Prensa (SNTP) de Venezuela, en lo que va de año suman “al menos 30 detenciones de periodistas y trabajadores de los medios” en ese país.
El martes, mientras el equipo de Univision era deportado, el corresponsal Daniel Garrido de Telemundo News también fue detenido por agentes de Maduro.
Ramos resumió su experiencia en una columna en español que publicó hoy The New York Times , titulada “El dictador de Venezuela se gana su título”.
“Fui deportado de Venezuela el martes 26 de febrero después de una entrevista tirante con Nicolás Maduro, el mandatario del país. En medio de nuestra conversación se levantó y se fue, y sus agentes de seguridad confiscaron nuestras cámaras, las tarjetas de memoria con la grabación y nuestros celulares. Sí, Maduro se robó la entrevista para que nadie pudiera verla”, es parte del artículo.
Aquí va mi columna para The New York Times en español sobre lo que nos pasó en Venezuela.

Mark Bittman serves up dinner ideas in new cookbook

Texto completo: Cookbook author and food activist Mark Bittman is known for tackling big topics. His 1998 "How to Cook Everything," revised for a 10th anniversary edition in 2008, is an award-winning encyclopedia of 2,000 recipes. It's considered a "Joy of Cooking" for a new generation, a hefty, one-stop reference with a style that's relaxed, thorough and flexible.
Since then, he's written 15 other cookbooks, including "How to Cook Vegetarian," "How to Bake Everything" and last year's "How to Grill Everything."
His new cookbook takes on the challenge of getting dinner on the table. "Dinner for Everyone" is organized by 100 iconic dishes - Bittman prefers to call them "concepts" - that are done three ways: easy, vegan and "all out." For paella, there's Shrimp Paella Under the Broiler (the easy dish), Vegetable Paella with ripe tomatoes, green beans and eggplant, and the more complex Mixed Paella With Mussels. The Korean barbecue concept has an easy Roasted BBQ Brisket, Seared Rice Cakes as the vegan dish, and a 10-hour project, Korean BBQ at Home.
In a recent phone interview, I asked him how he arrived at dinner as his next topic.
"The meal that people are going to cook most often is dinner," he said. "It seemed like a good idea at the time. As we got deeper and deeper into it, we had this idea for a kind of umbrella with three things underneath it. It started as good, better, best, or something like that. We ultimately decided that instead of going from good to better to best, we would do these three different things.
"I think here are the three things that people want: They want fast and easy because everybody claims they don't have enough time, and a lot of people don't know how to cook, and obviously learning how to cook fast and easy is the way to start.
"People know they need to be eating more plant food, so they want to know how to eat more plant food.
"And then there's cooking for friends and family ... relaxing and cooking over time and doing things the right way, in a leisurely and sometimes more luxurious fashion. It's a show of nurturing, a show of love. Not that cooking fast isn't. But you know, it's a social occasion with really good food that you have spent some time on. It's something to celebrate. I haven't done recipes like that in a while and I wanted the opportunity to do those."
Bittman said it wasn't easy to come up with vegan versions for all 100 concepts, but those are the recipes he's most proud of.
"You know, I think the vegan recipes are the most exciting part of this book, frankly," he said. "They are the best vegan recipes you'll find. I think they are really good."
Leaning toward vegetables
Bittman's philosophy about food is largely flexitarian, a diet that is high in plant foods but includes some meat and fish. He said he doubts he'll ever be a vegetarian, but he advocates adding more plant food to our diets, for both health and environmental reasons.
His distinguished career has included many years as a food writer and columnist at the New York Times. His "Minimalist" recipe column ran in the Times' Dining section for 13 years and he also was lead food writer for the New York Times Magazine. Then, in 2011, he became a columnist for that paper's op-ed page. It was said to be the first "food-focused" opinion column at a major newspaper.
In those columns and two essay-style books, "Food Matters" in 2009 and "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00" in 2013, Bittman explored difficult topics about food politics, such as the deterioration of the American diet with the rise of convenience and nutrient-poor foods, and how global livestock production is hastening climate change.
"I think around 2000, even in the late '90s, I could see that food was going in a less-than-wonderful direction," he said. "Right after I wrote 'How To Cook Everything,' I started to think about 'How To Cook Vegetarian.' That was really an important moment. ... I thought the writing was on the wall and we were going to be eating more plant foods, and that it was important to be able to cook them. It was kind of a 10-year journey. And it hasn't let up, really."
A decade after the publication of "Food Matters," he said he feels people are getting the message. Watching the Super Bowl, he noticed commercials promoting sustainability and denouncing junk food.
"This is ridiculous to say - it sounds self-congratulatory - but I think 'Food Matters' and even to some extent 'VB6' were before their time," he said. "But they weren't wrong. There's a lot being said about this stuff now. To the extent that they were influential, great. I think that now is the time.
"I think that the awareness level is really, really high. I'm more hopeful and optimistic than I've been for a long time."
He said he believes the "eat local" movement - eating food that's grown or produced close to where you live - should be considered "more of a direction than a religion," but added: "I think it's important to look for and support local food."
No longer writing for the New York Times, Bittman is a member of the faculty at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. He's currently living in a small town 60 miles north of New York City. Although he said he's not able to cook every day, he cooks when he's at home.
"I was home all weekend so I cooked all weekend," he said. "We made a lasagna for Super Bowl. I don't know the last time I made a lasagna, but there you go. That was really fun."
Vegetable Paella
From "Dinner for Everyone" by Mark Bittman
Salt
8 ounces ripe tomatoes, chopped
Pepper
4 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
1 1/2 cups short-grain brown rice
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
8 ounces green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 red bell pepper, cored and sliced
1 small eggplant, chopped
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 teaspoons paprika
Large pinch saffron threads
2 to 3 cups vegetable stock or water
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, for garnish
Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and salt it. Put the tomatoes in a medium bowl, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and drizzle them with 1 tablespoon olive oil; toss gently to coat.
When the water boils, stir in the rice and adjust the heat so that the water bubbles steadily. Cook, stirring once or twice, for 12 minutes, then drain thoroughly.
Put the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion softens, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Add the green beans, bell pepper and eggplant to the skillet, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring once in a while, until browned in spots but still crisp, 5 to 10 minutes; add more oil if the mixture looks too dry. Transfer to the bowl and toss to combine; taste and adjust the seasoning.
Add the rice to the pan and stir until shiny and toasted, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste, paprika and saffron and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add 2 cups stock; stir gently to combine. The rice should be submerged by 1/2 inch; if not, add a little more liquid.
Scatter the browned vegetables on top, followed by the tomatoes; drizzle with any accumulated juices. Put the pan in the oven and cook, undisturbed, for 15 minutes. Check to see if the rice is dry and just tender. If not, return the pan to the oven for another 5 minutes. If the rice looks too dry at this point but still isn't quite done, add a small amount of stock or water. When the rice is ready, turn off the oven and let it sit for at least 5 and up to 15 minutes. Garnish with the parsley and serve.

Texto completo: The U.S. military blocked internet access to a Russian entity seeking to sow discord among Americans during the 2018 midtermelections, several U.S. officials said, a warning that the group's operations against the U.S. are not cost-free.
The strike on the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, a company underwritten by an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, was part of the first offensive cyber campaign against Russia designed to thwart attempts to interfere with a U.S. election, the officials said.
"They basically took the IRA offline," according to one individual familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. "They shut 'em down."
The operation marked the first muscle-flexing by U.S. Cyber Command, with intelligence from the National Security Agency, under new authorities it was granted by President Donald Trump and Congress last year to bolster offensive capabilities.
Russia's tactics are evolving, and some analysts were skeptical of the deterrent value on either the Russian troll factory or on Putin, who, according to U.S. officials, ordered an "influence" campaign in 2016 to undermine faith in U.S. democracy. Officials have also assessed that the Internet Research Agency works on behalf of the Kremlin.
Cyber Command and the NSA declined to comment.
Disruption to Internet Research Agency networks took place as Americans went to the polls and a day or so afterward, as the votes were tallied, to prevent the Russians from mounting a disinformation campaign casting doubt on results, according to officials.
The blockage was so frustrating to the trolls that they complained to their system administrators about the disruption, the officials said.
The Internet Research Agency, according to federal prosecutors, is financed by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a tycoon from St. Petersburg and an ally of Putin. Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency and a company Prigozhin runs called Concord Management and Consulting, were among 16 Russian individuals and companies that a grand jury indicted a year ago as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Another element of the Cyber Command campaign, first reported by the New York Times, involved "direct messaging" that targeted the trolls as well as hackers who work for the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. Using emails, pop-ups, text or direct messages, U.S. operatives beginning last October let the Russians know that their real names and online handles were known and they should not interfere in other nations' affairs, defense officials said.

Media no longer merit legal shield

Texto completo: I write in response to your Feb. 21 editorial - "Our View: Landmark 1964 Supreme Court case protects a free press" - and your remarks about Justice Clarence Thomas' proposal to reconsider the case.
While you make interesting comments regarding history, it is not altogether relevant to the world today.
The New York Times still proclaims that it publishes "all the news that's fit to print," but the days are long gone when they tracked down the content for accurate and truthful reporting, and, importantly, refused to print that which they could not track down, as well as that of dubious, unsubstantiated accuracy.
Social media and other "news" sources have adulterated this process, so the Times, and others, feel compelled to print news "products" that are being aired by the array of competitor news outlets.
Some of these reports turn out to have been entirely fabricated, or twisted in interpretation, and some of the results are indeed harmful to the targets, often unfairly as well as inaccurately. I cannot give the reporting organizations a pass if they continue to claim to print only what readers may rely upon as truthful and accurate, and this reporting, because it isn't and hasn't been checked, does real harm to someone wrongly reported.
People have relied upon newspapers for reliable reporting, but perhaps that should now be replaced by disclaimers.

Teacher 'advocacy' ban would shut down dissent
I just finished reading L.D. 589, Rep. Lawrence Lockman's bill "Directing the State Board of Education To Adopt Rules Prohibiting Teachers in Public Schools from Engaging in Political, Ideological or Religious Advocacy in the Classroom." It's a terrible bill. Really. It's stunningly antithetical to the concept of critical thought and debate that happens within a democratic society and is learned in our classrooms across the state.
L.D. 589 amounts to state-sponsored censorship of speech, based on an ill-conceived specter of liberal bias in our public school system. It's incredibly disingenuous and clearly obvious that the bill presents what Rep. Lockman believes to be a fair balancing of a partisan public school system.
The irony is how extremely partisan this bill is. As an example, per Section 2, No. 9, the rules would bar a teacher from "segregating students according to race or singling out one racial group of students as responsible for the suffering or inequities experienced by another racial group of students."
What he clearly means to state here is that the historical inequities of racism cannot be blamed on white people. Rep. Lockman should at least be honest about this point. So, in essence, he is asking for a rewriting of American history. This is tantamount to amending the stain of racism, in order to expunge the conscience of those who are unwilling to accept historical inequity. This is alarming and intellectually dishonest.
Rep. Lockman's bill is a small-minded attempt to do an end run around the reality of living in a pluralistic society by shutting down dissension and opinions that differ from his own. The people of Maine deserve better than this terrible bill, and more from elected officials like him.

Paid-time-off bill would benefit many in Maine
When I founded The Szanton Co. in 1996, I could only hope that one day we would celebrate our 23rd anniversary. We've been able to grow and thrive - developing 552 affordable, quality apartment units - because our employees know that we value them.
We offer significant "earned time," which employees can use for vacation, bereavement, sick time - whatever they want. Allowing our employees to recover from an illness or care for a sick family member is one of the things that has helped us retain quality employees.
I'm proud of that, but also sad that a third of Maine's low-wage workers, who can least afford to miss a paycheck, can't take the day off when they or a child is sick.
That's why I support L.D. 369, state Sen. Rebecca Millett's bill to allow all workers in Maine to earn paid sick time. For businesses like mine that already offer "earned time" or "paid time off," the legislation would not change anything. It would just require that employees be allowed to use up to five of those existing days to recover from an illness or care for a sick family member. It wouldn't change anything for my business, but it would mean a lot to thousands of working Mainers.

Call on Maine senators to back Green New Deal
The Senate is soon going to vote on the Green New Deal. The move to rush a vote on the plan is being led by Mitch McConnell in an attempt to stifle constructive work on this newly drafted proposal. Like any new proposal, this document will need time to be reviewed, revised and edited before it is ready to be voted on. Bringing it to a vote so quickly stops that work.
The people of the United States deserve and demand that our country aggressively address climate change. That is what the Green New Deal, brought forward by Sen. Edward Markey and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, plans to do.
The Green New Deal will keep us safe from climate change and create millions of new green jobs. It is a common-sense policy that is popular with the American people and people from all around the world.
I ask, why would we not want this? It is because many of our political leaders take massive sums of money from oil lobbyists. Please contact your senators and demand that they support the Green New Deal.

Sick-time bill would let parents tend to ailing children
I have been a social worker for 22 years. I have seen the costly effects of people not having sick leave. I have seen parents struggle when they or their children are ill. When children are sick, parents are faced with a choice: Stay home or go to work.
Some parents have to go to work despite their child being sick. The child may be left home alone or sent to school. Sending a sick child to school is clearly not a parent's preferred option, but sometimes it is the only option. Schools frown on families sending sick kids to school, but what is a single parent to do?
Parents are forced to make difficult decisions in order to keep their jobs and provide for their families. Staying home and missing work leads to lost income, which causes financial hardship, especially for families living paycheck to paycheck. It can also place a person's job in jeopardy. I knew a number of parents who lost their jobs from having to call in sick. What are they to do if their child has the flu, which lasts five to seven days? What happens when they have multiple children, who may be sick for several weeks?
Containing the contagion and keeping the sick child at home keeps the rest of the school population healthy. Isn't that what we should be aspiring to? Healthy schools where everyone can optimally learn? This is a public health issue - workers with paid sick days will help reduce the spread of the flu.
This is why I am happy to see that the state Legislature is taking on the issue of paid sick days this year. I am a firm believer in paid sick days, and I hope the Legislature sides with me on this.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- An American citizen who was abducted nearly 18 months ago in the Yemeni city of Sana was freed last week and has been reunited with his family, President Trump announced on Monday.
Danny Lavone Burch, an engineer at a Yemeni oil company, has been "recovered and reunited with his wife and children," Mr. Trump tweeted aboard Air Force One as he flew toward Vietnam, where he is to meet this week with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.
"I appreciate the support of the United Arab Emirates in bringing Danny home," the president wrote. "Danny's recovery reflects the best of what the United States & its partners can accomplish."
Mr. Trump did not specify how Mr. Burch, who is married to a Yemeni woman, was freed. It also was not clear who had abducted Mr. Burch, although former American officials said he was not being held by Al Qaeda.
Working closely with American forces, the United Arab Emirates has stationed ground troops in Yemen to fight Houthi rebels in the country's ongoing civil war. American officials have previously told The New York Times that freeing Mr. Burch likely would have required a raid; a State Department spokesman on Monday said the United Arab Emirates was "crucial" to securing his release.
Two American officials discussed the details of the case on Monday on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Burch, who had been working for oil companies in Yemen for years, was 63 when he was forced from his car by unidentified gunmen in September 2017. At the time, Nadia Forsa, Mr. Burch's wife, said in a phone interview that "they did it in broad daylight in front of everyone."
Kidnappings of Americans and other Westerners are common in Yemen, a poor country that has been devastated by years of civil unrest. Houthi rebels and affiliates of Al Qaeda often attempt to ransom hostages for money or accuse them of being spies.
At the time of Mr. Burch's abduction, no group claimed responsibility.
Mr. Burch began working on oil rigs in Yemen in the mid-1990s. He traveled between the United States and Yemen before moving there permanently, according to Stephen Burch, his son from his first marriage, in an interview shortly after he was taken in 2017.
Stephen Burch said then that his father had divorced his first wife and had virtually no contact with him or his other children from the first marriage.
In his tweets on Monday, Mr. Trump said recovering American hostages "is a priority of my Admin, and with Danny's release, we have now secured freedom for 20 American captives since my election victory."

Pre-Civil War Butler House survived into 1920s

Texto completo: On the western edge of downtown, the no-frills, mom-and-pop Butler House was an old friend to the weary traveler and local resident alike. The hotel doubled as an economy boarding house, so its ambiance was always more welcoming, working class and west side than its more stylish downtown competitors.
For some 35 years, John Preston Press Butler, his wife Elizabeth Lizzie Kavanaugh Butler and their adult children owned and operated the place, which also served as their family home.
Located at the northwest corner of Madison and Front streets, the three-story, wood-frame hotel already had a rich history before the Butlers came into the picture in the mid-1880s. It appears the hotel opened for business way back in 1856 or 1857, in the decade before the Civil War, and was first known as the Bronson House and then the Denman House.
In its early years, the hotel regularly changed hands, and for a long time it was known as the St. Nicholas Hotel. Press and Lizzie Butler began running the hotel in 1884-1885, changing its name from the Waits New Hotel (its most recent incarnation) to the Butler House
In the latter half of the 19th century there were few Bloomington residents as intriguing as Press Butler. He weighs not over 130 pounds, is short in stature, and of slender build, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy mustache and goatee, noted The Pantagraph. He is the impersonation of self-reliance, grit, and cool courage. His nerve and pluck have been tested time and again, and have never failed.
Butler first gained a local reputation as a daring Bloomington firefighter in the era of volunteer companies. By the mid-1880s, he was a private detective of considerable fame. His exploits included a lengthy gun battle at Bloomingtons west-side Union Depot ending in the capture (and eventual conviction and imprisonment) of a notorious forger and safe-blower.
In 1888, the Butlers erected a handsome four-story brick addition to their hotel facing Madison Street. The 24-room north-side addition was designed by Bloomington architect George H. Miller, whose many local buildings include the old Moses Montefiore Temple on Prairie Street, and the Central Fire Station (now Epiphany Farms Restaurant) on Front Street.
With the George Miller addition, the Butler House offered 64 rooms, as well as a bar, billiard room, and barber shop. Even so, the original part of the hotel, in all its creaky, wood-frame antebellum glory, meant that the Butler place was never a direct competitor to the larger and finer hotels of sturdy brick in the heart of downtown, such as the Ashley House on the northwest corner of the courthouse square, and the Phoenix Hotel on Center Street between Jefferson and Monroe.
In July 1887, a Hoopeston baseball club traveled to Bloomington for a scheduled game against the local nine. It was the practice back then for the hometown boys to cover the visitors hotel and traveling expenses. They stopped at the Butler House, but desired a high-priced house, and accordingly moved to the Phoenix, recounted The Pantagraph. The Bloomington management refused to pay the difference, and the Hoopestons paid their own bill and left the account in the hands of (McLean County) Judge (Colostin) Myers to collect.
Perhaps because of its well-worn appearance and casual atmosphere, the Butler House had a reputation for attracting colorful characters. In early December 1893, for example, circus great William Sparks, aka the American Hercules, breathed his last in one of the rooms. Sparks, known for the cannon ball act, traveled with Barnum, Ringling and other top-tier circuses for three decades. According to The Pantagraph, he developed a morphine habit six years earlier after being horribly burned during a performance mishap. Sparks had been staying at the Butler House for about a week with his daughter after failing to free himself of his addiction at the Keeley Institute in Dwight. His death made The New York Times.
The Butler House also served as the stage for some wild scenes, more than a few involving fisticuffs, knives, firearms, or, on at least one occasion, a hefty chunk of lumber. In April 1916, two obstreperous amateur boxers, John Chick Hayes and Jimmie Gardner, caused a ruckus in the Butler House parlor until they met their match in Capt. (later known as Major) E.C. Butler, one of Press and Lizzies sons. Wielding a sap, Butler knocked one of the pugilists across a chair, and the two troublemakers spent the night in jail, charged with drunkenness and disorderly conduct.
Press Butler died Jan. 28, 1918, at the age of 79. The following fall, Lizzie Butler and her son, Major E.C. Butler and his family, all of whom had been living at the hotel/boarding house, moved into an apartment building on North Main Street. They then rented out the family business, and in its final years the Butler House became known as the Butler Hotel.
After the move, Lizzie Butler lived a few months more before passing away Feb. 8, 1920. Her life was characterized by kindness, eulogized The Pantagraph. Few women have been so universally loved and her death has thrown a pall of sadness over the wide circle of friendship, which had spread around her during her long residence in the heart of the city.
An executors sale was held three weeks later, but the bids were deemed too low, so the family decided it best to raze the three-story wood-frame hotel and sell the lot. The four-story brick addition was left standing.
The historic hostelry then came down in the summer of 1922, the framing dismantled and carted off for reuse elsewhere. The hotel is the oldest in the city and is one of the noted landmarks in this section of the country, reflected The Pantagraph.
A filling station later replaced the Butler House corner, as the periphery of downtown became the increasing domain of businesses serving the automobile  from service garages to dealer showrooms.
The brick addition facing Madison Street remained standing into the 1950s, and the faded letters spelling Butler House could be read on its north wall for many years. During the Great Depression, the building served as a shelter for the homeless and then became Sheeneys Tavern.
Between 1956 and 1961, this building and the remaining ones on the southern half of the block bounded Madison, Front, Roosevelt, and Washington streets were razed.
Today, the Butler House lot is an underutilized eyesore; one more surface parking lot in a downtown blighted by them. The Butler name survives into our denuded present because the city-owned space is called the Major Butler Lot, the Major part apparently a nod to either one or both of Press and Elizabeth Butlers sons.
William Butler served as a major in the Spanish-American War, and his brother Edward as a captain, though later on Edward became known as Major Butler as well, though whether he officially attained that rank is unknown.

Texto completo: Eventually, someone who writes on public policy comes up against the limits of words. There are only so many times you can urge, condemn, cajole, wheedle, praise, remind, prod, propose and coax before your vocabulary and patience both give out. This is not to say that public argumentation makes no difference. But for a columnist, that influence consists mainly of throwing 750 words over a high wall and hoping they land with a pleasing thud on some doer or decider.
Having mastered the arts of opinion writing, cultural criticism and human decency, David Brooks of The New York Times is now undertaking a project at the Aspen Institute called "Weave," designed to recognize and help people directly involved in social repair. In the work of lighting candles to push back the darkness, Brooks wants to be a lamplighter.
The metaphor Brooks prefers is textile production. Many people are involved in the unholy work of ripping and shredding our social fabric — through dehumanizing language, racial prejudice and other evidence of tribalism. The groups Brooks highlights are the weavers, laying down the warp and weft of communities. They promote community dialogue and deal with various categories of need from youth development to suicide prevention. But they share the goal of strengthening human ties, trust and reciprocity as alternatives to isolation, loneliness and despair.
I’ve been familiar with, and occasionally involved in, efforts to praise and encourage the work of community and religious groups providing compassionate social services. I’ve been involved in efforts to promote volunteer service as a method of social mixing and an alternative to the general selfishness of our culture. Brooks’ effort involves a more ambitious framing, designed to be the intellectual scaffold (to employ another metaphor) on which a movement is built.
In his manifesto, Brooks argues for what he calls "relationalism" as opposed to the "hyper-individualism" of a society based on the maximization of choice and self-actualization. A critic might respond that liberal individualism has done a pretty good job as the basis for democracy, capitalism and pain-free dentistry. But Brooks is diagnosing an excess of individualism leading to "social isolation, distrust, polarization, the breakdown of family, the loss of community, tribalism, rising suicide rates, rising mental health problems, [and] a spiritual crisis caused by a loss of common purpose."
In Brooks’ relationalism, the answer is not found in a political ideology, but in an alternative way of being human. In this view, success is not measured by the goods we accumulate but in the number and quality of the relationships we form. Such relationships tend to push our attention outward, toward the welfare of others. "The central journey of modern life," Brooks argues, "is moving self to service." And a rich relational life delivers a deeper more satisfying form of happiness than consumerism. We are actually liberated by the deep commitments we make in life.
Relationalism had clear (and acknowledged) debts to the Catholic idea of the common good, to Martin Luther King Jr.’s conception of "the beloved community," to Alexis de Tocqueville’s celebration of American volunteerism and to Edmund Burke’s preference for the small and natural over the large and ideological. Some political conservatives may object to Brooks’ critique of modern capitalism as potentially soul-destroying. Some liberals may object to his focus on incrementalism and the human scale rather than on structural injustice.
None of this makes much difference to the extraordinary weavers across the country Brooks has chosen to highlight. They are following an entirely different prompting — a love that leads beyond egotism and into the lives of others.
Brooks’ message is likely to resonate precisely because it is not political. The atomizing tendency of American life does deepen and complicate problems such as drug addiction and suicide, in which isolation can contribute to a downward spiral of self-destructive behavior. But many Americans can identify with the broader challenge of loneliness, which seems to be the flip side of autonomy.
Brooks is making the case that there is already a movement of human connection in this country, among people who don’t yet recognize themselves as part of one. He has served this movement by giving it a compelling, non-sectarian, non-partisan frame, allowing diverse groups to consider themselves part of each other. In this case, the frame serves the picture well.

Texto completo: Nuestra ciudad enfrenta grandes desafíos que requieren un líder fuerte. Pero para que una líder sea efectiva y le cumpla a las personas que le han confiado para que los representen, los funcionarios electos deben ser informados por usted. Las personas deben tener una voz en el desarrollo de programas y políticas que tengan un impacto en sus vidas diarias. De eso estoy segura porque es yo cómo lidero y cómo respondo a las comunidades.
Durante mi servicio como miembro del Concejo y luego como Presidenta del Concejo de la Ciudad de Nueva York, la participación de la comunidad no solo fue una prioridad, fue un componente fundamental para lograr hacer cambio –tiene sentido común. Eso lo podemos ver en el éxito sin precedentes del Proyecto de Presupuesto Participativo, que abrió la puerta a miembros de la comunidad, de 11 años de edad en adelante, independientemente de su estatus migratorio, raza, género o condenas por delitos mayores, para opinar y votar sobre cómo gastar dinero público para mejorar sus vecindarios. Desde 2011, cuando presenté por primera vez el PP al Concejo junto con tres concejales, el proyecto ha crecido rápidamente, de los cuatro distritos participantes iniciales a 32. Hoy, el proyecto involucra a más de 4 millones de residentes de la ciudad, con más de $35 millones en fondos de capital disponibles para proyectos comunitarios. Es el proyecto de participación cívica más grande del país, uno que el New York Times ha llamado “civismo revolucionario en acción” y ahora ha servido como modelo para otras ciudades en el país.
Los avances realizados para reformar la justicia penal en nuestra ciudad también se deben al trabajo de muchas partes interesadas involucradas en la toma de decisiones. El proceso no consiste simplemente en hacer que las comunidades se sienten en la mesa, sino que tengan la capacidad de elegir sus opciones. Principal dentro de nuestros objetivos de reforma fue cerrar Rikers Island, el complejo de cárceles disfuncional e inhumano considerado durante mucho tiempo como una mancha para nuestra ciudad. Enfrentar el complicado proceso de imaginar cómo proceder, en particular cuando algunos funcionarios electos consideraron la tarea indiscutible, involucró a muchos neoyorquinos.
A petición mía, se creó la Comisión Independiente de Justicia Criminal y Reforma de Encarcelamiento de la Ciudad de Nueva York. Presidido por el ex juez principal del estado de Nueva York, Jonathan Lippman, esta reunió a más de dos docenas de expertos, incluidos políticos, defensores de la ley, académicos, judiciales, grupos de defensa, empresas y neoyorquinos previamente encarcelados. En abril de 2017, después de un año de deliberaciones, la Comisión presentó “Una ciudad más justa”, un plan para reducir la población en Rikers. Aunque su población ha disminuido algo, la recomendación de establecer cárceles comunitarias, para reducir aún más el número de detenidos y acercarlos a la familia y sus sistemas de apoyo, ha generado mucha controversia. Claramente, la alarma registrada por las comunidades afectadas se debe a la falta de transparencia y al bajo compromiso del Gobierno. Cuando las comunidades sienten que no están siendo escuchadas, no podemos avanzar.
En 2015, cuando el Concejo trató de abordar los efectos de la desigualdad de género, en particular en las mujeres jóvenes de color, lanzamos la Iniciativa de Mujeres Jóvenes. Una vez más, buscamos el consejo de los miembros de la comunidad e invitamos a los expertos en estos temas, un grupo diverso de mujeres de 18 a 24 años, para estudiar la naturaleza y el alcance de las inequidades y su impacto en su bienestar económico, cívico y social. YWI, por sus siglas en inglés, tuvo la tarea de identificar apoyos y servicios para ayudar a las jóvenes de color a tener éxito, y publicó un informe con más de 100 recomendaciones. El Concejo Municipal comprometió $10 millones, combinados con fondos filantrópicos, para implementar sus recomendaciones en el transcurso de dos años.
No importa qué desafío enfrentemos como Ciudad, nuestros esfuerzos no tendrán éxito a menos que ustedes estén involucrados. Me postulo para Defensora del Pueblo, la única oficina de la ciudad que representa y responde directamente a cada uno de ustedes. Como Defensora del Pueblo, tendrás mi oído y mi voz. Estableceré una división de Participación en la Comunidad para atraer líderes y defensores comunitarios y a cualquier residente interesado para que me informe sobre mi trabajo y me ayude a servirle mejor.
Vaya a las urnas el 26 de febrero y emita su voto. Necesito su apoyo para ser su próxima Defensora del Pueblo.

Texto completo: This year's Academy Awards offers all the traditional reasons to tune in: Glimpses of the world's biggest movie stars preening in couture gowns and borrowed diamonds. Great movies receiving the film industry's highest accolade. Soaring speeches. Stunning upsets.
But for the 2019 edition, there's an equally compelling reason to watch. It's the final chapter to the year's troubled, turbulent awards season. Live.
This Oscar season has been so fraught with missteps, backpedaling, Kevin Hart host-canceling, scandal, furor and controversy right up to this moment, that seeing it all come to a head-spinning conclusion in real time on television with a global audience is going to be a must.
All of that and Lady Gaga crooning "Shallow" with Bradley Cooper and Queen playing. I'm so there. With popcorn.
Kevin Hart out as Oscars host: Backlash from past homophobic tweets
Oscars costume party!: Get up close with iconic outfits from 'Black Panther,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and more
If Oscar producers Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss can pull off this host-less, ever-changing show with moments of poignancy, emotion and intended humor, they're going to deserve an Emmy, a special Oscar and a guest appearance on "MacGyver. "
It's going to be compelling live television, no matter what.
Adweek reports that advertisers have snapped up the full allotment of commercial time, running at $2. 6 million for 30 seconds. Follow the money, because the people spending it know something.
Pulling off a host-less Oscars is the biggest hurdle and potentially most captivating scenario, bang at the show's beginning. It's like a figure skater stepping on the ice and attempting a triple axel jump.
In 2011, there was a host crisis when Eddie Murphy dropped out in November, before Billy Crystal rode in to save the day two days later. Still, many pondered if there would be enough time to pull off the show, which he did.
Hart flamed out of the host job in December following a furor over homophobic tweets revealed from his past. No one else wanted to step into the already thankless job, and the original idea of The Rock as host idea was genius, but he's busy.
The internet is so hungry for someone to fill the void that it's invented this scenario where Whoopi Goldberg, who's gone missing from "The View," is going to step in. Seriously? But wouldn't that be something?
The last time we didn't have a host for the Oscars was 1989 and the opening number featured the jaw-dropping scene of Rob Lowe dancing and singing with Snow White on a helium bender. Lowe is still banging his head against a wall about this.
Just seeing how the show's producers handle the lack of host and opening when confronted with this kind of history is going to be worth ensuring you're tuned in before the last A-lister waltzes off the red carpet into the Dolby Theatre.
Queen and Adam Lambert, whose performance was announced Monday with minimal ceremony and confirmed to USA TODAY as an opening act, could make people forget their host problem in one "We Will Rock You" stomp.
Then there's the other drama that's erupted this year around the major re-tooling of the show – revealing an energized, vocal (oh, and did we mention, very famous) Academy membership ready for some argy-bargy. Remember the "popular film" Oscar? That proposal was shot down faster than Greedo in "Star Wars. "
There have been other stands and hasty retreats by Academy officials. The decision that only two of the nominated songs would be performed – "Shallow" and Kendrick Lamar's "All the Stars" – led to more umbrage. The Academy flipped to allow all nominated songs to be represented, but wasn't able to secure Lamar's participation because he's out of the country and working on an album.
In another effort to cut down on the show's run time, the Academy decreed that four awards would be handed out during commercial breaks, then replayed during the broadcast in abbreviated form. Cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short took the hit, and the outcry was sustained – from Brad Pitt and George Clooney to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.
Just two weeks before the telecast, the show's producers were told by Academy leadership that the show would be drastically changed once again by adding the awards back live.
“It would make for a good story if I had a nervous breakdown,” Gigliotti told The New York Times. “You find a new way. ”
Watching live awards shows, and live TV productions like "Grease Live," multiplies the thrills because there's no safety net. Right now, there are seasoned pros sweating through an already tricky show, one that's constantly changing in light of every new drama. They are so good that we usually only enjoy the slick product. But as Envelopegate showed us two years ago, when the wrong best-picture winner was announced, things can become regrettably, unforgettably unglued.
And who knows what other dramas will pop in the remaining time before the show finally starts. It's crunch time, and anything goes.
Awards audiences are already tough and have a chip on their shoulder after fights to preserve their show – with the wild card of President Donald Trump watching with his thumbs on Twitter as liberal Hollywood steps out.
Not to mention the surprises which will happen and unknowables which have happened before: a streaker, Neil Patrick Harris onstage in his underwear, Jennifer Lawrence tripping up the stairs to receive her award.
All of this is on top of the vivid plot lines which have emerged this awards season. Popular hits "Black Panther," "Bohemian Rhapsody," "A Star Is Born," and "Green Book" are in the running for best picture. And who the heck really knows who will win? Spike Lee could take home his first directing or best picture Oscar, Glenn Close could break her streak of being the most nominated living actress without a win. It goes on.
History of some sort will be made Sunday. The world waits.

Venezuela's Ex-Spy Chief Breaks With Maduro: 'You Have Killed Hundreds'

Texto completo: CARACAS, Venezuela -- A former intelligence chief in Venezuela who is one of the government's most prominent figures turned against President Nicolás Maduro on Thursday, calling him a dictator with a corrupt inner circle that has engaged in drug trafficking and courted the militant group Hezbollah.
In interviews with The New York Times, the former intelligence chief, Hugo Carvajal, 58, who is a congressman in the governing Socialist Party, urged the military to break with the president ahead of a showdown with the opposition on Saturday over Mr. Maduro's blockade of aid shipments on the country's borders.
"It has been more than enough," Mr. Carvajal said in a statement, which was also released in a video online on Thursday and addressed to Mr. Maduro. "You have killed hundreds of young people in the streets for trying to claim the rights you stole. This without even counting the dead for lack of medicines and security."
"To the generals," he added, "how is it that having the power to allow the entry of international humanitarian aid to our country to save lives, you would decide not to? Would you be so inhuman? So hypnotized?"
The strong words come amid a wave of other defections by government officials, including a top air force official, diplomats, military attachés and members of the national guard. This break with the regime, by a man who once guarded its secrets as intelligence chief, adds a dose of unexpected pressure on the president just three days before the confrontation over aid at the border with Colombia.
Mr. Carvajal's accusations also added a new twist to the unfolding drama: a willingness to provide evidence that could be used against Mr. Maduro's government should it fall. Mr. Carvajal -- who in 2017 criticized Mr. Maduro for setting up a second legislature -- now provided a valuable weapon to the opposition, which for years has contended that the president's inner circle has ties to drug runners and militants.
[Venezuelans speak of their hopes for their country's future.]
President Trump warned Venezuelan military officials on Monday to abandon Mr. Maduro by the weekend or "lose everything." This was an escalation of American support for Juan Guaidó, the leader of the opposition, who claims the presidency and has staked his bid on pushing shipments of humanitarian aid into Venezuela, against Mr. Maduro's wishes. Many of Mr. Guaidó's supporters said they are preparing to storm a border bridge to force open the blockade on Saturday.
In his interview, Mr. Carvajal -- who retired from the intelligence service in 2012, after having served almost 10 years -- offered a rare account of the internal workings of a government in which he said drug trafficking and corruption were commonplace, managed by top figures such as Néstor Reverol, the interior minister; Tareck El Aissami, a minister who served as vice president; and Mr. Maduro himself.
Those who were combating drugs "were the ones trafficking it, too," he said of Venezuelan officials who face indictments or sanctions in the United States.
Mr. Carvajal is among those accused of drug trafficking by American investigators: He escaped extradition on drug charges in Aruba in 2014 and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for having helped Colombian guerrilla groups smuggle cocaine.
In the interviews, Mr. Carvajal admitted to dealings in both worlds.
But he said that any dealings with drug traffickers, including a Venezuelan kingpin named Walid Makled, came from his role investigating them as an intelligence chief. He said he had met with members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in 2001, but only to engage as a government negotiator in the kidnapping of a Venezuelan businessman, a trip which had been approved by presidents in both Venezuela and Colombia.
Instead, Mr. Carvajal pointed to other top government officials, including Mr. Reverol, the interior minister, who is under a United States indictment for allegedly assisting drug traffickers and calling off investigations while he was director of the National Antidrugs Office, or O.N.A.
Mr. Carvajal recalled an incident in 2012, when he said he had been investigating a luxurious ranch in Venezuela owned by Mr. Makled, the drug trafficker. Mr. Carvajal said his team had intercepted a shipment of about 400 kilograms of cocaine that arrived at the ranch on a small plane.
After the drugs were confiscated, Mr. Carvajal said, he received an unusual call that said the military had determined that the shipment did not contain drugs after all -- which he interpreted as an attempt to return the shipment to Mr. Makled.
Mr. Carvajal said he was able to countermand the decision.
He said Mr. El Aissami and Mr. Reverol were "directly responsible," accusing the men of taking kickbacks for turning a blind eye to drug trafficking.
Mr. Carvajal also accused Mr. Reverol of having allowed drug-laden planes to land during Mr. Reverol's watch as head of the antidrug agency. He said that in one case in 2012, he called Mr. Reverol to report seeing a suspicious, low-flying aircraft outside Caracas. Mr. Reverol did nothing, Mr. Carvajal said, and the plane continued.
"I was sure it was a super-shipment of drugs," Mr. Carvajal said.
In 2017, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Mr. El Aissami, then vice president, calling him a "prominent Venezuelan drug trafficker."
Mr. Carvajal said that Mr. El Aissami also had courted Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant organization. He said that when he and Mr. El Aissami traveled to Iran in 2009 as part of a delegation representing President Hugo Chávez, Mr. El Aissami, then the interior minister, had asked to make a stop in Syria, where he had friends and relatives.
Mr. Carvajal said that during the stopover, they met a representative of Hezbollah and a Venezuelan diplomat sympathetic to the militants. Mr. El Aissami proposed a plan in which the militants would come to Venezuela to work with FARC fighters, Mr. Carvajal said.
The Hezbollah operative gave three rifles to Mr. El Aissami, who then gave one to Mr. Carvajal, Mr. Carvajal said. During the interview, he showed the rifle and his passport, which contained entry stamps to Iran and Syria during the dates in question.
Mr. Carvajal said he did not know the identity of the Hezbollah operative, but he identified the diplomat as Ghazi Nasr al-Din, a former chargé d'affaires in the Venezuelan Embassy in Damascus, the Syrian capital.
In 2008, Mr. al-Din was sanctioned by the Treasury Department as a "Hezbollah supporter" who "facilitated the travel of Hezbollah members to and from Venezuela." He is also wanted by the F.B.I. on similar charges.
Mr. Carvajal said he had taken his objections about the plan to invite Hezbollah members to Venezuela to Mr. Maduro, who was then the foreign minister. But Mr. Maduro, who favored antagonizing the United States, seemed positive about the proposal, Mr. Carvajal said.
Mr. Maduro has denied that his government had any links to Hezbollah.
Mr. Carvajal also said he became entangled in a dispute between the president and a Venezuelan billionaire, Raúl Gorrín, that led to dueling attempts at blackmail and bribery by the men.
After Mr. Maduro was elected president following the death of Mr. Chávez in 2013, Mr. Carvajal said, Mr. Maduro became upset about unfavorable coverage he was receiving on the television network Globovisión, then owned by Mr. Gorrín.
Mr. Maduro, according to Mr. Carvajal, expressed interest in using intelligence files collected by Mr. Carvajal to pressure Mr. Gorrín to change the network's editorial line. The files included information about bribes from Mr. Gorrín to government officials, Mr. Carvajal said.
Some time later, according to Mr. Carvajal, a representative of Mr. Gorrín offered $10 million to call off the investigation. Mr. Carvajal said he did not accept the bribe.
Globovisión soon changed its editorial line to support Mr. Maduro.
Mr. Gorrín could not be reached for comment: He later disappeared and is wanted in the United States on charges of money laundering and offering bribes to top officials, including Venezuela's former treasurer, for whom he is accused of buying yachts, homes, jets and champion horses.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: One of Delaware's native sons found the inspiration for his fourth and latest novel two decades ago in a Kirkwood Highway used book store. Christopher Castellani, who grew up in Price's Corner and attended Saliesianum School, picked up a tell-all tome about playwright Tennessee Williams. He wrote "A Streetcar Named Desire," "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Glass Menagerie," among others.
Castellani didn't know much about Williams, except that he was a great playwright. Castellani didn't even know Williams was gay. But when he read through a chapter about Williams' long-time companion, Frank Merlo, it sparked his imagination.
Merlo was an Italian American from New Jersey who drove a truck. Castellani, who sees himself as a working-class Italian American and who also happens to be gay, felt like he understood who Merlo was. Castellani started wondering what a relationship between Merlo and the high-flying Williams would have been like.
He started work on a tale about it then, but put off working on it repeatedly to focus on other things, including "The Saint of Lost Things," which is set in Wilmington's Little Italy.
Now, with two other novels and a book of essays about writing on his resume, Castellani will be in Delaware Friday, Feb. 22, at the Concord Pike Barnes & Noble to talk about "Leading Men," his new book based on the relationship between Williams and Merlo.
Castellani laughs at the notion that he didn't exactly rush this novel into print. "It's so funny because so many people say, 'Oh, my gosh. You've written so many novels.' Others say, 'God, it takes you so long,'" Castellani said. "My intention is to write literary novels that take a lot of time to really dig deep and have to marinate in your mind and have to deeply invest in characters.
"I really work on the language. For me, language has always been the thing that draws me to writing, not so much the story or the plot, but the language that an author is able to invest in characters."
"Leading Men" started getting good reviews even before it was published. Kirkus Reviews, Booklist and Publishers Weekly praised it.
"Castellani's novel hits the trifecta of being moving, beautifully written, and a bona fide page-turner. This is a wonderful examination of artists and the people who love them and change their work in large and imperceptible ways," Publishers Weekly said.
The New York Times' Dwight Garner extolled the way Castellani wove multiple themes into its recreation of the gay scene of the 1950s and '60s. "This is an alert, serious, sweeping novel," Garner said. "To hold it in your hands is like holding, to crib a line from Castellani, a front-row opera ticket."
The book is told from two points of view: Merlo's, as he is dying from lung cancer in 1963, and Anja Blomgren, a Swedish actress who Castellani created. A foil for Frank, she becomes involved in their relationship and remains friends with Williams until his death in 1983.
"Leading Men" even includes a fake one-act Williams play titled "Call to Joy" that he's supposedly written for Anja toward the end of his career.
"It's deliberately a bad play," Castellani said. "It's the only way I could write a Tennessee Williams play. I was never going to try to write a good Tennessee Williams play. I could never pull that off."
This is the first time Castellani has written about real people. He read biographies, as well as the letters and journals from the Merlo and Williams, who were together for 15 years, but decided not to reach out to family.
His first stab at Merlo's and Williams' tale came as a short story when he was in a graduate writing program at Tufts University. It was one of the few stories he wrote that his classmates liked.
"I was writing a lot of bad stories at the time," he said. "It was one that was salvageable."
The book starts with a punch: "Truman was throwing a party in Portofino, and Frank wanted to go."
Castellani found a two-week gap in journal entries from 1953 and decided to set the book in that time period. Truman Capote really was in Portofino then. He did have a party. It's possible Merlo and Williams went, Castellani theorizes. That's where he has them meet Blomgren and take her under their wing.
Castellani, who met his husband, Michael, at a party 22 years ago, said he wanted to explore what it was like to live in reflected glory and to be gay at a time when that was mostly hidden from society.
He also wanted to write about when they were happy. By all accounts, their happiest times were spent in Italy, Castellani says.
"I wanted to write in the cracks of what we know, the cracks of history," Castellani said. "I wanted to keep the possibility that all of this really happened."
In real life, Merlo and Williams split up after 15 years, after numerous affairs and problems with drugs. Williams, who wrote most of his great plays when they were together, wouldn't see Merlo again until the day he died.
The structure of the book, flipping back and forth between the Merlo and Blomgren sections, allowed Castellani to move between sections that were constrained by his self-imposed two-week limit on Merlo, and unrestrained as he created Blomgren and her life without any limits.
When Castellani got irritated with one, he switched to the other.
"It was great," he said. "I could cheat on them with each other."
Before "Leading Men," Castellani says he would not outline his books. He preferred to let his characters and stories take him where they would. But he found he needed an outline to survive a tale told from two overlapping perspectives.
He writes every morning, trying to give himself a minimum word count to achieve, although it's usually very low, maybe only 500 words. When he amasses enough to really work with, he'll check into a hotel and spend a week or two diving deeply into the material.
"I only write novels, so you need the time to immerse yourself in the world," he said.
A Boston resident, he works in the afternoon as the artistic director of GrubStreet, a nonprofit writing center that has workshops and programs for anybody who wants to learn to write creatively. He is also a Guggenheim fellow.
The son of Lydia and Vincent Castellani, Christopher attended Swarthmore College after he fell in love with the place when a Sallies English teacher took a group of students there.
One of the things that interested him about Merlo and Williams was exploring the queer spaces in which they could openly socialize. One haven was Portofino, Italy. Others were Key West, Florida, and Provincetown, Massachusetts.
"A lot had to do with class and money," he said. "If you had enough money, if you had enough status, you could transcend homophobia. Most of the book takes place in those kind of spaces."
He didn't set out to write anything with a political overtone.
"I guess what I'm saying is that everything has changed and nothing has changed in terms of gay people still having to invent their lives," he said.
Castellani thinks that growing up in Delaware made him connect more strongly to the story.
"I don't think I would have connected perhaps as strongly with Frank as I would have if he wasn't from nearby Jersey, and if I hadn't had my own Delaware roots that I thought were analogous to that," he said. "I felt like I had more authority and credibility to write him because I felt like he was from my part of the world.
"Maybe that's why I didn't particularly want to talk to his family. I felt like I already knew them."

Winery perfects Chardonnay in Pinot Noir country

Texto completo: For the Valley News
A to Z Wineworks
Chardonnay 2016
Newberg, Willamette Valley, Oregon, $16.99
Alcohol content 13 percent
The 2016 A to Z Oregon Chardonnay is a well-balanced unoaked, versatile white wine that’s good to drink by the fire in winter and on the porch on summer evenings.
The Willamette Valley, which has been recognized since the 1970s as one of the top Pinot Noir producing areas in the country, is becoming known for its high-quality Chardonnay, and A to Z is receiving accolades for being one of the best, particularly for its price range.
Those of you who are price sensitive should not worry. The wine is often on sale for a couple of dollars less, and it’s so good that it can easily be called a special treat.
There’s a school of thought that winter months are better for drinking red wines than whites. I would agree that some reds are best for winter and too heavy for hot weather drinking — thick, high-alcohol California Cabernet Sauvignon or red blends or the ubiquitous Australian Shiraz, come to mind — and some whites, such as Vinho Verde or some Sauvignon Blanc, are a bit on the light side for sipping during the colder months, although they go well with seafood any time of year.
But A to Z Chardonnay is a crisp, Burgundy-style wine with lemon and floral aromas and flavors that bridge the seasons.
Four friends, two husband and wife teams, started A to Z in 2002. Bill Hatcher, Deb Hatcher, Cheryl Francis and Sam Tannahill all worked in the Oregon wine industry at different wineries when they decided to make a Pinot Noir blend in the Hatchers’ kitchen. Their efforts paid off when Food & Wine called it the Best American Pinot Noir under $20. From the beginning, the company had a reputation for dependable quality wines, and production grew quickly, the company website says.
In 2006, the four partners hired Oregon wine veteran Michael Davies as winemaker, and formed a partnership with Gregg Popovich, coach of the NBA’s San Antonio Spurs, to buy Rex Hill Vineyards and Winery, a successful family-owned business started in 1982. A to Z is now Oregon’s top selling wine brand.
The Willamette Valley was a booming agricultural area in the 1920s. Plum, pear, apple, walnut and hazelnut orchards covered the region, and dozens of independent fruit- and nut-drying facilities sprang up to prepare the harvests for shipping to the East. When rail and truck transportation improved enough to allow fresh produce to be shipped, dried fruit and nuts fell out of vogue. Many of the drying facilities closed down, including Rex Hill, which shut its doors in the 1960s. For a decade, Rex Hill was a pig farm and then a commune before being completely abandoned, the Rex Hill website says.
Paul Hart and his wife, Jan Jacobsen, bought the old barn with its drying tunnels and hillside acreage in 1982. They were among the first to plant Pinot Noir grapes in Oregon, and they turned Rex Hill into a successful vineyard and winery.
Rex Hill has continued to be family owned under A to Z, and the partners have been good stewards of the land, using sustainable organic and biodynamic principals. A to Z also has been named a “Best in the World” B Corporation every year since 2014 by the nonprofit B Lab, signifying the company’s commitment to the highest standards of social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability.
In a column published in the New York Times last June, wine writer Eric Asimov gives partial credit for the improvement of Willamette Chardonnay to the influence of wine consultants from Burgundy who have worked with Oregon winemakers during the last decade. He also notes that the Valley’s producers are now taking Chardonnay seriously.
In years past, Chardonnay was an afterthought in Oregon, planted in vineyards where Pinot Noir had been grown, areas that were good for Pinot Noir, but not for Chardonnay. The growers also came to understand that Oregon Chardonnay grapes are acidic. Focusing on acidity, rather than sugar, became a determining factor on when to harvest and the quality of the wine.
After spending some time in the vineyards in Oregon, Asimov assembled a tasting panel of experts in New York and tasted 20 Willamette Chardonnays.
“In the best versions, acidity was felt as a sense of liveliness, energy, tension and thrust. It gave the wine momentum and vibrancy, allowing it to refresh, while showing other characteristics like flavors of herbs and flowers or discernible minerality,” he said in the column.
A to Z Chardonnay was one of those tasted. The wine was one of two under $20, and it scored two stars out of three. The judges noted that A to Z was “lively and floral, with modest mineral and citrus flavors.”
A to Z is widely available across the country, and pairs well with spicy chicken. My wife, Sandy, and I drank it with a weeknight dinner of grilled beefalo burgers and steamed broccoli. It was an excellent match.
Suggestions of wines in the $10 range are always appreciated. Warren Johnston can be reached at raiseyourglassofwine@gmail.com. For past recommendations, go to raiseyourglassofwine.com.

Jordan: Trump got “raw deal” from Justice Dept.

Texto completo: LIMA - After being briefly featured in a Tuesday New York Times article about President Donald Trump’s moves against the Mueller investigation, Rep. Jim Jordan confirmed his involvement with other Republican House Freedom Caucus members to highlight what Jordan calls the “raw deal” dealt to the president by Justice Department leaders in the early months of Trump’s presidency.
Jordan said he received a call from U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, in July 2017 - two months after FBI Director James Comey was dismissed - to discuss the need for the party “to go play offense.”
“Matt’s attitude, and I totally agreed, was we need to start talking about all the abuse that took place at the highest levels of the Justice Department. We had that conversation, and frankly, there have been a group of us that have been focused on the raw deal that the president got,” Jordan said.
Up until Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in 2018, Jordan and other conservative House members - Reps. Mark Meadows, Andy Biggs and Devin Nunes - have used Congress’ investigative powers to question justice officials in those terms, creating a parallel investigation against justice members, many who have resigned or been fired, as Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted a number of officials closely related to Trump.
“We’re like, ‘This is crazy.’ We started pushing back and the more we pushed back, the more we learned about all the wrongdoing they were doing. Coupled with the good work Devin Nunes was doing on the Intel Committee relative to the (Steele) dossier, and we’ve been trying to get to the truth ever since,” Jordan said. “We feel like this should never have happened in our country and yet it did.”
As for why Justice Department members dealt Trump a “raw deal,” Jordan said their actions stem from a deep animus against the president.
Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who has made rounds on national news outlets this past weekend in conjunction with a book release, said Justice Department officials discussed concerns that Trump was a national security threat and helped solidify the Mueller investigation after Comey’s firing.
“You got to remember the mindset of (Washington, D.C.) at the time,” Jordan said. “May 9, 2017: the president fires Jim Comey. The whole town goes ‘Oh, you can’t do that,’ and the folks at the FBI are like: ‘What? Our best pal just got fired. And we hate the president.”
While Jordan didn’t go so far to call the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt” - a phrase often tweeted by the president - Jordan expressed concerns that investigations into the president were “built on a faulty premise,” primarily the Steele dossier.
“It’s obvious from the get go where their motivation and where their bias was,” Jordan said.
“The question was if there was ever coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to hack the election. There’s been no evidence whatsoever of coordination to impact the election,” Jordan said.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha sido cuestionado sobre sus intentos de intervenir o detener de algún modo la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
Esta semana, el New York Times hizo algunas revelaciones al respecto, aunado a declaraciones del exdirector interino del FBI, Andrew McCabe , sobre lo que motivó el inicio de las indagatorias: el despido de James Comey , exdirector del FBI.
1. Sospechas de injerencia.- A finales de 2018, el presidente Trump le preguntó al entonces fiscal general en funciones, Matthew Whitaker , si un abogado que él nombró podría supervisar una investigación relacionada con él mismo, luego de que el fiscal ya se había retirado de la investigación, informó el Times, que citó a varios funcionarios estadounidenses con conocimiento directo de la llamada. Esto es considerado como una forma de injerencia en la investigación.
2. Ataque a investigaciones.- Un conteo de ese diario reveló que el presidente Trump ha atacado al menos 1,2000 veces la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016. El reporte, hecho en un sistema de visualización, incluyen declaraciones hechas en Twitter, en discursos oficiales, en mítines y durante entrevistas con medios de comunicación y otros eventos de prensa. Esto significa que el mandatario ha cuestionado las indagatorias al menos una vez durante 330 días.
3. ¿Un activo ruso?.- El exdirector interino del FBI, McCabe, dijo que es posible que el presidente Trump sea un activo ruso. “¿Todavía cree que el presidente podría ser un activo ruso?” , preguntó a Anderson Cooper de CNN. “Creo que es posible. Creo que es por eso que comenzamos nuestra investigación, y estoy realmente ansioso por ver dónde (el fiscal especial Robert) Mueller concluye eso”, dijo McCabe. Es otro comentario explosivo de McCabe, que se produce días después de que describió las razones por las que los principales funcionarios de Estados Unidos decidieron abrir una investigación de contrainteligencia y una investigación por obstrucción de la justicia en el presidente Trump.
El recién ratificado fiscal federal, William Barr , indicó que es posible que la siguiente semana Mueller entregue algún reporte de las indagatorias que inició en 2017 y que han derivado en acusaciones a excolaboradores cercanos del presidente Trump, como su exabogado personal, Michael Cohen .

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Tuesday denied a report that he asked former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker if an ally could undo his recusal in an investigation of his former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.
Longtime Trump ally Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, had already recused himself from the Cohen case at the point of Mr. Trump's request. But the president wanted him to oversee an investigation into Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen and payments made during the 2016 campaign to several women to keep them quiet about alleged extramarital affairs with Mr. Trump.
The New York Times first reported the alleged request, citing "several American officials with direct knowledge of the call."
"No," the president said when asked about the report during a space policy event in the Oval Office, "I don't know who gave you that. There's a lot of fake news out there. No, I didn't" ask Mr. Whitaker if Mr. Berman could be put in charge of the Cohen investigation.
While special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia and whether the president obstructed the investigation, the president also plays a central role in a separate case in New York, where prosecutors have implicated him in a crime.
The prosecutors say Mr. Trump directed Mr. Cohen to make illegal hush-money payments to two women as a way to quash potential sex scandals during the campaign. New York prosecutors also are looking into Mr. Trump's inaugural fund.
The Times reported that Mr. Whitaker - who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to "jump on a grenade" for the president - knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president's many legal problems go away.
A Justice Department spokeswoman said Tuesday that the White House had not asked Mr. Whitaker to interfere in the investigations.
"Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that 'at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel's investigation or any other investigation,'" said the spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec. "Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony."
In April, the FBI raided the Manhattan office and residences of Mr. Cohen - the president's lawyer and fixer - walking off with business records, emails and other documents dating back years. At first, Mr. Trump was not concerned.
The president told advisers that the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, assured him at the time that the Cohen investigation had nothing to do with him. In the president's recounting, Mr. Rosenstein told him that the inquiry in New York was about Mr. Cohen's business dealings, that it did not involve the president and that it was not about Russia. Since then, Mr. Trump has asked his advisers if Mr. Rosenstein was deliberately misleading him to keep him calm.
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's longtime friend and personal lawyer, initially portrayed Mr. Cohen as "honest," and the president praised him publicly. But Mr. Cohen soon told prosecutors in New York how Mr. Trump had ordered him during the 2016 campaign to buy the silence of women who claimed they had sex with Mr. Trump. In a separate bid for leniency, Mr. Cohen told Mr. Mueller's prosecutors about Mr. Trump's participation in negotiations during the height of the presidential campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.
Mr. Trump was now battling twin investigations that seemed to be moving ever close to him. And Mr. Cohen, once the president's fiercest defender, was becoming his chief tormentor.

Sanders faces a different test as he says he'll run again

Texto completo: Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who nearly toppled Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary, launched a campaign for the 2020 presidential nomination on Tuesday, plunging into a diverse and crowded field in which other candidates are echoing his themes and attempting to claim the progressive mantle.
A 77-year-old independent from Vermont, Sanders retains a large and loyal following and a formidable grass-roots fund-raising operation, thanks to the insurgent campaign he ran against Clinton in 2016, when he won 22 states, many by landslide margins.
But unlike that head-to-head matchup with a front-runner firmly ensconced in the political establishment, this campaign will test whether Sanders can emerge as the progressive favorite in a wide-open contest that features prominent Democrats pushing his signature issues of Medicare for all, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage.
Sanders told his supporters “it is time to complete that revolution" they started three years ago, now that his ideas have caught on with the American public.
“Three years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were 'radical' and 'extreme,' " Sanders wrote in an e-mail to supporters announcing his second White House bid. “Well, three years have come and gone. And, as a result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans."
In an interview with Vermont Public Radio, Sanders responded to concerns that he no longer represents the “face of the new Democratic Party," as some Democrats have rallied around the notion of nominating a younger candidate, a woman, or a person of color to challenge President Trump in 2020.
“We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender, and not by their age," Sanders said. “I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society, which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for."
Jonathan Tasini, a 2016 Sanders campaign surrogate who wrote the book “The Essential Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America," said Tuesday that Sanders' success in making his agenda part of the Democratic mainstream might be the biggest obstacle he faces in 2020.
“He might not win, oddly enough, because in 2016 he won the debate over the direction of the party," Tasini wrote in an e-mail. “Most, if not all, of the Democratic candidates for the nomination are singing from Bernie's policy playbook: Medicare For All (or some close variation like 'open Medicare to anyone 50 and older'); free college tuition; taxing the uber-wealthy."
Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio might be the two candidates most closely aligned with Sanders' message of fighting for workers against the power of billionaires and the corporate elite. But other Democrats such as Senators Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and Cory Booker of New Jersey have also embraced policies popularized by Sanders such as Medicare for all.
“Look, I think Bernie is terrific," Warren said Monday night in Glendale, Calif., where she was asked what she would say to voters who supported Sanders in 2016 and are considering supporting her in 2020. “We were friends long, long before I ever got involved in politics, and I think it's great that Democrats are out there, talking about ideas. We are the party of ideas."
Warren and Sanders may battle in particular for support in New Hampshire, which both consider their political backyards. Sanders won the state by 22 points in the 2016 primary. But some who backed him there are eyeing other candidates this time around.
“I don't see him getting as much traction as last time," said Christopher Sebastian Parker, a political scientist at the University of Washington. “And especially right now, in 2019 going on 2020, where he's an older, straight, white man. Oh, no. Not in 2020. That's not going to work. I think the electorate, especially in the middle and on the left, is going to want something different."
Despite being a longtime independent, Sanders has worked with Democrats in the Senate, but has never officially joined the party.
Sanders' supporters argue that he remains the most authentic and credible champion for progressives because of his unwavering record of fighting for government-funded health care and refusal to accept corporate money — stances that some Democrats have only recently embraced.
“It's almost comical to see them claiming, 'Oh, yes. I'm a progressive, too,' " said Phil Fiermonte, Sanders' former state director and senior campaign adviser in 2016. “Well, Bernie has been there fighting the fight for a long time, consistently and effectively. And I don't think the others can claim that. Maybe they're bona fide progressives now. I have my doubts."
The campaign said it had raised $3.3 million from 120,000 donors within the first nine hours of Sanders' announcement. Sanders also hired Faiz Shakir, national political director of the ACLU, to be campaign manager.
As the party looks to mobilize a diverse coalition of voters, Sanders is facing questions about his ability to appeal to black voters. In 2016, he lost to Clinton in Southern states such as Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, where blacks comprise a significant portion of the Democratic electorate. Some observers have since criticized Sanders' outreach to black voters as lackluster and inconsistent.
Parker said Tuesday that the situation might be even more dire now that Sanders is competing against Booker and Harris.
“He could go to as many black churches as he wants to — it's not going to work, not when you've got two black candidates," said Parker, whose February 2016 column, “Why Bernie Will Burn Out in Dixie," predicted Sanders' struggle with black voters in the South.
Sanders has also publicly apologized to multiple women who told The New York Times and Politico that they were harassed by Sanders' staffers while working on his 2016 campaign. Sanders has called the mistreatment “absolutely unacceptable."
Sanders on Tuesday called Trump “a racist," “a sexist," and “a xenophobe" in an interview with CBS News. Trump, for his part, said he agrees with Sanders on trade, although “he doesn't know what to do about it" and “we're doing something very spectacular on trade."
“Personally, I think he missed his time," Trump said at the White House. “But I like Bernie."

Why Math's Race Gap Matters

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For an article that ran on Tuesday's front page, I interviewed a dozen or so black mathematicians about the subtle racial slights they have been subjected to by white and Asian colleagues. Among them, several took pains to note that theirs is not the only field typified by what one called "the racism of educated people."
"Unconscious bias is a problem for academics in general," said Danny Krashen, an algebraist at Rutgers, who has learned reliable techniques for deflecting race-related skepticism from peers when it arises. Academics are prone to "assume we're immune" to assorted prejudices, he said, "because we think of ourselves as smarter."
Medieval studies, high-energy physics, journalism and Hollywood have all drawn deserved scrutiny for their abiding tolerance for extreme racial imbalance -- not to mention corporate law and the Silicon Valley technosphere. But the unusually candid blog post that served as the inspiration for my article happened to be written by a black mathematician, Edray Goins. There were several reasons I felt that the toll this type of bigotry -- which often goes undocumented -- takes on black mathematicians was worth reporting on.
One is the sheer magnitude of the underrepresentation of black academics in research math. According to the American Mathematical Society, there are 1,769 tenured mathematicians at the math departments of the 50 United States universities that produce the most math Ph.D.s. No one tallies the number of black mathematicians in those departments, but as best I can tell, there are 13. That comes to seven-tenths of 1 percent of the total -- perhaps as far as any job classification gets from accurately reflecting the share of black Americans in the general adult population, which stands at 13 percent.
Maybe it seems like splitting already ludicrously fine hairs, but in biomedicine, the share of black scientists who receive major research grants from the National Institutes of Health (1.4 percent) is about twice as high as the share of black mathematicians on the tenured faculty of top United States math departments. The share of employees at Facebook who are black (4 percent) is roughly six times higher; the share of black graduates from United States medical schools (6 percent), nine times higher. Among the film and television agents at Hollywood's top four talent agencies, according to a recent New York Times article, black agents number in the dozens, which makes their share roughly eight times that of the black mathematicians.
"To say that I feel isolated is an understatement," Dr. Goins wrote.
Then there is the cost of that underrepresentation to the public. In the private sector, shareholders bear the opportunity lost by excluding demographic groups. But mathematics research is funded largely by taxpayers. Federal agencies distributed some $350 million in grants to American universities for basic math research alone in 2016. And math -- "the queen of the sciences," as the 19th-century mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss is said to have labeled his discipline -- underpins virtually all of the tens of billions of dollars worth of basic science research that Americans support each year.
"How much further forward might mathematics have gotten today," Richard Taylor, a prominent (white) mathematician at Stanford, wrote in an email, "if we had attracted that talent?"
And there is the matter of the people who don't get a shot at charting the mathematical universe for a living. Most of the hand-wringing about underrepresentation of racial minority groups in science, technology, engineering and math is centered, for good reason, on the economic injustice: So-called STEM jobs, whether in finance or machine learning or academia, pay nearly twice the national average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But research mathematicians frequently suggest that their work is closer to poetry or painting than other sciences, a concept perhaps best-illustrated by an XKCD cartoon bearing the legend "Fields Arranged by Purity," with physicists claiming dominion over chemists, biologists, psychologists and sociologists, all spaced the same width apart ("it's nice to be on top") until the figure representing the mathematicians, far off in the distance, turns to notice the cluster to her left. "Oh hey," she says. "I didn't see you guys all the way over there."
As Daniel Zaharopol, the director of a program for mathematically talented low-income middle-school students, put it when I interviewed him for a 2017 article: "Math is beautiful, and being a part of that should not be limited to just some people."
Some misguided people claim that there are not many black research mathematicians because African-Americans are not as intelligent as other races. These people, whom I have reported on for other stories in recent months, almost invariably use mathematical accomplishment as their yardstick for intelligence. They note that no individuals of African descent have won the Fields Medal, math's equivalent of the Nobel Prize. They lack any genetic evidence to explain the gap in average I.Q. scores between white and black Americans that they cite as the basis of their belief, or reason to think that a genetic trait would be impervious to social or educational intervention, or that high I.Q. is key to math ability, which Timothy Gowers, a 1998 Fields medalist, has attributed largely to "the capacity to become obsessed with a math problem."
But I have been reporting on these topics for several years, and I am acutely aware that math prowess factors heavily into the popular conception of intelligence. There's a vicious cycle at work: The lack of African-American representation in math can end up feeding pernicious biases, which in turn add to the many obstacles mathematically talented minorities face. Which was one more reason it seemed especially important to hold up to the light all the racial biases that contribute to that underrepresentation.
That includes the well-documented racial disparities in public-school resources, the selection of students for gifted programs -- and the fact that having a parent with a Ph.D. is helpful to getting one in math, while black children are less than half as likely as white children to live with such a parent.
I learned some of the math-specific history of racial exclusion, too, from Dr. Goins's speech at last month's math conference in Baltimore: In 1969, when the leadership of the nearly all-white American Mathematical Society counseled members to reject a resolution to address the shortage of black and Hispanic mathematicians in its ranks, a white mathematician, Lee Lorch, wrote in protest.
"Do we care only for those already in the profession?" Dr. Lorch had written. "Is the Society willing to accept the present nearly-complete exclusion from our mathematical manpower pool of Black America?"
Yesterday, it echoed in my mind when I saw a tweet responding to a sentence in my story referring to a Columbia University administrator's conclusion that "progress would hinge partly on majority-group faculty members' adjusting their personal behavior."
"That's us," Kevin Covey, a white astronomer at Western Washington University, said. "Things won't change unless WE change."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday called for the Supreme Court to reconsider New York Times v. Sullivan, the landmark 1964 ruling interpreting the First Amendment to make it hard for public officials to prevail in libel suits.
He said the decision had no basis in the Constitution as it was understood by the people who drafted and ratified it.
"New York Times and the court's decisions extending it were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law," Justice Thomas wrote.
Justice Thomas, writing only for himself, made his statement in a concurring opinion agreeing that the court had correctly turned down an appeal from Kathrine McKee, who has accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault. She sued Mr. Cosby for libel after his lawyer said she had been dishonest.
An appeals court ruled against Ms. McKee, saying that her activities had made her a public figure and that she could not prove, as required by the Sullivan decision, that the lawyer had knowingly or recklessly said something false. Ms. McKee asked the Supreme Court to review the appeals court's determination that she was a public figure.
Justice Thomas wrote that he agreed with the court's decision not to take up that question. "I write to explain why, in an appropriate case, we should reconsider the precedents that require courts to ask it in the first place," he wrote.
In Justice Thomas's view, the First Amendment did nothing to limit the authority of states to protect the reputations of their citizens and leaders as they saw fit. When the First Amendment was ratified, he wrote, many states made it quite easy to sue for libel in civil actions and to prosecute libel as a crime. That was, he wrote, as it should be.
"We did not begin meddling in this area until 1964, nearly 175 years after the First Amendment was ratified," Justice Thomas wrote of the Sullivan decision. "The states are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm."
The events leading to the Sullivan decision test that assertion. The case arose from an advertisement in The Times seeking support for the civil rights movement. The ad contained minor errors.
L.B. Sullivan, a city commissioner in Montgomery, Ala., who was not mentioned in the ad, sued for libel. He won $500,000, which was at the time an enormous sum. It was one of many suits filed by Southern politicians eager to starve the civil rights movement of the oxygen of national attention. They used libel suits as a way to discourage coverage of the movement by national news organizations.
Against this background, and animated by an urge to protect the American public's ability to assess the situation in the South for itself, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled for The Times and revolutionized American libel law.
Justice Thomas's statement came in the wake of complaints from President Trump that libel laws make it too hard for public officials to win libel suits.
"I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money," Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail. "We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected."
Thanks to the Sullivan decision, it is indeed hard for public figures to win libel suits. They have to prove that something false was said about them, that it harmed their reputation and that the writer acted with "actual malice." That last term is misleading, as it has nothing to do with the ordinary meaning of malice in the sense of spite or ill will.
To prove actual malice under the Sullivan decision, a libel plaintiff must show that the writer knew the disputed statement was false or had acted with "reckless disregard." That second phrase is also a term of art. The Supreme Court has said that it requires proof that the writer entertained serious doubts about the truth of the statement.
Justice Thomas questioned those standards.
"There appears to be little historical evidence suggesting that the New York Times actual-malice rule flows from the original understanding of the First or Fourteenth Amendment," he wrote.
Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, routinely made the same point in his speeches. But Mr. Trump's two Supreme Court appointees -- Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh -- have expressed support for broad libel protections in their opinions as appeals court judges.
At his Supreme Court confirmation hearings in March 2017, Justice Gorsuch was asked about the Sullivan decision by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. She wanted to know whether "the First Amendment would permit public officials to sue the media under any standard less demanding than actual malice."
Judge Gorsuch, reticent when asked about other precedents, seemed comfortable with preserving that one.
"New York Times v. Sullivan was, as you say, a landmark decision and it changed pretty dramatically the law of defamation and libel in this country," he said. "Rather than the common law of defamation and libel, applicable normally for a long time, the Supreme Court said the First Amendment has special meaning and protection when we're talking about the media, the press in covering public officials, public actions and indicated that a higher standard of proof was required in any defamation or libel claim. Proof of actual malice is required to state a claim."
"That's been the law of the land for, gosh, 50, 60 years," he said.
As an appeals court judge, Justice Gorsuch showed no hesitation in applying the line of cases that began with the Sullivan ruling.
Some plaintiffs, he wrote in a 2011 opinion, have reputations so poor that even serious accusations cannot damage them. Libel law, he said, is "about protecting a good reputation honestly earned."
He added that minor inaccuracies in a news report can never serve as the basis for a libel suit, calling that "a First Amendment imperative."
In 2015, Justice Kavanaugh, as an appeals court judge, wrote that posing provocative questions generally cannot be the basis for libel suits, choosing an interesting example.
"Of course," Judge Kavanaugh wrote, "some commentators and journalists use questions -- such as the classic "Is the president a crook?" -- as tools to raise doubts (sometimes unfairly) about a person's activities or character while simultaneously avoiding defamation liability."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday called for reconsideration of the Supreme Court's landmark decision making it more difficult for public officials to claim defamation as the court turned down a request from an accuser of Bill Cosby.
The court declined to take the case of Kathrine McKee, who accused Cosby of raping her more than 40 years ago. She sued after Cosby's attorney leaked a letter that she said distorted her background to "damage her reputation for truthfulness and honesty" and to shame her.
Thomas said he agreed with his colleagues not to accept McKee's "factbound" appeal.
But he launched a detailed critique of the landmark libel ruling, which he said was a "policy-driven" decision "masquerading as constitutional law." No other justice joined his concurrence.
But President Donald Trump has also expressed support for making it easier to sue for defamation, and during the campaign - and afterward - he complained about "hit pieces" in The Washington Post and The New York Times.
"I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money," Trump said during the campaign. Over the weekend, he complained about a "Saturday Night Live" skit and wondered about "retribution."
Some media law experts expressed concern over Thomas' declaration.
Jonathan Peters, a professor of media law at the University of Georgia, said New York Times v. Sullivan "is essential to our modern understanding of press freedom."
Peters said the ruling "had the immediate impact of emboldening news organizations to cover the civil rights movement more forcefully - and later the Vietnam War and Watergate."
But Thomas and Justice Antonin Scalia have said the court may have intruded into a space in which it was not needed.
"We should not continue to reflexively apply this policy driven approach to the Constitution," Thomas wrote. "Instead, we should carefully examine the original meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we."
The media for decades has depended on New York Times v. Sullivan as a shield for reporting on public figures. But Thomas said Justice Byron White had also expressed concern after he was in the majority in the case.

Mommy needs lots more than a drink

Resumen: After reading a slew of books in the past few weeks that aren't about drinking but are all about mothers Megan K. Stack's forthcoming "Women's Work: A Reckoning With Home and Work," Stephanie Land's "Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother's Will to Survive," Shani Orgad's "Heading Home: Motherhood, Work, and the Failed Promise of Equality, "Catherine E. Aponte's forthcoming "A Marriage of Equals: How to Achieve Balance in a Committed Relationship" and Molly Willwood's forthcoming "To Have and to Hold; Motherhood, Marriage and the Modern Dilemma" I think I have an idea. On the other end of the financial spectrum is MacKenzie Bezos, an author who is in the midst of divorcing her husband, Jeff, who has been keeping company with and sexting another woman. "The United States has the least generous benefits, the lowest public commitment to caregiving, one of the highest wage gaps between employed men and women, and among the highest maternal and child poverty rates of any Western industrialized nation," writes sociologist Caitlyn Collins, author of "Making Motherhood Work: How Women Manage Careers and Caregiving."

Texto completo: Mommy needs a drink.
You've heard that, or some version of it. It's a popular meme for everything from cards to Facebook groups to T-shirts to coffee mugs to refrigerator magnets to books with cheeky titles like "Naptime is the New Happy Hour," and everything in between and beyond.
I used to buy birthday cards and cocktail napkins with similar messages.
I don't anymore; binge drinking is becoming a thing among women, and it's a big thing in Marin.
What I really want to know is, why does Mommy need a drink?
After reading a slew of books in the past few weeks that aren't about drinking but are all about mothers Megan K. Stack's forthcoming "Women's Work: A Reckoning With Home and Work," Stephanie Land's "Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother's Will to Survive," Shani Orgad's "Heading Home: Motherhood, Work, and the Failed Promise of Equality, "Catherine E. Aponte's forthcoming "A Marriage of Equals: How to Achieve Balance in a Committed Relationship" and Molly Willwood's forthcoming "To Have and to Hold; Motherhood, Marriage and the Modern Dilemma" I think I have an idea.
America has a problem with women. Working women, poor women, single women, sexual women, old women, powerful women, LGBTQ women. It especially has a problem with mothers.
"Motherhood is the biggest, most complex topic I have ever reported on," Hillary Frank, creator of the parenting podcast "The Longest Shortest Time," wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed, "The Special Misogyny Reserved for Mothers." "And yet it has been treated as small, niche and unimportant."
That's so interesting because there are a lot of us moms around, and let's be real who among us would even be here if we didn't have one?
Of all the moms, single mothers seem to get the most societal scorn, especially if they're poor single mothers, which many moms are because we get paid less than men do and we make up the majority of people in low-paying occupations.
Stephanie Land is one of them. She didn't have an abortion when she found out she was pregnant, despite being on birth control, by a boyfriend who became abusive. She did what anti-abortion activists want women like her to do have the baby. And it sent her spiraling into the world of being poor in America, and all the shame, stigma, scrutiny and surveillance that entails.
When a pediatrician tells Land she needs to move from her affordable but mold-infested apartment because her young daughter Mia keeps getting sick, she says she can't she can't afford it.
"Well, she needs you to do better," the pediatrician chastises, Land writes in her best-selling memoir, "Maid."
"I didn't know what else to say. I nodded."
A "good mother" wouldn't raise her child like that. And yet Land, who worked tirelessly as a maid making about $9 an hour to support them while studying at night for a college degree, was doing the best she could with what she had. That's being a good mother.
On the other end of the financial spectrum is MacKenzie Bezos, an author who is in the midst of divorcing her husband, Jeff, who has been keeping company with and sexting another woman. MacKenzie is the richest woman in the world; no one is going to scorn her, right?
Except look at how we talk about her now. She's "walking away" with her "husband's net worth" and being "awarded one of the largest divorce settlements to date" as if she had nothing at all to do with that wealth building.
She most certainly does.
She helped draft Amazon's business plan, was its first accountant and was instrumental in transforming it from the small online bookseller it started as to the behemoth it is today.
But the biggest contribution MacKenzie has made to the Bezos household is being mom to their four kids, sometimes homeschooling them. That was something Jeff valued. There's no way he would have been the successful businessman he is while also having a loving, stable home life if it weren't for the unpaid labor of his wife.
OK, many of us in Marin are not living in extreme poverty or extreme wealth. We're just regular ol' moms doing the best we can for our kids. But even that's getting harder. The stakes have been raised on what it takes to be a "good mother," and what my recent reading list, especially Millwood's book, makes clear is just how imperfect motherhood can make us feel. The physical and emotional changes, the huge sense of loss of our freedom, the overwhelm and isolation that comes after we give birth are bad enough. It's made worse by a country that doesn't value women or mothers, and creates policies that ignore the realities of having and caring for children.
"The United States has the least generous benefits, the lowest public commitment to caregiving, one of the highest wage gaps between employed men and women, and among the highest maternal and child poverty rates of any Western industrialized nation," writes sociologist Caitlyn Collins, author of "Making Motherhood Work: How Women Manage Careers and Caregiving."
Mommy doesn't really need a drink.
Mommy needs help.

Texto completo: Picture your book club. Keep the glasses of Chardonnay and hold the laughs at witty takes level, but increase your attendance 20 fold.
That's what the DSM Book Festival hopes to be.
Hitting Capital Square in downtown Des Moines on March 30, the DSM Book Festival has already scored three heavy-hitting headliners — Susan Orlean, Garth Stein and Nnedi Okorafor — and planned a host of literary-themed discussions and classes.
Now, the Des Moines Storytellers Project is proud to announce that we are joining the book-themed fun with an event featuring beloved tales from our archives.
"From the collection: Treasured stories from the Des Moines Storytellers Project" will bow at 6 p.m. on the Prairie Meadows Authors Pavilion and will feature storytellers revisiting pieces that made our first four seasons sparkle. Details on who will share will be announced soon.
At the Storytellers Project, journalists with the Des Moines Register coach everyday Iowans to tell true, first-person stories live onstage without notes.
Like a chat around the campfire or a visit among friends, the Storytellers Project celebrates that good stories don't necessarily have to be bound up in a book — an idea that's also central to the mission of this new festival, said Colleen Murphy, downtown events director with the Greater Des Moines Partnership.
"We will have the authors, but a lot of the festival is centered around discussion and celebrating how people love to share stories or what they've read with each other," she said.
Born from the success of smaller book-focused events, The DSM Book Festival is aimed at connecting readers with people who produce work you can read. Like all good book clubs, the festival is 50 percent literature discussion and 50 percent party.
"When I read a book, one of the more exciting things I love after I finish is to talk with someone about it," Murphy said. "So this festival is bringing that to life in a community celebration."
For more than a year, a committee of citizens, literary folk and business leaders have been planning the event. Throughout the process, they've made a concerted effort to secure authors whose work has transcended the literary scene, Murphy said.
A staff writer at the New Yorker, Susan Orlean has had multiple books land on the best-seller list, including "The Orchid Thief," which was later made into "Adaptation," a film starring Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep. Orlean is appearing at the festival as part of the Des Moines Public Library's Authors Visiting in Des Moines (AViD) event series.
Garth Stein is the author of the perennial book club favorite, "The Art of Racing in the Rain," which will be made into a film this year.
And Nnedi Okorafor wrote some of the Black Panther comics that inspired the 2018 Oscar-nominated eponymous film. An award-winning science fiction author when not writing for panels, Okorafor is known for her Africa-based fantasy and myth-infused magical realism in young adult books.
Her "Akata" series, which centers on a young Nigerian-American girl who discovers she can cast spells, was called a "Nigerian Harry Potter" by the New York Times.
In addition to the author talks, there will be a children's stage for young readers and a host of "make and take classes" featuring book discussions paired with a craft.
On the cooking stage, classes will include the Grape Gatsby, a wine tasting with a 1920s theme, and For Whom the Beer Tolls, a lecture on authors and the drinks they loved.
The Des Moines Storytellers Project is currently in its fourth season and has shows scheduled throughout this year. To become a teller or attend a show, visit DesMoinesRegister.com/Storytellers.

Texto completo: Actor and author Andrew Rannells will bring his book "Too Much is Not Enough" to Naperville next month for an appearance at North Central College’s Wentz Concert Hall.
Rannells, who has starred in Broadway’s "The Book of Morman" and HBO’s "Girls," will sign copies of his book, pose for photos and participate in a question-and-answer session at 7 p.m. Tuesday, March 19, at 171 E. Chicago Ave. His appearance is sponsored by Anderson’s Bookshop.
Tickets are required and available exclusively at AndrewRannellsAndersons.brownpapertickets.com. Additional books will be sold at the event.
"Too Much is Not Enough" is a coming-of-age memoir of a Midwestern boy surviving bad auditions, bad relationships and some really bad highlights as he chases his dreams in New York City.
When Rannells left Nebraska for New York in 1997, he, like many young hopefuls, saw the city as a chance to break free. To start over. To transform the fiercely ambitious but sexually confused teenager he saw in the mirror into the Broadway leading man of his dreams.
In his book, Rannells takes readers on the journey of a 20-something hungry to experience everything New York has to offer: new friends, wild nights, great art, standing ovations.
At the heart of his hunger lies a powerful drive to reconcile the boy he was when he left Omaha with the man he desperately wants to be.
Rannells is best known for originating the role of Elder Price in "The Book of Mormon" and playing Elijah Krantz in "Girls."
A Tony and Drama Desk nominee and Grammy winner, he also has played Hedwig in "Hedwig and the Angry Inch," King George III in "Hamilton" and Whizzer in "Falsettos." He most recently starred in the 2018 Broadway revival of "The Boys in The Band."
In addition to "Girls," his TV appearances have included "The New Normal," "The Knick" and the recent Amazon anthology series "The Romanoffs." His film credits include "Why Him?" "The Intern," "Bachelorette" and "A Simple Favor."
His writing has been published in The New York Times "Modern Love" column. This is his first book.

Musicians from Roosevelt High School prepare for Carnegie Hall performance

Look up the biography, the long or short version, of any acclaimed musician and you’ll see the phrase “debuted in Carnegie Hall” followed by the date. And mostly likely every single one remembers the experience.
“There is simply no place like it. The first time I stepped foot in Carnegie Hall was in 1964,” the multiple Grammy Award-winning maestro Leonard Slatkin once said.
Next month, a group of Roosevelt High School student musicians will share that thrill. Led by Roosevelt band director Gregg Abe, about 60 of them will be traveling to New York and will perform as part of the 2019 New York Wind Band Festival. The five-day festival, now in its 17th year, features select school and community bands from around the country to perform at the concert hall, a landmark in midtown Manhattan.
“We work with the best of the best, and Roosevelt is no exception to that,” said Molly Wenske of World Projects, the San Francisco Bay Area-based organizer of the festival. She said the organization looks at not only quality performances, but whether a school band is involved in promoting “new music, expanding on what music means, and giving back to the community.”
Abe, who himself performed in Carnegie Hall as a part-time drummer for the Royal Hawaiian Band in the 1990s, said being selected for the festival is “a really big honor, considering the number of quality high school bands who have performed in previous years.”
“I don’t think it’s really hit them yet that they’re going to be performing in Carnegie Hall,” he said after one recent rehearsal, “but with only three more rehearsals to go, I think now they’re realizing it’s getting near.”
Abe needn’t worry. His musicians are plenty excited about the trip and, if a bit nervous, very proud to represent their community.
“It’s pretty cool, a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” said junior Margaret Lonborg, who’s been playing trombone since sixth grade. “I was shocked, sitting there in class thinking ‘What?’ Because you never hear about Hawaii bands going to Carnegie Hall. It’s a big thing and if we mess up, it tarnishes the name of our school.”
“It’s crazy. It’s an amazing opportunity to have,” said Harley Beltran, a Roosevelt sophomore who plays alto saxophone. “In the music world in general, it’s just a big name, like ‘oh, I’ve played Carnegie Hall.’ ”
Performance of a lifetime
Since its opening in 1891, Carnegie Hall has been noted not only for the artistry of the performers who have taken its stage — none other than Tchaikovsky conducted the opening-day concert there — but for making them sound as good as they possibly can. Its renowned acoustics are somewhat of a mystery — the architect who gets credit for them, William Burnet Tuthill, left behind no notes on his work — but what is known is that listeners can appreciate rich, resonate sound from every one of the 2,800 seats in its Isaac Stern Auditorium.
That only puts additional pressure on musicians like junior ­Lakota Nguyen, the only tenor saxophonist in the group. “If I mess up, I feel like you can really hear it in Carnegie Hall,” she said. “I know musicians wait their entire lifetimes to perform there, but we’re getting to go as teenagers and we’re so young.”
The band will perform two works: “Four Seasons of Japan,” a lovely cinematic work by Japanese composer Satoshi Yagisawa, and “Diamond Tide,” a work by Vietnamese-American composer Viet Cuong that features unusual percussion instruments, as well as difficult challenges for percussion players. The composers themselves expressed excitement that their work will be played at Carnegie Hall, and they’re planning to go to New York to hear them.
Yagisawa has been friends with Abe for many years, and composed the work for the Roosevelt students at Abe’s request in 2017.
“My work hasn’t been performed at Carnegie Hall in New York yet. So I’m very, very happy!” Yagisawa said in an email. “I love Hawaii. So I composed this piece in hopes that the people of Hawaii and the Japanese will have a deeper relationship and understand each other’s culture.”
Abe originally intended to perform another Yagisawa composition, but the students wanted to play “Four Seasons of Japan.” The piece features rich, anthemlike melodies that conjure up pastoral images of the Japanese landscape. It opens with a flourishing duet played on sax by Beltran and Tiffany Kusano on flute.
“I’m the opening of the first piece we’re playing, so it’s kind of nerve-wracking,” said Kusano, a sophomore who has been playing flute for four years and plays in ­Hawaii Youth Symphony.
Cuong’s “Diamond Tide” was inspired by scientists’ announcement that they could “melt” a diamond. Aside from the “Diamond” in its name, the piece is particularly apropos for a Hawaii band to play, since it employs a number of percussion instruments that use water.
In some passages, students use chopsticks to tap lightly on crystal wineglasses holding water, tilting them at certain angles to create a glissando effect, a “bending” of the pitch. They also strike disclike bells called crotales, which they then dip into buckets of water to bend the pitch. It’s particularly challenging because each of the three percussionists plays an individual note in a melodic line, so they must be in sync.
Raene Imamoto, a senior who plans to pursue music studies in college, will be one of the performers on these instruments. She was “intrigued” by instrumentation of the piece when the band first started playing it last fall.
“When we see buckets, we usually think you’re going to tap on the buckets, so it’s different to be dipping something in the water,” she said. “It’s a lot different but it’s good experience.”
Cuong is a native of Georgia whose work has been praised as “wildly inventive” by The New York Times. He teaches at the esteemed Curtis Institute of Music and met Abe at a music conference a few years ago.
Other works by Cuong have been performed in Carnegie Hall, but he is still thrilled to have “Diamond Tide” make its Carnegie Hall debut.
“It’s incredibly exciting,” he said. “When a group, or a performer or an ensemble goes to perform in Carnegie, it’s such a momentous thing for them, they obviously put a lot of thought into what they’re going to perform. And the fact that they choose a piece of yours, it’s a huge honor.”
Focus and preparation
Roosevelt is not the first local school to send a band to Carnegie Hall. In 2015, Kaimuki Middle School students, under the direction of Susan Ochi-Onishi, performed there as part of the same festival. This year, Ochi-Onishi is one of several professional musicians helping the Roosevelt band prepare for the concert, working exclusively with the oboe section.
“One of the really beautiful things about music in Hawaii is that we’re all connected,” she said during one rehearsal. “Gregg Abe, I’ve known him for a long time, since back in the ’80s. He’s really a hard worker, and since we’re all connected we try to support one another and help each other. So when he asked me to do oboe sectionals — of course.”
Abe, a Roosevelt alumnus who has been teaching there for 33 years, also had the students focus on aspects beyond the music. During one recent rehearsal, he coached them on how to stand up from their chairs after they finished performing, drawing hoots and cheers from them for his deft demonstration.
He’s also been reminding them to wear appropriate clothing, since they’ll be going to a Broadway show and taking a cruise, getting a view of the famous Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty. “Guys, you gotta wear shirts with collars,” he said during one rehearsal. “Aloha shirts are OK.”
“I’m really extremely proud of our students,” Abe said later. “They sacrifice so much time, because I would say that almost every single one of them in that band has other obligations besides band … athletics, student government, part-time jobs. But they make the time to be here and they work extremely hard. So I’m so, so proud of them and I know they will do extremely well out there.”

Trumps no longer pursuing new hotels

Texto completo: Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have given up on plans for two new hotel lines, blaming a political climate “where everything will be used against us.”

Plans to expand the Trump empire with two hotel chains, Scion and American Idea, in dozens of U.S. cities have been put on ice as the Trump Organization faced scrutiny over whether it was conflict of interest to have the company’s owner running the country, the New York Times reported Thursday.

“We live in a climate where everything will be used against us, whether by the fake news or by democrats who are only interested in Presidential harassment and wasting everyone’s time, barraging us with nonsense letters,” Eric Trump said in a statement to the publication. “We already have the greatest properties in the world and if we have to slow down our growth for the time being, we are happy to do it.”

The Trumps had previously announced they had about 30 potential deals in the works, but to date had only announced one partner. On Thursday, the company announced that agreement had ended.

With the Trump name seen as polarizing, the president’s company faced local opposition to potential deals in Dallas and St. Louis. In other instances, potential partners feared increased scrutiny.

Since President Trump entered the White House, his company was paid to remove his name from hotels in Toronto and New York. Drama also erupted at the Trump hotel in Panama last year over the removal of the Trump name.

The presidency has not had a negative effect on all of the company’s business. A Trump-branded hotel in Vancouver and a golf course in Dubai, both of which were in the works before Trump was elected, have gone forward. Deals in India, Uruguay and the Philippines are still ongoing.

Sandmann may face challenges in proving defamation

Texto completo: Does Nick Sandmann have a case against media outlets, celebrities and journalists?
The Covington Catholic High School junior is represented by a nationally recognized attorney, L. Lin Wood, who has experience in defamation lawsuits.
Wood told The Enquirer by email this week that the Sandmann family's legal team, which includes Northern Kentucky-based Todd McMurtry,is investigating outlets for more than potential defamation offenses.
Those who "intentionally joined a cybermob aimed at harassing and threatening a teenager have good reason to be legally concerned," Wood wrote.
He and Wood recently sent dozens of letters requesting national media outlets and figures preserve evidence such as internal emails for potential lawsuits. The Enquirer did not receive a letter.
Wood, in an email to The Enquirer, cited a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., as one that would bolster Nick's chances in court.
The court ruled in the case that "opinions that convey false facts, that imply the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts, or that are based upon false or incomplete facts are legally actionable," Wood wrote.
McMurtry divulged to The Enquirer an example of a false report that harmed Nick. He said some professed that Nick got into the face of Nathan Phillips, the Omaha tribe elder who stood across from Nick.
Two legal experts disputed that claim, telling The Enquirer it would likely fail in court because it is not a verifiable fact.
"That's really a perspective, a point of view," said David Marburger, a Cleveland-based attorney who spent decades representing outlets including CBS, CNN and the Associated Press. Those who bring an accusation of defamation stemming from a statement of opinion "will lose," he added.
Jon Fleischaker echoed him. The attorney, who represents the Louisville Courier-Journal and is general counsel for the Kentucky Press Association, said it is "set law under the Constitution" that a person or publication "cannot be held ... responsible for damages for statements of opinion. Because opinion is something that is not provable as a matter of fact."
Marburger said the Milkovich ruling only addresses the First Amendment. But the first consideration in a lawsuit will be state law.
He cited a 1999 Kentucky Supreme Court ruling that found "only provable false assertions of fact can provide the basis for a defamation action."
Marburger also said that case emphasized that generalized rhetorical exaggeration is protected speech.
He gave an analogy by describing the aftermath of the O.J. Simpson trial. Many wrote that Simpson was guilty of murder, Marburger said, but those statements were not libelous.
"The context is controlling, not only words but the overall expression," he said. "If it screams perspective, giving a point of view, screams, you know, rhetoric, hyperbole, criticism," it isn't defamatory."
But Wood wrote the team is also looking into additional possible offenses.
"As we analyze the mountain of false publications and statements about Nick," he wrote, "we will be looking at causes of action beyond defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, including actions based on cyberbullying and assault."
Infliction of emotional distress claims accuse a defendant of engaging in conduct beyond the means of human decency while knowing doing so would cause distress in a plaintiff, Marburger said.
Defamation law distinguishes between public and private figures. Typically, public figures must prove whoever wrote or uttered a statement had prior knowledge that it was false or evidenced a reckless disregard for the truth, according to Fleischaker.
Fleischaker said potential defendants against Nick's attorneys would have a "legitimate argument" that Nick would qualify as a limited-purpose public figure, as he participated in a public protest and has sought publicity on his own.
Wood, who represented JonBenet Ramsey's brother in a $750 million defamation suit against CBS, called Nick a "private figure plaintiff."
Wood and McMurtry sent more than 50 preservation letters, requesting the recipients keep items such as drafts of stories, internal emails and other correspondence regarding Nick.
The following people or organizations were among those sent the letters, Nick's attorneys said:

Texto completo: In Detroit, it's as much a part of Valentine's Day as roses, chocolates and mushy greeting cards. The slightly naughty and always entertaining DIRTY SHOW is back for a second weekend starting Thursday at the Russell Industrial Complex. The annual display of erotic art, now in its 20th year, draws artist-provocateurs from around the world as well as metro Detroit. This year's special guest artist is native Detroiter Glenn L. Barr, whose paintings typically depict surreal creatures and tragic characters in seedy, urban settings. In addition to art, Dirty Show guests get to partake of burlesque and go-go dancers, erotic art films, bars and food vendors. However, it's the people watching that keeps many of them returning to the event year after year. Let the freak flags fly!
7 p.m.-2 a.m. Thursday-Saturday (ages 18 and older Thursday, 21 and older Friday-Saturday), Russell Exhibition Center at the Russell Industrial Complex, Detroit. 800-838-3006. dirtyshow.org. $40, $100 VIP.
Ice skating, hockey games and s'mores melting on an open fire. There are no better ways to spend a chilly February afternoon, and they'll all be awaiting revelers Saturday at the WINTER CARNIVAL AND HOCKEY CLASSIC in Clark Park. The annual southwest Detroit event will also include a petting zoo, horse-drawn carriage rides and a traveling exhibit from the Detroit Institute of Arts. The day concludes with fund-raising hockey games, including the traditional men's game and, for the first time, a women's game. Players make donations to be part of the games, and proceeds go to Clark Park and its youth programs. All the day's activities are free.
The carnival runs noon-4 p.m., and the hockey games start at 6 p.m. Clark Park, southwest Detroit. clarkparkdetroit.com. Free.
Break a leg? No problem. Props fall off walls, lines are forgotten, cues are missed and an actress is knocked unconscious in 2017 Broadway hit "THE PLAY THAT GOES WRONG," which has just landed at the Fisher for a run that continues through Feb. 24. The madcap British comedy centers on a theater company — the Cornley University Drama Society — that's attempting to stage a 1920s murder mystery with a group of accident-prone thespians who are magnets for misery. The Broadway version of the play closed just last month after 745 regular performances and 27 previews, and the North American tour launched last September. U.S. reviews of the show, which has been tickling funny bones in Britain since 2012, have been fair to good, with the New York Times' Ben Brantley opining: "My reactions ranged between thinking this play was exhaustingly funny to finding it just plain exhausting."
8 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday, 7 p.m. Sunday, 2 p.m. matinees on Saturday-Sunday through Feb. 24, Fisher Theatre, Detroit. 800-982-2787. broadwayindetroit.com. $44 and up.
Actor, comic and occasional rapper MIKE EPPS takes the stage at the Fox on Friday for an evening of laughs with fellow comics Don (DC) Curry and Karlous Miller. The Indianapolis-born, New York-raised Epps is best known for his movie work in "Next Friday," "Friday After Next" and the "Hangover" franchise. A few years back, he was tapped for the starring role in a much-buzzed-about Richard Pryor biopic, which eventually stalled out. Fans can next see him in Amazon comedy "Troop Zero," which premiered earlier this month at the Sundance Film Festival; Netflix biographical comedy "Dolemite Is My Name," which is based on the life of raunchy comic Rudy Ray Moore (played by Eddie Murphy); and "The Trap," produced by Epps and co-starring T.I. and Queen Latifah.
7 & 10:30 p.m. Friday, Fox Theatre, Detroit. 800-745-3000. 313presents.com. $57 and up.
A big and bold American classic will unfold starting Friday on the tiny stage at Ferndale's Ringwald Theatre. The ambitious Ringwald company, which has previously produced "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "Glengarry Glen Ross," is tackling Arthur Miller's "DEATH OF A SALESMAN" for the next four weekends. The Pulitzer-winning 1949 tragedy follows insecure and self-deluded salesman Willy Loman, who struggles near the end of his life to understand how success and happiness have eluded him and frets that his two sons seem destined to lead lives no more fulfilling than his. Lee J. Cobb originated the iconic role of Willy Loman on Broadway, and it has been assumed in the decades since by everyone from George C. Scott and Dustin Hoffman to Brian Dennehy and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Metro Detroit theater vet Joel Mitchell stars in the Ringwald staging.
8 p.m. Friday-Saturday & Monday (continues through March 11), Ringwald Theatre, Ferndale. 248-545-5545. theringwald.com. $20, $10 Mondays.
Now that the North American International Auto Show has taken its final bow at Cobo Center, the downtown venue is gearing up for another rite of winter: the DETROIT BOAT SHOW. Exhibitors will be showing off 2019 watercraft designed for everything from fishing to cruising to skiing plus marine supplies and accessories at the 61st edition of the popular Michigan event. Other highlights include shows featuring live sharks in a tank, a simulator that allows guests of all ages to test their boating skills, fishing seminars, a free boater safety course, a tiki bar and the return of Twiggy the Water-Skiing Squirrel.
10 a.m.-8 p.m. Saturday, 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Sunday-Monday, 3-9 p.m. other weekdays, Cobo Center, Detroit. 734-261-0123. detroitboatshow.net. $13, free to children 12 and younger with an adult. Special ticket discounts offered throughout the event. See website for details. Continues through Feb. 24.
A stage musical based on a mostly forgotten movie from the 1990s is the midwinter offering from Meadow Brook Theatre. "THE SPITFIRE GRILL," inspired by the 1996 film starring Ellen Burstyn, arrived off Broadway just days before the events of Sept. 11, 2001, and warmed the hearts of New York critics and audiences alike during that unsettling autumn. The story line follows a young woman just out of prison who decides to begin life anew in a small Wisconsin town via employment at a ramshackle diner called the Spitfire Grill. Over the course of two acts and 20 or so musical numbers, she leads the town on a path toward a tenuous awakening. "The music is very moving," says Meadow Brook's Travis W. Walter, who directs with the help musical director Jeffrey Campos. Heads up to those who remember the movie: The musical's ending is entirely different.
Wednesdays-Sundays through March 10, Meadow Brook Theatre on the campus of Oakland University, Auburn Hills. 248-377-3300. mbtheatre.com. $30-$45.
Three artists who experiment with perspective, form and color to create a sometimes off-balance version of the world around us are the stars of "FRACTURED BEAUTY," opening Saturday at the David Klein Gallery in Detroit. Michigan State University professor Alisa Henriquez uses images gathered from contemporary media to create collage-like works that explore ideas of self, femininity and beauty. Detroiter Andrew Krieger employs carved wood panels and cast clay as a base for his realist paintings, which he refers to as time machines that trigger sense memories of moments from our pasts. L.A.-based sculptor Brad Howe is known for large chameleon-like pieces that change in looks when viewed from various perspectives. The three-artist exhibit continues through March 23. An opening reception takes place 6-8 p.m. Saturday.
David Klein Gallery, downtown Detroit. 313-818-3416. dkgallery.com. Regular hours: noon-6 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.

DARK DAYS IN THE SUNSHINE STATE A YEAR AFTER PARKLAND SHOOTING, TWO PENGUINS - FORMER FLORIDIANS - REMEMBER AND REFLECT

Texto completo: Nick Bjugstad and Jared McCann will never forget the feeling.
In Vancouver last Valentine's Day as members of the Florida Panthers, the two newest Penguins awoke from their afternoon nap to learn that a former student had shot and killed 17 and injured 17 more at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., about 20 minutes from where Mr. Bjugstad and Mr. McCann played their home games.
Thursday marks one year since that tragic event. Nikolas Cruz, now 20, remains jailed in Broward County, charged with 17 counts of first-degree murder. No trial date has been set.
"It was definitely a dark time in Florida," said Mr. McCann, who lived about 3 miles from the high school. "All the kids who were affected, it was so sad."
As members of the Florida Panthers - who, like the Penguins, are tremendously active in the local community - Mr. Bjugstad and Mr. McCann took it upon themselves to do what they could to comfort those affected.
The Panthers welcomed the Eagles high school hockey team to games and practices, and the two forwards befriended several players, one of whom Mr. Bjugstad keeps in touch with to this day.
When the Eagles made an improbable run to the Florida state championship, Mr. Bjugstad and Mr. McCann drove to Fort Myers to cheer them on. The club later invited the high school team to practice at its home rink, BB&T Center.
"It's kind of like, 'What can you do?' " Mr. Bjugstad said. "These poor kids are going through an experience that they should never have to deal with. It was so sad to see."
In the aftermath of the shootings, the Panthers used hockey as a way to offer hope.
They won that night, 4-3, over the Canucks and emerged victorious in 20 of 29 down the stretch, barely missing the playoffs. When the team returned home from that five-game road trip on Feb. 22, goaltender Roberto Luongo delivered an emotional speech as the Panthers honored the victims and their families.
"We played some good games there afterward," Mr. McCann said. "We were kind of playing for them."
Playing high school hockey while growing up in Blaine, Minn., Mr. Bjugstad felt like having older players offer a few words of encouragement might be helpful.
At minimum, the Panthers players at the time felt like they had to do something.
"It's nothing crazy that we did," said Mr. Bjugstad, who remembered having one of the injured students pull up his shirt to reveal several gunshot wounds to the abdomen. "We just tried to comfort them in any way we could. It felt like you couldn't do enough because it was such a tough deal."
There will be plenty of activity Thursday at Stoneman Douglas to commemorate the deadliest school shooting at a high school in United States history, worse than Columbine in 1999.
According to the Broward County public school district, there will be projects, such as serving breakfast to first responders and packing meals for undernourished children. Mental health providers and therapy dogs will be available for comfort. A moment of silence is scheduled for 10:17 a.m., and the school will close at noon.
While Mr. Bjugstad and Mr. McCann will be consumed with their current grind, they will be thinking about what they witnessed in the days following the shootings and the need for safer schools.
"When you're that close to it and people are affected that you know or that you've met, it's definitely pretty traumatizing - obviously more so for them," Mr. Bjugstad said.
"School is supposed to be the safest place for these kids. It's turning out that you have to keep your head on a swivel nowadays. You never know. You can't take anything for granted. It definitely opens your eyes."
It also does something else, said Mr. McCann, who noted that his girlfriend was born on Valentine's Day.
"It changes you," Mr. McCann said. "Definitely when it hits so close to home like that . I spent three years in Florida. I lived about five minutes from the school. It was not a good situation for anybody.
"I know all those kids are still thinking about the other kids who passed, just trying to be with them."

OK UK BRINGING SOME BRITISH CLASSICS TO SOUTH FORT MYERS

Texto completo: Fish and chips in Fort Myers? OK.
John Natanni opened OK UK Fish-n-Chips in North Fort Myers five years ago. The small restaurant quickly drew fans, some from as far away as Sebring. Natanni had so much success that he decided to launch a second location. In November OK UK opened in an L-shaped strip mall south of Gladiolus Drive and across from Jamaica Bay in south Fort Myers.
Like the original location, OK UK south serves a fast-casual menu of British comfort-food favorites.
"Our menu is short and sweet," Natanni said. "We keep it simple and do it right. We have fish, shrimp and chicken, and everything comes with 'chips.' That's what the British call French fries."
The thick-cut fries are made in-house, meaning the staff peel and slice the potatoes themselves. No bags of frozen, heat-and-eat fries in this joint. And everything comes deep-fried.
"Deep fried goodness," Natanni said.
Well, almost everything. The menu also features a British specialty known as "mushy pees."
"It's a side dish, kind of like green mashed potatoes," explained Natanni. "If you like peas, you'll love it. But it you don't like peas, forget it."
When it comes to the fish used in his fish and chips, Natanni took great care selecting the right type.
"We use Icelandic cod," he said. "There's all kinds of cod, and this Icelandic cod is bar none the best quality you'll find."
Each piece of fish is beer-battered, and the batter is kept thin and crispy like in traditional fish and chips shops in England. There's also malt vinegar on the tables, another part of the traditional fish and chips experience.
So, how did Natanni, who is not British, come to own two authentic chippies? Through his father-in-law, who came to the U.S. from England in his early 20s, and who owned restaurants all his life — everything from fine dining to food trucks.
Natanni had spent most of his career in retail, first as a store director for the supermarket chain A&P and then as a general manager at Staples. When he wanted to move out of the corporate world and go into business for himself, his father-in-law offered to help him set up a restaurant. As it turns out, Natanni's years in retail helped prepare him for a second career in the restaurant business.
"They're different industries but with a lot of similarities," he said.
"Retail is a lot of hours, and they're goofy hours like nights and weekends. So when I segued into this, it wasn't too bad. If I'd had a nine to five office job, I would never have made it."
Now Natanni operates both OK UKs as a family business with his son Shane running one location and Natanni running the other. His daughter, Melissa, and younger son, Evan, also help out, as does his wife.
"She's a bank manager, but I manage to drag her in here on the weekends and Friday nights," he said with a laugh.
The new OK UK location in south Fort Myers, like the shop in North Fort Myers, has already developed its own loyal following. Natanni wasn't surprised.
"Everybody has some sort of connection with England. Whether they went to school there, they were in the military there or they have friends there. Our two countries are so interconnected. If someone likes British fish and chips, they're going to find good fish and chips."

Texto completo: Carina Black said she slapped and pushed away Oscar Arias, Costa Rica's Nobel Prize-winning former president.
Black, now the executive director of the Northern Nevada International Center and an adjunct professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, said she spent much of April 6, 1998, avoiding advances that included Arias reaching for her hand and inviting her to Costa Rica. She said he pinned her against an elevator wall and tried to kiss her.
Black, who is well-known in Northern Nevada for helping refugee families from war-torn countries resettle in the area, was part of a team who had invited Arias to speak on campus.
Her allegations were part of a Sunday New York Times story about Arias.
"I pushed him, and I smacked him in the face," she told the Times, adding that she didn't file a report because she was not injured.
"Arias is so powerful," she said in the Times. "He has huge land ownership. He is so revered. In Latin America, the power is so tilted on the side of men."
Black said she came forward with her story of assault amid a wave of allegations against Arias because she is the mother of five children and is a leader in her organization.
"When I heard about the nuclear physicist's story last Tuesday, I knew almost immediately that I had to support her in her efforts to make the truth known," Black said in her statement about the 78-year-old man who won the Nobel Prize for his part in ending civil wars in Central America.
Alexandra Arce von Herold, a psychiatrist and antinuclear activist, recently accused Arias of a 2014 sexual assault.
Black said she is "dismayed that women continue to face structural barriers to feeling safe and secure in their places of work as well in their private life."
Carina Black, pictured in 2017, made allegations of sexual assault against Oscar Arias, Costa Rica's Nobel Prize-winning former president.

Biking to work in the winter can seem like a daunting, insurmountable activity. The snow! The ice! The freezing temperatures!
But listen here, friends. I'm here to tell you about the simple ways to address the elements and enjoy cold-season commuting.
For my first winter of riding to work, I used a hand-me-down mountain bike with two studded tires, for better grip on the snow and ice. I dressed in layers -- recycling the same clothes I use for cross-country skiing and frosty running -- put on a pair of old mitts, and I was on my merry way.
I've refined my low-key approach slightly, but am still convinced you don't need to own a lot of fancy equipment to be comfortable when winter biking. While it might be nippy outside, just a few key pieces will make a significant difference.
In collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) things that will keep you commuting on your bike all season.
(And if you're new to commuting by bike, here are all the basics you'll need.)
Base layers
I live in Calgary, a Canadian city that is wintry for multiple months per year. The secret to survival? Long johns, which are crucial to making outdoor pursuits comfortable. Though base layers are on the higher end of cheap(ish), keep in mind they're extremely versatile; I wear the same long johns for multiple activities.
The Arc'teryx Rho LT Bottom is Wirecutter's favorite long john for women, while the Smartwool Merino 150 Base Layer Pattern Long Sleeve is their favorite top. For men, Wirecutter recommends the Icebreaker Men's BodyfitZone Zone Leggings along with the Smartwool Men's Merino 150 Base Layer Long Sleeve.
Buff
For years I associated Buffs with the reality show "Survivor," where contestants on tropical islands wear the closed tubes of fabrics as wristbands, headbands, scarves and even tube tops. Turns out Buffs are also multipurpose must-haves for cyclists, especially ideal for keeping your neck and face warm in frigid weather. I adore the adaptability: If it's chilly, I start my ride with a Buff covering my ears and nose then tug it down to my chin once I get toasty.
Wirecutter recommends an "Original Reflective for lightly cold or breezy rides; a ThermoNet for rainy or almost-winter conditions; and for freezing or below, the Polar for slower rides, the Tech Fleece for faster, windier rides, and the Heavyweight Merino" for truly frigid temperatures.
Mitts and gloves
One of my biggest concerns when I started bike commuting year-round was that my hands would freeze, so I relied on the thickest pair of mitts I owned. But they were bulky, making shifting and braking precarious. I've since switched to a layered approach: a light glove liner, an insulating pair of mitts, topped with a waterproof shell. The problem now is that I have six separate pieces of clothing to keep track of (and that's just for my hands).
Avoid my mistake and pick up Wirecutter's recommendation, the Pearl Izumi P.R.O. Am-FIB Lobster Glove, a hybrid mitt and glove with a split-finger design.
Socks
Every snow season commuter has a different preference for footwear. Some people opt to stick with cycling shoes and add shoe covers for more warmth, others shell out for winter specific cycling shoes, while some people (like me) prefer hiking boots or winter boots. No matter your choice, you'll want to start with good socks, and I've found that hiking socks keep my feet warmer than cycling socks.
The Darn Tough Light Hiker Micro Crew Light Cushion sock for men and women is Wirecutter's top pick for best hiking sock, thanks to its mix of comfort, durability and cushioning.
Travel mug
This is a no-brainer: It's cold out, so you want something to keep your morning beverage hot.
Wirecutter's favorite travel mug to keep that coffee warm -- even on a winter bike ride -- is the Zojirushi SM-SA48 Stainless Steel Mug.

Steve King pushes to get committee assignments back

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, is pressuring House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to reinstate his committee assignments after the Iowa Republican made comments in a New York Times interview appearing to support white supremacy.

King released a letter Tuesday from more than 200 “pro-family leaders” slamming McCarthy for believing “a liberal news organization famous for their bias” over a member of Congress, who they said had served Iowa constituents “honorably” for the last 16 years.

“Don’t make the fatal mistake of turning the reins of the U.S. Congress over to the liberal media, allowing them to target, misquote, and falsely brand any member of Congress they wish to remove,” the letter, dated Feb. 5, said.

It also demanded McCarthy apologize to King and reinstate his committee assignments.

The letter’s signatories included former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney, and evangelical leader James Dobson.

Republicans revoked King’s committee assignments last month amid an uproar over his comments to the New York Times, in which he asked why phrases such as "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" have become "offensive." King previously served on the Judiciary and Agriculture committees — the latter of deep importance to King's Western Iowa district, which is largely rural.

Some Republicans went as far as calling on King to resign from Congress. Some cited his years-long affinity for rightist political figures globally, including the Freedom Party of Austria and a Toronto, Canada white supremacist mayoral candidate.

After King's comments appeared in the New York Times, he backtracked — somewhat.

“I reject white nationalism. I reject white supremacy. It's not part of any of my ideology. I reject anyone who carries that ideology," he said, adding he had been misquoted.

Texto completo: After Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, President George W. Bush declared a national emergency to do something Republicans had long wanted to do anyway: He suspended prevailing wage laws on federal contracts to rebuild the region.
Labor unions protested. Democrats signed on to a bill to rewrite the law. Even dozens of moderate Republicans asked Bush to reconsider.
But then a single congressman used a parliamentary maneuver – never attempted before or since – to challenge the underpinnings of the national emergency itself.
Bush backed down without even a vote.

The largely forgotten story of Bush's capitulation explains why Republicans have advised President Donald Trump against bypassing Congress and invoking a national emergency to build a wall along the Mexican border.
In addition to raising legal questions – such a move would inevitably be challenged in court – a declaration would invite Congress to exercise its long-dormant power to revoke national emergencies.
And all it would take is one member of Congress to force the issue.
In 2005, that member was Rep. George Miller, a California lawmaker who was the top Democrat on the House Education and Labor Committee.
Calling Bush's decision "callous and misguided," Miller's first move was to try to amend the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931. That law sets the prevailing wage for federal contracts, but allows the president to grant waivers in times of national emergency.
But Democrats were in the minority, and while some Republicans were grumbling about Bush's move, they were unwilling to sign on to Miller's legislation – meaning it would never get to the House floor.

So Miller changed tack. He dug up the National Emergencies Act of 1975, one in a series of post-Watergate reforms. It allowed Congress to terminate a presidential emergency by simple majority vote.
Republican leadership couldn't block the vote: Under the law, they had 15 business days to bring it out of committee and to the floor.
Miller introduced his resolution on Oct. 20, and a vote was scheduled for Nov. 8.
On Oct. 26, the Bush administration announced it would terminate the emergency effective Nov. 7.
Bush Labor Secretary Elaine Chao said the administration had re-examined the issue and discovered that it wouldn't save as much money as initially forecast. (Chao is now Trump's transportation secretary, and her husband is Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. )
Miller declared victory.
"Let me be clear," he told The New York Times. "The president is backing down today only because he had no other choice. "
Mark Zuckerman, who was the Democratic staff director of the House Education and Labor Committee at the time, says all it took was the threat of a vote.
"It can be revealing when you make people vote on something," he says.
"We thought it was an unacceptable and inappropriate use of emergency powers, but we also wanted to check to see if there was really Republican support for something like this. I think it’s part of the genius of the procedure is that it tests sentiment on Capitol Hill for your unilateral idea. "
The original intent of the 1975 law was to allow Congress a block a presidential emergency by simple majority vote. But in 1983, the U. S. Supreme Court struck down the legislative veto. So now, any joint resolution by Congress to terminate an emergency can be vetoed by the president.
And McConnell said Trump could do exactly that.
"The president could win anyway by vetoing the bill and then trying to get enough votes to sustain it, so may ultimately be able to prevail on the national emergency alternative," McConnell told Fox News on Tuesday.
Still, some GOP senators are already expressing discomfort over such a vote, and have asked Trump this week – both publicly and privately – not to put them in that position.
"It's not my preferred choice," said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.
"I hope he doesn't do it," said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
"It might be a – you know – a tough vote to win here in the Senate," said Sen. John Thune, R-S. D.
One concern is the precedent such a declaration would set.
"I think most Republicans will tell you that we really would like to find a way to avoid that type of a discussion if at all possible because this goes beyond just this president," Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S. D. , told CNN on Wednesday. "This goes on to future presidents and what they might decide to declare an emergency for. "
Special report: America's perpetual state of emergency, from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama
That was exactly what Congress expected when it voted overwhelmingly to pass the National Emergencies Act.
The law called for every emergency to be reviewed – and possibly voted on – every six months. But in 44 years, presidents have declared at least 60 national emergencies without Congress taking a single vote.
Thirty-one of those emergencies remain in place today.

The use of emergency powers became so routine that the Obama administration said in 2015 that they were mere formalities – despite their boilerplate language that they're in response to an "unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security. " And presidents seem to have ignored requirements that they update Congress on the costs of those emergencies.
More: The Obama White House claimed that national emergencies were just formalities
Liza Goitein, director of the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, has advocated reforms to presidential emergency powers.
"I think Congress has woken up to the idea that the process for declaring emergencies is too permissive," she says.
"This isn’t going to look good if the Republican Senate is voting to curtail the president's power. It’s going to split Republicans and force Republicans to take a vote they don’t want to take – and it may not go Trump's way. "
Trump did not mention the national emergency in his State of the Union address Tuesday, but says he's still considering it. A national emergency could allow him to transfer unspent military construction funds toward a wall.
"I don't like to take things off the table," Trump told CBS in a pre-Super Bowl interview. "It's that alternative. It's national emergency, it's other things and, you know, there have been plenty national emergencies called. "

Texto completo: A pioneering Montana author who grew up on the Grant-Kohrs Ranch in Deer Lodge died Saturday in Los Angeles, Calif.
Patricia Nell Warren, 82, is best known for her 1974 sports novel "The Front Runner," the first gay novel in modern times to achieve commercial success and earn a place on the New York Times bestseller list.
"When I wrote the novel, I didn't think of it as a 'gay love story' or a gay' anything. The story came to me as something broader and deeper and more personal," Warren wrote. "Hopefully, the story of Harlan's inner battle, his defeats and his victories, would spark the sympathies of as many people as possible."
Her character Harlan is a crusty ex-Marine because she wanted "to confront readers with the inner reality of such a man because I know they exist."
Warren came out as a lesbian shortly after the novel's debut, LGBTQ Nation reported.
Warren, born in Helena, also was an activist and Reader's Digest editor.
Gregory Hinton described her book as "the best-known gay novel ever written." He introduced her at the OutWrite! Lambda Literary Awards event in West Hollywood in 2013.
"Patricia and I share the same mother and her name is Montana. Patricia was born and grew up on the historic Grant-Kohrs ranch at Deer Lodge, now a national historic site," he said. "Patricia's passion for writing came naturally. Her family had a strong oral tradition that included lots of storytelling at the dinner table."
Warren's first novel, "The Last Centennial," is set in a small Montana town.
"It would have been easier, and far more lucrative, to pen stories about Jack and Jill, but instead we have steadfastly written about Jill and Janet or Jack and Joe," Hinton said.
Hinton escorted Warren to Bozeman Pride and saw a young man, "18 if he was a day," pump her hand and thank her for changing his life with "The Front Runner."
"Behind him, a mature Yellowstone Park Ranger, who leaning in, grasped her hand, emotionally whispering, 'thank you for changing my life,'" Hinton said.
Montanan Patricia Nell Warren wrote "The Front Runner."

Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro says any US invasion would be worse than 'Vietnam'

Texto completo: One week after President Donald Trump's administration recognized an opposition leader as Venezuela's interim president, the Latin American nation's disputed leader Nicolas Maduro warned Wednesday that the United States was in danger of turning his country into another Vietnam War.
"People from #USA, I ask for your support in order to reject the interference of Donald Trump's administration which intends to turn my Homeland into a 'Vietnam war' in Latin America. Don't allow it!" Maduro posted on his Twitter account, in English.
In a video published in Spanish on his Facebook account, Maduro said if "the U. S. intends to invade us, they will have a Vietnam worse than they can imagine. "
Maduro has accused the U. S. of attempting to stage a coup against his government. Speculation that Trump may be preparing to send troops to Venezuela was fueled this week after National Security Adviser John Bolton was seen holding a notepad that read: "5,000 troops to Colombia. " Colombia borders Venezuela.

More than 58,000 Americans and 4 million Vietnamese were killed in the Vietnam War. The second longest war in American history was an expensive and divisive conflict the U. S. entered incrementally from 1955 to 1973 on the side of South Vietnam against Communist North Vietnam. The longest U. S. war is in Afghanistan.
Maduro's comments on social media came as thousands of Venezuelans marched late Wednesday in opposition to his regime and in support of Juan Guaido, a charismatic 35-year-old who heads the opposition. Guaido is an industrial engineer by training and has little governance experience but he has won the backing of many Venezuelans, and Trump and some U. S. allies, for his stated commitment to fighting corruption and revitalizing the oil-rich country's troubled six-decade-old relationship with democracy.
Guaido has vowed to end the "usurpation," a reference to moves by Maduro to accumulate executive power that has weakened Venezuela's courts, undermined its legislative assembly and brought allegations of gross human-rights abuses.
Trump spoke with Guaido by phone Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. They "agreed to maintain regular communication to support Venezuela’s path back to stability, and to rebuild the bilateral relationship between the United States and Venezuela," Sanders said. It was an allusion to Maduro but also to the diplomatic tensions that began under his predecessor Hugo Chávez.
The socialist leader assailed U. S. influence in Latin America in his campaign against capitalism and democratic freedoms. It was under Chávez that Venezuela's economic woes intensified. Chavez impoverished Venezuela by expropriating the country's private wealth, especially its oil money, and attempting to redistribute it to the poor. But Chávez's populist policies were staggeringly mismanaged.

Venezuela now has the highest annual inflation rate in the world – more than 100,000 percent – and it is plagued by shortages of essential medicines and food.
In Venezuela's latest presidential election, a controversial vote which he won in May last year, Maduro barred most opposition candidates from running.
The Venezuelan Program for Education-Action in Human Rights, a humanitarian group, alleges that at least 40 people have been killed by paramilitary groups linked to Maduro's government since protests started this month. The U. S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-run oil company, PVDSA, on Monday, and Bolton has said that as far as Washington is concerned "all options are on the table" to resolve the crisis.
About 20 countries have joined the U. S. in recognizing Guaido's leadership, although the European Union, a 28-nation political bloc, has held out. Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the EU "will take further actions" if Maduro does not hold a presidential election in the next few days. These actions would likely be sanctions.
China, Russia and Turkey have stood by Maduro.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected in Miami on Friday to meet with members of the Venezuelan exile community and to give a speech backing Guaido.
Still, Carlos Vecchio, a Venezuelan envoy to the U. S. who works with Guaido, told reporters in Washington that his transitional government has not spoken with anyone from the Trump administration about military intervention. And in an article published in The New York Times, Guaido said that he has held secret meetings with members of Venezuela's own military to discuss the possibility of ousting Maduro.
Continuing support from Venezuela's security forces may be key to Maduro's survival.
"The military's withdrawal of support from Mr Maduro is crucial to enabling a change in government, and the majority of those in service agree that the country's recent travails are untenable," Guaido wrote in The Times opinion piece published Wednesday.
Guaido said Thursday that Venezuelan police showed up at his apartment in Caracas to intimidate his wife. He said his 20-month-old daughter was in the apartment at the time. The police left shortly after neighbors started banging posts and pans, he said.

Texto completo: Corey Maggette has been identified as the unnamed Duke men’s basketball player who allegedly sexually assaulted Meredith Watson, USA TODAY Sports confirmed through a friend of the accuser Monday night.
Watson is the second woman to come forward to accuse Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault.
Maggette’s one year at Duke before an NBA career that stretched 14 seasons coincides with the alleged rape (1999), first reported by USA TODAY Sports on Friday. The New York Times was the first to report that Watson identified the alleged perpetrator as Maggette to a friend.
The friend, Washington D. C. -based attorney R. Stanton Jones, confirmed in an email to USA TODAY Sports that Watson told him she was raped by Fairfax and Maggette.
“When Meredith told me she’d been raped twice at Duke, it made me realize that nothing really awful had ever happened to me in my then very young life,” Jones told USA TODAY Sports. “That realization, and the horror of what Meredith told me about what she’d been through in college, had a big impact on me then and has stuck with me ever since. ”
Maggette denied the accusation when reached by The New York Times.
"I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge," Maggette said in the statement issued through a spokesperson.
The spokesperson for Watson’s attorney, Karen Kessler, provided The New York Times with a Facebook message exchange between Watson and another friend in March 2017, in which Watson named Fairfax and Maggette. The Times was unable to independently verify the message’s veracity.
"Ms. Watson came forward to address the Justin Fairfax denials," Kessler told USA TODAY Sports in a text message on Saturday when asked for specifics about the 1999 incident with the Duke player. "This is our focus and should be yours. "
Maggette has worked as a broadcaster since retiring from the NBA in 2013 and is an analyst at Fox Sports West.
"Fox Sports takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and we are looking into the matter," Fox Sports West said in a statement. "We have no further comment at this time. "
Maggette was not part of the Los Angeles Clippers' broadcast team for Tuesday night's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Ralph Lawler, the longtime voice of Clippers, told Fox Sports West viewers that Maggette had to return to Southern California to deal with a “personal matter. "
Watson’s attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, said in a statement released Friday that Watson "went to the dean, who provided no help and discouraged her from pursuing the claim further. "

Duke University also is investigating the allegation against Maggette.
"We are in the process of gathering information to determine what policies and procedures were in place during the time period in which these events are alleged to have occurred, and whether they were activated and followed," Duke said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. "We are not able to provide further information or comment on any individual at this time. "
Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski said after Saturday’s game against Virginia that he had "no knowledge" of the incident until Friday.
"I think there was an allegation made, right?" Krzyzewski said. "So, I'm not sure if it's true or not, but there is an allegation. "

Police Charity Invites O'Reilly to Be Big Draw for an Event. Instead, Outrage Ensues.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
When the Police Athletic League two weeks ago announced Bill O'Reilly as the speaker for its monthly business luncheon, organizers hoped the conservative writer and former Fox News host would be a big draw and raise a significant amount of money.
But the invitation led one board member to resign and drew criticism from the National Organization for Women. Then on Monday evening, after The New York Times inquired about O'Reilly's appearance, the organization abruptly withdrew from Tuesday's event and said it would not accept money raised from it, the executive director, Frederick J. Watts, said.
"We want speakers to bring light and good will to P.A.L.," Mr. Watts said. "This speaker was distracting and it seemed inconsistent with that goal. It's not much more complicated that."
Mr. O'Reilly was pushed out of his job with Fox in 2017 after The Times reported he had been accused of sexual harassment by five women. His accusers agreed not to pursue litigation or speak out about the accusations in return for payouts that totaled about $13 million from the network or Mr. O'Reilly.
Mr. O'Reilly's departure helped usher in the #MeToo movement, and since then more than 200 powerful men in several industries have lost their positions as a result of sexual harassment allegations.
The Police Athletic League is a century-old organization closely linked to the New York Police Department that runs after-school and recreational events for children. Its motto is "The Best Friend a Kid Can Have" and the police commissioner is an honorary president of the board. The league also lists a number of city agencies and law enforcement offices as partners. In 2016, it reported more than $28 million in total revenue.
Sonia Ossorio, president of the National Organization for Women in New York City, and a commissioner on the city's Commission for Gender Equity, said inviting Mr. O'Reilly to speak at the athletic league's fund-raising luncheon sent the wrong message to the city's youth.
"It's grotesque," Ms. Ossorio said. "Of course as a role model for positive manhood, few could fail the test as clearly as Bill O'Reilly."
Mr. O'Reilly did not respond to an email seeking comment. Last week he told a gossip columnist, "The Police Athletic League is dear to me."
Since 2017, Mr. O'Reilly has struck out on his own, continuing to write a string of best-selling books and speaking to his nearly five million followers on Twitter and Facebook as well as through his own website. Currently, Mr. O'Reilly is working on a book about President Trump.
Before the P.A.L. withdrew from the event, the police commissioner and the Manhattan district attorney decided not to attend, citing scheduling conflicts, spokesmen for the two officials said. They declined to comment on whether Mr. O'Reilly's presence at the event was a factor in their decisions.
Two of the league's board members have also recently resigned, and one of them cited Mr. O'Reilly's speech as a reason, according to a P.A.L. vice chairman, John A. Catsimatidis. He declined to name that board member.
Mr. Catsimatidis, a Republican who is a major donor to political campaigns and was instrumental in inviting Mr. O'Reilly, defended the decision, brushing aside concerns about past accusations of sexual harassment. His motive, he said, was simply to sell tickets.
"Me and my staff decide who are best and easiest sellers, to sell out the crowds," he said. "It's all about the kids."
Mr. Catsimatidis said Mr. O'Reilly had informed him that he had "never been convicted" of abusing the women and had agreed to pay the settlements as a matter of convenience. "He never pleaded guilty and we still live in America where you're innocent until proven guilty," Mr. Catsimatidis said.
Mr. Catsimatidis said P.A.L. received a donation from Mr. O'Reilly on Monday morning, a rarity for a person already donating their time and star power to sell tickets to the luncheon, he said.
Mr. Catsimatidis also suggested the complaints about the speech might have been part of an orchestrated effort by outside agitators to stir discontent, but provided no details or evidence.
"Who is paying these people to stir the pot?" he asked.

$25M cyclotron targets cancerous growths

Texto completo: DELRAY BEACH — A $50 million cancer center and a machine that targets tumors with unique precision are the latest additions at Delray Medical Center.
South Florida Proton Therapy Institute, the first proton-therapy center in Palm Beach County, opened in January at Delray Medical Center’s campus on Linton Boulevard and Military Trail. Though the cancer center is open, the $25 million machine that attacks cancer cells with highly-charged proton particles won’t arrive until July, said Dr. Tim Williams, medical director of the center.
The institute is one of just 27 in the country equipped with the 220-ton, $25 million machine called a cyclotron. The cyclotron blasts cancerous growths with radiation, but stops at the tumor instead of passing through it like traditional radiation. The precision allows doctors to mostly spare healthy tissue from radiation exposure and its side effects.
The therapy is usually reserved for tumors that are tough to target and nestled against healthy, vulnerable tissue. Take, for example, a brain tumor that can’t be surgically removed, Williams said.
“There may be a tumor you would love to give more (traditional) radiation to, but you can’t because the surrounding normal tissue just won’t allow you,” Williams said. “With proton therapy, you can target the tumor itself and spare the surrounding tissue.”
It’s an appealing course of treatment because it spares patients some of the side effects of radiation, he added.
It’s particularly effective in treating solid cancer tumors including those of the brain, spine, head and neck, lung, prostate, colon and some breast tumors.
One reason proton-therapy cancer units are sparse is cost. Both the machinery and individual treatments are more expensive than traditional radiation.
Where traditional radiation might cost $18,000, proton therapy would cost as much as $35,000, Williams said.
Studies critical of proton therapy say there is little difference in the outcome and side effects of the treatment from traditional radiation, making proton therapy less cost-effective and deterring private insurers from covering it, the New York Times reports.
Though most proton-therapy centers are profitable, nearly a third have lost money, the Times reports.
Williams argues proton therapy could, in some cases, be cheaper than traditional treatment. The proton-accelerating cyclotron can deliver higher doses of radiation without putting normal tissue at risk.
“You can give a smaller number of higher doses and get the same outcome,” he said. “So in certain circumstances, proton therapy can actually be cheaper.”
Williams is confident the Delray Beach center will be a financial success. The closest proton-therapy units are in Miami, Orlando and Jacksonville. The Delray location would cater to patients in Palm Beach and Broward counties, he said.
It’s ideal to have a treatment center nearby because, like traditional radiation, patients typically require one session per day, five days a week.
The center is also part of a national network carrying out clinical studies in ultra-high dose radiation to eliminate tumors. Within a year and a half, clinical trials could take place at Delray Medical Center.
“It could transform the entire process of solid tumor therapy,” Williams said.

Former White House aide Cliff Sims sues Trump

Texto completo: Former White House communications aide Cliff Sims, whose new memoir Team of Vipers was released last month, is suing President Trump.

In a lawsuit filed Monday, Sims claims Trump, in his official capacity, used his campaign as a “cutout” to inappropriately pursue retribution against former staffers, the New York Times reports.

Last week, the Trump campaign filed an arbitration claim against Sims, who they alleged violated the nondisclosure agreement he signed when he joined Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Many White House staffers were required to sign nondisclosure agreements, but Sims claims he cannot remember if he signed one when he joined the administration in 2017.

As a result, the lawsuit claims Trump “is seeking to impose civil liability against Mr. Sims through application of NDAs that apply to information Mr. Sims learned solely during his federal service.”

The lawsuit also accuses Trump of not enforcing nondisclosure agreements equally, citing how Trump has sought to enforce it against former staffers such as Omarosa Manigault Newman, but not others such as former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.

Manigault Newman published a book last year called Unhinged: An Insider's Account of the Trump White House, which prompted outrage from Trump. However, Trump didn’t push back on more flattering accounts of the Trump White House, including Spicer’s book called The Briefing: Politics, The Press, and The President, which Trump praised and encouraged people to buy.

Similarly, the lawsuit alleges that Trump’s public statements indicate he has a “disdain of so-called ‘tell-all books’ written by former federal officials and his desire to apply NDAs to those who serve in the White House.” It also claims the government “infringed upon Mr. Sims’s First Amendment rights as a former federal employee and acted contrary to the interests of public policy.”

As for Sims' book, Trump sought to discredit it as a work of “fiction.”

“A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction,” Trump tweeted. “He pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner about the lawsuit.

Sims’ publishing house has stood by Sims and backs the lawsuit, which was filed in a federal district court in Washington.

“When presidents or their political campaigns seek to silence a voice, it is especially important that we maintain our steadfast commitment to free speech,” St. Martin’s press said in a statement. “Recent attempts to selectively prevent former government employees from speaking and writing about their experience as public servants call for our scrutiny, and illustrate how essential the First Amendment is to the preservation of democracy.”

Instead, Abramson said the cribbed paragraphs were the result of “doing 70 pages" of trailing footnotes that she asserted did cite the sources for the entries in question.

But, she admitted, “there are a few that dropped out, and I feel terrible about that."

Abramson has come under fire after reporters discovered several paragraphs from her new book, Merchants of Truth, were lifted from other news sources nearly word-for-word.

“Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter pressed Abramson on her refusal to admit plagiarism, noting the examples raised met both the New York Times’ and Harvard University’s definitions of plagiarism. Abramson is a senior lecturer at Harvard.

“It doesn’t matter if I put a footnote 300 pages later,” he told Abramson. “If I do that in a book, that’s plagiarism. That’s word-for-word stealing other people’s work.”

“That’s your position. I don’t see it that way,” she replied.

Abramson admitted she erred in the crediting of sources and said the paragraphs in question would meet the New York Times’ standard for “things that should be promptly corrected.”

“There was no attempt to pass off someone’s ideas, opinions, and phrasings as my own,” she added. “These were all factual passages that unfortunately did not match up exactly to the right footnotes, but they are credited in the footnotes elsewhere.”

Texto completo: The news media's collective shock that Donald Trump won in 2016 was evidence of how out of touch most reporters were with the less affluent, less educated, rural parts of the country, where white voter rage galvanized into votes that made him the 45th president.

But more than two years later, the same question bedevils journalism: Can our tribe cover their tribe?

The president has his amen corner on right-wing talk radio, Fox News and Breitbart, megaphones that help keep his base rock solid and reticulate his warped version of the facts and truth.

Meanwhile, there have been some good dispatches from the heartland, but too often what is published amounts to the proverbial "toe touch in Appalachia."

The rhythm of the internet has made spending a week reporting a story a rare luxury. But our cocooning on the liberal coasts has intensified because of other factors in the past decade. One is the virtual disappearance of local newspapers, their business models irrevocably broken by the disappearance of print advertising.

With the possible exception of The Wall Street Journal, the most influential national papers reflect the values of the cities where they are headquartered, New York and Washington.

FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver pointed out, "As of 2013, only 7 percent of (journalists) identified as Republicans." Does this contribute to groupthink? Sure it does.

The rise of all digital news organizations has actually intensified the clustering. Almost all are in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Some reporters never leave their screens to do on-the-ground reporting. But other outlets, including Vice News, do bring their audience up close to the different and difficult realities of life in rural America.

Reporters who have contracts with MSNBC and CNN sometimes appear on panels, wedged between Democratic partisans and prosecutors who have already judged the president guilty of grave crimes. They blend and create an appearance of bias. It's hard for viewers to keep them straight. Twitter is just an open invitation for politically inflamed hyperbole.

The president is a master at media manipulation, a talent gained on "The Apprentice." So determined to dominate each news cycle, he seamlessly abandons his preference for "Fox & Friends" to give occasional interviews, such as the one he did with The New York Times, to the very places he has criticized in more than 1,000 tweets, including using the term "fake news" hundreds of times.

On the whole, enterprise reporting on President Donald Trump has been excellent.

Although editors have pledged to dial back the reactive coverage that revolves around the president's words and tweets, they remain addicted. After all, they are swimming in Trump-generated revenue, clicks and ratings.

"I remain astonished by the ability of this former reality TV star to be our assignment editor," bemoaned Kyle Pope, editor of the Columbia Journalism Review.

One way out of the reactive cycle is to report the story from the places where the pro-Trump and Trump-curious live, to cover the facts and truths of their lives. The Caro approach offers a way forward for news organizations to find contributors from, or place correspondents in, the communities that support the president, to soak up the sense and sensibility of undercovered America. That way, we mix with the other tribe.

The 2020 campaign, already upon us, offers a great opportunity to fulfill the pledge we made after the last election.

Jill Abramson is a journalist and author of the new book "Merchants of Truth."

Texto completo: They say a picture is worth a thousand words. We'll have to make do with 600 or so.
The picture in question - the video, actually - electrified social media. In it, a white high school boy wearing a "Make America Great Again" cap, confronts an older Native American man who is beating a ceremonial drum and singing a Native song. The encounter took place Friday on the National Mall. The man was there as part of the Indigenous Peoples March. The boy was with a group from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky that was participating in the "March For Life" anti-abortion rally.
The man sings. The boy smirks. Some of his classmates mock the Native man. Someone yells, "Build the wall!" And there was, for many of us, something starkly symbolic in all of it, something that spoke of American fracture.
Yes, the story grew more complicated as details emerged over the weekend. It turns out the students had been drawn to the spot by a small group of black protesters - so-called "Black Hebrew Israelites" - using their First Amendment rights to curse and insult essentially everyone who was not them, including Catholics, whites, Native Americans and, at one point, a black person who disdained their toxic beliefs.
The students began what they described as a school spirit chant to drown out the black men.
Tensions were high. And into this cauldron of ideology and identity stepped Nathan Phillips, a 64-year-old elder of the Omaha people and a Vietnam veteran. His aim in walking through the crowd, he said, was to settle things down. As he told The New York Times, "I stepped in between to pray."
The crowd, he said, parted to let him through. All except for the boy, since identified as Nick Sandmann, a junior. Phillips said the boy blocked him when he moved left. When he moved right, Sandmann did the same.
In a written statement, the boy denied blocking Phillips. "To be honest," he wrote, "I was startled and confused as to why he had approached me." But the boy in that video, smirking, trying not to laugh, is not startled or confused. He looks, rather, entitled and smug.
Indeed, what gave the image its initial, visceral power was the sense that his expression was one we have seen before. It was on the face of an SS man as he cut off a rabbi's beard on a Warsaw street, on the face of an Alabama state trooper waiting at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Heck, it was on the face of a hulking high school boy as he prepared to dunk a smaller kid's head into the toilet. It was the eternal expression of the bully at the head of a mob.
Now here it was on this boy, using his First Amendment right to wear a hat many of us consider the functional equivalent of a pointy white hood, as he faced down a child of the people who named the Mississippi River and left the first footprints in the virgin soil of the Blue Ridge Mountains. All while someone yelled about building a wall. And if the story has grown more complicated, what hasn't changed is the sense that those images capture a nation at the breaking point.
As it happens, this story unfolded over the weekend we set aside to honor Martin Luther King, the confrontation itself occurring near the spot where he said, "I have a dream." That, of course, was on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a monument to the president who led this country through a war in which 2 percent of the population - the modern equivalent would be 6.6 million people - died fighting over the meaning of freedom.
And Nathan Phillips' prayer? It was for unity, he said.

Texto completo: LONDON -- When Anne Washburn started her Trump play, she didn't think it would ever see the light. After a frustrating day spent reading the news online, she would begin to write. "It was enjoyable to feel I had some measure of control over the situation," Ms. Washburn said. "It's the helplessness that makes people crazy."
The result was "Shipwreck," subtitled "A History Play about 2017." It begins performances Feb. 11 at the Almeida Theater here before a likely, but as yet unannounced, run in the United States.
"Shipwreck" is set in the immediate aftermath of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey's congressional testimony, when a group of white liberal friends gather in an old farmhouse in upstate New York; as snow falls and supplies run short, their conversations endlessly circle and jab at the Trump administration, and eventually each other.
But the house is also haunted, theatrically, by the people who lived there before -- a farmer, his adopted black son -- lending a long-view perspective that acts as a counterpoint to the chatter of the New Yorkers. Oh, and Donald J. Trump himself even puts in an appearance.
"He kind of appears. He appears in a way. It would be so lonely without him," Ms. Washburn said with a degree of mischief when we met at the Almeida. She was keen not to reveal too much.
Ms. Washburn was in town for rehearsals with Rupert Goold, the show's director who also runs the Almeida. It's a busy time for the American playwright in London: Her adaptation of "The Twilight Zone," seen at the Almeida last year, is about to transfer to the West End beginning March 4.
Critical reactions to her work here have always been rather mixed: "Twilight Zone" was met with varying degrees of warmth, while Robert Icke's 2014 Almeida production of "Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play," Ms. Washburn's breakout, produced one of the sharpest divides among critics in the last decade.
Still, this post-apocalyptic comedy -- in which the Cape Feare episode of "The Simpsons" transforms over generations into the nurturing stuff of myth -- won ardent fans among young audiences, playwrights and bloggers.
"Almost all the critics hated ["Mr. Burns"], which in the States would have destroyed it, in a way that it didn't seem to here," Ms. Washburn observed. (The play's American supporters include critics for The New York Times, who named it one of the best 25 American plays of the last 25 years.) "Here people were quite invested in hating it, or championing it -- it kept going in a way, which is ideal from a playwright's point of view. In the States, people wouldn't even have bothered to hate it."
That ferment -- and the Almeida's continued belief in her writing -- has made Ms. Washburn a significant figure on the British theatrical landscape. Add to that the box office appeal of a title like "The Twilight Zone" and Ms. Washburn can sail into the West End; by contrast, she hasn't had work on Broadway.
Still, she never expected "Shipwreck" to open here. "It's a very American play," Ms. Washburn conceded, and she's had to tweak the script a little for British audiences. But she's found it resonates in a country going through its own political upheaval.
"It's not like it's a covert Brexit play, obviously, but it touches on things," she said. A few lines about inaction in the face of looming disaster, although written about the United States, were added in London following Ms. Washburn's "endless discussions with agonized British people."
She began "Shipwreck" on a silent writing retreat in June 2017. "I wanted to see what it would be like to write about the current time, because that was all I was thinking or talking about," she said. And it was important to her to try to understand Trump supporters, too. "Writing the play came from having a very liberal experience but it also came from going online and seeking other viewpoints, visiting websites that I don't normally hang out at."
Whether art can, or should, tackle contemporary politics is among the issues chewed over by the "Shipwreck" characters. Their discussion of the controversial depiction of President Trump in the 2017 Shakespeare in the Park production of "Julius Caesar" is a proxy for Ms. Washburn's own wrestling with the dilemma.
"Whether art has a responsibility to be contemporaneous, whether it can be contemporaneous, is a huge question," Ms. Washburn said. "I feel like the idea of an immediate political theater is very enticing and yet often disappointing. It's a hard nut to crack and yet we still want to go at it."
By the time "Shipwreck" was finished last April, she said, it was too late for 2019 programming in the United States. British theaters, however, are a little more nimble. And although she had only showed the script to a few friends, Mr. Goold had got wind, and asked if he could read it.
His first reaction was simply how funny the play was. "She doesn't write a dull line," Mr. Goold said over the phone. And although he was surprised at its overtly political nature -- not typical of Ms. Washburn's writing -- addressing how theater can respond to politics was certainly appealing.
Mr. Goold had some concern it would be too American. "But the inability for metropolitans to come to terms with the shamanistic power of populism is as relevant here as it is over there," he added.
Ms. Washburn was surprised at his interest, but then, she initially didn't think anyone would want her Trump play. "I thought no one would ever want to spend any more time talking about it than we already do," she said. "But I did want to get into the intricate, really overheated language we were all partaking in. What is it like to put this time on paper?"
Inevitably, then, "Shipwreck" is a talky, thinky piece, but Ms. Washburn's skewering of the chattering classes is as sparkling as it is spiky. (Tara Fitzgerald, Selyse Baratheon on "Game of Thrones," is best-known in the cast of British theater regulars.) She's always shown forensic interest in the way we speak and the stories we tell, from making up her own language for 2006's "The Internationalist" to tracing the mutation of culture in "Mr. Burns."
There's also a through-line with "The Twilight Zone." The British theater and opera director Richard Jones had brought her onto that project, having been impressed by the "audacity" of "Mr. Burns." He described Ms. Washburn as "a brainiac" -- but a hilarious one, who is "very joyful to work with."
Ms. Washburn was working on it during the 2016 presidential campaign, and found herself wondering: "What is America doing? Where did this thing come from?"
"The Twilight Zone," she added, "felt like the subconscious of America laid bare."
She has now done the same thing in "Shipwreck," once again reflecting America back at itself -- even if it is London audiences who will get the first look.

Fees? Online referrals? Here are some tips to find the right lawyer

Texto completo: Lawyers don’t know everything.
Wait, what? Sure, we pretend to at family dinners, but that’s different.
The truth is in modern times no one lawyer can know every area of law. Think about it — the tax code alone is a gaztrillion pages long (that’s a legal term). How could we know and understand that along with the California Family Law code, which is a modzillion pages (legalese again, sorry)? That’s why we specialize in one, maybe two or three related areas of law. And that’s why you should be careful and methodical in choosing your attorney.
So how do you choose?
First, be clear about what kind of lawyer you need. Is this a real estate transaction? Do you need a will or trust? Are you being sued in a business transaction? Were you injured and contemplating a lawsuit? Is a divorce looming? Those are matters for different types of attorneys. (If you find one attorney who claims to do all of that, please run far away. They can’t possibly do it all well.)
Next, find a referral.
Talk to friends, neighbors, and, most importantly, other professionals to find out what lawyers practice in the area where you need help and who are the good ones. Lawyers are like other business folks (except when arguing with one, or so I’m told) — there are great ones, mediocre ones and bad ones. Talking to someone who has worked with a specific attorney can tell you a lot you need to know. Was the attorney responsive? Reasonable? Knowledgeable? You want those things.
Check the lawyer’s standing
The California state bar website calbar.ca.gov will let you know if the attorney is licensed, what their practice area is, and whether they’ve had any disciplinary proceedings.
I recently had a client bring me their estate planning documents which were so poorly prepared I looked up the attorney who drafted them. He’d been disbarred years before he prepared their documents. I’m sure the client would not have hired him if they had known that, which would have saved them time and money.
I’m less fond of consumer review sites, as there is no neutral party administering what gets posted, as there is with the State Bar, but go ahead and check. If you find a pattern of complaints (as opposed to one or two outliers) you may learn that’s not the right attorney for you.
Meet and talk to the attorney
Most attorneys offer free consultations. You should feel free to ask questions about their experience, their fees, their areas of practice and what you can expect if they handle your matter.
I’ll be honest, we’re rarely asked these questions, but I like it when someone does ask. I know that’s going to be an engaged and sharp client. The point of the conversation is to understand what it will be like to work with that particular attorney. And an important part of that is learning whether you’ll be comfortable and happy working with him.
If your matter involves estate planning or a divorce, you will be sharing a lot of personal information about your family and finances. You should feel comfortable doing that. If your matter involves a lawsuit, you’re likely to be stressed and emotional at times — again, you need to be comfortable with the attorney and confident in her abilities.
My dog can help you out here. Years ago I had a beagle battling cancer. His oncologist was cold and pessimistic and made our appointments much more difficult to bear.
Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and asked to be assigned to a different doctor. The clinic’s owner said, “that’s why we have several doctors on staff, we want you to be comfortable.” The next doctor was fabulous and made the whole experience easier. I’m guessing that’s why California has so many lawyers — so you can find the right one.
One last thought: Though it’s tempting and an important factor, don’t let fees make the decision for you. After all, you can get a car for $500. That doesn’t mean it will get you where you need to be.

Texto completo: Lawyers don’t know everything.
Wait, what? Sure, we pretend to at family dinners, but that’s different.
The truth is in modern times no one lawyer can know every area of law. Think about it — the tax code alone is a gaztrillion pages long (that’s a legal term). How could we know and understand that along with the California Family Law code, which is a modzillion pages (legalese again, sorry)? That’s why we specialize in one, maybe two or three related areas of law. And that’s why you should be careful and methodical in choosing your attorney.
So how do you choose?
First, be clear about what kind of lawyer you need. Is this a real estate transaction? Do you need a will or trust? Are you being sued in a business transaction? Were you injured and contemplating a lawsuit? Is a divorce looming? Those are matters for different types of attorneys. (If you find one attorney who claims to do all of that, please run far away. They can’t possibly do it all well.)
Next, find a referral.
Talk to friends, neighbors, and, most importantly, other professionals to find out what lawyers practice in the area where you need help and who are the good ones. Lawyers are like other business folks (except when arguing with one, or so I’m told) — there are great ones, mediocre ones and bad ones. Talking to someone who has worked with a specific attorney can tell you a lot you need to know. Was the attorney responsive? Reasonable? Knowledgeable? You want those things.
Check the lawyer’s standing
The California state bar website calbar.ca.gov will let you know if the attorney is licensed, what their practice area is, and whether they’ve had any disciplinary proceedings.
I recently had a client bring me their estate planning documents which were so poorly prepared I looked up the attorney who drafted them. He’d been disbarred years before he prepared their documents. I’m sure the client would not have hired him if they had known that, which would have saved them time and money.
I’m less fond of consumer review sites, as there is no neutral party administering what gets posted, as there is with the State Bar, but go ahead and check. If you find a pattern of complaints (as opposed to one or two outliers) you may learn that’s not the right attorney for you.
Meet and talk to the attorney
Most attorneys offer free consultations. You should feel free to ask questions about their experience, their fees, their areas of practice and what you can expect if they handle your matter.
I’ll be honest, we’re rarely asked these questions, but I like it when someone does ask. I know that’s going to be an engaged and sharp client. The point of the conversation is to understand what it will be like to work with that particular attorney. And an important part of that is learning whether you’ll be comfortable and happy working with him.
If your matter involves estate planning or a divorce, you will be sharing a lot of personal information about your family and finances. You should feel comfortable doing that. If your matter involves a lawsuit, you’re likely to be stressed and emotional at times — again, you need to be comfortable with the attorney and confident in her abilities.
My dog can help you out here. Years ago I had a beagle battling cancer. His oncologist was cold and pessimistic and made our appointments much more difficult to bear.
Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and asked to be assigned to a different doctor. The clinic’s owner said, “that’s why we have several doctors on staff, we want you to be comfortable.” The next doctor was fabulous and made the whole experience easier. I’m guessing that’s why California has so many lawyers — so you can find the right one.
One last thought: Though it’s tempting and an important factor, don’t let fees make the decision for you. After all, you can get a car for $500. That doesn’t mean it will get you where you need to be.

End Warren's presidential dream

Texto completo: Another week, another apology from Sen. Elizabeth Warren for her phony claims of Native American heritage. But the latest evidence against her should spell the end of her presidential ambitions.
The Massachusetts Democrat's discredited story of Indian ancestry has made her an object of ridicule coming from President Donald Trump, who dubbed her "Pocahontas," and conservatives who prefer the more pointed "Fauxcahontas." Liberals have mostly been willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, seemingly accepting each new explanation for her shifting story of how and why she was mistaken for a member of the Cherokee Nation.
Her 1986 registration card for the State Bar of Texas could put an end to all that. The Washington Post obtained a copy of the signed document in which Warren wrote that her race was "American Indian."
This supports two critical charges against her: that she knowingly and personally claimed Native American heritage, and that she did so for the purpose of career advancement.
Warren has consistently dissembled about how and why she came to be thought of as Native American. When the Boston Herald broke the story during her 2012 Senate campaign, she said that she had no idea Harvard listed her as a minority hire, and that she couldn't "recall" having listed herself as such on any job or "other applications."
The Texas Bar registration shows this isn't true. Also, the document coincides with the year Warren began self-reporting as a "minority professor" in the Association of American Law Schools staff directory. It was also two years after she contributed recipes to the "Pow Wow Chow" Native American cookbook, some of which appear to have been plagiarized from a French chef in The New York Times.
Why would Warren pretend to be an American Indian in the 1980s if later she downplayed the matter as a misunderstanding based on family lore?
Despite the leftist mania to call out supposed "white privilege," the fact is that even in the 1980s minority status could confer distinct advantages in hiring and promotion in career fields dominated by liberals for whom affirmative action is an article of faith. As the 1983 guidance from the American Association of University Professors noted, when it comes to filling academic positions, "in the interests of diversity, affirmative action considerations might control the final selection."
A 2018 investigation by The Boston Globe found little to support the idea that hiring committees, at law schools where Warren taught, openly discussed her alleged heritage as a factor in bringing her on board. Yet, Harvard was quick to tout her as the law school's first "woman of color," of which Warren said she was unaware. She was identified as a minority winner of a teaching award at the University of Pennsylvania, apparently also without her knowledge. Maybe these schools did not discuss her supposed ethnicity, but they recognized and exploited it.
The Texas Bar registration comes on the heels of Warren's apology for releasing a DNA test finding "strong evidence" that she had a Native American ancestor six to 10 generations ago.
DNA evidence is not accepted by the Cherokee Nation anyway, so the whole fiasco shows a terrible sense of judgment — and perhaps panic — on Warren's part.
It is fair to speculate that Warren's presidential campaign will soon be over. If Democrats want to nominate a progressive/socialist who will also be a standard-bearer for identity politics, they have other, more authentic choices available. As a nominee, Warren would have to spend the entire campaign explaining to people of color why her candidacy is not a standing indictment of the cynical abuse of affirmative action programs for personal gain. This would be in addition to having to demonstrate why her outdated economic policies would not turn the United States into the next Venezuela.
President Trump said he would love to run against Warren, and she keeps showing why.

An open letter to Howard Schultz

Texto completo: Dear Howard Schultz,
We need to talk.
This whole running for president thing — it's not going to happen. The high-priced political consultants you hired may be telling you otherwise, but I've got a better place for you to sink your millions. And I'm not going to charge you for it.
First, it should really go without saying that a candidate who is pro-immigration, pro-gun control, pro-gay rights, and pro-racial equality isn't going to win over a lot of Republicans. Opposing raising taxes on billionaires, standing against Medicare-for-All, obsessing over the deficit, and suggesting cuts to Social Security and Medicare won't endear you to Democrats either.
That may explain why you've got a favorability rating of around 4 percent.
I think the Ebola virus scores higher than that.
Second, all your tweets are getting ratioed and even Donald Trump is dunking on you. Democrats are apoplectic that you're going to get the president re-elected by slicing off a little piece of the anti-Trump vote, and there's some polling that suggests they're right.
Do you really want to be that guy who gave us four more years of Trump?
I'm sure you don't. And I take you at your word that you love your country. After all, while you could just sit back and nap on a giant pile of money, you're out there talking to people, doing interviews, and getting heckled at Barnes and Noble.
So here's a suggestion that would do far more to help America: Go buy a newspaper. Buy a couple actually. I don't mean the New York Times or the Boston Globe. They're not for sale and their owners are among the finest people in the world.
Buy some mid-sized newspapers, the kinds operating on shoe-string budgets, staffed by overworked and underpaid reporters, and barely surviving. Hire smart, enterprising editors to run them and give them free rein and lots of cash to ramp up their operations and do great public interest journalism. This kind of financial investment couldn't be more urgent. It's only February and more than 2,000 journalists have already lost their jobs this year.
You've seen the headlines: Buzzfeed, Vice, Huffington Post, McClatchy, Gannett, the Dallas Morning News. It's been a bloodbath. Two thousand newspapers have closed or merged. Between January 2017 and April 2018, more than a third of the largest newspapers in the country laid off employees. About 1,800 newspapers have closed or merged since 2004, and more than 1,300 communities lack a local paper, in effect, becoming news deserts.
This growing dearth of local news is terrible for democracy. Without effective news outlets in smaller cities, who will hold political leaders accountable and keep citizens informed of what's happening in their communities? You live in Washington state. When the Seattle Post-Intelligencer closed there in 2009, studies show that civic engagement actually decreased.
You've said that no one wants to see Trump leave the White House more than you. Well, here's something to think about: he outperformed 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney in communities with low newspaper circulation. . . and did worse in places with heavier circulation.
Local newspapers are failing, in part because they haven't figured out the challenge of finding an effective business model that ensures profitability in the digital age.
But maybe that's not the future of journalism. Maybe newspapers are the new Carnegie Libraries — supported by smart, civic-minded, philanthropic Americans with deep pockets. Look at what Jeff Bezos did with the Washington Post. He plunged tens of millions of dollars into the paper and it's doing some of the best journalism of the Trump era. The Los Angeles Times and the Atlantic are ramping up their operations because of support from billionaire owners. You can be that guy!
I've heard you say that you're “living proof" of the American dream and it's hard to disagree. Your rags-to-riches story is impressive. Now you have a chance to take what you've accomplished and use it to strengthen democracy and build stronger and more resilient communities. And I can promise you one thing: If you make newspapers, not the presidency, your focus, you'll be remembered for a lot more than coffee and cake pops.

Hedy Lamarr: Legend propels popular novel

Texto completo: Author Marie Benedict explains the challenge of putting herself in Hedy Lamarr's mind as the actress narrates the novel "The Only Woman in the Room."
"I'm just a former lawyer turned writer. I live in Pittsburgh," Benedict said. "It would be hard to imagine myself this world-famous movie star. But I started long before that in the book. When the book opens, she's still a teenager. She's had some success, but she's still very much a work in progress."
Through the novel, Benedict celebrates Lamarr, who spent her last decade in Central Florida and died in Casselberry in 2000. Benedict will be featured Tuesday at the Central Florida Jewish Book Festival in Maitland.
"I think she's a heroine," Benedict said. "It's a patriot's story, it's an immigrant's story [with] elements of World War II suspense. It's a historical story about a woman whose contributions have been marginalized."
The author restricts herself to 1933 to 1942 in Lamarr's story. "I think that was the most pivotal time in her life," she said. "What we see later in her life, the Hedy Lamarr most people know, emerged because of that time period."
Benedict explores the events that shaped Lamarr as a Jewish girl in Vienna, an actress finding her way and the wife of an arms dealer, one of the richest men in Austria. She meets Italian leader Benito Mussolini (actually happened) and overhears German leader Adolf Hitler (that's fiction).
She escapes her overbearing husband and steers her way to Hollywood through shrewd negotiations with MGM studio boss Louis B. Mayer. The woman born Hedwig Kiesler becomes Hedy Lamarr, one of the most beautiful women in the movies.
Her best-known films include "Algiers" (1938), "Boom Town" (1940), "White Cargo" (1942) and "Samson and Delilah" (1949). But Benedict focuses on Lamarr's scientific contributions. In the early 1940s, while at MGM, Lamarr came up with frequency hopping and worked with composer George Antheil on a breakthrough crucial to cellphones, Wi-Fi and GPS.
Benedict never met Lamarr and didn't talk to the actress' children, but she hopes they'll read the book. "It's my interpretation of what could have occurred during that time period," she said. "It's a tribute to her and her contributions."
The author adopted a similar first-person approach in novels about other women. "The Other Einstein" is about Mileva Einstein-Maric, Albert Einstein's first wife. "Carnegie's Maid" focuses on Clara Kelley, who worked in Andrew Carnegie's home.
As a lawyer, Benedict said she went through documents, constructed narratives for clients and advocated for their positions. She has carried that approach to writing about unsung women.
"They're the ones I'm advocating for always," she said. "Their stories need to be told."
As Heather Terrell, her real name, she has written the historical novels "The Chrysalis," "The Map Thief" and "Brigid of Kildare." She also has written the young adult series "Sanctuary" and "Fallen Angel."
But for now, she is focused on historical women. Next up: Clementine Churchill, wife of Winston. Benedict has a list of 50 women whose stories she'd like to tell.
"The Only Woman in the Room" is her most successful book so far. It's on The New York Times Best Sellers list and a Barnes & Noble Book Club pick. She calls the Lamarr novel an origin story for a figure she loves.
"She never got to portray the fullness of her intellect, power, curiosity," Benedict said. "She never got to portray her full self on screen or even a fraction of it. It's such a gift for me to be able share that huge other part of her."

Texto completo: Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
Pop & Rock
SUSANA BACA at Sony Hall (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). This 74-year-old Peruvian singer-songwriter started her career as an ethnomusicologist, specifically focusing on Afro-Peruvian culture. But when David Byrne featured her recording "Maria Lando" on his 1995 compilation "Soul of Black Peru," she was thrust upon the international stage. Since, she has recorded six albums for his Luaka Bop label and won two Latin Grammys. Baca's repertoire includes both traditional Peruvian songs and her own originals, but the sound is consistent thanks to her ensemble's elegant acoustic instrumentation and her superlative, powerful voice.

ANITA BAKER at Radio City Music Hall (Feb. 13-14, 8 p.m.). At 61, this R&B legend concluded what was billed as her farewell tour in 2018 with a star-studded finale in September that included appearances by Stevie Wonder, Lalah Hathaway and Kelly Rowland. Thankfully for fans, she's back with this two-night run at Radio City. The "Giving You the Best That I Got" singer's roster of hits may have helped define the quiet storm era, which started in the 1970s, but at recent live shows, she has sounded as vital and captivating as ever.
212-465-6000, radiocity.com
TALIB KWELI at the BRIC House Ballroom (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). A Brooklyn native, this rapper gives an interesting spin to Valentine's Day concerts: His is a love letter to his home borough. Brooklyn -- specifically Park Slope, where Kweli grew up, and Fort Greene, where this concert will take place -- has changed dramatically since he first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as half of Black Star, which he formed with the M.C. Yasiin Bey (then known as Mos Def), a fellow Brooklynite. Kweli's message, though, has remained the same: He's still using his technical mastery to push for social and political reform in Brooklyn and beyond.

LIFE AND DEATH X SÓNAR at the Avant Gardner (Feb. 8, 10 p.m.). The influential electronic music label Life and Death is partnering with the Spanish festival Sónar to curate a night of D.J.s from around the world at this multiroom Brooklyn club. The lineup includes Life and Death's co-founder, D.J. Tennis (a.k.a. Manfredi Romano), who specializes in techno; the Los Angeles-based producer Daedelus, who makes experimental electronic music; the London-based house D.J. Call Super; and the Israeli D.J. Mor Elian, whose recent work skews toward electro and ambient music.

SARAH SHOOK & THE DISARMERS at the Knitting Factory (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). With a rare combination of deft, classic country sounds and plain-spoken storytelling, Shook bucks both Nashville's mainstream and the overly self-aware Americana scene. The twist comes from Shook's unconventionally compelling voice, which is low, steady and a little nasal, recalling Appalachian yodeling but with a grungy edge. Plentiful slide guitar and a reliance on barn-dance-ready shuffle rhythms ground the songs in tradition, and the execution is sharp enough that the band's old-school approach is convincing, a believable transformation of country's vintage melancholy.

SHARON VAN ETTEN at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Van Etten's new album, "Remind Me Tomorrow," is receiving rave reviews, thanks in part to the New Jersey-bred singer-songwriter's fairly dramatic stylistic shift. On her most recent releases, her confessional, poetic songs are bolstered by a slew of different electronic effects and synths instead of basic rock instrumentation. "I found that I was more drawn to the darkness and the driven synths and the syncopated beats," she told The New York Times last month. The elaborate production, though, does little to obscure her music's potent vulnerability.

NATALIE WEINER
Jazz
CLAUDIA ACUÑA at the Birdland Theater (through Feb. 9, 7 and 9:45 p.m.). Last week Acuña released "Turning Pages," her first album in a decade and her first to consist of mostly original tunes. It finds the Chilean-born vocalist luxuriating in the breadth of her powers, whether covering Abbey Lincoln or unveiling her own compositions; she's equal parts taut rhythm, flowing largess (think Cassandra Wilson in the 1990s) and sky-seeking mountain folk. Acuña performs songs from that album here with her band, featuring Juancho Herrera on guitar, Pablo Vergara on keyboard, Carlos Henderson on bass and Yayo Serka on drums.
212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com
ITAMAR BOROCHOV at Nublu 151 (Feb. 13, 9 p.m.). An Israeli-born trumpeter, Borochov plays contemporary jazz that's easy to enjoy. His melodies are direct and often plangent, his harmonies and rhythms sturdy and repetitious. His latest album, "Blue Nights," draws together influences from the Middle East and North Africa with jazz-academy thinking. He performs here, using his signature quarter-tone trumpet (a custom instrument that allows him to play more fluidly in Middle Eastern modes), with Rob Clearfield on keyboard, Sam Weber on bass and Jay Sawyer on drums. The North African folk band Innov Gnawa, which was featured on one track on "Blue Nights," will appear as special guests.

DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER at 92nd Street Y (Feb. 14, 7:30 p.m.). A recently minted National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, Bridgewater is one of jazz's most beloved straight-ahead veterans of the 1970s and '80s, with a style that's rooted in theater; she carries forth the storytelling legacies of Dinah Washington and Nancy Wilson. Her most recent album, "Memphis," is a homage to the soul music of the city where she was born, but at this Valentine's Day concert -- joined by her typical backing trio of the pianist Carmen Staaf, the bassist Tabari Lake and the drummer Tyson Jackson -- expect a more standard serving of romantic jazz fare.
212-415-5500, 92y.org
RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA'S INDO-PAK COALITION at the Miller Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Mahanthappa, an alto saxophonist, has been working with his Indo-Pak Coalition for long enough now that the group is starting to subtly outgrow the initial mission statement. They are no longer simply jazz improvisers combining musical traditions from across the Indian subcontinent. The trio -- which also includes the guitarist Rez Abbasi and the drummer and tabla player Dan Weiss -- has the restless, unboxable rapport of musicians broadly exploring musical sounds and strategies, with Indian classical as its launchpad.
212-854-7799, millertheatre.com
THUNDERCAT at the Blue Note (Feb. 12-14, 8 and 10:30 p.m.; through Feb. 17). Thundercat, a six-string-electric-bass wunderkind and merry prankster, might be the most hopelessly enjoyable artist currently making music in jazz's crossover territory. He will do a six-night run in the coming week, welcoming a range of unannounced special guests throughout. Expect wry, hilarious non sequiturs muttered in between songs -- like "Them Changes" and "Show You the Way" -- that will be full of elastic funk grooves and blistering bass solos. Thundercat, whose birth name is Stephen Bruner, has been improving his vocal chops recently; his singing still has an unpretentious, conversational allure, but now there's more body and breath behind it.
212-475-8592, bluenote.net
WING WALKER ORCHESTRA AND BRIAN KROCK'S LIDDLE at Threes Brewing Gowanus (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). Led by the young multi-reedist Drew Williams, the Wing Walker Orchestra is about to release a remarkable debut album, "Hazel." The music stays tightly woven, even as Williams switches up the grooves and harmonic palettes constantly; there's almost always a sharp, biting cadence coming from some part of the band (though not necessarily the rhythm section). The group shares this bill with Liddle, a combo fronted by the alto saxophonist Brian Krock, playing music that draws in equal measure from Charlie Parker, Anthony Braxton and Battles -- putting checkered rock rhythms underneath pelting, hard-edge melodies.

Texto completo: Yakima Valley winemakers are pulling out the stops to help you celebrate Valentine's weekend with a series of winemaker dinners and opportunities to savor the region's Red Wine & Chocolate festivities on Feb. 16-17.
Whether you're planning an elegant, multicourse dinner or a weekend searching for your favorite chocolate confection, you'll have a wide array of options during Presidents Day weekend. Here are a few highlights to include in your epicurean adventure.
If it's the chocolate that moves you, take time to learn what each winery is pairing with its wines. Every wine has a story, but during Red Wine & Chocolate, you can learn the story behind many of the handcrafted desserts featured throughout the Valley. Some highlights:
Gilbert Cellars is featuring Woodblock Chocolates. This husband-and-wife team from Portland look at creating chocolate as an artistic endeavor; owners Jessica and Charley Wheelock source and roast their own cocoa beans, allowing them to bring out the desired profiles in the cocoa bean before creating the chocolate.
Kana Winery will pair its wines with handmade chocolates in addition to offering for sale gourmet truffles from The Brigittine Monks at Our Lady of Consolation priory in Amity, Ore. The monks support their community by making and selling gourmet fudge and truffles; the chocolates have received national recognition from Town and Country magazine, Bon Appetit, People magazine, U.S. News & World Report, Chocolatier and The New York Times.
J. Bell Cellars will feature local chocolatier Stacy Stephen's of CC Chocolates. This new chocolate business is created by a local farming family that loves to share its talents. Originally apple and beef farmers, Jeannie and Mark Stephen found a passion in gardening, inspiring them to open Cowiche Creek Nursery. In addition, they farm blueberries and have developed a taste for bonbons and truffles, which resulted in the opening of CC Chocolates, a small, handcrafted chocolate business.
When Laura Lemons, owner of Killa Bites in Ridgefield, was thrown a curveball in life, she knew she needed to direct her priorities and turn a lemon into lemonade. So Laura developed her now-famous "cake bombs," which are mini-cupcake confections covered by filling and dipped in chocolate. Vanarnam Vineyards in Zillah will offer those best-selling cake bombs during the weekend.
If it's the savory experiences you like most, these winemaker dinners may pique your interest.
? J. Bell Cellars. The smooth, upbeat sounds of the Mel Peterson Collective will fill the air, and guest chefs from Yakima's Bite Club will serve a four-course, farm-to-table dinner paired with four of J. Bell Cellars' premier wines. It's at 6 p.m. Feb. 16; tickets are available at jbellcellars.com.
? Chandler Reach Winery. The winery will feature an intimate five-course dinner, with wines selected to showcase the best of what Chandler Reach offers. It's at 6:30 p.m. Feb. 15; make reservations by calling 509-588-8800 or emailing shelbey@chandlerreach.com. The full menu is at chandlerreach.com.
? Sleeping Dog Wines. One of the Valley' smallest wineries will be offering a winemaker dinner at Venezia Ristorante in Richland. The menu includes antipasti, fresh spinach salad, pastitisio, chicken Parmigiana, pork souvlaki skewers and sokolatina tort with port. Call 509-371-8300 for reservations.
Wine, chocolate, winemaker dinners and Red Wine & Chocolate festivities offer a flavor explosion. Regardless of how you choose to celebrate, the best way to experience the event weekend is with a premier pass, which gets you access to exclusive pairings, library tastings and discounts. More information and passes are available at wineyakimavalley.org.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
NEW YORK - An upcoming audio-only book will feature an author's memories of his complicated friendship with the late Philip Roth.
James Atlas' "Remembering Roth" comes out Friday, March 1, the audio publisher and distributor Audible announced Tuesday. Atlas, whose books have ranged from the memoir "My Life in the Middle Ages" to an acclaimed Delmore Schwartz biography, will reflect on a relationship that began in the late 1970s and continued for decades. Roth died last spring.
According to Audible, Atlas and Roth would take walks together in Manhattan, where the two had apartments on the same block, and read each other's work. (Atlas was among the few people Roth allowed to see a pre-publication edition of his novel "The Ghost Writer.")
In a 1979 profile that ran in The New York Times, Atlas wrote that Roth was "Discordant, manic, ebullient," with "the verve of a Borscht-circuit comedian and a genius for mimicry."
Their friendship was strained by Atlas' biography of one of Roth's literary heroes, Saul Bellow, a project that Atlas has written was suggested by Roth. Published in 2000, the book was condemned by many as an overly negative portrait.
Audible is describing "Remembering Roth" as "Atlas' deeply personal tribute to Roth delivered in his voice."

Re "Trump Says He'd Be Wary of Letting His Son Play" (SportsMonday, Feb. 4):
President Trump complained to The New York Times's publisher at their meeting last Thursday that just once he would like to see a positive piece about him. And a couple of days later one actually appeared.
The president talked about his fears about his son Barron playing tackle football. He sounded like any other concerned parent. No bluster, no posturing, just serious concern. To the extent that it matters, it was nice to see.

Local daily outsourcing jobs

Texto completo: Twenty-nine union employees at the Plain Dealer - mostly copy editors, page designers, and illustrators - will be laid off after March 2019, according to George Rodrigue, the paper's Editor and President. The plan is to outsource most of those jobs to a New Yorked-based company called Advance Local, which is a subsidiary of the PD's parent company, Advance Publications.
The decision caps weeks of negotiations between company management and the PD News Guild, a union that represents 68 Plain Dealer employees including reporters, copy editors, designers, photographers, and illustrators.
Wendy McManamon, a copy editor whose job is among those slated to be cut, said the paper's managers are saving money by trading in journalists with local perspective.
"Journalists care, their readers care," said McManamon, who also heads the PD Guild. "Maybe one day the people who run these newspapers will care again."
"We make this decision with some sadness," Rodrigue said in a statement Thursday, "but with the long-term preservation of The Plain Dealer at heart."
Over the past decade or so, improvements in technology have made it possible for groups of newspapers around the country to pool their resources, especially on pages of national and international news, sports, or features. This concept has been tested industry wide, and has proven to be both efficient and effective. It allows local newsrooms to focus their editing efforts on their local journalism, which means quality can be sustained at lower cost.
The Plain Dealer began in October to explore the question of whether we, too, could benefit from such production efficiencies. We solicited bids from companies that specialize in centralized production services, and invited the Northeast Ohio Newspaper Guild to discuss keeping production local. We have carefully reviewed all those proposals, including an offer from The Guild, and have chosen to contract with Advance Local for production of The Plain Dealer.
- George Rodrigue, President and Editor, The Plain Dealer
Despite the changes, "The Plain Dealer will remain a local institution," Rodrigue said, "Editorial decision making will remain the responsibility of The Plain Dealer's editors."
Local stories, which make up about half of the newspaper, "will be selected and copy-edited by veteran journalists based in Cleveland." He added that those who are laid off will have a chance to apply for those positions.
As the news sank in, some current and former Plain Dealer employees expressed dismay and frustration on social media. Rachel Dissell, a reporter at the paper since 2002, tweeted that the company was "following rather than leading":
Outsourcing means @ThePlainDealer editing, design and illustrations means Advance Publications is again following rather than leading.
- Rachel Dissell (@RachelDissell) December 28, 2018
"Just like it followed when other papers decided to give content away for free online. Because that worked out well...." she added.
The statement announcing the layoffs was "designed to confuse and deflect," said Josh Crutchmer, a former design and graphics editor for the PD, who currently works for the New York Times:
every single word of this is designed to confuse and deflect and write around the fact advance is killing the best designed paper in america and taking 30 jobs with it and ultimately will solve nothing https://t.co/zo5PHC552T
- Josh Crutchmer (@jcrutchmer) December 27, 2018
The PD Guild followed the announcement with a series of tweets, accusing the company's management of "union-busting" and opting for "cost savings and efficiencies" over quality.

Texto completo: Sharon Van Etten
Sharon Van Etten has been prolific in her decade-plus time as a musician, putting out upward of 10 releases, including her most recent, “Remind Me Tomorrow," which debuted last month. She'll be at Royale on Friday in support of the album with opening act Nilüfer Yanya. (Friday, Feb. 8, at 7 p.m.; Royale, Boston; $30-$35; 18+)
Mark Morris Dance Group's 'Pepperland'
The New York Times once called Mark Morris “the most successful and influential choreographer alive, and indisputably the most musical." His dance group will be back in Boston with “Pepperland," a dance tribute to The Beatles' landmark album “Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." In keeping with the eclectic sounds of the 1967 album, the dance will be accompanied by a chamber music ensemble of voice, soprano saxophone, two keyboards, theremin, and percussion. (Friday, Feb. 8, through Sunday, Feb. 10, at various times; Boch Center Shubert Theatre, Boston; $25-$75; all ages)
Boston SciFi Film Festival
Get your geek on at the 44th annual Boston SciFi Film Festival, which will feature appearances by Sam Jones (“Flash Gordon") and Sean Young (“Blade Runner"), along with more than 80 movies spread out over the 11-day event at the Somerville Theatre. The festival will close with a 24-hour movie marathon starting on Sunday, Feb. 17, at noon. (Friday, Feb. 8, through Monday, Feb. 18, at various times; Somerville Theatre, Somerville; $14.25 per film, $90 for the marathon, $125 for a festival pass; all ages)
Lunar New Year Celebration at the MFA
The Museum of Fine Arts will celebrate the Lunar New Year with free admission all day on Saturday. The museum also will have special events based on Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese traditions, like an interactive kung fu demonstration, a Chinese tea ceremony, and a lion dance performance. (Saturday, Feb. 9, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; free; all ages)
The Ghost of Paul Revere
It's perhaps fitting that this Portland, Maine, folk trio named for a man most famous for his midnight ride got some big national exposure in 2018 with a late-night appearance on Conan O'Brien's show. Catch the band at the Paradise on Saturday, along with local songwriter Aubrey Haddard — as long as you're 18 or older and not a Redcoat. (Saturday, Feb. 9, at 9 p.m.; Paradise Rock Club, Boston; $16 and up; 18+)

Texto completo: A U. S. professor is deeming the classic 1964 film "Mary Poppins" racist, accusing Julie Andrews of "blacking up" her face with soot while dancing with chimney sweeps.
In a New York Times op-ed called "'Mary Poppins,' and a Nanny’s Shameful Flirting With Blackface," Professor Daniel Pollack-Pelzner slammed the iconic dance scene where Poppins joins Dick Van Dyke's Bert on a rooftop for the song "Step In Time. "
"When the magical nanny … accompanies her young charges, Michael and Jane Banks, up their chimney, her face gets covered in soot, but instead of wiping it off, she gamely powders her nose and cheeks even blacker," Pollack-Pelzner wrote.
Related: Julie Andrews and Emily Blunt were both new moms making 'Mary Poppins'
The Linfield College literature professor linked the scene to racism in P. L. Travers' novels, which he claims "associate chimney sweeps’ blackened faces with racial caricatures. "
Pollack-Pelzner also took aim at naval officer Admiral Boom, who ordered his cannons fired at the "cheeky devils" on the roof after mistaking the dark figures of the chimney sweeps for "Hottentots," a racial slur.
"These aren’t really black Africans; they’re grinning white dancers in blackface," he wrote. "It’s a parody of black menace; it’s even posted on a white nationalist website as evidence of the film’s racial hierarchy. "
‘Mary Poppins Returns’: Everything we know about the musical sequel
Pollack-Pelzner's observations didn't sit well with many fans of the classic family film.
@Sherri_Garver questioned: "Ummm Seriously? #MaryPoppins is now in the Cross hair? THEY WERE CHIMNEY SWEEPERS!!! NOT "BLACK FACE IMPERSONATORS. "
"Mary Poppins wasn’t flirting with black face! It was soot in their faces from being a chimney!" user @Jencon1978 added. "Stopped spreading racism claims on non racist things like this!"
@AmandaEliasch said it's the, "end of the world when Hollywood thinks Mary Poppins is racist. "
And user @coldxman said, "People are searching for racism like it's oil. … If it were a literal commodity, however, it's value would be through the roof at this moment in history. "
The Emily Blunt-led 2018 sequel "Mary Poppins Returns" is currently nominated for several Academy Awards, including best costume design, production design and original score, as well as best original song for "The Place Where Lost Things Go. "
Review: Emily Blunt is spit-spot-on as the iconic nanny of 'Mary Poppins Returns'

Texto completo: BSO's Marin Alsop breaks Davos glass ceiling
There's a lot of news recently about the World Economic Forum, particularly the men who admitted there to being afraid to mentor women in the #MeToo era. What we should be hearing about from the Davos, Switzerland, forum, however, is the breaking the glass ceiling story that also happens to be a good Baltimore tale.
The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra's Music Director, Marin Alsop, received the prestigious Crystal Award at Davos and used the opportunity to promote the BSO and its OrchKids program. The award celebrates achievements of artists and cultural figures whose leadership inspires inclusive and sustainable change.
Also receiving the award were Haifaa Al-Mansour and Sir David Attenborough: Haifaa Al-Mansour, for her leadership in cultural transformation in the Arab world as the first female filmmaker in Saudi Arabia; Sir David Attenborough, for his leadership in environmental stewardship through his more than six decades of television.
Maestra Alsop's award is for her leadership in championing diversity in music. The award noted that she "is one of the greatest conductors of our time. Earlier this year she was the first woman to be appointed Chief Conductor of the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra and, in 2013, was the first woman in 118 years to conduct the BBC's 'Last Night of the Proms'. She has tirelessly endeavored to provide opportunities for all people to access music for a world where diversity in classical music is the exception. In Baltimore she launched the 'OrchKids' programme to serve the city's less privileged children, and the BSO Academy and Rusty Musicians for adult amateur musicians."
Maestra Alsop participated on panels with other outstanding women such as Rebecca Blumenstein, deputy managing editor of the New York Times; Michelle Bachelet, United Nations high commissioner for human rights; and HRH Princess Nane Annan, Kofi Annan's widow and Kofi Annan Foundation co-founder. Moreover, she spent time putting forth her Baltimore agenda with the heads of foundations such as Microsoft and Hilton Philanthropies.
Here at home the BSO faces a several difficult issues. But we should be proud of its highly successful European tour this summer and the good news from Davos about its director.
Rheda Becker and Mark K. Joseph, Baltimore

Video shows police fault
in death of Anton Black
I read with interest the letter concerning Anton Black's death from Jason C. Johnson the president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund ("Sun jumps to false conclusions about Greensboro death," Jan. 30). Like Mr. Johnson, I watched the video, and I am wondering what "relevant facts" he is referring to.
I saw an unarmed kid begin to jog away from a police officer who gives chase until cornering the kid who has shut himself into the family car in the driveway. Is this what Mr. Johnson is referring to as "behavior consistent with mental illness?" I'm not sure, but what I saw next was the officer wearing the camera bust out the window with his baton (without apparently attempting to communicate with the boy) and reach in and use an electric shocking device on his body. As the boy exits the car he is grabbed and sat on by a large adult whose attempts along with others present (including a random motorcyclist who participates; not being a cop I'm not sure if this is "empowering" procedure) until he stops breathing and exits this life as his mother watches.
Unlike Mr. Johnson of Alexandria, Va., I live about 10 miles down the road from Greensboro in Denton and have had several interactions under less than favorable circumstances with both officers from the Caroline County Sheriff's Department and the Federalsburg City Police Department. I have found them both to be unfailingly polite, clear with their actions and thoroughly professional.
In my humble opinion the actions that the Greensboro police officer took in this particular instance were totally unnecessary and inexcusable. A young man full of promise is dead. I look for more "relevant facts" in the future.
Dave Atwater, Denton
Why didn't Anton Black surrender?
"A preventable death." That's about the only part of your article that is indisputable ("The more we learn, the worse police look in the death of Anton Black," Jan. 24).
I've watched the body cam video several times. Please consider why the police were called to the residence in the first place; the actions of Black when approached by the police and the efforts of the police to talk him down and de-escalate the situation. The young man ran from the police, became combative and continued resisting arrest even after being subjected to a taser. His family members were there and witnessed the unfortunate event.
The medical examiner's report is factually correct to the cause and manner of death. Ask yourself, "Why did he not surrender?"

‘Valley News’ marks a new beginning

Texto completo: Longtime readers of the Valley News will notice that, in the last few days, their favorite local daily newspaper has taken on a new appearance. We’re about 2 inches slimmer and half an inch taller (just like the big guys, including The New York Times and The Boston Globe) and we have a new design with new fonts and typography that we hope will make reading us even easier.
Making these changes has not been easy. There have been hard decisions to make, which we’ll get to in a moment, and there will be bugs to work out. But we believe these changes will help us do the most important thing of all, and that is to continue to serve as the premier source of news and information for the Upper Valley, as we have since the first edition of the Valley News rolled off the presses on June 9, 1952.
We have noted a number of times since the summer — on our website, in a Sunday Valley News story by business writer John Lippman and in several notes to our readers from publisher Dan McClory — that the newspaper industry is facing tremendous challenges, and the Valley News is feeling them. These challenges, which include rising production costs and declining advertising revenue, are particularly acute for smaller local newspapers with less-deep pockets. Some newspapers, even big ones, have closed up shop or gone 100 percent digital. Others have been snapped up by hedge funds, vulture capitalists and private equity groups interested only in siphoning off a property’s profits or assets, not serving readers or their communities.
The Valley News, and its family-owned parent company, Newspapers of New England, have decided on a different approach.
The company has made a $4 million investment in a new printing facility in Penacook, N.H., where the Valley News is now printed and where its sister newspapers, the Concord Monitor and the Peterborough, N.H.-based Monadnock Ledger-Transcript, will be printed in the future. (In Massachusetts, Newspapers of New England also publishes the Daily Hampshire Gazette, Greenfield Recorder, Athol Daily News, Valley Advocate, Amherst Bulletin and The Summit.) The new printing plant will give the company a chance to boost revenue by printing other companies’ publications, and the new press will offer increased color capacity and options such as labeling, “wrap-around” advertising and sticky notes while at the same time significantly cutting production costs.
The potential benefits of these changes have not rendered them painless.
On Wednesday night we watched the final run of our venerable flexographic press, a bright blue, three-story, 220-ton behemoth that has dominated the back of our building since we acquired it from a newspaper in Copenhagen in 1990. Our deadlines are now earlier to accommodate the drive from Concord, which means some late news — scores from West Coast games, for example, or some Town Meeting and election tallies — won’t make it into the next morning’s print edition. (We will provide updates to late-breaking local stories and scores on our website and, in most cases, follow up in the next day’s edition.)
And there have been job losses, including three in the production department when the advertising design process was outsourced in July. The seven full-time members of our press crew and five full-time distribution personnel all were offered jobs at the new Concord printing facility, along with 18 part-time press and distribution staff. But given the 60-mile commute, just six have chosen to stay on board.
Losing a job is tough. So is watching friends and colleagues, some of whom spent decades at the Valley News, lose theirs. It is cold comfort to them, we know, but this process has inspired a determination in those of us who remain working at our office in West Lebanon — the reporters, photographers and editors, the advertising, customer service and administrative staff — to continue to cover the events and tell the stories that are important to you, to continue to provide you with the news, context and perspective you need, to continue to hold the powerful accountable and give you a platform to share your opinions with friends and neighbors. We know that the Valley News knits the Upper Valley together in ways no other organization can, and we promise to continue to bring to all of our readers, every day, the best newspaper — and the best website — we can produce.
Just the other day, Columbia Journalism Review published a story headlined “A brutal week for American journalism.” Before that, Editor & Publisher reported that “Gannett Lays Off Journalists Across the Country.” Earlier this month, the American Press Institute shared a Poynter Institute report titled “Did we just experience the hardest decade in journalism?” And let’s not forget, the president of the United States has labeled the press “the enemy of the American people.”
Yes, these are challenging times — even brutal times — for journalism in general and for small daily newspapers in particular. But for the journalists, advertising reps and other staff members of the Valley News, there’s nothing we’d rather be doing, and there’s no place we’d rather be doing it.
Thank you for reading, and thank you for supporting us with your subscription and advertising dollars. We look forward to continuing to serve you and the Upper Valley for many years to come.

The space has been improved, next needs to be the food For a beer and some big-screen TV action, Coppersmith Tavern &amp; Table is fine. But it needs to up its food and service game.

Texto completo: In the decades since it was built, the structure at 671 Main St. in South Portland has housed more than half a dozen restaurants. Chicago Dogs lived here until early 2018; before that were Tony Roma's, a Chinese buffet, a Mexican restaurant, and even the diner and ice-cream shop that once serviced the vanquished-looking Howard Johnson's hotel next door.
"Nothing special, though," Coppersmith Tavern & Table's general manager Gene DiMillo told me, as if absolving me for not being able to recall any of the businesses that once occupied this spot. "Bob and Paula (Coppersmith, the bar-restaurant's co-owners) are the first ones that have done a complete facelift of the place, got the fireplace working, all of it."
There's no denying that much of the interior looks recently renovated (apart from an annex dining room that looks like a suburban rec room), from an L-shaped, wood-topped bar coated in a layer of high-gloss polyurethane so thick it looks wet, to Edison-bulb pendant lighting and seven mammoth flat-screen televisions, each tuned to a different sports channel.
Yet it's not all mancave-modern. On several walls hang moody brown-and-gray ink illustrations by local artist Middy Thomas that contribute a humanizing, hand-crafted warmth the 90-seat restaurant desperately needs - especially in a space so laden with flickering screens and logo-and-brand-heavy visuals.
"You watching the game, hon?" my server asked on my second visit, as I sat solo and nursed a pint of Allagash White ($5.50). "Which one?" I replied, pointing at the three screens in my field of view. "Good point," she laughed, then set a shallow dish of fried calamari ($11) in front of me. "Well, then here's something else to distract you."
I dipped the crumb-breaded tentacles and rings into house-made, oregano-forward marinara, lazily giving myself over to the stream of playoff data as I chewed... and chewed. The calamari had been left in the fryer just long enough to make eating it a chore. And then I discovered the ultimate distraction: a deep-fried hot pepper hidden in the pile. It wasn't a complete surprise - the menu does indicate that cherry peppers are tossed into the fryer with the squid - but the wattage caught me off guard.
When I asked my server if this happened often, she looked at me quizzically and told me she had no idea there were peppers in the calamari.
Her response didn't shock me. On both visits, I encountered service problems that ranged from one server not knowing if the overdressed Caesar salad ($9) came with anchovies (it did not), to another who told our party of six that we "might have to move from our table if one of the regulars comes in."
Then there's the bartender, who spoke in baby-talk for 15 minutes, setting down a glass in front of a customer and asking him what would happen if she accidentally served him a "Bud Wight."
Atmosphere, too, was an issue on my first visit, when my party was seated in a room where laundry bags overflowing with soiled linen and tablecloths rested against one wall. A toddler from another table kept running over to jump on them before her horrified parents figured out what was happening.
All of these issues should be easy enough to remedy. After all, DiMillo is a food-service veteran with more than 40 years of experience in hospitality and knows how to train staff. But for the moment, another of Coppersmith's shortcomings keeps him otherwise occupied: There is no head chef.
DiMillo, who pitched in behind the scenes at his family's famous floating restaurant before starting his own business in Portland, has been running the back-of-house at Coppersmith since it opened in August.
"But I'm not a chef." he said. " 'Jungle cooks' is what my father used to call us."
It's hard to blame DiMillo, but the food coming out of the kitchen reflects a lack of culinary vision and, much more importantly, minute-to-minute quality control.
Some dishes squeak by - a lackluster but satisfactory take on cheese pizza ($9), a 10-inch thin-crust pie, made with homemade dough, but served barely cooked on a sling-like, paper pizza liner. Or a decent, if lukewarm, steak & cheese sandwich ($13) stuffed with shavings of Angus beef griddled together with onions, peppers and mushrooms, then topped with provolone cheese.
Most dishes that require little-to-no prep are similarly adequate, if uninspiring. Best among these are the Applewood-bacon BLT ($9) and deep-fried "tater kegs" ($9) mammoth, distributor-sourced tater tots seasoned with bacon, cheddar and chive.
Desserts (also from a corporate manufacturer) - like light, yet too-sweet carrot cake ($6.50) and a dense, super-fudgy three-layer chocolate cake ($6.50) that, on my first visit, was served chilled and a little dried-out from its time in the fridge - feel like placeholders rather than dishes anybody would get excited about eating.
The absence of kitchen leadership grows ever more noticeable as you order more complicated menu items. "Hope you like paprika," my server said flippantly as she set down a grilled hot dog bun overflowing with fresh-picked stone crab meat that had been enthusiastically crop-dusted with the red powder. Remove the layer of paprika, and the lightly mayonnaise-dressed sandwich is enjoyable - exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant owned by the same people who run Docks Seafood just a few miles away.
Worse was the Black Angus Burger ($10): a 6-ounce, char-broiled Angus beef patty on a toasted bun sourced (as is all of Coppersmith's bread) from La Marca and Sons in Malden, Massachusetts. Burgers may seem simple, but they overcook quickly. Mine arrived not medium-rare, but verging on well-done. Eating it was like trying to gnaw through a rope.
And I'm still scratching my head over the Fish Bowl ($11), a haddock fillet rubbed with Cajun seasoning, then cooked to a cinder before being interred under bland coleslaw and a pile of salsa made from mango, onion, bell peppers and garlic.
I took a bite, then went back for another confirmatory taste before taking a cleansing swig of my guest's nutty dry-hopped Sebago Frye's Leap IPA ($5.50). "I'm a little worried about this place," he whispered to me. "Me, too," I replied.
As a spot to watch football while you drink one of the dozen draft beers and snack on skin-on, pre-frozen French fries ($3.50), Coppersmith Tavern & Table fits the bill just fine. But if it hopes to avoid becoming yet another unremarkable layer in the palimpsest of this building, there is still quite a bit of work left to be done.

Texto completo: One of the greatest of summer joys -- hopping in the car and going for a ride -- becomes complicated when temperatures drop and snow starts falling. Locks freeze, windshields ice up, batteries give up the ghost. Roadside emergencies that might, in better weather, be mildly embarrassing -- getting stuck on a soft shoulder, say -- can be more difficult to deal with and even dangerous. If you're heading out on a winter road trip, take along these essentials and be prepared.
Hopkins/Subzero 16691 51" Ice Scraper
This tool provides lots of leverage, a razor-sharp scraper for ice, a brush to clear off snow-covered mirrors, and a squeegee for slushy, dirty windshields.
Rumpl Puffy Down Blanket
Bring a good outdoor blanket to warm cold feet or comfort complaining children. This one is stain -- and dirt -- repellent, perfect for car use.
Weego 44 Jump Starter
Cold temperatures sap your battery's power while thickening your engine's oil, both of which make it harder to turn the engine over -- a double whammy.
Purell Advanced Hand Sanitizer
Lock frozen? Dab a little hand sanitizer on your key, carefully work it into the keyhole, and the alcohol will melt the ice.
Voile Telepro Avalanche Shovel
A compact, collapsible shovel with a metal edge can cut through ice, dig tracks for tires and clear out a potential parking spot.

Texto completo: Catherine Sara Stahl and Andrew Vincent Shapiro were married Feb. 1 at the Fox Hollow, an events space in Woodbury, N.Y. Mary K. White, a friend of the bride's family and a judge in the family division of Vincinage 15 Superior Court in New Jersey, in Woodbury, N.J., officiated.
Mrs. Shapiro, 29, who goes by Cassie, is a production manager at Bernard Chaus, a women's sportswear company in New York. She graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor of arts in Italian and a bachelor of science in textiles, merchandising and design from the University of Rhode Island.
She is the daughter of Shelley E. Stahl and Edward J. Stahl of Marlton, N.J. The bride's father retired as the principal of Triton Regional High School in Runnemede, N.J. Her mother is a licensed psychotherapist in private practice in Haddonfield, N.J.
Mr. Shapiro, 30, is an investments optimization senior analyst at American Express in New York. He graduated from Boston University.
He is the son of Anne Mancuso and Howard M. Shapiro of Tarrytown, N.Y.

Second former employee who worked for the Trump Organization illegally to attend State of the Union

Texto completo: A former undocumented immigrant who worked for President Trump as a housekeeper will attend his State of the Union address next week — the second to be invited by a federal legislator.

Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., invited Sandra Diaz, who worked for Trump from 2010 to 2013 at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., to be his guest.

"It’s no small feat for a migrant from Costa Rica to stand up to a bully and hypocrite in the White House,” Gomez said in a statement. “She is living proof that President Trump couldn't be more wrong — both morally and factually — when he demonizes those who come to America seeking a better life.”

Diaz, who is now a legal resident of the U.S., shared her story of working for Trump while being an undocumented immigrant from Costa Rica with the New York Times last year.

Diaz said she was one of a number of undocumented workers who were employed at the golf club. Part of her job working at the golf club was to clean Trump’s personal residence, including washing and ironing his clothes.

“Apparently, the Trump Organization had no problem with hiring undocumented immigrants like Sandra to polish their golf clubs, serve them drinks, and make their beds. Treating these hardworking people with dignity, however, was clearly a bridge too far,” Gomez said.

Gomez won't be the only former Trump Organization employee who was an illegal immigrant while working for the company to attend the State of the Union. Victorina Morales, an illegal immigrant who was fired from Trump National in Bedminster after five years, will join Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., at the address.

Trump Jr.'s mystery calls in '16 weren't to his father; Investigators say business associates were on the line

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - For more than a year, congressional Democrats have pushed to unlock a mystery they said could reveal whether Donald Trump had advance knowledge of a meeting his eldest son had in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising damaging material about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The key, they said, was to determine who was using blocked telephone numbers to speak to Donald Trump Jr. before and after the meeting in Trump Tower, suggesting he may have communicated with his father on a private line.
But Senate investigators have concluded the blocked calls were conversations between Trump Jr. and two longtime business associates: Howard Lorber, a real estate investor who has done business in Russia, and Brian France, the chief executive of NASCAR, according to two people familiar with the determination.
The findings were first reported by CNN and ABC News.
France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Lorber said Friday that the real estate magnate "does not recall conversations with Donald Trump Jr. in the summer of 2016," adding that Lorber never discussed "any Russian matters" with the president's son.
Lorber is a longtime friend of the elder Trump, and the two went to Moscow in 1996 to scout for a real estate deal that never materialized, according to people familiar with the visit. The trip helped spur Trump's interest in seeking other ways over the years to build a tower in Moscow.
President Trump has long denied he knew about the Trump Tower gathering in 2016, which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. At the meeting, Trump Jr. was expecting a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin to share dirt on Clinton, he later told Congress, but she instead pressed him on a U.S. law levying sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses.
The president and his allies seized on conclusions by congressional investigators, saying the findings undercut Democratic efforts to raise questions about links between Trump and Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
"The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. ... Really sad," the president tweeted late Thursday.
"This Witch Hunt must end!" he added.
In his own tweet, Trump Jr. wrote: "More of the Democrat's #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes. I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that his father had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting with the Russians.
Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who now chairs the House intelligence committee, were skeptical of Trump Jr.'s account, noting that his first explanations of the meetings were misleading.
In a July 8, 2017, statement to The New York Times, Trump Jr., said meeting participants "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children." The statement did not mention that he was promised damaging information about Clinton - or that Trump Jr. had responded enthusiastically to the offer.
"If it's what you say I love it," he wrote in an email to an associate who offered to set up the meeting.
Democrats raised questions about phone calls made by Trump Jr. on June 6, 2016, that they thought might show that Trump's son informed his father about the meeting in advance.
At 4:04 p.m. that day, phone records show, Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian who helped arrange the meeting, called Trump Jr.
Phone records show Trump Jr. called Agalarov at 4:31 p.m. Between those two calls, phone records show that Trump Jr. was connected with a blocked phone number.
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember whom he spoke with at that time, but others testified at the time that his father uses a blocked line.
Democratic members of the House intelligence committee pushed for information on the blocked numbers for more than a year. But House Republicans rebuffed efforts to subpoena the phone records, according to Schiff.
Schiff told MSNBC that he would continue his efforts to "find out who Don Jr. was talking to about that meeting at Trump Tower."
"Those conversations could have taken place over the phone, or they could have taken place by Don Jr. walking down the hall to talk to his dad," he added Thursday.

David Brooks endorses Kamala Harris

Texto completo: New York Times columnist David Brooks said Sen. Kamala Harris could be the Democrats' best nominee to battle President Trump in 2020, and he said she might be able to "pulverize" him next year.

"To beat Trump, I suspect Democrats will want unity," wrote Brooks, the paper's center-right leaning columnist. "They won’t want somebody who essentially runs against the Democratic establishment (Bernie Sanders); they’ll want somebody who embodies it (Harris). They’ll want somebody who seems able to pulverize Trump in a debate (Harris)."

“Democratic primary voters may decide that if they are going to take on Donald Trump, they’re going to want the roughest, most confrontational gladiator they can get. After they see how, well, direct she can be, they may decide that person is Kamala Harris,” Brooks added.

Brooks said that while some people might see her past as an “aggressive prosecutor” as a weakness, he sees it as a strength. He said that in her job as a prosecutor, she was able to see more of the realities of some less fortunate. Especially, he noted, with her background as a “highly educated progressive coastal elite.”

“[I]n deciding to work as a prosecutor — rather than going to a law firm — Harris was immersing herself in the gritty world the rest of the achievatrons were rising away from,” Brooks said. “Working as a prosecutor put her in touch with a world in which brothers sexually abuse their 6-year-old sisters, in which a man literally scalps his girlfriend in a domestic dispute, in which parents are too financially stressed and personally strained to have the time to make sure their kids go to school.”

Harris, D-Calif., launched her presidential bid on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, began her campaign at a rally in Oakland over the weekend, and is one of the many high-profile Democrats who have entered, or are considering entering, the 2020 Democratic contest.

Fellows Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and, as of Friday morning, Cory Booker of New Jersey, are also running among more than a half dozen other potential nominees.

Partisan anti-Howard Schultz zealotry leads liberals to disparage the poor

Texto completo: You want to get a progressive angry? Well, that isn't even a challenge.

But if you want to get him really angry, remind him that former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is considering running for president in 2020 as an independent candidate. This has Democrat partisans up in arms, furious that he's going to cost some Democrat the election.

This outrage has produced a number of insane — and entirely partisan, mind you, not at all ideologically progressive — attacks against the perfectly boring liberal billionaire businessman. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, for example, claims Schultz is a plutocrat who is trying "to undermine resistance" to President Trump.

However, the lowest point so far in the lathery anti-Schultz frenzy that the Left has whipped itself into is the criticism of his completely accurate claim that he’s a “self-made” man.

“Howard Schultz: I’m a self-made billionaire. Also Howard Schultz: The federal government paid for my housing,” tweeted Jamison Foser, who serves currently as a senior adviser to the Tom Steyer-founded political action committee NextGen America.

New York Times magazine’s Nikole Hannah-Jones said elsewhere that “Growing up in government-(i.e. taxpayer) subsidized housing is actually the opposite of making it by yourself. Your fellow Americans put in so your parents could provide you decent housing.” She was retweeted in this anti-poor sentiment by no less than MSNBC's Chris Hayes.

For reference, Shultz’s personal story does indeed begin humbly in the projects in Brooklyn, N.Y.

“His father Fred never graduated from high school and held a series of blue-collar jobs including truck driver, factory worker and cab driver. He never made more than $20,000 a year, and with three children to feed, Fred was never able to afford to buy a home,” CNBC reported in 2016.

Schultz graduated later from Northern Michigan University, which he was able to attend only because he had a full football scholarship. He was the first person in his family to graduate college. He first started working for Starbucks in 1982, when there were only four stores. In 1987, he bought the still-tiny chain, which he grew in the following decades into a mega, multibillion-dollar success.

It's true that Schultz is an extremely wealthy man, but that's only because he worked for it. He certainly wasn't handed his wealth and success. He started as a kid from the projects and retired as the billionaire innovator of a company with nearly 30,000 shops worldwide.

But don’t you dare call him a “self-made” man!

“No one is self-made,” grumbled economist David Rothschild. “‘Projects in Brooklyn’ are government funded housing. Government also educated him, etc. [Starbucks] thrives because US military ensures the security of our international trade, police/fire protect its buildings, roads/sidewalks transport their customers.”

Lastly, there's New York Daily News columnist and former Obama administration official Brandon Friedman, who said, “If you ‘grew up in the projects,’ then you're not ‘self-made.’ The ‘projects’ are taxpayer-funded public housing. Your friends, neighbors, family members and millions of Americans you never met all worked and paid their taxes so that you wouldn't have to grow up homeless.”

We’re really going to do this? We’re going to stupidly pretend that “self-made” means something other than “I did not inherit my wealth"?

It’d be one thing if these critics were aiming to tear down the idea of individualism. It’d be one thing if they sought to underscore a contradiction between Schultz’s personal story and his position on whether social safety nets ought to be eliminated (he hasn’t advocated for this).

But they’re not doing any of those things. Their complaints amount to nothing more than: You’re not “self-made” if you were once poor enough to qualify for government assistance. As New York magazine’s Ezekiel Kweku notes, this is just as stupid as saying, "you're not self-made, your parents didn't let you starve to death.”

At this rate, it’s a guarantee we’ll see even dumber attacks on the most vanilla personality ever to mull a presidential bid in the United States. For now, though, dunking on kids from the projects is the low point of the Left’s anti-Schultz freak out.

Texto completo: Not Much Fit Into Print
Perhaps it was because some baseball writers were distracted by the fact that Dodgers Manager Leo Durocher had been suspended for his alleged association with gamblers.
Or perhaps it was that some writers were not sure what to make of Robinson and how much to actually write about him. Some were sympathetic, still others were skeptical he would make it. And when actual games were played, some were just used to covering them the way they always had in the past.
Whatever the reason, The New York Times gave minimal coverage to Robinson's major-league debut on April 15, 1947. The story about the game ran in the sports section, not on A-1. Robinson's name did not appear in the main headline nor, for that matter, in the headline for the accompanying Sports of the Times column.
The Times, was not alone in its approach. Dick Young, in his Game 1 story in the Daily News, did not mention Robinson until his last paragraph. Years later, he would wonder "how I could have been blind to the meaning of it all."

Years before he became a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times, Dave Anderson covered Jackie Robinson and the Dodgers for The Brooklyn Eagle and The New York Journal American. In this section, are excerpts from columns he wrote for The Times that looked back at that era. Other articles in this section were written by Jay Schreiber, with help from The New York Times archives and two books on Robinson -- "Opening Day," by Jonathan Eig, and "Jackie Robinson, A Biography," by Arnold Rampersad.

Media Layoffs As Democratic Emergency

Texto completo: Working in digital media is like trying to build a fort out of marshmallows on a foundation made of marbles in a country ruled by capricious and tyrannical warring robots. I've toiled in this business for nearly 20 years, and even in the best of times it has been a squeamish and skittering ride, the sort of career you'd counsel your kids to avoid in favor of something less volatile and more enduring -- bitcoin mining, perhaps.
It might be tempting, then, to dismiss the recent spate of media-biz layoffs as unfortunate but otherwise not concerning. Two hundred workers, including dozens of journalists, were given the slip last week at BuzzFeed. About 800 people are losing their jobs in the media division of Verizon, the telephone company that owns Yahoo, HuffPost, TechCrunch and many other "content brands." And Gannett, the once-mighty newspaper empire that owns USA Today and hundreds of smaller outlets -- from The Bergen County Record to The Zanesville Times Recorder -- is letting go of 400.
But it would be a mistake to regard these cuts as the ordinary chop of a long-roiling digital media sea. Instead, they are a devastation.
[Farhad Manjoo will answer your questions about this column on Twitter on Thursday at 1:30 p.m. Eastern: @fmanjoo.]
The cause of each company's troubles may be distinct, but collectively the blood bath points to the same underlying market pathology: the inability of the digital advertising business to make much meaningful room for anyone but monopolistic tech giants.
Coming in a time of economic prosperity, at world-historical levels of interest in the news, last week's cuts tell a story of impending slow-motion doom -- and a democratic emergency in the making, with no end in sight.
Consider: We are in the midst of a persistent global information war. We live our lives on technologies that sow distrust and fakery, that admit little room for nuance and complication, that slice us up into ignorant and bleating tribes. It is an era that should be ripe for journalists and for the business of journalism -- a profession that, though it errs often, is the best way we know of inoculating ourselves against the suffocating deluge of rumor and mendacity.
And for a while, it looked like we could do that. The past half decade has been a season of bold and optimistic innovation in media. In addition to the Trump bump, there was new money from venture capitalists, and giants in cable and telecom. Big brands, looking to attract millennials, began to spend haltingly and then generously on advertising, leading to a Cambrian explosion of new sites, new formats, new business models. And consumers began opening up their wallets to support journalism, turning around the fortunes of The New York Times.
Many in the industry remain optimistic about these ways forward. There's a doubling-down on subscriptions, a rush to podcasts and high-end video, and a return to smaller and more calculated media ventures, like Bill Simmons's tiny but profitable start-up, The Ringer. Then there is the charity of digital billionaires. The Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, Jeff Bezos' Washington Post, Laurene Powell Jobs's Atlantic magazine, Marc Benioff's Time and Farhad Manjoo's Color Me Skeptical That the Billionaires Who Got Us Into This Mess Will Save Us Gazette.
But it takes only a quick jaunt through the particulars of last week's layoffs to snuff out much reason for optimism.
In the cuts at Gannett, we see the nearly final evisceration of local news, an institution recognized as democratically vital even by the mainstream media's most frothing detractors. Gannett's end now looks nigh; the company is presently laboring under a hostile takeover bid by a secretive hedge fund whose only demonstrated expertise lies in "strip-mining" publications of their final morsels of profit.
In the troubles at Verizon, we see a behemoth that tried to take on Google and Facebook. Under a former executive, Tim Armstrong, the phone company bought up Yahoo and other media brands as useful pawns in a strategic war against internet giants. For similar reasons, Comcast has also plowed money into media start-ups.
But Verizon quickly learned that Facebook and Google are insurmountable. When new management took over last year, it began dumping the news in favor of readier ways to make money.
It's the cuts at BuzzFeed that sting most. You may regard the site as a purveyor of silly listicles and inane quizzes. I think of it as a relentlessly experimental innovator: It's the site that gave us The Dress and published The Dossier, a company that pushed the rest of the industry to regard the digital world with seriousness and rigor.
More than anyone else in media, BuzzFeed's founder, Jonah Peretti, bet on symbioses with the tech platforms. He understood that the tech giants would keep getting bigger, but to him that was a feature, not a bug. By creating content that hooked into their algorithms, he imagined BuzzFeed getting bigger -- and making money -- along with them.
At the least, the layoffs suggest the tragic folly of Mr. Peretti's thinking. Google and Facebook have no economic incentive for symbiosis; everything BuzzFeed can do for them can also be done by the online hordes who'll make content without pay.
So where does that leave media? Bereft.
It is the rare publication that can survive on subscriptions, and the rarer one that will be saved by billionaires. Digital media needs a way to profitably serve the masses. If even BuzzFeed couldn't hack that, we are well and truly hosed.

Immigrant Who Worked For Trump Gets Invited

Texto completo: An undocumented immigrant who worked at one of President Trump's golf clubs in New Jersey for years and recently spoke out about her experience will attend his State of the Union address after being invited by her Democratic congresswoman, the woman's lawyer and the congresswoman's office said Wednesday.
The undocumented immigrant, Victorina Morales, had worked as a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., since 2013, and spoke to The New York Times as part of an article published last month. The report revealed that the president's company -- the Trump Organization -- was, for years, employing people at the golf club who are in the country illegally.
In a brief interview on Wednesday, Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before The Times article was published. Still, the lawyer, Anibal Romero, said that neither he nor his client has received notice that she has been fired. He said Ms. Morales's employment status with the golf club was not entirely clear.
Since leaving her job, Ms. Morales, who is from Guatemala, has campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, she said she was pleased to have been invited to the State of the Union, that she has accepted the invitation and that she was "very proud because I am going to raise my voice for all of us immigrants."
"I'm not scared to show my face," she said, speaking in Spanish. "I am not speaking for me, I'm speaking on behalf of millions of undocumented immigrants who live in the United States."
The congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, represents the New Jersey district in which Ms. Morales lives. The news that Ms. Morales had been invited to attend Tuesday's State of the Union address as Ms. Watson Coleman's guest was reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday.
"Immigrants by and large are hardworking, trustworthy and skilled people who simply want to work and build better lives here," Ms. Watson Coleman said in a statement. "For years these kinds of people were loyal and dedicated enough to be Trump Organization employees. I hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country -- women and children fleeing violence; law-abiding, taxpaying people who would do almost anything to be Americans. And if he can't, I've invited Victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face."
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.
Mr. Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, and his insistence on building a border wall led to the recent partial government shutdown. He has labeled illegal immigration "a major, major problem," and pledged to build a border wall while his administration has carried out workplace raids and payroll audits.
The Times article, published Dec. 6, said undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff. It also said they were kept on the payroll even though management was aware they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.
Ms. Morales previously told The Times that a manager at Bedminster had helped her secure a new fake Social Security number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.
Since the article was published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.
Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y., this month, a development first reported by The Washington Post.
The Trump Organization also said late Tuesday that it was implementing a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties.
"I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking," Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in the statement on Tuesday. "Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice."
He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it "demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately."

Texto completo: Despite the recent settlement of the Los Angeles teachers strike, mostly in the teacher union’s favor, the deal largely ignores the shaky financial realities of the school district. While the union crows about its apparent victory, the potential fiscal disaster should make teachers consider leaving the union, not rallying around it.
In addition to a 6 percent raise for teachers, the settlement deal includes more staff at schools and a cap on class sizes. Yet, the district’s finances mean that the deal is built on quicksand.
As the New York Times pointed out, “the deal essentially punted on the question of how the district would come up with the $403 million to pay for the additional staff members.”
Further, the district can only afford the deal if it can pass a local parcel tax in 2020 and receive increased state funding from Sacramento.
These glaring financial questions clash with the district’s current bottom line.
For example, state law requires the district to maintain a minimum 1 percent budget reserve, and the district has a structural deficit, spending more than it takes in.
That structural deficit will soon end up causing the district to dip below the state-mandated 1 percent minimum.
Los Angeles County Office of Education superintendent Debra Duardo recently told the education group Speak Up, “it’s gotten to the point where [the district] can’t show us that they can maintain a 1 percent reserve in their third year out.”
The County estimates that by 2021-22, “the district will be bankrupt.”
Duardo points out, “Especially at a district as large as LAUSD, if they were to go insolvent, then they would be in really big trouble.”
What kind of trouble? For teachers, here is the chilling warning.
The district, says Duardo, “would actually run out of the cash they need to pay their teachers and all of their salaries.”
Duardo explains that a budget reserve is a one-time pot of cash, and “that’s not money you [will] have [again in the future].”
In response to a question about the district giving in to the union’s demands, Duardo is clear about the ramifications: “The law is set up where if they were to show us in their budget that they don’t have enough money to maintain that reserve, and even go further into the negative — which would concern us that they may be at risk of becoming insolvent — then the next step would be for us to assign a fiscal advisor.”
The kicker: “And a fiscal advisor has stay-and-rescind authority, which means that if there are decisions being made that put the district at risk of becoming insolvent, then we could override decisions that the board is making.”
The union claims that the district is not deficit spending, but Duardo points to the simple fiscal fact that the district’s reserve is plunging, so if there were no deficit spending “we wouldn’t see this reserve dwindling down to below 1 percent.”
The new settlement deal, therefore, may be a Pyrrhic victory for teachers that could cause harm to them and their students.
Instead of blindly following their union, teachers should consider taking advantage of their new rights under the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, which held that public employees cannot be forced to pay dues or fees to unions.
Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the Janus majority opinion, wrote that it is an unconstitutional infringement on the rights of public employees to require them “to provide financial support for a union that ‘takes many positions during collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences.’”
L.A. teachers should make use of their Janus rights and walk away from the union, not walk with it over a cliff.

Russell Baker and why you should read the obituaries

Texto completo: With the death of Russell Baker on Jan. 21, America lost one of its great journalists. The two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist had not written regularly for many years, and some obituaries referred to him as a humor columnist, which is a mischaracterization. Baker was an essayist who wrote humor quite well but was so versatile he could write, with wit and compassion, about anything -- politics, journalism, history, current events or language.
Upon his death, what bears mentioning is his unmatched ability to write about how time and culture pass away. One example serves to illustrate.
In 1997 Baker wrote the foreword for a book of obituaries and farewells by The New York Times called "The Last Word." In our current age of fake news and Twitter, his observations are more true than ever.
In the foreword he wrote, "As youth turns into middle age, and middle age turns into grayness and failing vision, the cultural collapse accelerates. It becomes routine to arrive at the obituaries and find another part of your past has been moved out during the night. At a certain age, the past starts vanishing so fast that it is impossible to keep track any longer of who is dead and who is alive."
He realized that, in some measure, death results in a societal loss of knowledge by pointing out trivial examples: hand-cranking a car on a cold morning, butchering a hog, baking a cake from scratch. Obviously, fewer and fewer people know how to do these things, and in most ways it really doesn't matter. But Baker understood in some profound sense that there was a more serious aspect to this loss of knowledge that comes with death.
"More alarming is the loss of knowledge of old realities. Each day death takes another batch of people who experienced the time of Hitler and his war. This is a serious loss, for many of their replacements have been encouraged to think of Nazis as sources of entertainment. Sitcoms have portrayed them as comical bunglers. Film has spread a romantic taste for those smashing Nazi uniforms. Those beautiful ankle-length leather coats! Those fantastic red-and-black armbands. Here is a case where death is robbing us of valuable knowledge. The Nazis were not entertaining, they were not comical and not bunglers. They were fine soldiers and dangerous, terrifying, dreadful people. In their enchanting red, black and leather, they were as romantic as the machine-gunning of a mass grave."
Where to turn? The obituary.
Baker wrote that "obituaries often provide the only pleasure to be had from the daily newspaper and should be savored slowly, for leisurely reading over the last cup of breakfast coffee. To plunge into them first thing, before having endured the rest of the day's news, is like eating the dessert before taking a fried-liver dinner. What blessed relief they provide after the front page -- people butchering the neighbor's wives and children to serve God, right injustice, and display cultural superiority; science announcing that everything you love to do, eat, or drink will kill you ... then at last the obituaries. Oases of calm in a world gone mad. Stimulants to sweet memories of better times, to philosophical reflection, to discovery of life's astonishing richness, variety, comedy, sadness, of the diverse infinitude of human imagination that it takes to make this world. What a lovely part of the paper to linger in ... for long thoughts and easy living it's the obituaries every time."
It is worth contemplating whether, in our digital age, we will lose this refuge to which he alludes.
And what set Baker apart from other writers who tackle the passage of time, albeit not as well, was that he was no maudlin nostalgist. No "back to the good old days" for him -- he was upbeat about it.
"I am amused to realize that half the present population of the United States will not recognize (most of) the names that made up the environment in which my life was lived. From their viewpoint I am a creature from another planet. This is a rather pleasant feeling. I have been to a place the young can never know. It provides a harmlessly spiteful pleasure to realize that though my culture is vanishing the new culture can never know the pleasures of chewing Jujubes in the Lord Baltimore Theater while Charlie Chan scolds Keye Luke, of falling in love with Margot Fonteyn at Covent Garden, remembering when Leo 'the Lip' Durocher taught me the roguish joys of irreverence by preaching that nice guys finish last."
Interested readers can locate these arcane references through Google, but fair warning -- it won't be the same.
Now Baker has joined that distant planet. Unfortunately, younger people will never have the privilege to enjoy the same pleasant place he described. Some advice to you steeped in social media or those who refuse to watch black-and-white movies, do yourselves a favor. Read something by Russell Baker. You'll enjoy it -- and he would have too.

Westbrook's famed ice disk slipping away

Texto completo: Westbrook's ice disk, the naturally occurring phenomenon that captured the world's attention during a two-week spin in the Presumpscot River, appears to be nearing its end.
The disk, which had been spinning counterclockwise for several days after it appeared on Jan. 14, came to a standstill last Tuesday when air temperatures plummeted and it froze into the river ice. It remained stationary Sunday.
The edge of the disk facing upriver toward Saccarappa Falls, which is just a few hundred feet away, had melted Sunday evening and eroded to the point where the disk was no longer circular. The side of the disk adjacent to Ash Street was frozen into the riverbank.
However, the side of the ice disk facing the parking garage on Dana Court - on the opposite side of the river from Ash Street and the city's River Walk - seemed to be intact.
On Sunday evening, several people standing on the River Walk boardwalk turned and walked away after realizing that the disk was beginning to turn into river mush. The center of the disk, which at its peak was about 100 yards in diameter, looked like it had melted and turned into a pond of water.
Tina Radel, Westbrook's marketing and communication manager, has used the city's drone to take extensive aerial footage of the disk.
She said the disk started to show signs of deterioration last Thursday after most of Maine was hit with heavy rains and temperatures that reached 50 degrees.
"It was a giant piece of ice. We knew it wouldn't be there forever," Radel said Sunday night. "We like to think of it as our rainbow. It made people smile before it fades away. It became a natural wonder in an urban setting."
Radel said the ice disk breathed new life into an area of Westbrook that the city that has been trying to promote, bringing visitors who may have never been to Westbrook before the disk formed.
The River Walk extends 1.2 miles from Saccarappa Falls, cutting a path behind a string of Main Street businesses and restaurants and past the city's Riverfront Park before ending on Cumberland Street.
Radel said the city has no plans to commemorate the demise of the ice disk. "We'll go back to business as usual," she said. "But we will certainly never forget it."
Visitors who came to see the disk Sunday evening said they were disappointed.
"It's not an ice disk anymore," said Millilani Johnson of Standish.
She had never seen the disk before, and that's why she and her husband, Greg, decided to take a few hours out of their vacation to stop in Westbrook. "I wish it was still spinning."
"We're disappointed," said Greg Johnson. "It was kind of cool having a worldwide phenomenon right here in Westbrook."
Greg Johnson said he had observed the disk on a couple of prior occasions and agreed that it was in critical condition.
"The ice disk is nearly dead," he said.
At the nearby Legends Rest Taproom, bartender Diana Corbett said she had served a bunch of Ice Disk Cosmo cocktails Sunday. The bar named the drink after the disk, which Corbett admitted did wonders for their business.
Legends had a line of people waiting to get in Friday night - unusual for this time of year.
But Corbett said Sunday's customers expressed regrets that the disk, which has been floating just a few hundred feet from Legends' rear entrance, was starting to disintegrate.
"Please tell everyone that it was good run," Corbett said of the disk and its economic impact.
The city's ice disk garnered attention from around the world.
It received coverage from the BBC, ABC's "Good Morning America," and The New York Times, among other news outlets.
Last week, Brown University asked if it could set up a webcam to monitor the growth and eventual demise of the ice disk. Rob Mitchell, the owner of a building on Ash Street, gave his approval, and Ethos Marketing, which is a tenant in Mitchell's building, allowed the university to access its internet network to stream the pictures.
Unfortunately for viewers, moisture got inside the camera this weekend, creating an image that was more foggy than clear. But the 20-second delay time-lapse video taken Sunday did show that the left side of the disk, closest to Ash Street, was starting to erode.
The ice disk also attracted some negative attention.
A New Jersey man armed with a pickax, hatchet and chainsaw walked onto the ice floe last Thursday, telling news media he wanted to study it and turn it into a giant peace sign.
Christopher Angelo, 44, has a history of staging public stunts and was not charged by police. He has been arrested for doing stunts in other states.
"Today was a rough day for the ice disk. It was hit by warm temperatures, heavy rains and an out of state visitor who used tools to cut chunks out of it and carve a line across the middle," the city of Westbrook wrote Thursday in a post on its Facebook page.
"We discourage anyone from attempting to go out on the ice. It is not safe and the public is enjoying it intact. We hope the ice disk can rebound."
Radel said she spoke with Chris Horvat, the scientist from Brown University who has been studying the ice formation, and he told her that Angelo's antics probably did not inflict significant damage.
"That piece of ice may be up to a thousand tons. Let's hope Mother Nature wins here and people stay off the ice to let nature do its thing," Horvat told the city.

No longer bound by 'gag clauses'

Texto completo: In October, President Donald Trump signed two new bills into law that prohibited "gag clauses" in contracts between pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers - companies that manage an insurance plan's drug benefits.
The move was a victory for the pharmacists, who said the clauses restricted their ability to communicate information to patients about drug costs - namely, when it was cheaper to pay with cash rather than using insurance.
Under new federal laws, pharmacists can now freely share that information without worrying about legal repercussion from pharmacy benefit managers.
The prohibition on the clause applies to drug benefits in commercial and Medicare insurance plans. While the prohibition on Medicare plans officially doesn't go into effect until 2020, pharmacy benefit managers of Medicare prescription drug plans have been told to not include "gag clauses" by officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Chances are, you didn't hear a big announcement from your local pharmacist or pharmacy about the change.
Mainly, there hasn't been a big change that would have been noticed by patients, said Marc Murdock, ambulatory care pharmacy manager for Virginia Mason Memorial. He oversees outpatient pharmacies at the hospital, North Star Lodge and Memorial Cornerstone Medicine.
Still, Murdock considers the new federal law a win for consumers.
"Now they know if they want information, it's (all) available for them," he said.
Here's what you should know about so-called "gag clauses" and how they impact consumers.
What's a "gag clause"?
The phrase is a bit of a misnomer because such a clause may refer to multiple provisions or requirements in a contract between a pharmacy and a pharmacy benefit manager, said Scott Brunner, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the National Community Pharmacists Association, a national trade organization of pharmacists and pharmacy owners.
Such provisions can require the pharmacy to quote the price from the pharmacy benefit manager or restrict pharmacies from disclosing information on social media channels or other media, he said.
How does that affect what information consumers receive from a local pharmacy?
Such provisions have prevented pharmacists from telling patients when it's cheaper to purchase a prescription drug at the cash price rather than having it covered through insurance and paying a co-pay.
Chris Brown, president of Wray's Marketfresh IGA, which runs pharmacies at its stores, said consumers always had the option to inquire about the cash price about a drug and that many customers have done so.
However, for those who didn't know what to ask, it was a key piece of information pharmacists didn't disclose to avoid running afoul with the pharmacy benefits manager, Murdock said.
"You were worried about breaking that contract," he said.
Why did pharmacies agree to such contracts?
Many pharmacies felt they had no choice and that they had to sign contracts if it meant losing insured customers otherwise, Brunner said.
In a story in The New York Times this month, Mark Merritt, president and chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents benefit managers, said the use and implementation of gag orders were an "outlier."
But Brunner said most pharmacists were circumspect in disclosing certain information if they thought they were at risk of breaking contract provisions.
Now that we have federal laws that prevent such provisions, what are pharmacies doing?
Murdock said there wasn't a huge change in how his pharmacies communicate with consumers. But he feels that local pharmacists are more comfortable telling people about the cash price for a given drug.
"They have the liberty to say, 'If we don't run this through your insurance, it's going to be a lot cheaper,'" he said.
For Jeff Rochon, president of the Washington State Pharmacy Association, a statewide trade organization, the new laws acknowledge the challenges of working with pharmacy benefit managers.
"I think the federal bills are a positive step to recognize restrictions placed on pharmacists appropriately," he said.
Brown said the new laws increase transparency.
"We don't have to worry about running afoul with the third-party guys anymore," he said.
Will I save money?
Not necessarily.
Brown said there was once a major cost difference between paying with cash rather than having it covered through insurance. "You would be paying $15 to $30 co-pay and the cash price for a generic drug might be $2.50," he said.
That's not the case now, he said.
Murdock said that while paying the cash price might yield savings, patients will still need to compare prices and seek less-expensive and/or generic options of a certain drug.
Still, if pharmacists can reveal that information freely, more consumers will be aware that the information is out there.
"Certainly, it's empowered patients (to) ask pharmacists if there's a lower cash price," Brunner said.
What's next?
States across the U.S. have passed or are working to pass their own bills that would further restrict such "gag clauses" for plans not covered in the federal law, such as Medicaid.
In Washington state, Senate Bill 5422 would strengthen further prohibition of any contract clauses that would restrict a pharmacy's ability to disclose information to its patients. The bill, among other things, looks to restrict other practices by pharmacy benefit managers, such as the co-pay "clawback." A clawback occurs when a patient pays an insurance co-pay higher than the price negotiated by the pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy and the manager keeps the difference.
Rochon said that while he's pleased with progress in increasing price transparency for consumers, there are still other practices, such as clawbacks, that can restrict patient access to affordable drugs.
"There's still a great deal to be done," he said.

Texto completo: In all, WikiLeaks released 50,000 pages of stolen communications related to the Clinton campaign and Podesta.
WASHINGTON — Every criminal case brought against a senior member of the Trump campaign as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has revealed a new attempt to conceal contacts with Russia or intermediaries linked to the Kremlin.
Michael Cohen, the longtime personal attorney to President Donald Trump; Michael Flynn, the Trump administration's first national security adviser; Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman; and George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the campaign; all have been implicated in back-channel efforts to establish lines of communication with the United States' primary adversary – Russia.
In a 24-page indictment revealed Friday against Roger Stone, one of Trump's longtime political advisers, Mueller's prosecutors took their deepest plunge yet into the inner workings of the Trump campaign and its intense interest in the Kremlin's effort to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential bid with hacked emails laundered through the group the government says became its de facto publishing arm: WikiLeaks.
Since he began investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, Mueller hasn't charged any Americans with plotting to help the Kremlin. Instead, his office has indicted a succession of Trump associates – and now Stone – accusing them of lying to investigators about their activities, and has sketched an increasingly detailed picture of efforts by the campaign to benefit from hacking by Russian intelligence services that the U.S. government says was meant to help deliver Trump the presidency.
Stone's relationship with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group that published troves of documents stolen from Democratic political organizations by a hacking group backed by Russian military intelligence, is at the heart of the Friday court filing in which the self-avowed political "dirty trickster" was charged with lying to investigators, obstruction and witness tampering.
Following a brief court appearance Friday morning, a defiant Stone stood before jeering protesters and cheering supporters claiming that he was "falsely accused" and would "plead not guilty."
Prosecutors detailed a series of alleged contacts between Trump campaign officials, who were not identified in court documents, and the colorful political adviser who had publicly boasted of his connections with WikiLeaks and its embattled founder, Julian Assange.
Assange has been living in exile at the Ecuadorian embassy in London since being granted asylum in 2012, in part to avoid the reach of British authorities and possible U.S. prosecution.
Prosecutors allege that starting in the summer of 2016, as Trump was securing the Republican nomination for president and as the FBI was launching its initial inquiry into Russia's interference campaign, Stone communicated with senior Trump campaign officials about WikiLeaks and the politically-charged material in its possession.
In those contacts, according to court documents, the campaign officials referred to information that "would be damaging to the Clinton campaign."
One of the most striking of the allegations disclosed Friday was contained in a passage in which prosecutors asserted that after a July 22 release of stolen Clinton-related emails, "a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information (WikiLeaks) had regarding the Clinton campaign."
"Stone, thereafter, told the Trump campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by (WikiLeaks)," prosecutors alleged.
Prosecutors did not identify the senior campaign official, nor did the documents elaborate on who may have directed that official to get in touch with Trump's longtime adviser.
But the July 2016 timeline referenced in the court documents closely tracked a series of related events that month, including an often-cited July 27 campaign appearance by then-candidate Trump who appealed to Russia to unearth Clinton's electronic communications.
"Russia, if you are listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing," Trump said, referring to a tranche of emails linked to an FBI review of Clinton's communications while she served as secretary of State.
Mueller's office previously alleged that later that day, hackers working for Russia's military intelligence service "attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton's personal office."
Prosecutors did not allege that Stone or other campaign aides worked with WikiLeaks to release the stolen records. Instead, they allege that Stone lied to the House Intelligence Committee during its investigation of Russian election interference, and that he tried to conceal emails and other records the committee had requested that related to his efforts to obtain information about WikiLeaks' planned disclosures.
Those efforts, according to prosecutors, continued into the fall and included alleged collaborations with intermediaries including right-wing political commentator Jerome Corsi, identified in court documents as "Person 1," and radio host Randy Credico, identified by prosecutors as "Person 2."
In an Aug. 2, email, Corsi allegedly informed Stone that Assange "plans 2 more dumps" of emails, including one in October. "Time to let more than (Clinton campaign chief John Podesta) to be exposed as in bed (with) enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC," the message said, referring to Clinton.
Following the Oct. 7 release of the first batch of Podesta communications, prosecutors alleged that an associate of an unidentified, high-ranking Trump campaign official sent Stone a text message: "Well done," it said.
That official was campaign and administration adviser Steve Bannon, according to copies of the messages published by The New York Times.
In all, WikiLeaks released 50,000 pages of stolen communications related to the Clinton campaign and Podesta.

If you did this in college, you can still do it

Texto completo: With our dinner outing canceled on a cold, snowy night, my wife and I snuggle up on the couch to watch "Rake," an Australian television series about a talented but self-destructive barrister. A scene between the lawyer and his former prostitute brings back college memories, and by the time the credits are rolling, my wife and I are sitting at the dining room table trying to remember how to do it.
No worries.
"The game is easy to learn, difficult to master," says Tim Mabee, 72, the Naperville man who heads up Pub Club, the state’s most successful and longest-running continuous backgammon group. "I’ve been playing about 30 years and competing for about 25."
Backgammon, a game in which two players roll dice in a race to move 15 checkers around the 24 points on the board, likely originated in Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago, according to "The Backgammon Book," published in 1970 at the beginning of the last great backgammon craze in the United States. Playing boards were found in King Tutankhamen’s tomb. Plato, Homer, Chaucer and Shakespeare referenced the game in their writings. Roman emperors Claudius and Nero played it. So did Thomas Jefferson.
Paul Magriel, a mathematics professor and author of "Backgammon," won major backgammon tournaments and wrote a weekly column on the game for The New York Times in the late 1970s, when Pub Club got its start. That’s also when my college roommate and I played backgammon for money, with quarters being the currency of choice for the Laundromat washing machines or a game of Space Invaders. Who plays backgammon these days?
"Can I call you right back? As it turns out, I’m in the middle of playing a game of backgammon," says Mabee, who generally plays four days a week, including the Pub Club tournaments, which start at 7 p.m. every Thursday at Crazy Pour, an upscale sports bar at 105 E. North Ave. in Villa Park. The group typically draws a couple dozen players, more than 30 some nights, both men and women, speaking Russian, Georgian, Spanish and English.
"There are so many different professions, languages, and socio-economic levels that we have in our little club right in the suburbs," says Mabee, who grew up in a home where diversity and social justice were important.
Backgammon is the great equalizer, he says. Even the club’s 2018 champion, David Rockwell, still lost nearly a third of the games he played.
"The dice introduce all sorts of vagaries," Mabee says. "Anybody can beat anybody."
That’s why the club plays seven-point matches, with each game counting for one point. A cube allows players to double the points for a win if they think they have an advantage. Faced with a doubling, a player can resign and lose one point, or play on, and even double the points again if the prospects change.
"Playing one game against an average player, my skill would give me 55-percent chance of winning," Magriel once said. "An hour’s worth of games would make the odds two or three to one in my favor, and, if we played all day, my opponent wouldn’t stand a chance."
The Pub Club single elimination tourney usually lasts five or six rounds and winds up before midnight. A team of the top Pub Club players will be vying for their fourth straight state backgammon championship on March 3 in Bloomington against the five other Illinois clubs — Chicago Bar Point Club of Skokie; the Bloomington-Normal Backgammon Club; the Peoria Backgammon Club; the Sangamon Valley Backgammon Association of Springfield; and the Winnetka Backgammon Club.
"It’s not clear why it’s such a big deal, but this is one of those ‘Stanley Cup’ trophies where all the names go on the trophy," says Mabee, who didn’t make the cut as a player this year for the first time since 2006. Often missing games to help run the club, Mabee says his status as the all-time points leader for the club could fall as soon as next month.
In his younger days, Mabee loved poker. "I play very badly," Mabee says, explaining how opponents could tell if he had a good hand. "There’s no bluffing in backgammon."
Artificial neural networks, the technology used to help computers learn, turned computers into chess masters years ago, but only recently got a handle on the game of backgammon. "It has certainly improved play. It’s one of the reasons I’m a has-been," says Mabee, who once finished second in the American Backgammon Tour and also owns a 1-0 record against Magriel. "What I like best is the subtlety of the strategy. You always have to have a plan B."
There is a $10 fee to play in the weekly tournaments, although Mabee picks up that cost for first-time players, and players are encouraged to bring a board. For more information about Pub Club, visit pubclubchicago.com, and for more information on the game, visit the U.S. Backgammon Federation website at usbgf.org. The Chicago Open, May 23-27 at the Holiday Inn & Suites Chicago O’Hare in Rosemont, draws most of the top U.S. players, as well as an international roster that includes Akiko Yazawa, who is considered by many to be the world champion, Mabee says.
Mabee’s wife, Linda, doesn’t play. Neither does one daughter, Elizabeth Uribe of Downers Grove. But daughter Joanna Lein of Tulsa, Oklahoma, heads her state’s only backgammon club.
"We’re a friendly group," Mabee says of backgammon regulars. "It’s a great game for someone with a Zen attitude because stuff happens. One of the most common expressions, especially after losing, is, ‘That’s backgammon.’"

Texto completo: Amid a partial government shutdown sparked by President Donald Trump's demand for $5. 7 billion toward the construction of a barrier on the U. S. -Mexico border, about a dozen Latino workers at a Trump golf club were fired because they were undocumented immigrants, according to a report from The Washington Post.
The workers and their attorney told the Post that they were fired from their jobs at the Trump National Golf Club Westchester – located in Briarcliff Manor, New York – after the company conducted an audit of the immigration documents it had been given and determined that theirs were fake.
A Trump Organization human resources executive called them in one at a time to deliver the news, they said. Six of them said they were fired on Jan. 18. They told the Post that the move was unexpected and that they were not given any severance pay.
Most of the workers told the Post they were from Mexico and had acquired fake immigration documents after they entered the U. S. on foot. They said the Trump Organization did not look closely at those papers when they were hired.
"They said absolutely nothing. They never said, 'Your Social Security number is bad,' or, 'Something is wrong,'" Margarita Cruz, a housekeeper who was fired after eight years at the club told the Post. "Nothing. Nothing. Until right now. "
Cruz made a recording of her interaction with Trump human resources executive Deirdre Rosen, who spoke to Cruz via a Spanish interpreter listening to their meeting on speakerphone. Rosen told Cruz her immigration documents didn't appear to be authentic.
"Are you currently authorized for employment in the United States?" Rosen asked through the interpreter, according to the Post.
Cruz said she was not.
"By law, the club cannot continue to employ an individual knowing that the individual is, or has become, unauthorized for employment," Rosen told her. "Unfortunately, this means the club must end its employment relationship with you today. "
Cruz asked why she was not given any warning.
"The law says as soon as we know that you do not have authorization that we cannot continue your employment. That’s why," Rosen said, according to the Post. "Have a great day. "
Gabriel Sedano, a maintenance worker at the club since 2005, told the Post he "started to cry" when he got the news.
"I had worked almost 15 years for them in this club, and I’d given the best of myself to this job," he said. "I’d never done anything wrong, only work and work. "
Trump still owns the business, along with the other Trump Organization interests, but his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have taken over the daily operations since he was sworn in as president.
"We are making a broad effort to identify any employee who has given false and fraudulent documents to unlawfully gain employment. Where identified, any individual will be terminated immediately," Eric Trump said in a statement emailed to the Post.
The Trump Organization did not immediately return a request for comment from USA TODAY.
In December, The New York Times published a story about undocumented workers at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Several workers were fired after that story ran, according to the Post.
Trump has long decried the effect that the cheap labor provided by undocumented immigrants has on American workers. But the Post cited one unnamed former Trump organization manager who said the company had a "don't ask, don't tell" attitude toward undocumented workers.
"People don't want a short-term job," Trump explained. "It's very, very hard to get people. But other hotels do the exact same thing. "

4 challenges for Bernie Sanders in a 2020 bid

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., would face a starkly different political landscape should he choose to make a second bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.
Few people expected Sanders to make a run in 2016, but he quickly made his mark in a limited field in what quickly became a two-person contest between him and Hillary Clinton.
This time around, nearly everyone expects Sanders to run for president, but he's likely to face tough competition in a very crowded field. And no longer the fresh face, he will likely face more scrutiny.
Here are four challenges Sanders could face in a 2020 bid.
1. Sanders' women problem On Jan. 2, The New York Times reported on allegations of "sexual harassment and demeaning treatment as well as pay disparity" in Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign.
This was followed by a Jan. 9 report by Politico about accusations that Sanders' 2016 Iowa campaign manager forcibly kissing a staff member. The accused, Robert Becker, was named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement.
In both instances, Sanders apologized and said he was unaware of the incidents or, in Becker's case the settlement, until they were reported in the news media.
During a Jan. 10 news conference, Sanders addressed the allegations.
"It appears that as part of our campaign, there were some women who were harassed and mistreated — I thank them from the bottom of my heart for speaking out," he said, adding, "To the women in our campaign who were harassed or mistreated, I apologize."
This isn't the first time Sanders has been linked to sexism.
During 2016, the campaign came under fire for failing to rein in the misogyny of so-called "Bernie Bros," ardent supporter which USA Today described as "unsanctioned shock troops of Bernie Sanders' vaunted online army, digital rogues who've plagued Hillary Clinton's presidential bid and embarrassed Sanders' campaign."
2. Age One of the Democratic stars of the midterms is 29-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. The midterm elections showed that Democratic voters are ready to embrace a new generation of younger, more diverse politicians.
Meanwhile, Sanders will be pushing 80 by the time he takes office, should he win the presidency.
As Earlham College politics professor Thor Hogan put it in a November Washington Post Perspective piece, "Democrats are the party of progress, of hope and of change. It seems quite sensible, therefore, that their voters would gravitate toward youth, vigor and new ways of thinking."
3. African-American voters Issac J. Bailey writing for Politico Magazine in June 2016 concluded, "All the talk about Sanders representing the future of the Democratic Party because of his overwhelming popularity among young people leaves out an important caveat: He couldn't persuade minority voters to sign on."
Looking ahead to 2020, Sanders's support base skews heavily toward liberals and young voters. FiveThirtyEight created a five-sided chart for evaluating Democrats who are or could run for the nomination. The chart for Sanders shows the senator with a lot of upside among "party loyalists" and "black voters."
Sanders worked hard to campaign for some prominent African American candidates during 2018, including a pair of governor's races in the South — Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia — but he still showed some rough edges.
4. More choices for progressives Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, on Friday announced her bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
Why that matters is that the 37-year-old Gabbard has been a close Sanders ally who shares many of the same underpinnings that form the foundation of the progressive agenda.
In February 2016, Gabbard stepped down as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National committee to endorse Sanders, splitting from the party's establishment which supported Hillary Clinton for the nomination. She was also a speaker at The Sanders Institute's year-end meeting of progressive leaders, dubbed "The Gathering."
The potential 2020 field includes other candidates with solid progressive credentials such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and Julian Castro, HUD secretary in the Obama administration, who announced his candidacy earlier this month with a speech that hit many progressive notes.
The polls show Sanders remains among the elite contenders for the 2020 nomination, but he's likely to face a tougher competition than 4 years ago when he had nowhere to go but up.
How Sanders stacks up against other contenders Progressives and Democrats: The left-leaning voters form a critical bloc within the Democratic Party, and no candidate hoping to become the party's nominee can afford to alienate this crucial constituency. A Pew Research Center survey showed an increasing share of Democratic voters describing themselves as "liberal," with the figure hitting 48 percent in 2017.
Some high-profile campaigns during the 2018 midterm elections only reinforced the impression that the progressive wing of the party is in ascendance. After the Democrats regained the majority in the House last year, Five Thirty Eight declared, House Progressives Are Set To Wield A Lot Of Power In 2019.
Among the top Democratic 2020 contenders, Sanders can make the argument that he is the purest progressive in the field.
Health care reform, raising the minimum wage, even student debt relief, reining in Wall Street — all key parts of the Sanders platform — are now familiar talking points for many Democrats with an eye on the 2020 nomination.
But the underlying theme of economic inequality and social justice has been Sanders' defining issue since his days as mayor of Burlington. Many specific proposals were brought into the mainstream by Sanders during his unabashedly progressive 2016 campaign when they were often seen as too radical to find broad acceptance.
The near-progressive: Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is often seen as the strongest challenger to Sanders' progressive mantle.
Warren, who announced the formation of an "exploratory committee" for a presidential bid on New Year's Eve, is often linked with Sanders as anchoring the liberal/progressive wing of the Democratic party.
The two senators are closely aligned on many issues, but they diverge on the proper path toward a more equitable society.
Sanders identifies as a democratic socialist and leans toward solutions that rely on the national government.
Warren is a former Republican who has proclaimed "I am a capitalist."
As she told the Atlantic, "I believe in markets and the benefits they can produce when they work. Markets with rules can produce enormous value."
The difference comes down to Warren's accountable capitalism vs. Sanders' democratic socialism.
The recently-closed Weekly Standard once noted, Warren "was outbid in her progressivism by the socialist from Vermont."
The overlooked progressive: That would be Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio.
Washington Post writer Ben Terris in his 2015 piece, "Sherrod Brown: Why aren't progressives begging him to run for president?," wrote Brown was "Elizabeth Warren before Elizabeth Warren was cool."
Since then, the Ohio senator has scored a decisive reelection victor in a state that went for Trump in 2016, and has raised his profile, speaking out against the president and testing the 2020 waters with a planned trip to Iowa.
Brown frequently cracks the top 10 among possible 2020 Democratic nominee, but so far lacks the level of national name recognition to put him in the same progressive league as Sanders or Warren.
The Wall Street Democrats: What the other members of the elite 2020 field have in common is that they are centrists.
That includes people like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Corey Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, as well as former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas.
Centrist is a slippery concept within the Democratic Party today. As Charles P. Pierce wrote in Esquire last month, "if, as a lot of people seem to believe, anyone who is not full-tilt behind the Green New Deal and/or Medicare For All is unacceptably 'centrist,' then the word has lost all meaning.
Some progressive have another name for centrist candidates — Wall Street Democrats.
News reports have Booker, Gillibrand and Harris checking in with Wall Street in recent weeks as they weigh possible bids.
A blessing from the investment community might be a big boost for fundraising, but will likely be a black mark with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.

Texto completo: The World Health Organization has ranked vaccine hesitancy – the growing resistance to widely available lifesaving vaccines – as one of the top 10 health threats in the world for 2019.
That news will not come as a surprise in New York City, where the worst measles outbreak in decades is now underway. Nor in California or Minnesota, where similar outbreaks unfolded in 2014 and 2017, respectively.
Leading global health threats typically are caused by the plagues and perils of low-income countries – but vaccine hesitancy is as American as can be. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of children who are unvaccinated has quadrupled since 2001.
The consequences of this disparity are substantial: a surge in outbreaks of measles, mumps, pertussis and other diseases; an increase in influenza deaths; and dismal rates of HPV vaccination, which doctors say could effectively wipe out cervical cancer. But infectious disease experts warn that things could get much worse. Trust in vaccines is being so thoroughly eroded, they say, that these prevention tools are in danger of becoming useless. The next major disease outbreak "will not be due to a lack of preventive technologies," Heidi Larson, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, writes in the journal Nature, but to an "emotional contagion, digitally enabled."
Thwarting this danger will require a campaign as bold and aggressive as the one being waged by the anti-vaccination contingent. Here's how to get started.
Get tough. After the 2014 California measles outbreak, the state eliminated nonmedical exemptions for mandatory vaccinations. After a similar outbreak in Michigan, health officials there began requiring individuals to formally consult with their local health departments before opting out of otherwise-mandatory shots.Other states ought to follow this lead, and the federal government should consider tightening restrictions around how much leeway states can grant families that want to skip essential vaccines.
Be savvy. The Vaccine Confidence Project is a London-based academic endeavor that monitors anti-vaccine websites for rumors and conspiracies and addresses them. It also puts out a vaccine confidence index. Federal health officials would do well to implement a similar program and pair it with an aggressive social media campaign.
Vaccines, to some extent, are victims of their own success. In the United States especially, they've beaten so many infectious foes into oblivion that hardly any practicing doctors, let alone new parents, remember how terrible those diseases once were. An effective pro-vaccine campaign needs to remind us: Vaccines prevent two million to three million deaths globally each year.
Enlist the right support. Some doctors and scientists have referred to ""uneventful vaccination" as "The Greatest Story Never Told." Though they may not spread on the internet like the stories of terrible mishaps that anti-vaxxers traffic in, these far more common tales of inoculation without incident can be a powerful elixir for a nervous new parent. The best ambassadors of these stories are likely to be parents themselves. If health officials corralled these families and trained them in the basics of vaccine science, they might succeed where official voices sometimes fail.

Texto completo: Verna Washington's Fourth-Grade Class
Jose Ortega Elementary School, San Francisco Minecraft is better than Roblox. In Minecraft there are many different modes, like survival mode and creative mode. People can rage on Minecraft, but not on Roblox.
Kevin Situ, 9 I think we should have no homework, because you already learn in school. Think about the extra time you would have to play with no homework.
Nyla Herring, 9 I think school days should be shorter, so we can play more and have more free time. I also think recess should be longer, because it is fun, you get exercise, you get your energy out and then you can pay better attention in class.
Jackson Lewis, 9
School recesses should be longer so the kids can have a break, because kids get tired. When you are tired, you don't learn.
Jonathan Turner, 9
I think Minecraft is better than Fortnite, because Fortnite is a shooting killing game, and I don't like killing people. Minecraft is more peaceful than Fortnite.
Brandon Lung, 9 Penalty kicks should not be part of soccer. A penalty kick is not a play -- all it is is a shot. Anyone can score on penalty kicks. Soccer should be a game of skill, not of luck.
Jack Nichols, 10 I think students should have three weekend days instead of two. One reason is that some students become stressed when they are at school for too long. Also, three weekend days are good for students who are bullied.
HaoYang Wu, 10 People should stop hunting tigers for their fur, for fun and for medicine. Imagine if you were a tiger free in the wild, and then ... BOOM, you are shot for your fur. How would you feel?
Joseph Truong, 10
I think we should go on a field trip to a go-kart place so we can learn about how engines work.
Seneca Jackson, 10 I think you should read nonfiction books most of the time to get smarter. If you want to be successful in life, you have to get into a good elementary school and then a good middle school and a good high school and then a good college, and if you pass you're most likely going to have a successful life.
Angela Huang, 9
People should stop stealing other people's stuff. I had my pencil stolen, and it made me feel sad. If you want to use it, then ask -- don't steal it.
Chelsea Fong, 9 I think people should eat a lot of eggs because they are healthy and delicious.
Fiona Li, 9
There should be more books in the world. All kinds of books, too, in libraries, bookstores and every school.
Moises Martinez, 10 All kids should be able to wear hoodies in class. Hoodies help block out people distracting you so you can focus.
Ryan-Sierre Elarms, 10 Devices should be cheaper, because a lot of people want to play Fortnite and Roblox, and the best way to play them is on a phone. Jhearson Sidgel Tamondong, 9 In the Smash Brothers franchise there have been many commercials that say, "Everyone is here!" But is everyone here? No. My second-favorite character, Waluigi, is not in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. I mean, come on, Nintendo!
Malia Washington, 9 Construction workers in this country should work harder. In Asia it takes one year to build a bridge, and in the United States it takes 15 years.
Coby Liu, 10 I feel like all schools should have transgender bathrooms. All-gender bathrooms are a good idea. You should support the L.G.B.T. community, as they have lives as well.
Yvaine Ashley, 10 I think we should all work hard! Even adults and parents need to work hard, too. Because if they don't, they can flunk their work.
Ai Lian Huang, 10
We should have better school lunches, because more and more people are getting hungry, and it's all because of the school lunch. People are eating snacks for lunch and asking their friends for their lunch. My mom doesn't cook me lunch, so the only thing I can eat is the school lunch, but I really don't like it. I hope school lunch can taste better in the future.
Wenti Zhang, 9
I really think all kids should have an allowance. If parents don't buy things for their kids and don't want to, they need to give their kids an allowance. Allowance for all!
Lily Smith, 9 I think people should use protein shakes and vitamins because they help you lose weight or gain weight and be healthy. Being healthy will help you live longer. Xavanah Wright-Meriweather, 10 Your family loves you a lot, and you should love them the way they love you. You should always love them as much as you can, and tell them you love them and help them when they need help.
Jessie Lai, 9 I think we should be able to have high-quality buffet food instead of the not-fit-for-human-consumption food that the school gives us.
Jacob Mai Nguyen-Glantz, 9 The wall between the United States and Mexico is a really stupid idea. Maybe Trump had some conflict with Mexicans, and now that he's president he has the ability to release his anger. Maybe it's a different reason, but even if it is, the wall is a seriously stupid idea.
Skyler Yien, 10 FOR EACH ISSUE of The New York Times for Kids, we visit a different fourth-grade public school class somewhere in the United States. So far we have visited schools in Queens; Chicago; Oklahoma City; New Orleans; and Charlottesville, Va., among others. On Dec. 10, the Times reporter Mike Isaac and I visited Jose Ortega Elementary School in San Francisco. We talked to the students about newspapers and the difference between reporting and opinion writing. Then we helped them pick topics they feel strongly about, including longer recess, saving tigers, President Trump, allowances and Fortnite. Here are short excerpts from what they wrote.

Texto completo: Russell Baker, a longtime New York Times columnist, died last week at 93. Mr. Baker's observations on politics and cheeky insights on the everyday -- which he shared in his "Observer" column for more than 35 years -- were variously described as "wry and exquisitely observational," "sardonic and idealistic at the same time" and having "a deep appreciation for the absurdity of living." Mostly, though, he understood a viral quip well before he would have suffered the indignity of watching his words trend on Twitter.
______
"The only thing I was fit for was to be a writer, and this notion rested solely on my suspicion that I would never be fit for real work, and that writing didn't require any."
-- "Growing Up" (1982)
"I think -- this has been a long time ago, remember, but I think we expected school only to process those kids -- that is, swell them a bit in size and add social poise without really changing them from kids, the point of our lives, into something alarming, as school did. They were fated to become people, alas, and they did it without our even noticing for the longest while."
-- "No kidding" (1973)
"The old notion that brevity is the essence of wit has succumbed to the modern idea that tedium is the essence of quality."
-- "Getting On With It" (1982)
"The ideal journalism school needs only one course. Students should be required to stand outside a closed door for six hours. Then the door would open, someone would put his head around the jamb and say, 'No comment.' The door would close again, and the students would be required to write 800 words against a deadline."
-- In response to a student's query
"Perhaps humans have always had this ridiculous belief in the absolute excellence of the present, this conviction that the world into which they have had the marvelous good luck to be born is the best world that ever was, the best that ever will be."
-- "Stuck on Ourselves" (1993)
"Under my system any teacher caught assigning Dickens to a person under the age of 25 would be sentenced to teach summer school at half pay. Punishment would be harsher for assigning 'Moby Dick,' a book accessible only to people old enough to know what it is to rail at God about the inevitability of death."
-- "The Only Gentleman" (1982)
"Life seemed to be an educator's practical joke in which you spent the first half learning and the second half learning that everything you learned in the first half was wrong."
-- "Back to the Dump" (1983)
"What are they like, these Washingtonians? Very much as you and I would be if we found ourselves in the curious jobs that Washingtonians perform. Which is to say, cocksure and uncertain, devious and naïve, ebullient and melancholy, pompous and frivolous, bored, hard-working, shiftless, wide-eyed and tired of it all, full of dreams and schemes, and, without quite realizing it, a little absurd, for they are mostly common men distinguished largely by possession of uncommon jobs."
-- "An American in Washington" (1961)
"Columnists' tendency to spend their time with life's winners and to lead lives of isolation from the less dazzling American realities makes it too easy for us sometimes to solve the nation's problems in 700 words."
-- "A Few Words at the End" (1998)
"We all come from the past, and children ought to know what it was that went into their making, to know that life is a braided cord of humanity stretching up from time long gone, and that it cannot be defined by the span of a single journey from diaper to shroud."
-- "Growing Up" (1982)

Anderson to perform at FireKeepers today

Texto completo: Louie Anderson is celebrating his 40th year in comedy, but he's still surprised when people ask to take photos with him.
"I landed here in Minneapolis, and people wanted to take pictures with me, and I'm like, 'You do?' " Anderson said by phone Thursday. "I've had many people say, 'I'd never ask for a picture, but I just love your comedy.' I'm humbled and honored by that. If a person tells me I made your day by taking a picture, you made my day by saying that."
Anderson, 65, will perform at FireKeepers Casino today. The clean, family-friendly comedian has been named "One of the 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comedians of All Time" by Comedy Central and is a New York Times best-selling author.
Anderson made his national television debut on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in 1984. His animated series on FOX titled "Life with Louie," based on his childhood, ran for three seasons from 1995 to 1998, and he later had a four-year run hosting the game show "Family Feud."
His acting credits include "Coming to America" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." He currently co-stars along with Zach Galifianakis in the FX series "Baskets" as Christine, the matriarch of the Basket clan, a role that earned him a Primetime Emmy Award in 2016.
In 2018, Anderson penned and published, "Hey Mom: Stories for My Mother, But You Can Read Them Too," telling how his mom's spirit is still alive and how it has helped him turn life's challenges into joy.
Despite his success in show business, Anderson said it's his Midwest roots — he's a native of Saint Paul, Minnesota — that keep him grounded and connected to audiences.
"The Midwest... it's my people," Anderson said. "It's the whole idea of hard working, blue-collar, but could have been anything-type people. They could have done anything they wanted, but they love their community and are more cosmopolitan than people think.
"They are good, generous and charitable, but not an easy laugh. Nothing cheap, not looking for any cheap laughter. It's the comic I am and why I think I've lasted 40 years... I think I know moms, dads, brothers, sisters, being poor. I know humor and families, and I love the 'F' words – fathers, food family, being fat, funny mothers. I was born to do this, and I stumbled upon it."

Texto completo: More than a decade ago, Jay Asher's young adult novel, "Thirteen Reasons Why," a dark story about a bullied teenager who kills herself, became an unexpected best-seller. Teachers and librarians around the country embraced the novel as a timely and groundbreaking treatment of bullying and teenage suicide, and the novel went on to sell several million copies. A popular Netflix adaptation sparked controversy over its depiction of the causes of suicide, but still drew hordes of new readers to the book, and has been renewed for a third season.
Then, last year, Mr. Asher's career imploded when he was accused of sexual misconduct, and the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators announced that he had violated the professional organization's anti-harassment policy. The repercussions were swift: His literary agency dropped him, speaking engagements and book signings evaporated, and some bookstores removed his novels from their shelves.
Now Mr. Asher, who denied the allegations, has filed a lawsuit against the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators and the group's executive director, Lin Oliver, claiming that Ms. Oliver and the organization made false and defamatory statements about him that torpedoed his career, and caused financial harm and intentional emotional distress.
"I do not condone harassment of any sort, and have spent my entire career standing up for its victims, so these statements were devastating," Mr. Asher, who declined to be interviewed for this article, said in a statement.
In the lawsuit, which was filed in a California State Court in Los Angeles , Mr. Asher claims that Ms. Oliver and her organization never properly investigated the complaints against him and ignored exonerating evidence.
The lawsuit will likely further fuel an ongoing debate about the scope and messy aftermath of the #MeToo movement in the children's book world, which has seen a string of scandals involving prominent authors such as Mr. Asher, James Dashner, Sherman Alexie and the illustrator David Diaz.
Publishers, booksellers and agents have wrestled with how to handle anonymous allegations against authors when the accusations are hard to confirm, and with whether it's appropriate to rehabilitate the careers of those accused. Some publishers have canceled contracts and pulped books, and many have expanded the use of morals clauses and "author conduct" clauses in book contracts, which allow publishers to cancel book deals if the author is credibly accused of unethical behavior.
Children's book publishers in particular have reacted swiftly to harassment allegations against authors, given their books' impressionable audiences and their reliance on teachers and librarians, who might be reluctant to support the work of authors accused of inappropriate behavior.
But so far, few accused authors have vigorously fought allegations publicly, or sought financial damages for lost earnings.
According to the lawsuit, the allegations against Mr. Asher surfaced in April 2017, when Ms. Oliver received emails that were purportedly from a group of seven anonymous women who belonged to the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators. The emails claimed that Mr. Asher had used the group's conferences to prey on women sexually, then threatened them to intimidate them into silence, making them "feel unsafe to attend SCBWI events."
Mr. Asher has acknowledged having affairs with women he encountered at these conferences, but he maintains that they were consensual and that he never threatened any of the women or offered to help them professionally. In the complaint, Mr. Asher alleges that "an individual upset over Plaintiff's success" was behind the emails to Ms. Oliver, and that in June of 2017, one of the alleged seven anonymous women contacted Ms. Oliver and told her that the allegations made in April were false. But according to the complaint, "no further investigation" was conducted.
The lawsuit further states that Mr. Asher provided the organization with evidence that one of the authors of the emails had "sexually coerced him at a SCBWI Conference" and had been harassing him for more than a decade.
Andrew Baum, a lawyer representing Ms. Oliver and the organization, said that the group and Ms. Oliver "reject, and will vigorously defend against, Asher's claims." Ms. Oliver declined to comment further.
In February of 2018, the allegations against Mr. Asher erupted into a public controversy, after an article on Medium about sexual harassment in the children's book world set off a cascade of online accusations against prominent illustrators and authors, including Mr. Asher and the illustrator David Diaz.
That month, Ms. Oliver said in a statement to The Associated Press that the organization had broken with both Mr. Asher and Mr. Diaz. "Claims against them were investigated and, as a result, they are no longer members and neither will be appearing at any SCBWI events in the future," she said.
Mr. Asher disputed Ms. Oliver's characterization. "In April 2017, Mr. Asher voluntarily agreed that he would no longer attend SCBWI conferences," Mr. Asher's spokeswoman, Tamara Taylor, said in a statement. "This was in response to many years of harassment from a group of authors with whom he had consensual relationships that ended with some hurt feelings when they learned about each other."
Mr. Asher's complaint states that he has suffered psychologically and economically from "dramatically decreased book sales, and exclusion from involvement in a Netflix series based upon 'Thirteen Reasons Why'."
Mr. Asher is seeking a jury trial and unspecified financial damages.

Texto completo: The German-Swiss novelist Benedict Wells developed an intimate understanding of Bavarian boarding schools. He spent 13 years from the age of 6 to 19 in three different ones. What he most remembers is the hunger, both literal and figurative, that these rudimentary state-run schools induced in him. "It actually helped me a lot with my writing," Wells, said in a recent interview. "But now at the age of 34, I think I should get rid of that hunger."
A Bavarian boarding school features prominently in Wells's fourth novel "The End of Loneliness," which is also his first to be translated into English. It spent more than a year-and-a-half on Germany's Spiegel best-seller list and was awarded the European Union Prize for Literature in 2016. The English-language version, translated by Charlotte Collins, is being released in the United States by Penguin Books on Jan. 29.
Wells said he sometimes broke into tears as he was writing "The End of Loneliness," which took him seven years to complete. At the heart of the novel are three disparate siblings who are packed off to boarding school after their parents die in a car crash. The story is narrated in the first-person by the youngest, Jules, who is 11 when the accident happens. Jules falls in love with Alva, a young girl whose own family history has also been marked by loss. Their relationship unfurls over the next 30 years, before a fatal illness strikes.
Over the telephone, Wells, who divides his time between Berlin and the Bavarian countryside, described how composing "The End of Loneliness" changed his outlook both as a writer and a human being. In his previous novels he said that he had tended to wield "irony and sarcasm and to look away like most people from loss and loneliness and death." But that this time he deliberately "wanted to confront death again and again," to explore how people find the courage to cope with it.
When Collins, who is based in Cambridge, England, began translating "The End of Loneliness" she said she assumed Wells had been through some kind of experience with someone close to him dying. "I have; and I recognized the emotions and the responses to it, which I felt he portrayed absolutely beautifully," said Collins, whose translation of Robert Seethaler's "A Whole Life" was shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize in 2016. "It turned out that he hadn't had that experience and it was him empathizing with the situation and trying to imagine what it would be like."
At boarding school, Wells was keen on the storytelling of the Swedish writer Astrid Lindgren, best-known for her saga about a headstrong young girl, Pippi Longstocking. Recently Wells enjoyed seeing "Becoming Astrid," director Pernille Fischer Christensen's movie biopic about the writer. "Later I talked to old school friends who also liked the movie," he said. "But while all of them talked about the lighter novels that Lindgren wrote, I only remembered the dark ones where she wrote about heroes who didn't have any parents."
After leaving school at the age of 19, Wells went to the registry office and had his surname officially changed from von Schirach to Wells. He chose his new name on account of Homer Wells, the orphan hero of "The Cider House Rules," whose author, John Irving, remains one of his favorites. "Of course boarding school is something very different from an orphanage because I always had loving parents in the background," Wells said. "But nevertheless I always felt connected to stories about orphans."
Originally Wells managed to keep his private life out of the public eye but that changed in 2011 with the success of his third novel "Fast Genial," which led to a German newspaper uncovering the story of his family's Nazi past. "At least I had the chance to be an independent writer for three books," Wells said. "My fear now that I have my first book published in America is that everything will arrive at the same time: Me, my book, my family and my family's past."
That is why in October 2017, he published an English-language statement on his website entitled "A Personal Matter." In it, he explained his decision to revoke his family name and create a new one. Wells's grandfather Baldur von Schirach, who died 10 years before he was born, was sentenced to 20 years in prison at the Nuremberg trials for crimes against humanity, first as the Nazi Party national youth leader and later as Hitler's personal representative in Vienna. In his statement, Wells wrote: "I did not want to bear the name of a person who committed such crimes and showed no remorse."
Writing runs in Wells's family. His cousin Ferdinand von Schirach is one of Germany's most successful authors, selling millions of copies of his novels drawn from his experiences as a criminal lawyer. Meanwhile his grandmother Henriette von Schirach, who divorced Baldur in 1950, wrote several memoirs pertaining to the Nazis. As the eldest daughter of Heinrich Hoffmann, one of Hitler's closest friends and his official photographer, she and her husband were part of an inner circle.
But Wells, who was 7 when his grandmother died, professed to having read none of her books. "For me it was very important to make a strong cut," he said. When I asked him if his deep-rooted sense of empathy stemmed from a repudiation of his late grandfather's values, he demurred. "I can promise you that the conscious part of my writing has nothing to do with my family's past," he said. "One thing I know for sure is that when I was at boarding school and felt this special loneliness even though I was surrounded by other people, I always thought that one day I would try to find a language for all of that. I think this is definitely one of the reasons why I write now."
After leaving boarding school, Wells rejected the opportunity to go to university; instead he decided to teach himself how to write fiction. He moved to Berlin where he took on a succession of odd jobs during the day and wrote mostly at night. "When I was at high school there were so many people who were more talented than me," he said. "I never considered myself a big talent as a writer. But I promised myself that I would not give up." Wells completed his first novel "Spinner," about a group of young friends roaming Berlin, at the age of 19, and began sending it out to publishers.
He received over 60 rejections before the novel was eventually published in 2009. By that time he had already scored a hit after the Swiss house Diogenes Verlag introduced him as an author by publishing his second novel "Beck's Last Summer," which was made into a German film in 2015. Penguin recently bought the United States rights to "Spinner," for which Collins is keeping her "fingers crossed" in the hope of translating it.
Wells also published a debut collection of short stories in Germany last year and is now writing another novel. He has plans to work on it for another year or two. Trial and error has become an integral part of his process. "I never studied writing because I always liked to find my own way," he said. "I've always thought that will, determination and endurance are the fields where I can make my mark."

Texto completo: It’s one thing for liberals in the media to make up excuses for why they pushed a fake story about the Covington Catholic kids. But you’re dealing with something truly special when they start inventing absurd alternate realities about what would happen if the students had been black.

The non sequitur became common on social media within the last few days, but now author Michael Arceneaux has brought it to print, writing an impressively delusional piece for Essence magazine. Arcenaux argues that if Nick Sandmann had been a black boy, he wouldn’t be getting the sympathy that he did after his infamous scene with the old Native American protester turned out to be the opposite of what the media and the liberal Twitter mob said it was.

“I’m inclined to think that if a Black Nick Sandmann did dare such to do such a thing, he would have been harmed if not flat out killed,” wrote Arceneaux. “And if that did happen, yes, it would be overwhelmingly condemned, but I can’t help but believe that if there was a video of a Black Nick Sandmann displaying that degree of disrespect and arrogance surfaced not long after, some would go out of their way to promptly victim blame.”

Arceneaux also laughably accused the national media of “[protecting] those who yield ( sic ) the most power — white men — and the white boys who will soon grow into the fullest extent of their privilege.”

Arceneaux apparently does not read national newspapers, which have worked diligently either to downplay their original narrative that a white male was physically harassing a minority, or make up new reasons why the initial coverage and reaction to the scene was justified.

The New York Times’ Frank Bruni on Tuesday questioned whether conservatives were guilty of smearing the press because they were “gleeful” that the initial narrative on Sadmann was inaccurate. The paper separately ran a story on the fringe Black Hebrew Israelites who had first taunted the school kids with racist and homophobic slurs. In earnest, the paper of record referred to the Israelites, a fringe hate group, as “sidewalk ministers who use confrontation as their gospel.”

Well, that's one way to describe a person who calls you "faggot." There goes the minister, simply spreading the good word!

The Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart actually blamed the the students and their chaperones, who were visiting Washington from Kentucky, for failing to know to avoid the Israelites — who presumably don't have much of a presence in Northern Kentucky.

“If the ranting and raving Black Hebrew Israelites are the kind of folks who necessitate my crossing the street or altering my path before I make it into their line of sight, why would the Covington kids and their minders think it’s okay to engage crazy, hateful people raising hell in a national park?” wrote Capehart in a comically self-justifying and victim-blaming piece. “They should have ignored the Black Hebrew Israelites the way most everyone else does …”

In his piece for Essence, Arceneaux also faulted NBC’s Savanah Guthrie for what he described as “softball questions” that she posed to Sandmann in an interview Wednesday.

Here’s an example of those “softball questions” Guthrie put to Sandmann, a teenager still in high school, and who remains the subject of online harassment for a fake story that the media and a Twitter mob shoved him into just because he stood there smiling in a hat:

— “Do you feel from this experience that you owe anybody an apology?”
— “Do you see your own faults?”
— “Do you think if you weren’t wearing that [Make America Great Again] hat, this might not have happened or it might have been different?”
— “There’s something aggressive about standing there, standing your ground.”
— “Do you regret hitting your girlfriend?”

Okay, that last one didn’t actually happen, but the sentiment is the same — that Sandmann should feel guilt about something he didn’t do and shouldn't be held to account for.

If Sandmann had been black, this would have never been a national controversy at all. We would have never heard about it. It doesn’t fit the tiresome narrative of intersectionality — that of white privilege vs. minority victims — which the news media and liberals eagerly embrace and weaponize to divide the nation with every new story that has even the slightest connection to race.

Sandmann isn’t black. His life would be a lot easier right now if he were.

Christie still going

Texto completo: Chris Christie is making it clear that his political ambitions are far from over.
One week before his book "Let Me Finish: Trump, The Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics," hits shelves, the former New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate gave a broad and crowd-pleasing speech Tuesday evening in Indian Wells that covered his past and possible future, touching on stories including the 2005 wedding of Donald and Melania Trump, meeting with Trump to discuss the chief of staff position following Gen. John Kelly's departure earlier this month, and potentially running for president in 2024.
Speaking to a well-heeled, Republican-leaning crowd as part of the Desert Town Hall Series, which is sponsored by The Desert Sun and presented by the H.N. and Frances C. Berger Foundation, Christie took a shrewd and measured approach toward the president. He commended him for bucking politics as usual, but criticized him for surrounding himself with family members and shutting down the government.
"The president made the fundamental mistake, in my view, when he said in his first meeting with the couple he affectionately calls 'Chuck and Nancy,' 'I'll shut down the government. I'll own the shutdown. I'll be happy to do it.'" Christie said. "Now, we're 32 days in and no one knows how to get out."
During the 2016 Republican Primary, Christie once derided Trump in a New Hampshire speech by saying "We are not electing an entertainer in chief," but, on Tuesday evening, Christie said the president's appeal stemmed from many of the qualities the two men share, including their bluntness and willingness to spar with political opponents when they believe it's necessary. Reflecting on why Trump won the White House, Christie said that after eight years of "No Drama Obama," the American public wanted a change in style. "They want someone who can give to them straight, hit 'em between the eyes," Christie said.
"If I'm not blunt enough for them, then, man, Trump is going to win," he remembered telling his wife, Mary Pat Christie, during the South Carolina primary. "I think, in many ways, he's exactly what the country needs right now, but the job is too big for any one person," Christie said. "He does things that need to be done to politicians in Washington D.C., which is to tell them business as usual is over."
He recounted his clashes with Ivanka Trump and Steve Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News who was one of the president's most trusted advisers until he was ousted in August 2017. He said Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump's husband and an adviser to the president, was "in over his head." Christie said that the fact that Kushner and Ivanka Trump hold prominent positions in the administration repelled many potential quality advisers. The challenges of navigating the relationship between the president and his family member-advisers reportedly made Kelly's chief-of-staff job difficult before his eventual resignation.
While Christie headed up the president's transition team, he and Ivanka Trump fought over Gen. Michael Flynn's role in the administration. Christie opposed recommending any appointment for Flynn, who, after being fired by President Barack Obama, became one of Trump's fiercest supporters on the campaign trail. Trump later appointed Flynn as National Security Advisor but dismissed him less than a month into his term. In December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his 2016 communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. At a hearing last month, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan delayed Flynn's sentencing but made his overarching judgment clear.
"Arguably, you sold your country out," the judge said.
Of all of Trump's advisers, it was Flynn whom Christie spoke out most emphatically against.
"From the first time I met with Michael Flynn, I could tell this guy's a train wreck, but I didn't know that he was also a criminal," Christie said. In both his speech and in a town hall where he addressed high school students earlier in the evening, Christie identified indifference as the largest threat facing the country's political discourse.
Indifference, not polarization or foreign influence, threatened the health of American democracy, Christie said to applause. Christie did not shy from questions about Trump, Russia and the Mueller investigation.
While The New York Times reported recently that the FBI had, in early 2017, opened an investigation on whether Trump was a "Russian agent," Christie said he considered idea far-fetched.
Like many executives who have to work with a legislative branch, Trump often feels frustrated by gridlock, Christie said. The president's admiration for strongmen who can enact their agendas without resistance, like Russian President Vladimir Putin or North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, didn't amount to any collusion, Christie said.
Christie did not say he would again run for president in 2024, but willingly addressed questions about his future political ambitions. Many candidates who had run and lost early in their careers, including Ronald Reagan, Christie said, went on to win later elections and become successful presidents.
"Once you've got this in your blood, it's hard to get rid of it," he said.

Texto completo: A nurse at a Phoenix nursing home who had been assigned to care for a woman in a vegetative state who was raped and later gave birth to a child was charged on Wednesday with sexual assault, the police said.
Detectives at the Phoenix Police Department took the nurse, Nathan Sutherland, 36, in for questioning in the case on Tuesday, the police said, and collected a DNA sample from him that matched that of the child, a boy who was born on Dec. 29. Mr. Sutherland was booked on Wednesday morning at the Maricopa County Jail on one charge of sexual assault and one charge of vulnerable adult abuse, the police said.
"Through a combination of good old-fashioned police work, combing through evidence, talking to people and following up on information, combined with the marvels of DNA technology, we were able to identify and develop probable cause to arrest a suspect," Jeri L. Williams, the Police Department's chief, said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Detectives started to focus on Mr. Sutherland because he was among the medical staff members at the nursing home, Hacienda HealthCare, who were assigned to care for the woman around the time last year that the police believe she was assaulted. The woman had been at the nursing home since 1992 and since then had been in the same condition, unable to communicate or move, according to medical records. A lawyer for the family on Wednesday said they were aware of the arrest but had no comment.
Mr. Sutherland, a licensed practical nurse, had worked at Hacienda since 2012 and was assigned to a unit treating intellectually disabled people since 2014, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. He was fired immediately after the company learned of his arrest, the statement said. It added that Mr. Sutherland had worked his last shift on Sunday.
Earlier on Wednesday, the police said Mr. Sutherland had been employed by the company since 2011.
On Wednesday, Mr. Sutherland appeared at the Superior Court of Arizona and his bond was set at $500,000, said Bryan Bouchard, a spokesman for the court.
Mr. Sutherland's lawyer, David W. Gregan, could not immediately be reached for comment.
For nearly a month, the details of the case had gripped the Phoenix region and embroiled Hacienda HealthCare, a major health provider for people with serious disabilities in the state, in scandal as Chief Williams made the case the department's top investigative concern. The fallout has been immense at Hacienda, forcing the company's longtime chief executive to resign, and made it the focus of multiple investigations.
"Every member of the Hacienda organization is troubled beyond words to think that a licensed practical nurse could be capable of seriously harming a patient," company officials said in a statement. "Once again, we offer an apology and send our deepest sympathies to the client and her family, to the community and to our agency partners at every level."
Mr. Sutherland had "undergone an extensive background check upon hiring," the company said. That included searching possible criminal history and sex offender registries, as well as checking his personal references and performing a drug screening, the company said in a statement. They added that his nursing license was "current and in good standing."
The company recently announced it had hired Rick Romley, the former longtime top prosecutor in Maricopa County, to conduct an internal review of the assault and how it could have gone unnoticed.
Since its founding in late 1970s, Hacienda HealthCare has grown into one of the largest private providers of care in Arizona for people with serious cognitive and physical disabilities, operating mostly out of a single campus about six miles south of downtown Phoenix. It runs more than 40 programs through its subsidiaries, which provide services to more than 2,000 people every year, according to the company.
While Hacienda is a private company, some of its operations receive public funding, including $230 million in Medicaid funding since 2010, state records show.
As part of the investigations, detectives started to take DNA samples from all male employees at Hacienda earlier this month. Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a Phoenix police spokesman, said that Mr. Sutherland offered a DNA sample only after he was shown a court order to do so and that he invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination when he was arrested.
Mr. Sutherland's DNA sample, taken Tuesday, was "checked, rechecked, triple-checked, quadruple-checked" by the department's crime laboratory before Mr. Sutherland was arrested, Sergeant Thompson said.
Two doctors who treated patients at Hacienda, including the woman at the center of the case, no longer work at the nursing home. Last week, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, which manages the state's Medicaid program, notified one of the doctors, Thanh Nguyen, that he had been suspended and could not work at Hacienda or any other Medicaid-supported facility in the state.
The state accused Dr. Nguyen of placing "the health and welfare of A.H.C.C.C.S. members in danger," according to a letter from the state obtained by The New York Times. The suspension applies only to work with Medicaid-supported centers in the state.
State records show that he also operates a medical consultant group that has a contract with the Arizona Department of Veterans' Services to treat veterans and their families. Neither Dr. Nguyen nor a veterans' services department spokeswoman responded to requests seeking comment on Wednesday, and efforts to reach the consultant group were unsuccessful.
A second doctor involved in the woman's treatment resigned last week from Hacienda, the company said on Wednesday. The company declined to publicly identify the person.
Despite a team of doctors and nurses assigned to the woman, the center's staff members expressed shock that she was pregnant. In a frantic 911 call made at Hacienda on Dec. 29, which the police recently released, a woman reported that a baby had just been delivered and was in distress.
On Wednesday, Sergeant Thompson said that the boy was doing well.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Lawmakers responsible for upholding public trust

Texto completo: As Iowa starts an exciting new legislative session, I am honored to serve in my new role as senator. There is much to be optimistic about in Iowa. While the federal government remains gridlocked, our state and our community continue to set records for being one of the best managed states and best places to raise a family in the nation.
I am committed to pursuing ambitious policy to promote: economic growth, workforce development, mental health, innovation in education and investment in rural Iowa. Knocking on more than 10,000 doors across Iowa during the campaign season, I listened to Iowans, I heard their priorities, and now it is time to enact the positive change that serves us all.
Bi-partisan solutions. Emerson wisely noted, "There is no limit to what can be accomplished if it doesn't matter who gets the credit." I am proud that last year over 88 percent of the bills we passed were bipartisan. I hope we can move that number even higher this year in both the House and Senate.
From our work last General Assembly, families and small businesses now keep more of their hard-earned money, schools have record funding and greater flexibility, more Iowans have access to affordable health care, gaps in our mental health system are closing, and workers are accessing innovative training for 21st century careers. Our state is on the right path.
This year, we will pass a budget that is both fiscally responsible and funds the priority needs of Iowans. Iowans expect us to be stewards of their hard-earned tax dollars, and we will always keep the taxpayers of Iowa in mind through the budget process.
Investment in education. Governor Reynolds prioritized nearly $111 million in new dollars to go toward education in Iowa from pre-K to college. Iowa families want a first-class education system because they know that a great education is the key to a great life.Funding for education has increased 765 million dollars since 2011. As Iowans, we are right to be proud of these historic investments in our future.
But we must be vigilant to ensure that those dollars are making their way into the classroom, and being spent in a transparent and accountable way. We must continue to provide flexibility to our schools, empowering them to make decisions that fit their communities and their schools. Iowa's employers are depending on our schools to prepare the next generation of skilled workers.
Mental health. Republicans and Democrats came together to pass a landmark mental health bill that will help Iowans access treatment in their home communities and near their loved ones. The Statehouse is committed to meaningful investment in adult and children's mental health this year. This includes access and programming across Iowa to train and retain mental health professional.
I send many thanks to the health advocates, families, and patients, who championed this effort. They continue to bring together mental health professionals and policy leaders to identify opportunities for improvement.
Public service is a privilege. Every day, thousands of good men and women work tirelessly to serve our state, from their patrol cars, snow plows, classrooms, city halls, and countless other places across our state.
Lawmakers are not exempt from responsibilities to uphold public trust and inspire future public servants. Congressman Steve King's recent race-baiting comments to the New York Times were categorically wrong and at odds with his responsibility to provide ethical, honorable representation.
It is also a breach of public duty for anyone to engage in sexual harassment or assault. This culture must change in the Iowa Senate, and I am committed to accountability and public transparency. We must listen to credible accusations and hold offenders to account.
Service before self. It is an honor to serve you. Please let me know your priorities. I hope to hear from you directly, or by joining you in your community. Iowa's success has been defined by having the lowest unemployment rate in the country, one of the fastest growing economies in the country, and wages rising at a faster rate than most other states. Looking forward to working with everyone on pro-active solutions for our community.
STATE SEN. ZACH NUNN, R-Bondurant, represents Senate District 15, which includes most of Jasper County and parts of eastern Polk County, including Altoona, Bondurant, Mitchellville and Runnells. He can be reached at 515-519-2246 or zach.nunn@legis.iowa.gov.

Texto completo: Syfy's risqué magic show returns for a fourth season. And the rapper Killer Mike hosts a documentary series on Netflix.
What's on TV
THE MAGICIANS 9 p.m. on Syfy. Over three seasons Syfy's fantasy show about students at a school for magic has differentiated itself from, you know, that other series you probably just thought of, through a potent mixture of killings, depression and magic-augmented sex. The magical youngish adults here, adapted from novels by Lev Grossman, use words like "vibe" and phrases like "pro tip"; the story centers on a graduate student, Quentin Coldwater (Jason Ralph), and some other magic students who struggle with both magical malefactors and mental health. In his review of the first season for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that the series "manages to be more engaging and credible than the usual basic-cable genre drama," noting that it's "different enough in its details that from moment to moment you can forget how derivative it is." The fourth season, debuting Wednesday night, involves rebellion and memory loss.
DROP THE MIC 10 p.m. on TNT. This musical competition series, birthed from a segment on "The Late Late Show with James Corden" and previously on TBS, returns on its new home network: TNT. The show pits celebrities against each other in rap battles. Previous guests have included Seth Rogen, Taye Diggs and Molly Ringwald. Wednesday's episode has a pair of face-offs, with the "Saturday Night Live" alums Taran Killam and Rob Riggle going head-to-head before Boy George takes on Laverne Cox of "Orange Is the New Black."
What's Streaming
TRIGGER WARNING WITH KILLER MIKE Stream on Netflix. While actors rap in "Drop the Mic," the actual rapper Killer Mike takes a turn as a TV host in this documentary series, which looks at issues that affect blacks in America. Killer Mike, known as one half of the hip-hop duo Run the Jewels, does this in the first episode by trying to spend three days buying and consuming only products from black-owned businesses. Along the way he interviews Shareef Abdul-Malik, the founder of the website We Buy Black, and eats barbecue with his fellow Run the Jewels Rapper, El-P -- or rather he almost does, until he realizes that the meat isn't from a black-owned farm. Then he asks for a takeout box.
I AM NOT A WITCH (2018) Rent on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu. Britain's entry for best foreign language film at this year's Academy Awards (it was not nominated) is an absurdist tale from the Zambian-born, Welsh-raised director Rungano Nyoni. Maggie Mulubwa stars as Shula, an orphan who, after arriving in a Zambian village, is accused of being a witch. Her refusal to confirm or deny the accusation matters little; she's grouped with the town's other "witches" and forced to become an unpaid laborer and, at times, a tourist attraction. "The film is perhaps overly repetitive in emphasizing Shula's inability to escape exploitation," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in The Times. "But the story is put across with formal confidence and real originality."

U.S. stocks slide on fears of global slowdown after reports in China, Davos

Texto completo: U.S. stocks slipped Tuesday as global growth worries were resurrected on news out of China and the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The Dow Jones industrial average sank 462 points, or almost 2 percent, at its low - dragged down by DowDuPont, 3M, Boeing and Caterpillar, companies with significant exposure to the Chinese economy.
The blue-chip benchmark rallied late in the day as presidential economic adviser Larry Kudlow appeared on CNBC and denied news reports that talks between the Trump administration and Chinese trade officials had been canceled. In fact, he said, no meeting was ever scheduled.
"There's no cancellations," Kudlow said. "None. Zero. Let me just try to put that to rest."
The Dow immediately rose but closed the day down almost 302 points, or 1.2 percent, at 24,404.48.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.4 percent, its biggest drop since Jan. 3.
The S&P slid back into correction territory, with 10 of 11 sectors down on the day. A correction is a 10 percent retreat from a recent high.
The Nasdaq composite was well off its recent highs, down 1.9 percent, as technology stocks suffered.
The renewed volatility after several weeks of relative calm followed weekend reports from China that its official economic growth for 2018 came in at 6.6 percent, its slowest in 30 years.
"China is dealing with something very new, which is consumer-driven slowdown in growth," Glenn Youngkin, co-chief executive of the Carlyle Group, said during an appearance on Fox Business Network.
Data released Tuesday morning also indicated U.S. home sales are at a three-year low.
Adding to the pessimism in the markets were additional forecasts out of Davos that global growth, including for the United States, would be less in 2019 than it was last year.
"It's going to be globally a slow-up," billionaire investor Ray Dalio told CNBC during a Tuesday interview from Davos. Dalio, co-chairman of Bridgewater Associates, warned that the country could slide into a recession in 2020.
"It's not just the United States. It's Europe. And it's China and Japan," Dalio said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."
A letter from respected investor Seth A. Klarman warning of a potential financial crisis, rising out of global debt, international trade tensions and a retreat of the United States from the world stage, added to the gloom coming out of Switzerland.
Klarman runs the Baupost Group, which manages about $27 billion. His letter was reported in the New York Times by DealBook columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin.
That sentiment is far from unanimous.
Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone Group, on the same show, predicted a decline in U.S. economic growth to between 2.5 and 2.75 percent this year, well below the peak of above 4 percent in mid-2018.
"I don't see any recession," he said.
The drop in stocks occurs after four weeks of gains and as worries deepen over the partial shutdown of the U.S. government, which has lasted a month with no end in sight.
"Both sides of the shutdown debate need to figure out how to get out of this mess," said Jared Bernstein, who served as economic adviser to former vice president Joe Biden.
"There's a real sense that a lot of people in charge not only don't get it, but they are making things worse," Bernstein said. "Whether it's Trump and the shutdown, Theresa May and Brexit or Emmanuel Macron and the Yellow Vests, our leaders don't have answers. That creates a lot of chaos and anxiety that spills into financial markets."
Tuesday's pullback arrived after a four-week rally spurred by a wild December in which stocks hit a bear market, only to rocket upward as the Dow scored its highest single-day point gain in history.
Investors pounced on the decline in stock prices, which was brought on by a final quarter of 2018 that wiped out the year's gains.
Then came Tuesday's report from the National Association of Realtors showing sales of existing U.S. homes fell to an annual rate of 4.99 million units in December - the lowest in more than three years.
"It's kind of natural to give back some of this big gain, at least in the short term," said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "The magnitude of the rally off of the Christmas Eve low, combined with some less than great Chinese data and some existing-home data that came out today, brings the fears of global growth back to the forefront."

Texto completo: Attorneys for the federal government have asked to postpone a lawsuit that could decide the fate of Kentucky's $9.7 billion-a-year Medicaid program and the tougher eligibility rules that Gov. Matt Bevin seeks to impose, because the partial government shutdown cut off their salaries nearly a month ago.
However, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington indicated Thursday that he's inclined to only grant one-week delays in briefing deadlines in the case, to give the unpaid lawyers some breathing room, unless the state of Kentucky is willing to postpone changes to Medicaid that are scheduled to begin April 1.
Postponing the changes is not an option, state officials say.
"The Kentucky Department for Medicaid Services will continue to work toward implementation of the Kentucky HEALTH waiver on April 1," Health and Family Services Secretary Adam Meier said Friday.
"Kentuckians, and specifically our Medicaid members, deserve a Medicaid program that will improve health outcomes and provide paths for employability, long-term stability, and future success while also ensuring the long-term sustainability of Medicaid for those who need it most," Meier said.
Recdently, 16 Kentucky Medicaid recipients filed an amended lawsuit against the federal government to challenge Bevin's Kentucky HEALTH initiative that would add work requirements, premiums, coverage lock-out periods and reporting duties for able-bodied adults on Medicaid. The federal government twice has approved Bevin's plan, most recently in November.
An earlier version of the suit last year successfully blocked Bevin's first attempt to stiffen eligibility requirements for able-bodied adults. The plaintiffs asked this week for summary judgment on their amended complaint, arguing that Bevin's original version of Kentucky HEALTH, which Boasberg last June called "arbitrary and capricious," essentially was the same as his current plan.
But the U.S. Department of Justice approached Boasberg last week about putting the case on indefinite hold.
Along with much of the federal government, the department stopped being funded Dec. 21 because of a stalemate between President Trump and Congress over Trump's demand for a $5.7 billion wall along the Mexican border. And the department is who represents the federal government in such matters in court -- when it's paid.
"Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances," Assistant Attorney General Joseph Hunt wrote in his motion requesting a stay.
In their response motions, the Medicaid recipients and Bevin's office both protested putting the case on hold, noting that Kentucky HEALTH is scheduled to begin April 1. As a compromise, they said, they would not oppose a delayed briefing schedule that gives more time to harried attorneys for the federal government, as long as the case keeps moving forward.
"The commonwealth prefers that this action, and any appeal, be resolved sooner rather than later," wrote Matthew Kuhn, a lawyer for Bevin.
Boasberg entered a brief order Thursday indicating that he is inclined to only delay the deadlines in the case by one week unless Kentucky agrees to postpone its implementation of the Kentucky HEALTH initiative.
A larger problem is looming. The federal court system is preparing to burn through its current reserve funds within two weeks if the shutdown does not end, The New York Times reported Friday. When the courts' roughly 33,000 employees are furloughed, the judicial branch will be reduced to "mission critical" operations, putting most cases on hold, the Times said.
More than 1.3 million Kentuckians were enrolled in Medicaid last fall, about 30 percent of the state's population.
Bevin has promoted Kentucky HEALTH by saying that able-bodied adults on Medicaid will be healthier if they are engaged in their communities as workers, volunteers or students, and if they contribute toward the cost of their care. Monthly premiums would begin at $1 to $15, eventually topping out at $37.50.
Opponents say an estimated 95,000 people will lose their Medicaid coverage in the first five years under Kentucky HEALTH using the state's own figures. Many Kentuckians will have difficulty complying with monthly reporting requirements and finding 80 hours of work or volunteer duty every month, especially in rural parts of the state with no public transportation, these critics say.

Texto completo: Conan O'Brien returns with his revamped late-night show. And "Many Sides of Jane" offers an intimate look at life with dissociative identity disorder.
What's on TV
CONAN 11 p.m. on TBS. The late-night host Conan O'Brien unveils his show's new look and 30-minute format with Tom Hanks as guest star. The revamp will give "Conan" a more casual feel: O'Brien will be wearing fewer suits and will do away with the desk, bringing the audience closer to the action. "If I hadn't changed this up, I can't say how many more years I could have done it the same way, every night," he said in a recent interview with The New York Times. Among the guest stars on this week's episodes: Bill Hader, Tig Notaro and the cast of "The Good Place."
THE CONNERS 8 p.m. on ABC. The first season of this third "Roseanne" incarnation -- brought about by the thorny end to the revival that debuted last spring -- wraps up with a momentous offer for Darlene (Sara Gilbert) and worrisome news for Becky (Lecy Goranson). In his review for The Times, James Poniewozik called the show "unsettling and raw and fitfully funny," and said it feels more like the original "Roseanne" than the reboot did.
SIESTA KEY 9 p.m. on MTV. As far as reality series on islands go, "Siesta Key" is definitely more of a "Love Island" than a "Made in Staten Island." Season 2 opens with a wild birthday party, but surely, drama is around the corner.
MANY SIDES OF JANE 10 p.m. on A&E. Three years ago, Jane Hart, a 28-year-old mother of two, received a diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder. In this new six-part documentary series, Hart welcomes cameras into her home to show how she navigates parenting while living with more than nine identities, or what she calls "parts," and to shed light on a condition that is largely stigmatized and misrepresented by Hollywood. "The goal is not to get rid of my parts," Hart says. "It's to help them work better together -- for all of us."
What's Streaming
[Video: Stella's Last Weekend - Official Trailer Watch on YouTube.]
STELLA'S LAST WEEKEND (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. This unconvincing romantic comedy is a family affair, both onscreen and off. Nat and Alex Wolff, who last shared the screen on Nickelodeon's "The Naked Brothers Band," star as the brothers Oliver and Jack. When they reunite at their family home in Queens for a farewell party for their ailing dog -- thrown by their zany mother (played by the stars' real-life mother, Polly Draper, who also directs) -- Jack learns that Oliver's new girlfriend, Violet (Paulina Singer), is an aspiring ballet dancer whom Jack fell for eons ago but who never returned his calls.

9 MONTHS WITH COURTENEY COX 9 p.m. on Facebook Watch. The "Cougar Town" star narrates this documentary series that follows couples across the country as they deal with the unexpected highs and lows of pregnancy. Stream new episodes on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

Russia: We didn’t talk to anyone about a Trump real estate deal

Texto completo: Russia had no discussions with President Trump or anyone on his team during the 2016 elections about a proposed real estate project in Moscow, a senior Russian official told reporters Monday.

"No, the Kremlin did not hold talks with anyone at all about building the tower," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to state-run TASS.

Putin’s spokesman released that statement as Trump’s apparent interest in Moscow real estate dominated the Washington D.C. media landscape over the weekend. Buzzfeed prompted the discussion with a report, since contradicted by special counsel Robert Mueller’s office, that the president directed then-attorney Michael Cohen to lie to federal investigators about his interest in a Moscow Trump Tower during the election.

“The conversations lasted throughout parts of 2016,” Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Sunday on Meet the Press while discussing Cohen’s efforts to broker the project. “But the president's recollection of it is that the the thing had petered out quite a bit. They sent a letter of intent in. They didn't even know where to send it they knew so little about it.”

Trump denied any financial interest in Russia throughout the campaign and in the early months of his presidency.

“I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian many years ago,” he told NBC in May of 2017. “I had the Miss Universe pageant — which I owned for quite a while — I had it in Moscow a long time ago. But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia.”

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, argued that Giuliani’s comments justified his committee’s ongoing investigation.

“Why, two years after the fact, are we just learning this fact now, when there's been this much inquiry?” Warner asked. "I don't often feel bad for Rudy Giuliani, this morning, just seeing that interview, I almost feel bad for him. He keeps having to readjust his stories, as more facts come out. So we now know that Mr. Trump or his operation was still trying to do business with Moscow up until his election. We now know that his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, gave confidential information to a Russian agent, and we don't know what that Russian agent did with that.”

Trump discussed the topic more generally in November. “There was a good chance that I wouldn’t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?” the president said, as the New York Times recalled.

Putin’s team portrayed Cohen as ineffective, saying the attorney sent multiple messages to “the publicly accessible e-mail of the Russian presidential administration,” as TASS put it. Peskov added that he couldn’t say if Trump was aware of the effort.

"How do we know who kept this under control and what were the issues? Trump personally or someone else?" Peskov said. ”The Americans themselves and the U.S. president personally are in a better position to judge.”

6,700 people attend local Women's March

Texto completo: About 6,700 people marched at the Arizona Capitol Saturday as part of the third annual Phoenix Women's March, joining hundreds of thousands of participants nationwide who marched in support of women.
But attendance lagged in comparison to previous years. In 2018, more than 20,000 people marched at the Arizona Capitol. In 2017, more than 20,000 people marched in Phoenix, and more than 36,000 marched statewide.
The Arizona Department of Public Safety estimated 6,700 attended this year's march.
Despite controversies over anti-Semitism that surrounded the national women's march, Phoenix's march emphasized inclusiveness. Ahead of the march, separate gatherings honored Indigenous women, Black women and Latinas.
Indigenous women led the Phoenix march, with banners declaring "Honor Indigenous Women" and "Rise Stand with Missing & Murdered Indigenous Women." In Tucson, the march was also led by Indigenous women.
Local organizers distanced themselves from the national march and denounced anti-Semitism. That distance meant no organizing conference calls and no listing on the national march website, which made it hard to get the word out, said Phoenix organizer Eva Burch.
"We don't have any patience or tolerance for any anti-Semitic rhetoric," she said.
This year's theme was "Rising Together," and the event saw a diverse array of participants representing numerous organizations, as well as individuals.
Marchers chanted slogans against President Donald Trump and his policies and in favor of issues like abortion access and equal pay:
"My body, my choice."
"Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go."
"Education, not deportation."
Breaking from the national march In Phoenix, local organizers distanced themselves from the national march after allegations of anti-Semitism were leveled at national organizers.
The allegations of anti-Semitism stemmed, in part, from national Women's March co-president Tamika Mallory's refusal to condemn Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam who has perpetuated anti-Semitic theories and comments.
A former board member of the national march, Vanessa Wruble, said she was asked to leave the group after the 2017 march. Wruble, who is Jewish, told The New York Times her religion was a factor in being asked to leave.
"We had a lot of people come to us about the controversies at the national level wanting to know where we stand," Burch said. "We've never had any national sponsorship, don't have any financial backing (from national), we're all local organizers."
The group made a public statement denouncing anti-Semitism on the march's event page, and some organizers met with local rabbis, Burch said.
Burch's post in the Facebook event, written in November, said Phoenix organizers had been getting a number of messages from people concerned about an "anti-Semitic undertone" to the national march and its organizers.
"It simply can't go unanswered," the post said.
The organizers denounced anti-Semitism and any "hateful language and views" from national organizers.
"We are a movement of love and inclusivity. We condemn hate in all its ugly presentations, and continue to promote the values of justice and unity. Your local organizers represent a very diverse range of backgrounds and we will make sure to do our best to give all oppressed, condemned, or otherwise disenfranchised communities a voice," the post said.
Julia Lange, who is Jewish, attended the march and carried a sign in English and Hebrew. She said she started reading up on the march after learning of comments made by national organizers. She decided to come to the Phoenix march regardless.
"I wasn't going to let one issue stop me from supporting another issue," she said.
Why people marched The thousands who attended Saturday's march drew up colorful signs celebrating women and denouncing Trump. Some turned out for specific reasons and issues, while others sought to show solidarity with women.
Demetra Presley attended the Phoenix Women's March as a way to raise awareness of "period poverty" in Arizona.
Presley is the founder of Go With the Flow, a nonprofit that provides free menstrual hygiene products to schools in Arizona. She said one out of five students misses school because they don't have pads or tampons.
"There are things we can do in our community to support the effort of ensuring that everyone has access to essential period products," Presley said.
Malak Fayad, a student at Mesa Community College, attended the march in Phoenix. Fayad, who wears a hijab, said she gets questions and comments about her ability to speak English from her classmates.
She said a man attending the march Saturday asked her, "So your man let you come here?"
For Fayad, being at the march helped reinforce that, despite stereotypes other people may have, she's a part of the American community.
Eddi Treviso and Cynthia Rodriguez showed off their signs at the Phoenix march. One sign featured Elastigirl from Disney's "The Incredibles" and said, "Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so."
"I've always been a feminist, but I think it's more important now to support the movement as a Latina," Treviso, a Buckeye resident, said.
Eli Smith, 23, of Tucson, held a sign reading, "I Use a Gillette," a reference to the razor company's television ad attacking toxic masculinity. He said he was marching to support the rights of the women all around him, particularly in the financial business offices that employ him.
"In the past, I've worked for a lot of women, when I've had jobs, I've worked alongside a lot of women," he said. "And I have firsthand ... experiences in which women I saw did the same job that I did and didn't get paid as much. That's not right."
He said he hoped some of the children joining their parents in the march or watching it would grow to understand the march's message of equality and respect for women.
"Maybe when they grow up," he said. "They'll come to these marches."
Allison Wonderland of Phoenix said she attended her first women's rights march in 1968. She said she thought she'd be done protesting by now.
"I was walking over here and I thought, 'Am I going to be out here marching with my great-granddaughter, who's not even a year old, in 20 years doing the same thing?'" Wonderland said. "When is this going to stop?"
Local march emphasizes inclusiveness Phoenix's march emphasized inclusion and involved women of color in planning, organizing and leading the event. It started with the three pre-march gatherings for Indigenous, Latina and Black women.
Murphy Bannerman, one of the march's organizers, said the community gatherings before the march began provided a space for women from different communities to "celebrate their culture and embrace one another before uniting together."
Bannerman said the gathering for Black women focused on "empowering and uplifting Black women and girls."
Bannerman said the feminist movement hasn't always been inclusive of women of color, so it's important for women of color to feel empowered to move forward. Certain issues have disproportionate impacts on women of color, she said. For instance, not only are Indigenous women dealing with equal pay gaps, they're confronting a crisis of women being abducted from reservations, Bannerman said.
"The only way that we can move forward is if we're acknowledging all of the different ways that we're impacted as women," she said.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it encourages a glass of red wine every now and then.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: "We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous."
Douglas Cox, chairman of the Menominee Indian Tribe
GREEN BAY - The children had just awakened from a nap and were still rubbing sleep from their eyes when they pulled up tiny chairs at two small U-shaped tables.
Bowing their heads to say grace in their Oneida native language, the Head Start students were about to snack on Kiwi slices and rice cakes washed down with cups of water.
The Oneida Nation spends $233,000 annually on its Head Start program, which oversees 152 children at two locations on the reservation. Almost three-fourths of Head Start funding for the Green Bay-area tribe is paid through federal funds — roughly $172,000.
But all federal funds flowing to the Oneida and other Wisconsin tribes, as well as Indian tribes across the country, have dried up since the federal government shutdown.
Wisconsin tribes are using their own funds to continue to provide education, health, law enforcement, food pantries and other services, but if the shutdown lasts much longer — and there's no sign of the impasse ending any time soon — some services could be curtailed or cut, hiring might be frozen, workers could be laid off and other drastic measures taken.
"We're fortunate we have the infrastructure and manpower here. A lot of tribes don't have that," Oneida Vice Chairman Brandon Yellowbird Stevens said. "We can supplant the loss of funds with emergency contingency funding."
But the tribe's emergency funding is not limitless and it's designed for emergencies, and no one knows how long the federal shutdown, already the longest, will last.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has furloughed 2,295 of its 4,057 employees, the New York Times reported.
When Oneida self-government coordinator Candice Skenandore tries to contact someone at the bureau, which she does daily for her job, she gets automatic email replies that the person she's trying to reach is on furlough for an indefinite time. It's the same for voicemail.
Skenandore is in the middle of negotiations for a new funding agreement for the tribe's health services and she's waiting for grant approvals and funding OKs for several programs. But everything is on hold and Skenandore knows it will take several weeks, if not months, for federal employees to get up to speed once the shutdown ends.
Skenandore is supposed to attend a tribal self-governance advisory board meeting in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21, but she's not sure if the meeting will be held.
The shutdown "is stopping us from doing what we need to do to improve our health services," said Skenandore, whose position is federally funded. The tribe is paying her salary during the shutdown.
About 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives receive basic services from the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some tribes, like the Oneida, administer services funded by BIA money, while other tribes have their programs run by federal workers, many of whom are tribal members.
Services tied to decades-old treaties Because of treaties negotiated decades ago, the money funneled to tribes for health care, education, law enforcement and other services is in exchange for tribal nations giving up millions of acres of land in the 1800s. In effect, the tribes prepaid with land for funds now held up by the shutdown.
There's no guarantee tribes will ever see that money. Stevens said the Oneida tribe never got the money it was owed and was not paid during the government shutdown of 2013.
"We ceded millions of acres of land and, in return, the United States said they would pay for health and education," Stevens said.
The Oneida tribe was based in New York at the time and gave up 3 million acres. It later moved to Wisconsin.
Stevens points out that the Oneida were among America's first allies, fighting alongside American troops and helping feed George Washington's army when it was hunkered down at Valley Forge during the brutal winter of 1777. The tribe continues to receive a symbolic annuity payment of $1,800 each year from the Treasury Department as part of a treaty signed at the end of the Revolutionary War.
The tribe operates a 48-bed nursing home and a health center that handles 350,000 patient visits annually, offering family practice, internal medicine, behavioral health, dental, optical and public health services among other things. Its pharmacy dispenses between 1,000 and 1,200 prescriptions daily, said Debbie Danforth, comprehensive health director for operations.
Last week Danforth was on a conference call with other tribal health directors and learned that while some tribes are able to continue to provide services during the shutdown like the Oneida, some might have to close their clinics in a few weeks.
'It's truly scary' "It's truly scary for some tribes," Danforth said.
Of the Oneida Nation's roughly $490 million 2019 fiscal year budget, about $50 million comes from federal grants and self-governance funds. There are 17,165 enrolled members in the Oneida tribe with more than 4,400 living on the reservation, including 1,000 who are 55 or older.
"Our message to Congress: these should not be discretionary, we shouldn't be the first to be cut," Stevens said.
Wisconsin's other tribes are facing the same difficulties as the Oneida.
The Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is the largest employer in Shawano County with about 900 employees. The tribe does not have its own school system but provides tutors and a public safety officer for school districts where tribal members attend, in Gresham and Bowler. It handles snowplowing and repairing roads for many smaller communities in Shawano County.
About 1,475 people are enrolled in the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe with 500 living on the reservation.
"But many of those are aging so their health care needs are great," Stockbridge-Munsee President Shannon Holsey said.
"A majority of our citizens are no longer in the workforce. They're living on fixed incomes and they look to the tribal nations for needs such as transportation to medical appointments and healthy food distribution through Meals on Wheels," Holsey said.
The biggest priority for the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is its rural health clinic in Bowler, which offers general medicine, dental, behavioral health, chiropractic and community health services as well as a pharmacy. Since there are no buses or public transportation, the tribe shuttles members who cannot get to a doctor on their own and sends a registered nurse to help people who forget to take their medicine.
The tribe is paying for services normally provided by federal funds out of its reserves but Holsey said there's a limit to that, especially for a small tribe like the Stockbridge-Munsee.
Lac du Flambeau tightens spending Two weeks into the shutdown, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa decided to freeze all capital expenditures until further notice and told employees to be frugal in spending. Not all federal grants have been affected by the shutdown but some have and tribal administrators are meeting regularly with the tribe's accounting staff.
"We want to avoid disruption in services wherever possible and we are working carefully to determine the impact to our general fund and to avoid layoffs," Lac du Flambeau President Joseph Wildcat Sr. said in a statement.
The Menominee Indian Tribe is also using reserve funds to keep essential programs open, Chairman Douglas Cox said.
Like all tribes, the Menominee use a mix of funding to pay for services ranging from a police force and tribal court system to a large health clinic and K-8 school. Menominee Indian High School is a state school district and is not affected by the shutdown.
There are 9,300 enrolled Menominee members with about 4,000 living on or near the reservation.
Cox estimates about 60 percent of the tribe's $19 million annual operating budget is funded through federal grants. Cox and other leaders are reviewing the tribe's finances daily during the shutdown to ensure services continue to be provided.
Cox is worried money due to the tribes from this federal government shutdown will never be paid because Congress would have to approve paying those funds separately.
"We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous," Cox said in a phone interview.
"We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous."

The UK needs to respect the Brexit vote and leave the EU: Today's talker

Texto completo: British Parliament rejected this week the terms of separation that Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with the European Union.
Accept the will of the people: Separate
By Nigel Farage
After Prime Minister Theresa May's historic defeat in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Parliament is deadlocked and seeking an alternative to her deal. In 2017, 498 members of Parliament voted for Article 50, which states that if the United Kingdom doesn't agree to a withdrawal agreement by March 29, 2019, then we will leave the European Union on World Trade Organization rules.
This means that in U. K. and EU law, we should leave in a couple short months time. Shamefully, I expect members of Parliament will not allow this to happen.
The problem is Parliament refuses to accept the will of the people. More than 17. 4 million people voted for Brexit in 2016, but our political class think they know better than ordinary people. Now we see moves towards a much softer Brexit as May begins cross-party talks. Her failure of leadership at every opportunity has allowed Remainers in Parliament to take the upper hand and take control of the Brexit process.
Talker: Rudy Giuliani's lying is par for the course, but it's getting desperate
Sign-up for Today's Talker newsletter here
Their endgame is a second referendum, and I predict that is where we will end up. While I do believe that a such a result would mean a bigger vote to leave, this would be a deeply undemocratic and divisive outcome. Not only was Brexit the biggest democratic mandate in British political history, it was also backed up at a general election.
In 2017, both main parties promised to deliver Brexit and secured more than 80 percent of the votes cast in doing so. You also have to wonder whether remain supporters would honor a second vote, given that they have spent over two-and-a-half years trying to overturn the first one?
What this ultimately comes down to is trust in our democratic process. For once, the politicians decided to let the people decide on this great issue. To ignore them or ask them to vote again, before the first decision is even implemented, would be incredibly damaging to who we are as a nation.
Nigel Farage is a former UK Independence Party leader and vice chairman of the Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave. You can follow him on Twitter: @Nigel_Farage.
What others are saying
George F. Will, The Washington Post: "Brexiteers believe that the fact that leaving the European Union has proved to be so difficult a prison break validates Euroskepticism. They ask: Britain, which has been in the EU since 1993, was self-governing since the Romans departed in 410, so how calamitous can Brexit be? Very, respond Remainers, with increasing plausibility as the prospect of a 'hard Brexit' — divorce with no new U. K. -EU legal and commercial relationships in place — becomes more probable. Economic globalization, with the increasing importance of just-in-time inventory management of complex supply chains, raises the stakes for Britain, whose trade with the EU far exceeds its trade with either the United States or China. "
Roger Cohen, The New York Times: "There are no good solutions to the current impasse, but a second referendum is the least bad. All the debate has come up against a stubborn fact: Brexit is damaging to the British national interest. No deal can make it look good. Prime Minister Theresa May tried and failed. The British, and particularly British youth, deserve the right to determine their long-term future on the basis of reality. "
Steve Hilton, FoxNews. com: "The key dynamic in this whole process — and the factor that will determine its outcome — is a familiar one to us here in America: the split between the people and the establishment; between populism and elitism. The British people voted to leave the EU. But a majority of the members of Parliament want to stay. Despite a clear promise that voters would have the final say over Brexit, despite the British Parliament explicitly relinquishing control over the process when it passed the legislation authorizing the Brexit referendum in the first place — Parliament is now actively working to . . . well, 'take back control. ' "
What our readers are saying
If the United Kingdom does leave the European Union without a deal, then the EU should do all it can to economically isolate the United Kingdom further, until U. K. citizens vote to rejoin. United they stand, divided they fall. That's how unions work.
— John Bertelson
The people voted. Their wishes should be honored. Just like many would like to throw President Donald Trump out of office, the people voted him in. It seems like more and more people are getting pushed aside, while politicians seem to want to overrule their will.
— Larry Hubble
You can't blame Prime Minister Theresa May for her deal being defeated. May was handed a burning bag, and she's trying to handle it as best as she can.
— Khalid Nurredin
Of course they kept May as prime minister, because the only thing the members of Parliament want less is having to be responsible for the mess. Blame May, but keep her in so she continues to take the fall.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — An exhibition of photographs tracing John F. Kennedy’s private life and public trajectory opens at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum on Feb. 15. Some are iconic images of Camelot, while many have rarely been seen before.
"American Visionary: John F. Kennedy’s Life and Times" shows Kennedy as a joyful boy playing in the ocean and a troubled president working in the Oval Office, as a public figure adored by crowds and a father alone with his baby daughter. Jacqueline Kennedy is there, too — as a happy bride, an elegant first lady and a heartbroken widow.
The exhibition, one of the most exhaustively researched collections of Kennedy photos ever assembled, runs through May 19. It brings together images from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, Getty Images, private collections, and the Kennedy family archives.
Alan Lowe, executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, called the exhibit "a wonderful snapshot of JFK’s life."
"We are honored to bring ‘American Visionary’ to Springfield," Lowe said. "Not only are the photos wonderful, but they offer a chance to reflect on a man who, like Abraham Lincoln, served his nation in a time of great challenge and gave his life in that service."
There is no extra fee to see the exhibition. It will be included in regular ALPLM admission prices.
The exhibition is based on the book "JFK: A Vision for America" by Stephen Kennedy Smith and Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who contributes frequently to CNN and The New York Times. Brinkley will speak at the presidential library on April 12. The topic will be his latest book, "American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space Race."
"American Visionary" was organized and curated by Lawrence Schiller of Wiener Schiller. Schiller, a noted photographer, writer and director, will be taking part in a special preview Feb. 13.
The free preview, which runs 6:30-8:30 p.m., is open to members of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation. To become a member, visit www.ALPLM.org.
Another special event takes place Feb. 19. In "Fact vs. Fiction: Lincoln and Kennedy," two historians will examine the supposedly "eerie" coincidences between the assassinated presidents and explain which ones have some significance, which are random chance and which have simply been made up.
Kennedy’s administration coincided with a golden age of photojournalism in America. Photographers such as Ed Clark, Lisl Steiner, Ralph Crane and Steve Schapiro captured the optimism and challenges of the early 1960s in some of the finest and most vivid images of the period.
Highlights of "American Visionary" include: * A 1953 photo booth snapshot of the Kennedy newlyweds, possibly taken on their honeymoon * A candid 1958 photograph of Kennedy playing with his baby daughter, Caroline, in her bassinet * A 1960 photograph of people peering at Kennedy through the window as he prepares for a campaign speech * A 1961 photograph of the First Couple and others heading to Kennedy’s inauguration ceremony, with the White House blanketed in snow * A haunting photograph of the first lady departing the White House on the day of Kennedy’s state funeral in 1963.
"John F. Kennedy is still seen as a symbol around the world, representing and espousing the best and most universal elements of the American character," said Stephen Kennedy Smith, Kennedy’s nephew and co-editor of "JFK: A Vision for America." "It is our hope that the compelling images of President Kennedy’s life and work on view in this exhibition will remind visitors not only of the values that defined his presidency, but also will introduce him to new audiences and future leaders."
The presidential library and museum uses a combination of rigorous scholarship and high-tech showmanship to immerse visitors in the life and times of Abraham Lincoln. Visitors can see ghosts come to life on stage, watch TV coverage of the 1860 presidential election, roam through the Lincoln White House, experience booming cannons in a Civil War battle and come face to face with priceless original Lincoln artifacts.
The library holds an unparalleled collection of Lincoln books, documents, photographs, artifacts and art, as well as some 12 million items pertaining to all aspects of Illinois history.

Texto completo: It started as a statement of defiance after the election of Donald Trump, morphed into a mobilizing force at the polls, and now, as it approaches its third iteration, the Women’s March is focusing on fighting for its policy priorities.
Themes such as opposition to Trump, ending violence against women and the pursuit of equality are sure to take center stage during scheduled demonstrations in Washington and about 350 sites across the country Saturday, just short of the two-year anniversary of the historic first march.
As it grows into its political power, the movement is running into headwinds in the form of a splintered leadership and accusations of anti-Semitism against some of the original organizers.
The controversy, which prompted the Democratic National Committee and other groups to distance themselves from the Washington event, threatens to erode the movement’s gains, or at least slow its progress.
A cause that two years ago drew 3. 3 million to 5. 2 million nationwide, making it probably the largest demonstration in U. S. history, now may be lucky to attract half that many.
Besides lacking the immediate outrage over Trump’s election or midterms to serve as motivators, the marches face obstacles in the increased travel inconveniences created by the federal shutdown, in addition to harsh weather. Major winter storm Harper is forecast to pound large stretches from the Midwest to the Northeast with rain, snow and wind over the weekend.
“This is the heaviest lift they’re going to have,’’ said University of Maryland sociology professor Dana R. Fisher, author of the upcoming book “American Resistance. ’’
“In general, getting people to march in the winter is tough. It’s a hard ask, and right now there’s not an obvious goal, except for perhaps 2020 (the general election). I know Women’s March Inc. says they’re trying to use this as a pivot to start talking about doing more policy-based work, but I think that’s not a good mobilizer. ’’
Diminished interest is to be expected in a non-election year. After the enthusiasm generated by the first march, the movement spurred a spike in female activism before the 2018 midterms, in the form of candidates and involvement in campaigns.
Women, especially those in the suburbs, helped drive the Democrats’ 40-seat gain in the House of Representatives, flipping control of that chamber. A record 102 women – 89 of them Democrats – were voted into the House in November.

“You can draw a direct line from the 5 million who marched that day and our effort after that to impact elections to the makeup of the current Congress as the most diverse Congress that’s ever been elected,’’ said Vanessa Wruble, one of the leading organizers of the first march. “Already you see the movement shifting from reactive to proactive. ’’
But as Wruble knows all too well, the cause has been shaken by distrust and divisiveness, which she said began the very first day she and six other women met to lay down plans for the march.
A detailed story by the Jewish online magazine Tablet said Women’s March board members Tamika Mallory and Carmen Perez – whom Wruble recruited to add diversity to the original organizing group of four – confronted her about the role Jews had in oppressing minorities of color.
Wruble, who is Jewish, was asked to leave the group shortly after the first march, and she told The New York Times her religion was a factor. She later co-founded March On, an organization that provides support and guidance to women-led groups throughout the country, and estimates 50 percent of Saturday’s sister marches will have gotten help from the group.
Fisher said the controversy is clearly taking a toll.
“Women’s March Inc. does not own the women’s movement, and it certainly does not own this march, which has been so much a combination of all of these locally distributed efforts across the country,’’ she said. “It’s a shame all of the bad press is having this effect. ’’
WMI declined to make any of its board members available for an interview, instead forwarding one of the multiple denials of anti-Semitism the group has issued since the dispute erupted.
Its case was undermined when Mallory, a Women’s March co-president, appeared on ABC’s “The View’’ on Monday and declined to denounce the frequent anti-Semitic statements by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, whom she has publicly lauded.
WMI provided a statement about the concurrent marches programmed for Saturday, most of which are not affiliated with the group.

“Women's March is an organic movement, made of the fierce energy and power of millions of women and those who support them,’’ the statement said. “We're thrilled to see hundreds of marches sprout up in small towns, suburbs, and cities across America and around the globe. In 2017, we marched. In 2018, we took our power to the polls. In 2019, we're coming with an agenda created by women and for the people. ’’
In addition to addressing violence against women, that agenda includes items such as reproductive rights, racial justice and immigrant rights. The objectives are worthwhile enough for sponsors like the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood to remain on board.
A coalition of more than 100 supporters of the Jewish Women of Color signed a letter standing firm with the Women’s March.
On the other hand, the Jewish Democratic Council of America issued a statement joining the DNC and other groups pulling away from the Women’s March organization, though not the cause itself.
The diverging stances may diffuse the movement’s message.
“I think there’s obviously some confusion because people don’t know how the sausages are made, and what’s being revealed now is actually how the sausages were made,’’ said Wruble, who favors a decentralized operation. “The media had focused on a small group of people who were some of the organizers of one march. "
Julie Goldscheid, a law professor at City University of New York who has written about gender and equality law, said the focus should be on the overall accomplishments of the women’s marches, which along with the MeToo# movement have brought attention to issues of inequality women regularly confront.
She said the activism behind those causes has carried over into workplace changes in many sectors, from the corporate level to farm workers.
“Whatever the disagreements may be among the leaders or different perspectives or struggles to understand one another,’’ Goldscheid said, “it’s really important for us to remember how much really productive work is being done to fight violence, to fight discrimination on the basis of gender, on the basis of race, on the basis of religion, and all other forms of discrimination that are still so rampant. ’’

GOP's McCarthy faces first major test: Steve King

Texto completo: When Rep. Steve King was ushered into House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office Monday night, after sparking outrage for questioning whether the term "white supremacist" is offensive, he expected to be scolded. He did not expect his career in congressional politics to effectively end.
But as the Iowa Republican sat on a couch beneath an eight-foot-tall portrait of Abraham Lincoln, it quickly became clear that McCarthy - whom King has long privately knocked as soft - was taking a hard line.
King, an ally of President Trump's and a regular guest on conservative media programs, offered to "go quiet," according to three people familiar with the exchange who were not authorized to speak publicly.
McCarthy dismissed the suggestion - and the nine-term Republican was soon stripped of all his committee assignments.
For McCarthy, 53, the hour-long confrontation with King was a critical moment early in his tenure as the new leader of Republicans in the House, testing whether the easygoing Californian was willing to take on a popular conservative and assert himself in the wake of sweeping GOP defeats in the 2018 elections and the high-profile speakership of Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).
It was also a reminder of how Republican leaders have done little to police their ranks on the charged issue of race in recent years, from their embrace of Trump despite him casting doubt on President Barack Obama's U.S. citizenship to their support of the divisive King - making his punishment an outlier rather than the standard.
McCarthy's diminishment of King came after years of inaction by House Republican leaders, including McCarthy, who served as majority leader from 2014 until earlier this year and was majority whip for more than three years before that. During that time King made repeated statements disparaging immigrants and minorities, as did other members, but leaders chose not to move against them - fearful that taking harsh action would antagonize the party's conservative base.
McCarthy referenced that history in an interview with a local radio station this week. "Past leaders did not act," he said. "I just felt, I don't care if it hurts me or not - I've got to just do the right thing."
Many Democrats inside and outside the Capitol expressed skepticism about McCarthy's change of heart and argued that his effort to now distance the GOP from King did little to erase its past support for him.
Former Obama White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer mocked McCarthy on Twitter for "wrestling so deeply with Steve King's long record of racism" yet still giving thousands to his reelection campaign.
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, King received more than $27,000 last year from political committees affiliated with GOP leaders, including $5,000 from McCarthy's group.
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) was more measured when asked about McCarthy, saying, "It's never too late to do the right thing."
McCarthy can expect more challenges - and tense encounters - in the coming months as he deals with a powerful rival in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who brings decades of experience and a reputation for savvy and at times savage responses to her Republican counterparts.
McCarthy's relationship with Trump hovers as another variable. While he has drawn attention for carefully cultivating his presidential bond, to the point of bringing the president a jar of his favorite Starburst candy, the deluge of investigations Trump faces could cause unease among members of his caucus and force McCarthy to choose between protecting the president or them.
And there are signs that House Democrats are eager to rattle McCarthy as he settles into his post - and Pelosi's former office - and give House Republicans a rough welcome to life in the minority.
On Thursday, as lawmakers rushed to leave the Capitol, House Democrats pressed ahead with a bill to reopen the government through Feb. 28. Republicans were expected to firmly oppose the legislation since it did not include new funding for Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
But when Democrats moved to approve the bill by voice vote, no Republican spoke up to request a recorded vote. In an embarrassment to GOP leaders, the House had essentially approved legislation to reopen the government without Trump's wall money, and a testy floor exchange between the parties ensued. Democrats later agreed to revote next week.
McCarthy was absent as the fracas played out because he was en route to an event for a group led by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), whose mission is to elect more Republican women and occasionally take sides in primaries - a position that has riled some of McCarthy's allies in the leadership, but not McCarthy.
"He'd prefer to avoid Republican on Republican fights, but having been the recruiter for years, he knows how important it is to get the right candidate and he's going to be supportive of what Elise is doing," said one McCarthy associate who was not authorized to speak publicly.
From McCarthy's support of Stefanik to his absence from the floor Thursday to his handling of King, most House Republicans see a political animal trying to navigate a fraught party, often focusing more on repairing the GOP's brand than in pushing a policy agenda.
Republicans lost 40 seats last year, their worst showing in the House since 1974, and McCarthy's own California delegation was roughly halved by Democratic gains as suburban voters fled from the party. Not acting against King, to some members, would have been political malpractice.
Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) said: "One of the reasons we picked him for leader is we think he's the right guy to lead us out of this. He's not someone who is going to be comfortable being in the minority. He's someone who is going to every day wake up and think, 'How do we get back to the majority?' "
King, meanwhile, has been lashing out, saying on a St. Louis radio show this week that the experience has been "perverse" and like a "bad dream."
McCarthy "decided he's going to believe the New York Times over Steve King, and that's a fact," King said, adding that Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), a McCarthy ally and chair of the GOP conference, lacked "the moral authority or the intellectual judgment" to call for his resignation.
King was unavailable for comment Thursday.
The recent controversy began when King said in a New York Times interview, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"
It followed a long string of inflammatory remarks, as well as a seeming embrace of far-right foreign politicians and parties that have been openly hostile to those same groups.
There are other GOP grumbles about how McCarthy handled King, almost entirely on the conference's right flank, which has long been suspicious of McCarthy, as well as Ryan and Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) before him.
"If the reporter did a crummy job and did not have a tape recording of the conversation, given the New York Times' willingness to lie, I would give the benefit of the doubt to Steve King when he says what his intent was and the words he actually uttered," said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.).
McCarthy's decision to remove King from his perches on the House Agriculture, Judiciary and Small Business committees was made in coordination with the powerful Republican Steering Committee, which formally decides assignments along with the House leadership.
During the session, King asked McCarthy, "Why don't you just reprimand me?" He then asked for a "pause" in the decision-making process, the people said.
But his fate had already been decided.

Texto completo: Thursday marked the 27th day of the US government shutdown, six days longer than the previous record, in 1995-1996. As a result, more than 800,000 federal workers nationwide are missing paychecks. Overall, the shutdown is estimated to be costing the US economy more than $1 billion a week.
In New England, the shutdown is being felt in a variety of ways. Here is a breakdown of employees by state and a look at cascading problems nationwide that could arise as a result of the shutdown.
New Hampshire
2,100 employees (46th). Departments with most affected workers: transportation, state, and agriculture.
Vermont
1,500 employees (47th tied). Departments with most affected workers: homeland security, agriculture, and interior.
Connecticut
1,500 employees (47th tied). Departments with most affected workers: homeland security, justice, and transportation.
Massachusetts
8,200 employees (18th). Departments with most affected workers: Treasury, transportation, and interior.
SOME KEY DATES
Throughout January : This is a critical month for science grants that are going unrewarded during the shutdown. Benjamin Corb, director of public affairs for the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, calculated how much funding National Science Foundation provided through Jan. 8 last year: $42 million in 2018 vs. $0 in 2019.
Jan. 25: Federal courts expected to deplete resources and may have to suspend some civil cases.
Jan. 28: The IRS begins processing tax returns and has recalled half its furloughed workers (without pay) to handle them and issue refunds. Audits will remain on hold.
Early February: The Census Bureau could run out of funding for work on the 2020 count, and rent subsidies from the Agriculture Department are expected to run out for nearly 270,000 rural low-income families.
Late February: The Food and Drug Administration would run out of funding to review new drug applications.
March : Federal food assistance program is at risk of running out. The country's AAA credit rating could be affected; and HUD's Section 8 rent vouchers for 2.2 million households may run out.

Trump: 'So funny to watch Schumer groveling'

Texto completo: President Trump said Thursday how he found it humorous to see Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., “groveling.”

“So funny to watch Schumer groveling,” Trump tweeted. “He called for the firing of bad cop James Comey many times - UNTIL I FIRED HIM!”

While it's not clear what Trump meant by "groveling" and what prompted the tweet now, his tweet comes amid a government shutdown standoff and a day after Schumer expressed concerns about Trump’s nominee for attorney general, William Barr, after two days of confirmation hearings. Schumer lamented to reporters Wednesday how Barr declined to completely rule out interfering in the federal Russia investigation and didn’t confirm that he would release special counsel Robert Mueller’s report during a private meeting.

“So despite the fact that there were some nice words at the hearing, we do not have the kind of strong, clear commitments to the report being issued and there being no interference in the investigation that are needed, particularly now with President Trump treating the Justice Department as he has,” Schumer said.

“He said he’s for transparency," Schumer said. "That’s not good enough, especially with someone like Donald Trump who has treated the Justice Department almost as if it’s his personal fiefdom."

As Trump noted in the latter part of his tweet, Schumer had been critical of former FBI Director James Comey before Trump fired him in the spring of 2017. In the days leading up to the 2016 election, Schumer rebuked Comey for his unprecedented announcement weeks before the 2016 election that the FBI was reopening the investigation into the unauthorized email server of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the Democratic presidential nominee at the time.

"I do not have confidence in him any longer," Schumer said. He also characterized the decision, which came after a new batch of of emails were unearthed on a laptop belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s husband Anthony Weiner, as “appalling.”

Comey was fired by Trump in May 2017. Originally, Trump claimed Comey was fired at the suggestion of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but he admitted days later the “Russia thing” was a factor.

Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, was appointed to lead the probe shortly after Comey’s ouster in May 2017 by Rosenstein.

The New York Times reported last week that the FBI opened a counterintelligence operation looking into whether Trump was a Russian asset right after he fired Comey and that this inquiry was later wrapped into Mueller's investigation.

Trump has long derided Mueller's investigation as a "witch hunt."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Republicans are shocked, shocked, to learn that Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, is a dyed-in-the-wool racist. Also that snow is cold, the ocean is wet and the sky is often blue.

The clamor of GOP voices denouncing King's latest racist eruption is more amusing than inspiring. Where have his Republican colleagues been all these years? Surely the "party of Lincoln" is aware that race has been the most divisive issue in our national history. Surely Republicans were aware of King's toxic views, which he makes no attempt to hide. Why such an uproar now?

Perhaps King's newly outraged critics were waiting for him to finally spell it out in language that even the "party of Trump" cannot ignore. Which he did.

In a New York Times profile last week, King expounded on his hardline anti-immigrant views, which are the only thing that has distinguished him, or undistinguished him, in an otherwise mediocre congressional career. He boasted of having once told President Trump that "I market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something."

In what might have been an unguarded moment, King told the Times: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive? Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"

We have seen, in subsequent days, that the open embrace of white supremacy is a bridge too far for many Republicans. That's what they say, at least. I'll believe them when they make clear -- with actions, not just words -- that racists like King are unwelcome in the party's ranks.

After the Times piece was published, King quickly issued a statement seeking to distance himself from white nationalism and white supremacy, claiming to "reject those labels and the evil ideology they define." But then he went on to defend that very ideology in the euphemistic language -- word salad about nationalism and Western "values" -- that white supremacists use in polite company.

King claims his crusade is about keeping out the wrong kind of values. But his rhetoric and his associations make clear that his real aim is keeping out the "wrong" kind of people -- Latinos, Muslims, anyone who doesn't fit into his warped, ahistorical, racist vision of the nation's heritage.

Several years ago, referring to the undocumented "Dreamers" brought here as minors, King had this to say: "For every one who's a valedictorian, there's another hundred out there who weigh 130 pounds and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert." That's what King thinks of Hispanic immigration. He proposed a border wall before Trump did.

As the Times noted in its profile, King has supported political figures abroad who have anti-Semitic leanings and neo-Nazi ties. In his response statement, King said he condemns anyone who supports the ideology that led to the Holocaust. So that's something. In years past, however, he did display a Confederate flag in his office -- an odd and telling choice of decor for a man born and raised in Iowa, where the trees are not draped with Spanish moss and the atmosphere is not suffused with "Lost Cause" nostalgia.

Here is part of what King said last year to a right-wing Austrian website: "When I made a statement on Twitter saying, 'We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies,' it seemed to be more irritating to the left than anything I have ever said. First of all, the total fertility rate in Europe is below replacement rate. When that happens, you are a dying civilization. ... If we continue to abort our babies and import a replacement for them in the form of young violent men, we are supplanting our culture, our civilization." The idea of "replacement" is a cornerstone of white supremacist ideology.

Following the Times profile, we've heard stirring denunciations from outraged and embarrassed Republicans. On "Meet the Press," Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was righteously eloquent on the subject. In a Washington Post op-ed, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., challenged his colleagues: "Some in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism -- it is because of our silence when things like this are said." On "Face the Nation," House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., promised that "action will be taken" against King; there were reports he may be removed from some House committees.

Yeah, sure, whatever. You don't want to be called racists, Republicans? Then stop letting bigots like King and Trump define the party's policies. I'll believe stirring GOP words about diversity when they are backed up by votes.

Adam Schiff: House Intelligence Committee could subpoena interpreter, notes from Trump-Putin meeting

Texto completo: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said his panel would consider subpoenaing an American interpreter who took notes during a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"We certainly could subpoena the interpreter. We could subpoena the interpreter's notes. The question is on what basis will they refuse, because they will refuse, and what is our chance of success on that?" Schiff said during a Wednesday interview on CNN. "I think we have to look at is there a method for us to get that information voluntarily? Is there a way to assure the country that the president behind closed doors is not sacrificing the interests of the country? It's always our preference to get voluntary cooperation before we consider compulsion."

The California Democrat's comments come after his counterpart in the Senate, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., said he would not seek the interpreter's notes.

“If I were the president, I would try to claim executive privilege in anything that had to do with him," Burr said, according to CNN.

But Schiff on Wednesday evening expressed doubt Trump could rely on executive privilege.

"That privilege really normally applies when the president is seeking advice from his counselors and there's a policy interest in making sure that he has the free and unfettered opinion of those," he said. "That's not the case when he's speaking to a foreign leader and is speaking to that foreign leader in private. I don't think the privilege applies, but we want to be on the strongest possible ground. If the president destroyed any record of that meeting, that's a separate issue and a separate problem. That gives us further potential jurisdiction to get answers."

The Washington Post reported over the weekend that Trump tried to protect his conversations with Putin, including taking his interpreter's notes from their Hamburg meeting and pressuring the interpreter to withhold information from administration officials. A New York Times article earlier reported that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey in2017.

New book by former New York Times editor Jill Abramson sparks online chatter

Texto completo: Not for the right reasons perhaps, a forthcoming book by former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson continues to be the subject of intense online chatter.
Two weeks after President Trump referenced on Twitter a Fox News report on the book, some journalists are criticizing “Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," claiming an early version of Abramson's book contains multiple inaccuracies.
In a tweet last week, Danny Gold , a “PBS NewsHour" correspondent who formerly worked for Vice Media, said the book, due out Feb. 5, contains a “a straight up lie" about his reporting about the Ebola crisis in Liberia. Vice correspondent Arielle Duhaime-Ross also slammed Abramson, tweeting that she found “SIX errors and several false implications" in one paragraph of a galley.
In response, Abramson, now a senior lecturer at Harvard, said her critics should wait for the book to come out before commenting. She pointed out that the pages being widely shared online are from galleys.
“The photos of pages circulating from my book are from uncorrected galleys," Abramson tweeted, “which have a clear disclaimer saying 'Please do not quote for publication without checking the finished book.' "
Abramson's book follows two legacy organizations, the Times and The Washington Post, and two relative newcomers, BuzzFeed and Vice Media, in her examination of news-media disruption and adjustment.
Many of the Twitter accusations of problems involve present and former Vice staffers.
Duhaime-Ross notes that in the galley she is referred to as “transgender," which the Vice correspondent says is not correct. “I told [Abramson] I'm a queer, gender-nonconforming woman," Duhaime-Ross tweeted. “She didn't ask for an explanation. She didn't ask for my pronouns."
In an electronic copy of the finished book, the error is fixed: Duhaime-Ross is referred to as a “gender-nonconforming woman." Also in the galley, Abramson mistakenly writes that the 2017 white supremacist rally was held in Charlottesville, N.C. In the finished book, the correct location — Charlottesville, Va. — is included.
In the case of Gold, though, the galley and the finished book remain the same. Abramson writes that a Vice correspondent, whom she doesn't name, “wore no protective clothing. In contrast, Times correspondents followed the same protocol as doctors (one reporter was herself a doctor), covering every inch of their bodies with protective clothing."
In his tweet, Gold said he was the Vice correspondent and “like every other reporter there, i was told by experts not to walk around with a PPE unless you were in the ICU. I also worked alongside Times reporters, who a. Gave me that advice and b. Did the same."
Abramson's book got some free publicity from Trump a few weeks ago when the president mentioned it in a tweet: “Former [New York Times] editor Jill Abramson rips paper's 'unmistakably anti-Trump bias,' " he tweeted, alluding to a story by Fox analyst Howard Kurtz that highlighted criticisms on the newspaper in the book. “Ms. Abramson is 100% correct. Horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write. Hence the term Fake News, Enemy of the People, and Opposition Party!"
Abramson responded to the president with a tweet of her own: “Anyone who reads my book, Merchants of Truth, will find I revere @nytimes and praise its tough coverage of you."
Abramson will discuss her book at the Harvard Book Store Feb. 19.

Seth Moulton to speak in N.H., restarting buzz he may run for president

Texto completo: US Representative Seth Moulton will travel to New Hampshire in two weeks, according to people familiar with the planning of his visit.
The trip to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state will likely restart buzz that the Salem Democrat is exploring a run for president.
Moulton, 40, will address the Bedford (N.H.) Democratic Committee on Feb. 2, at a time a host of Democrats are exploring bids for president.
Since Friday, four Democrats have made moves to run for president, including Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro officially entered the race Saturday and spent Tuesday night and Wednesday in New Hampshire. They join Senator Elizabeth Warren, who announced a couple weeks ago that she was exploring a presidential bid. Roughly two dozen names are being floated as potential candidates in the Democratic field.
Although Moulton has traveled to both Iowa and New Hampshire in the past two years, he has not been as closely watched as others eyeing the White House. Media organizations rarely name him to their list of prospective candidates.
Moulton is not expected to make any major announcements about a White House campaign during his trip.
Moulton spokesman Matt Corridoni said the congressman “is always happy to accept invitations to speak with Democratic groups, especially ones so close to home.
“This is an outstanding request from the Bedford Democrats and Seth is looking forward to chatting with them about what he hopes to achieve in our new Democratic House majority," added Corridoni.
This will be Moulton's first trip to any early presidential primary state since the November election.
While he said in December he was not interested in a long-rumored Democratic primary challenge to US Senator Ed Markey in 2020, he never ruled out a run for president.
In a meeting with The Boston Globe editorial board Monday, Moulton was directly asked three times if he would run for president. Each time he changed the subject.
“American government is shut down and Americans are not getting their paycheck," Moulton replied to the first inquiry, before delving into voting irregularities in North Carolina and Georgia in the 2018 election.
When it was pointed out that he didn't answer the question, Moulton responded: “No, look these are the things we should be talking about."
And when he was asked about a timeline to make a decision, he said: “You've heard everything you need to know."
Moulton's potential interest in running for president follows a rough few months for him in Washington and in his district. He became the face of Democratic opposition to Nancy Pelosi's bid for House Speaker. But he eventually backed down and voted for her on the House floor earlier this month.
In the wake of his campaign against Pelosi — the first woman to hold the Speaker's gavel — local activists indicated they were looking to challenge Moulton in the primary for his House seat in 2020.
That same backlash could damage his presidential hopes as well, according to some Democrats.
“It's just not going to work," said Boston-based Democratic strategist Mary Ann Marsh on Moulton potentially running for president. “In a Democratic primary for president or US Senate or his own re-election is going to have a problem with women voters because he opposed Nancy Pelosi the way he did."
Pelosi's office did not return a request to comment Wednesday on Moulton's interest in the White House.
Moulton's New Hampshire visit could shake up the region's political donor circuit as Warren has already visited both Iowa and New Hampshire this month. In addition, former US secretary of state John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, still hasn't ruled out running for president again in 2020.
In the Globe editorial board meeting, Moulton demurred on whether he was open to endorsing Warren, but said he thought “it is great" Warren was running and that they have a good relationship.
Ahead of the midterm election, Moulton was busy in New Hampshire. He visited a handful of times and had his political action committee boost local candidates like newly elected state Representative Matt Wilhelm, a 36-year-old Democrat from Manchester.
Wilhelm, who introduced Warren last weekend at her first event in the Granite State, said Moulton is a candidate who could catch on in the state.
“He has a career defined by service, and I think Democrats right now are really open-minded to hearing new voices," said Wilhelm.

Texto completo: What happens when two restaurateurs cross a background in New England seafood with a hankering for warmer weather?
They get The Clam Bake in south Fort Myers.
Husband-and-wife owners Mark and Laurie Thomas opened The Clam Bake in 2005 after they decided to call it quits with their native New England.
"We got really tired of the weather, so we decided to move to Florida for the perfect weather that's here," Mark said.
"Our roots are New England seafood, so we opened a New England seafood restaurant."
And when he says "roots," he's not joking. Mark grew up in West Warwick, Rhode Island and has been fishing since he was a kid.
"My father had a little 16-foot boat," he said, "and we used to go out into Narragansett Bay to catch bluefish or dig quahogs. We'd catch any kind of fish that was available during the summer months. We used to go out every weekend."
In his early teens, Mark worked at a place called The Shamrock Cafe in West Warwick.
"That's where I learned how to make chowders," he said.
"I'd do all the work: shuck the quahogs, peel the potatoes, make the chowder. My boss would give it away to the neighbors and he was the hero, even though I was the one who made it."
Mark eventually came to run the kitchen at The Shamrock, and then he got serious and set out for Johnson & Wales University in Providence.
"I had plans, a vision, to do something other than living in that small town," he said.
After finishing culinary school, Mark opened his own breakfast and lunch spot. That's when Laurie's mother, who owned the building where Mark had his restaurant, decided to play cupid. She introduced the pair, and when Laurie said she was looking for part-time work on the weekends, Mark hired her.
In 2002, he married her.
"He always tells people he had to marry his best worker," Laurie said, laughing.
The pair left the bitter cold of New England's winters in the early 2000s, and in 2005 launched The Clam Bake in south Fort Myers. Today, the restaurant seats 165, up from the 50 seats of their original location in the same plaza, and, the Thomases said, the restaurant is growing every season.
Their longest wait-list to date? A whopping 478 people. That was in March when the Boston Red Sox, and their many fans, were in town for spring training.
Even though The Clam Bake sits just a few miles from the Gulf of Mexico, diners won't find any warm-water fish on the menu (except the ubiquitous grouper). The restaurant's fish are flown in daily from Boston and include northeastern favorites such as haddock and cod. Some of its most popular dishes include the fresh Maine lobster roll and the whole-belly Ipswich clams, along with Mark's famous Rhode Island clam chowder.
"It's like a taste of the oceans," he said of the chowder.
The Clam Bake opened a second location, The Clam Shack, on Sanibel in 2015 and, a year after opening, Mark and Laurie sold the restaurant to their two children, Patrick Hyland and Cara Lasalle. The Sanibel location continues to feature the same New England seafood and recipes as the original south Fort Myers store.
And, according to the Thomases, the proximity of local Florida seafood doesn't pose a threat to either location.
"It's basically a niche that we have," Mark said. "People flock to us because they miss their New England roots."
"Our customer definitely is from the northeast: Massachusetts, Rhode Island," Laurie said.
"We also have a large population from the Midwest, and they don't have a lot of seafood so we'll introduce them to haddock and they fall in love with it. Or we'll give them the fish and chips with a piece of fried cod, french fries and coleslaw. Or scallops — they love that.
"I haven't found a particular state that didn't like our food. We're truly authentic."

King's fall from grace too long in coming

Texto completo: It's hard to believe that one racially charged interview in The New York Times was what it took to garner a meaningful punishment from congressional Republicans of Iowa's long-standing, race-baiting congressman, Steve King. It's infuriating that it took that interview for his Republican Senate colleagues from Iowa, who've been well aware of his legacy of saying such things, to even criticize him. It's about time.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" King was quoted telling the Times last week. Monday night, the House Republican leadership responded by removing King from its agriculture, judiciary and small business committees.
As every Iowan knows, that's one interview out of scores of statements and positions the 4th Congressional District representative has proudly offered up denigrating non-Western, nonwhite, Central American or Muslim people throughout his decades-long political career. Imagine if Iowa's other high-ranking elected officials had taken a principled stand before they were shamed into doing so by national fellow Republicans.
Only in recent days have Sens. Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst condemned King. Shortly before the 2018 election, Grassley could be seen on video calling King an "ally" he needed in the House. But after the Times piece brought wide condemnations of King, as did a Washington Post column by South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott, who is black, Grassley finally spoke up. Scott wrote, "King's comments are not conservative views but separate views that should be ridiculed at every turn possible."
On Saturday, Ernst tweeted Scott's piece and condemned King's comments as "offensive and racist and not representative of Iowa." Grassley told reporters from Axios, " I find it offensive to claim white supremacy. I will condemn it."
Where have you been, senators? And where was Gov. Kim Reynolds, who just won election with King as her campaign co-chair? Then she was praising him as "principled." But after winning, she said something about his needing to decide whose values he represents.
In case they've forgotten, here's a little refresher on King's actions and pronouncements:
A Washington Post story this fall said King had met in August in Austria with members of the Freedom Party, founded by a former Nazi SS officer. He also granted an interview to a website associated with the party. This was while King was on a trip to Poland paid for by a group dedicated to preserving the history of the Holocaust.
He has said nonwhites have contributed less to civilization than white people; that America can't restore its civilization with "someone else's babies," and that "mixing cultures will bring down the quality of life." He called for America to be so homogeneous that we "look a lot the same."
He proposed an electrified fence to keep Mexicans out, noting, "We do that with livestock." He described Mexicans as having cantaloupe-size calves from running drugs. He justified torturing political prisoners in Abu Ghraib, comparing it to fraternity hazing.
While keeping a Confederate flag on his desk, he held up reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in Congress. He introduced legislation lobbied for by ACT for America, listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-Muslim hate group. He went to bat for the convicted former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who defied a judge's orders not to detain immigrants nabbed through ethnic profiling. He lavished praise on European politicians for going after Muslims and trying to ban mosques and the Koran.
The Register has quoted more such comments by King over the years than I can count.
In June, King retweeted British Nazi sympathizer and Hitler admirer Mark Collett's screenshot of a Breitbart news story about young Italians opposing mass migration, on which Collett had observed: "Europe is waking up..."
"Europe is waking up ...Will America...in time?" King added.
In 2015, it was reported that both King and Ernst had accepted campaign donations from Earl Holt, the leader of a white supremacist group. After that caused a stir, both said they would donate the money to charities.
King endorsed a white-nationalist candidate for mayor of Toronto, earning the condemnation of writers for the conservative Washington Examiner and Weekly Standard, who called out his obsession with race-based politics.
Imagine if Iowa leaders had had this awakening about King 10 or 15 years ago, how things might be different for the state, and especially for King's 39-county House district. Instead of being demonized, immigrants could had been welcomed and encouraged by their representative to help grow the region, its agriculture and small businesses. Instead of being so deeply divided and polarized under King's leadership, the people of the district might have functioned as one, with a shared commitment to progress and growth.
Instead, his supporters have defensively carried water for him while his detractors have felt compelled to shrink from the limelight, embarrassed.
"That is not the party of Lincoln and it's definitely not American," House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said of King in stripping his committee assignments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested King find "another line of work."
Whatever your political views, real leadership means doing what's right when you learn what's wrong, not after everyone else has already condemned it — and then because of polls or popularity or because your career could suffer if you don't.
Whatever happens to King's career, one can only hope Iowa's other top leaders will learn from this and get on the right side for the right reasons — promptly next time.

VERSATILE INSTANT POT GETS DINNER DONE FASTER WITH LESS MESS AND MORE STYLE

Texto completo: I'm a late and reluctant adopter to the Instant Pot. In fact, I doubt I ever would have cooked in one had I not bought one as a joke for my husband last year for Christmas.
He works out of town during the week, and I was tired of packing up meals for him to reheat in his bachelor pad. If you believed the hype - and it was hard not to when the multipurpose cooker became an Amazon darling in 2017 - he would be able to cook everything from barbecued chicken to pad Thai to yogurt and chocolate cake in just a few minutes. And all with minimal cleanup!
He immediately fell in love with his Black Friday gift. Ever since, he's constantly crowing about how quickly he's able to get rice, vegetables and Asian dishes onto the dinner table after work. But I maintained a healthy skepticism about the gadget and the obsessed Instant Pot community it spawned. I mean, I tend to cook a lot of stir fries and like my chicken crunchy and vegetables crispy. You can't do that in a pressure cooker.
Marriage, though, so often is about compromise, and eventually, I agree to give the multipot a try. And wouldn't you know it, I had to agree with my husband it's a runaway hit for good reason.
Just how insanely popular is the Instant Pot? I currently have nine cookbooks on my desk devoted to the cooker, with recipes that embrace everything from vegetarian Indian to paleo to sous vide and "cooking from frozen." It's a trend that seems to only be growing.
Is it the end-all, be-all? Nope. You're never going to make a creamy or crispy dish in it, and forget about using it for burgers or steak. But it is convenient, and it does a pretty good job for soups, stews, rice, and meat dishes that usually have to be cooked for a very long time to become tender. It's also extremely versatile. Along with saute and slow cooker functions, it serves as a rice cooker, steamer and food warmer.
It's fast, but not as instantaneous as the name suggests: You have to wait for the pot to come to pressure before you can cook in it, a process that can take a frustrating 15 or 20 minutes. But once you throw everything into the machine, it's pretty much hands off. You can toss in a load of laundry or go for a quick run, or maybe just unwind with your favorite IPA.
Over the past month, I've made everything from Indian butter chicken, beans and bolognese sauce to spaghetti and meatballs, chipotle mac 'n cheese and pork for tacos in the Instant Pot. It all turned out great and it's going to be hard giving the thing back to my husband.
What won me over, I think, was following New York Times food writer Melissa Clark's very good advice in her very good new cookbook, "Comfort in an Instant" (Clarkson Potter, October 2018).
"The key to pressure-cooker success is choosing recipes in which softness and succulence is the goal," she writes, "and which traditionally can take hours to get there ... If you don't ask it to do what it can't, you won't be disappointed."
The first recipe that caught my eye was for chicken cacciatore with mushrooms. Provided I don't have to give the Instant Pot back just yet, I also can't wait to try her risotto carbonara, spicy Asian chicken wings and sticky toffee pudding.

House condemns white nationalism, supremacy; Vote comes in the wake of comments by Iowa Rep. King

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The House voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to condemn white nationalism and white supremacy, a measure prompted by the comments of Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who openly questioned why those terms had become offensive.
Having been stripped of his committee assignments Monday and facing further reproach, King went to the House floor Tuesday to say that he would support the resolution while continuing to protest that he had been misquoted in The New York Times article.
"There is no tape for this interview I did. There's no way to go back and listen," he said, conceding that he might have said the quoted words but challenging how they have been interpreted. "That ideology never showed up in my head. I don't know how it would have come out of my mouth."
The resolution, introduced by House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., mentions King's remarks in its preamble, but the measure does not directly rebuke King himself. It passed 424-1, with Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., voting no because he favors a censure of King.
Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American congressional leader, called white nationalism and white supremacy "clear and present dangers to our great Republic," in floor remarks Tuesday.
"When elected representatives give cover and comfort to those who spread racial divisiveness, we embolden those on the fringes on our society, and we have seen some of the results," he said citing the hate-motivated murders of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., and synagogue attendees in Pittsburgh.
King sat apart from his colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle as Clyburn spoke. Moments later, King rose, made the sign of the cross, and descended into the well of the House to give his remarks.
King said he came from a family of abolitionists, before ultimately calling on his colleagues to support a measure that is intended to serve as a serious admonition against him.
"All men and all women are created equal," he said. "It is in my heart, it is in my soul, and it is in my works."
But those words came too late for his own Republican colleagues, not to mention scores of Democrats who are ready to pursue more serious actions against King, including censure - the most serious House sanction short of expulsion.
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, called Tuesday for King to "find another line of work," a day after GOP leaders moved to punish King by stripping him of his committee assignments and King earned a rebuke from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., condemned King's comments but stopped short of calling for his resignation.
"I think that's up to Steve King," he said.
Some Democrats are pressing for further punishment. Two Democrats have filed censure resolutions that are set to see floor action by Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., praised Republican leaders for their action but left open the possibility that he would vote for a censure resolution.
Hoyer exploded when asked how King's behavior compared to the last House member to be censured, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
King's conduct, he said, "far exceeds" Rangel's actions, which included improperly using his office to solicit funds and failing to pay taxes on a vacation home. Hoyer served as majority leader during Rangel's 2010 ethics proceedings and pushed to reprimand Rangel, a lesser punishment than censure.
"What King is doing and what others have done is to encourage the undermining of the basic principles of our country," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The House nearly unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday condemning Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, for questioning why phrases such as "white supremacist" are offensive.
King voted for the resolution himself. It passed 424 to 1.
Before the vote, King said he agreed with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn's resolution, titled "Rejecting White nationalism and White supremacy." The resolution invoked King's comments and condemned such words as "hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States."
"I regret that we are in this place," King said, adding that he rejects such ideologies. "I agree with every word that you have put in this. It's an honest and a direct resolution put together to address a subject that has been too long before the public dialogue in this country.
"I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's vote for this resolution. I'm putting up a yes on the board here," King said.
He said his "white supremacist" comments had not come across as he intended.
King sat alone on the GOP side of the chamber as Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, urged his colleagues to support the resolution. A handful of Republicans sat nearby. Many stood up to condemn racism.
On the other side of the aisle, about two dozen Democrats sat in rapt silence as Clyburn, a civil rights veteran, invoked the work of Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday was Tuesday.
"Now is the time to do right," Clyburn said before the vote. "This body must speak out against this evil."
The sole "no" vote came from Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., an African-American, who said the measure did not go far enough.
Minimally, King should be censured, Rush said Tuesday, and if he continues making such remarks, he should be expelled from Congress.
"Steve King has made a career out of being a racist, and he needs to be called out as such," he said.
The vote followed a series of condemnations from lawmakers in both parties. A handful of prominent Republicans said King should leave Congress, and top House Republicans voted Monday not to assign King any committees in the new Congress. King was on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business Committees. He had been the chairman of the immigration and border security subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee when Republicans controlled the House.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?" King said in an interview with The New York Times last week. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
"The House Republicans denounce his language. We do not believe in his language, and we've decided that he will not serve on any" committees, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Tuesday. He said it was up to King whether he should resign.
Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the No. 3 House Republican, went further, echoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: "I think that he should find another line of work," she said. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, also called on King to resign.
Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, 235-199, with the help of a coalition of women, African-Americans and Hispanics. They ushered in the most diverse class yet, breaking records for the number of women and minorities. The House GOP became less diverse, seeing a decline in the number of women and the loss of the sole African-American Republican woman in the House, Mia Love of Utah.
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., applauded Republican leaders for their "strong" actions against King on Tuesday. "I think they did the right thing,'' he said. "I think they're very concerned about their party being perceived as a Steve King party."
Hoyer said the party was discussing two measures that would censure King – one by Rush and a more narrow one from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio – acknowledging that such actions could open a Pandora's box. "It is a big deal to be censured," he said.
Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce, the first Republican to join Ryan's censure resolution and a member of the steering committee that stripped King of his committees, told USA TODAY he tried to have a "man-to-man" conversation with King when he "made stupid comments" about immigrants in 2013.
"My point was that when you say stupid things, it splashes on all of us," Joyce said.

Psychiatrist transformed his field by exploring the science of the brain

Texto completo: Lewis L. Judd, a nationally known psychiatrist who helped turn the focus of his profession from psychoanalysis to neuroscience, an approach that sought to destigmatize mental illness by treating it as cancer, heart disease or any other medical problem, died Dec. 16 in La Jolla, Calif. He was 88.
The cause was cardiac arrest, said his wife, Pat Judd.
For decades, psychiatrists were schooled in the theories of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, who posited that mental disturbances could be treated through dialogue with a therapist. Practitioners sought to interpret their patients' dreams, giving little attention to the physical functioning of the brain or the chemicals that regulate it.
Dr. Judd agreed, he once told the Associated Press, that a physician must look at patients as a "whole individual," with all their "worries, concerns, aspirations and needs," and not resort to simply "popping a pill in their mouth." But he found the long-prevailing psychoanalytic approach too limiting to explain or treat afflictions such as depression, bipolar disorder, severe anxiety and schizophrenia - "these serious mental disorders that have defied our understanding for centuries," he once told the Chicago Tribune.
Instead, he advocated a biological approach, starting at the molecular level of the brain. As director of the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md. - a post he held from 1988 to 1990, during a hiatus from his decades-long chairmanship of the psychiatry department at the University of California at San Diego - he helped launch a federal research initiative known as the "Decade of the Brain."
"He was obsessed with educating the public and the profession . . . that mental illnesses were biological illnesses, that schizophrenia and depression were diseases of the brain," Alan I. Leshner, Dr. Judd's deputy at NIMH and later chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said in an interview. "At the time, that was a heretical thought."
Today, the biological component of many mental illnesses is widely accepted. When Dr. Judd led NIMH, it was not; he once cited a survey in which 71 percent of respondents said mental illness was a result of personal weakness and a third attributed it to sinful behavior. Poor parenting was another common alleged culprit.
Dr. Judd argued that the biological approach to psychiatry held the promise not only of deepening understanding of the body's most complex organ but also of improving lives: If mental disorders could be shown to be a result of brain chemistry or of physical dysfunction, patients might feel less stigmatized and therefore more willing to seek treatment.
"We look at the homeless and feel that if they only got their act together, they could lift themselves up," Dr. Judd told the Los Angeles Times in 1988, discussing the prevalence of mental illness among homeless people. "We would never believe that about someone who has cancer or some other physical disease."
As head of NIMH, which is an arm of the National Institutes of Health and the chief federal agency for research on mental illness, Dr. Judd oversaw more than $500 million in research money. He described the Decade of the Brain - a designation conferred by Congress and President George H.W. Bush - as a "research plan designed to bring a precise and detailed understanding of all the elements of brain function within our own lifetimes."
During his tenure at NIMH, scientists for the first time successfully grew brain tissue in a laboratory. Dr. Judd was among those scientists who touted the potential of medical imaging, such as MRIs and PET scans, to reveal the inner workings of the brain and the potential causes of diseases such as schizophrenia.
Almost 30 years after the Decade of the Brain began, much about the organ remains elusive. Leshner credited the initiative with helping bring attention to the importance of brain research as well as inspiring the Brain Initiative, a public-private research effort advanced by the Obama administration.
"The brain is really the last frontier for scientists," Dr. Judd said.
Lewis Lund Judd was born in Los Angeles on Feb. 10, 1930. His father was an obstetrician-gynecologist, and his mother was a homemaker. Dr. Judd's brother, Howard Judd, also became an OB/GYN and a noted researcher in women's health at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Dr. Judd received a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Utah in 1954 and a medical degree from UCLA in 1958. In the early years of his career, he served in the Air Force as a base psychiatrist.
He joined UC-San Diego in 1970 and became department chairman in 1977, helping grow his faculty into one of the most respected in the country. He stepped down as chairman in 2013 and retired in 2015.
Dr. Judd's first marriage, to Anne Nealy, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 45 years, the former Patricia Hoffman, who is also a psychiatry professor at UC-San Diego, of La Jolla; three daughters from his first marriage, Allison Fee of Whidbey Island, Wash., Catherine Judd of Miami and Stephanie Judd of Chevy Chase, Md.; and four grandchildren.
Ever exploring the outer reaches of his field, Dr. Judd participated in a dialogue with the Dalai Lama in 1989 about life and the mind.
"Our model of mental health is mostly defined in terms of the absence of mental illness," Dr. Judd told the New York Times, reflecting on the Tibetan Buddhist leader's discussion of wisdom and compassion. "They may have more positive ones that might be worth our study."

Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, still learning the ropes of his new job, had a role Tuesday in his first high-profile congressional hearing.
Hawley, a Republican, got assigned a seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which went about the vetting of William Barr as the next U.S. attorney general.
Before defeating Democrat Claire McCaskill in the November general election, Hawley served as Missouri’s attorney general.
In his first round of questioning of Barr, the Missouri Republican focused on anti-trust laws, particularly in relation to technology companies, and a supposed counterintelligence investigation of President Trump by the FBI, reported over the weekend,.
“Do you think the Department of Justice has authority under the anti-trust laws or consumer protection laws or other laws to address bias by dominant online platforms?” Hawley asked.
Barr replied, “I would have to think long and hard before I said that it was really the stuff of an anti-trust matter.”
Hawley cited Google and Facebook as technology companies that pose regulatory challenges not just from a competition standpoint but for larger issues of privacy and the handling of information. He suggested the Federal Trade Commission has not applied meaningful consequences to firms running afoul of laws involving privacy rights or limiting competition.
“Obviously, competition is of central concern to the anti-trust division,” Barr said in response. “I would like to weigh into some of these issues. I would like to have anti-trust support that effort, to get more involved in reviewing the situation from a competition standpoint.”
Much of the early questioning by more senior Judiciary Committee members centered on Barr’s independence, particularly regarding special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The New York Times reported over the weekend that the FBI launched a secret investigation in May 2017 that focused on whether President Trump worked against American interests on behalf of Russia.
“Is it strange to have a counterintelligence investigation begun because members of that bureau disagree with the foreign policy stances of a candidate for president or a president of the United States?” Hawley asked.
Barr said, “Yes.”
Attorney general during the George H.W. Bush administration, Barr looks to be a shoo-in for confirmation by the Senate, which has a Republican majority. He would replace, on a full-time basis, Jeff Sessions, the former Alabama senator forced out of office by Trump in November.

Revise Size Of Budget Cuts

Texto completo: Congressional Republicans violated their own budget rules - which they had adopted at a time when they pretended to care about deficits - while passing the massive tax cut in December 2017. They did not “pay” for the revenue loss with other increased revenue or spending cuts, as required by the rule. Instead, they justified the cut with the time-worn and long-discredited notion that the cuts would pay for themselves through increased economic growth.
Now the numbers for the cut’s first year are in and, yet again, they disprove the theory that tax cuts pay for themselves.
The Congressional Budget Office has issued a report for the 2018 calendar year, showing that the cuts did indeed contribute to economic growth of about 3 percent. But, contrary to the tax cut sponsors’ promises, federal tax revenue declined by $83 billion from 2017, about 2.7 percent.
As reported by “Upshot” in The New York Times, the last time growth approached 3 percent, in 2015, federal tax revenue increased by 7 percent. Historically, growth periods have served to diminish the growth of annual deficits and the national debt, and to provide the government with flexibility to deal with recessions.
The Tax Foundation, which originally projected that the cuts would increase deficits by $450 billion over 10 years, now says that figure will be double, $900 billion.
Now that the numbers are in, Congress should drop the fiction and revise the size of the cuts to stop the bleeding.

Texto completo: Six award-winning and best-selling authors will travel to Des Moines this spring as part of the Des Moines Public Library's AViD author series in 2019.
The series, dubbed Authors Visiting in Des Moines, began in 2001 as a way to bring local and nationally-renowned authors to Des Moines.
"The idea was to provide our patrons with a way to see these national, accomplished authors for free without reservations or tickets," said Tim Paluch, Des Moines Public Library spokesman. "They can hear from these people on a more personal level."
The AViD series is funded by the library foundation and lasts throughout the spring. Each talk and book signing is scheduled for weeknights at 7 p.m. and attracts about 200-300 attendees.
"That's so (audience members) can just stop in without losing their weekend plans," Paluch said. "It expands horizons for some of our readers, and gives everyone a chance to see some accomplished literary icons."
For the 2019 lineup, organizers have taken special care to select authors who have written about topics relevant to current local and national issues such as economic inequality in the Midwest, Paluch said.
"This year's lineup is very exciting and interesting," Paluch said. "We have authors writing about raising a transgender child. C.J. Chivers wrote about the fighters and the effects of war on the combatants on the ground. We find not just good books, but books that provide engaging discussion and are relevant to Central Iowans and everybody."
Another author to note is Chigozie Obioma, a Nigerian-American, who wrote the acclaimed novel "The Fishermen." Obioma's latest book, "An Orchestra of Minorities," is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" and is set to release Jan. 8.
"Some might not know his name yet, but they're going to be seeing him in coming months," Paluch said.
Susan Orlean, author of "The Library Book" and "The Orchid Thief," will be the first author to visit Des Moines during the 2019 AViD series. AViD is sponsoring Orlean at the DSM Book Festival at 4 p.m. on March 30.
The other events will take place at the Des Moines Public Library Central Library at 7 p.m.
AViD series lineup:
March 30: Susan Orlean at the DSM Book Festival. She is the author of the critically-acclaimed 2018 best-seller "The Library Book," a love letter to libraries that doubles as a true crime exploration of the unsolved 1986 fire that damaged the Los Angeles Public Library. Orlean's 1998 nonfiction classic, "The Orchid Thief," was adapted into a feature film, "Adaptation."
April 18: Laurie Frankel. She's the author of the best-selling 2017 novel "This is How It Always Is," which tells the story of a family struggling with the challenges of raising a transgender child. The story is fiction, but the author is the mother of a transgender child herself. The book was chosen as a Reese Witherspoon Hello Sunshine Book Club pick in fall 2018.
April 22: Chigozie Obioma. The Nigerian-born author burst onto the literary scene in 2015 with his debut novel, "The Fishermen," which won multiple national and international awards — including an NAACP Image Award — and was a finalist for the prestigious Man Booker Prize. That same year he was named one of Foreign Policy's 100 Leading Global Thinkers. His much-anticipated second novel, "An Orchestra of Minorities" is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" written in the style of the Nigerian Igbo tradition.
May 2: Sarah Smarsh. Journalist, educator and author Sarah Smarsh's debut book, "Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth," was an instant best-seller upon release in 2018. It was a finalist for the Kirkus Prize and National Book Award. Heartland was named one of the best books of 2018 by NPR, Amazon, Audible, Publisher's Weekly and more. The book examines America's historic economic inequality and tells the story of her upbringing among the working poor of rural Kansas.
May 16: Madeline Miller. Madeline Miller's 2018 novel, "Circe," was a New York Times No. 1 best-seller and appeared on dozens of "Best Books of 2018" lists, including NPR, People, The Washington Post, Time, Entertainment Weekly, Buzzfeed, Book Riot and more. "Circe" was also named the Booklist 2018 Book of the Year. The novel, a retelling of the story of the villainous goddess Circe, recasts the infamous figure from "The Odyssey" into a feminist hero.
May 23: C.J. Chivers. Journalist C.J. Chivers is one of this generation's most revered war correspondents and a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner for The New York Times. His magazine story, "The Fighter," won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in feature writing. Chivers served as an infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps in the Persian Gulf War. In 2018, he released "The Fighters," a vivid account of modern warfare told through the stories of a half-dozen American combatants serving in the Middle East conflicts. The book explores the growing disconnect between military leaders making decisions and the men and women on the ground facing the dangerous consequences of those decisions.

Texto completo: Six award-winning and best-selling authors will travel to Des Moines this spring as part of the Des Moines Public Library's AViD author series in 2019.
The series, dubbed Authors Visiting in Des Moines, began in 2001 as a way to bring local and nationally-renowned authors to Des Moines.
"The idea was to provide our patrons with a way to see these national, accomplished authors for free without reservations or tickets," said Tim Paluch, Des Moines Public Library spokesman. "They can hear from these people on a more personal level."
The AViD series is funded by the library foundation and lasts throughout the spring. Each talk and book signing is scheduled for weeknights at 7 p.m. and attracts about 200-300 attendees.
"That's so (audience members) can just stop in without losing their weekend plans," Paluch said. "It expands horizons for some of our readers, and gives everyone a chance to see some accomplished literary icons."
For the 2019 lineup, organizers have taken special care to select authors who have written about topics relevant to current local and national issues such as economic inequality in the Midwest, Paluch said.
"This year's lineup is very exciting and interesting," Paluch said. "We have authors writing about raising a transgender child. C.J. Chivers wrote about the fighters and the effects of war on the combatants on the ground. We find not just good books, but books that provide engaging discussion and are relevant to Central Iowans and everybody."
Another author to note is Chigozie Obioma, a Nigerian-American, who wrote the acclaimed novel "The Fishermen." Obioma's latest book, "An Orchestra of Minorities," is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" and is set to release Jan. 8.
"Some might not know his name yet, but they're going to be seeing him in coming months," Paluch said.
Susan Orlean, author of "The Library Book" and "The Orchid Thief," will be the first author to visit Des Moines during the 2019 AViD series. AViD is sponsoring Orlean at the DSM Book Festival at 4 p.m. on March 30.
The other events will take place at the Des Moines Public Library Central Library at 7 p.m.
AViD series lineup:
March 30: Susan Orlean at the DSM Book Festival.

Republican Party has a racism problem, and it's not only Rep. Steve King

Texto completo: It seems the Republican Party is finally ready to admit that it has a racism problem. But contrary to what the GOP would have us believe, it's not just Rep. Steve King.
The problem is much deeper than that.
Elected officials like King certainly reinforce what many African-Americans already have concluded about the Republican Party.
In an interview with The New York Times, King reportedly wondered out loud, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?" It was just the latest in a long history of racist comments.
Republican leaders seemed appalled. Late Monday, House Republicans stripped King of all his committee assignments, though the move seems rather ceremonial since the GOP is no longer in the majority. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said there's no place in the Republican Party for such ideology.
Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican who is African-American, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post pointing out some of the terrible things white supremacists have done. And he added this:
"Some in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism -- it is because of our silence when things like this are said."
No, Sen. Scott, that's not why many African-Americans think the Republican Party is racist. It's because of the racist policies the GOP espouses. It will require a lot more than an apology or a sudden burst of consciousness to turn things around.
Let's just go down a list of the most obvious reasons African-Americans don't trust Republicans.
It's the GOP that's passing racist statewide voter identification laws in an attempt to keep African-Americans away from the polls. The GOP voted to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthy while proposing drastic cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other safety nets for the poor.
It's the GOP that looks at Pell Grants, student loans and Head Start programs as handouts, rather than steppingstones to a better life for African-American students.
It's the GOP that has voted over and over to repeal health care reforms that, for the first time in history, eliminated the inequity in uninsured rates for black children and white children.
It's the GOP that has attempted to take sole credit for reducing the unemployment rate for African-Americans when blacks know full well that the downward trend began under President Barack Obama. It's the GOP that has fought against police reforms, affirmative action and policies that protect consumers from predatory lending.
Without question, Republicans would love to have the African-American vote as they did in the aftermath of the Civil War. It would ensure that Democrats have a much tougher, perhaps impossible, chance of being elected to office.
Exit polls suggest that in the past 12 presidential elections, the Republican candidate garnered only about 10 percent of the black vote, while the Democrat averaged 87 percent.
But don't think for a minute that blacks are loyal to any party name. They are loyal to party policies. Republicans lost black support when they stopped being the party of Abraham Lincoln and became the party of Barry Goldwater in 1964.
Blacks immediately threw their support behind Democrat incumbent Lyndon Johnson, who had pushed through the Civil Rights Act, rather than Goldwater, his Republican challenger who opposed the law banning segregation in public places.
What troubles many Republicans, though, isn't the fact that its policies rarely, if ever, benefit African-Americans. It is that blacks aren't stupid enough to believe the halfhearted argument that they'd fare much better with Republicans than with Democrats.
Truthfully, most African-Americans don't think that Democrats are perfect, but when you put the two side by side, the choice is a no-brainer.
If you really want to talk about personalities, we can go there, too. Yes, Republicans gave us Sen. Hiram Revels, the first African-American to serve in Congress in 1870. But in 2016, Republicans gave us Donald Trump.
According to a poll conducted by The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 84 percent of blacks think Trump is a racist.
It is clear that the party that gave America Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation no longer exists. It is now the party of Trump and King and a disturbing number of white supremacists.

Memo to Trump: declare an emergency

Texto completo: In the long run, history will validate Donald Trump's stand on a border wall to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States.
Why? Because mass migration from the global South, not climate change, is the real existential crisis of the West.
The American people know this, and even the elites sense it.
Think not? Well, check out the leading liberal newspapers Thursday.
The Washington Post and The New York Times each had two front-page stories about the president's battle with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on funding the border wall.
Inside the first section, the Post had more stories, including one describing walls in history from China's Great Wall to the Berlin Wall to the Israeli West Bank wall to the wall separating Hungary from Serbia.
Inside the Times was a story on a new anti-immigration party, Vox, surging in Andalusia in Spain, and a story about African migrants being welcomed in Malta after being denied entry into Europe.
Half the columns on the op-ed pages of the papers dealt with Trump, immigration and the wall. And there was nothing significant in either on the Democrats' hot new issue, a Green New Deal.
Consider. In 1992, this writer's presidential campaign had to fight to have inserted in the GOP platform a call for "structures" on the border.
Now, the whole Western world is worried about its borders as issues of immigration and identity convulse almost every country.
Looking ahead, does anyone think Americans in 2030 are going to be more concerned about the border between North Korea and South Korea, or Turkey and Syria, or Kuwait and Iraq, or Russia and Ukraine, than about the 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico?
America's southern border is eventually going to be militarized and defended or the United States, as we have known it, is going to cease to exist. And Americans will not go gentle into that good night.
What should Trump do now? Act. He cannot lose this battle with Pelosi without demoralizing his people and imperiling his presidency.
Trump should declare a national emergency, shift funds out of the Pentagon, build his wall, open the government and charge Democrats with finding excuses not to secure our border because they have a demographic and ideological interest in changing the face of the nation.
For the larger the share of the U.S. population that requires welfare, the greater the need for more social workers, and the more voters there will be to vote to further grow the liberal welfare state.
The more multiracial, multiethnic, multicultural, multilingual America becomes -- the less it looks like Ronald Reagan's America -- the more dependably Democratic it will become.
The Democratic Party is hostile to white men, because the smaller the share of the U.S. population that white men become, the sooner that Democrats inherit the national estate.
The only way to greater "diversity," the golden calf of the Democratic Party, is to increase the number of women, African-Americans, Asians and Hispanics, and thereby reduce the number of white men.
The decisive issues on which Trump was elected were not the old Republican litany of tax cuts, conservative judges and increased defense spending. They were securing the borders, extricating America from foolish wars, eliminating trade deficits with NAFTA nations, the EU and China, making allies pay their fair share of the common defense, resurrecting our manufacturing base, and getting along with Russia.
"America First!" is still a winning hand.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has certainly surrounded himself with plenty of incompetent and ethically challenged people. But in William Barr, he has nominated someone with a track record of integrity and experience to be the next attorney general.
Such a person is badly needed at the Justice Department. Not only has Trump repeatedly debased law enforcement, his actions also have left many Americans thinking the unthinkable — that the president not only benefited from Russia's interference in the 2016 election but also is somehow beholden to its government.
No less than the FBI has entertained this thought. The New York Times reported Friday that the FBI started a counterintelligence inquiry in 2017 into whether Trump was — gulp! — acting as an agent of the Russian government.
SEN. WARNER: Barr’s nomination should be withdrawn
The outcome of that inquiry is unknown, and Trump denied on Monday that he ever worked on Russia's behalf. But he has given Americans plenty of reason for suspicion, including his odd obsequiousness toward Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, his confiscation of notes and records from his meetings with Putin, his real estate dealings with Russians, and his decision to pull U. S. troops out of Syria, leaving a vacuum for Russia and others to fill.
It is into this troubling context that Barr now drops as Trump's pick to become the nation’s top law enforcement official and overseer of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia inquiry. This would be Barr's second stint as attorney general, a position he ably held during the administration of President George H. W. Bush.
At the very least, Barr would represent a huge upgrade over acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who is wholly ill-suited for the job.
At the Senate confirmation hearings that begin Tuesday, Barr's first imperative must be an unequivocal defense of Mueller, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former FBI director whom Trump has attacked incessantly.
Barr states in prepared testimony that Mueller should be given a chance to finish his report, and that the report should be made public. This is a good start but is not sufficient. Mueller might plan further legal actions such as subpoenas, indictments and plea agreements. Barr needs to pledge that he would not interfere with those. He also needs to make abundantly clear that he would not fire Mueller.
Beyond these things, Barr needs to explain recent statements and writings defending the firing of former FBI Director James Comey and criticizing Mueller on the grounds that members of the special counsel's team made political contributions to Hillary Clinton.
While some Democrats have urged that his nomination be withdrawn, this is too extreme. Barr has done nothing to disqualify himself and deserves a chance to make his case.

Texto completo: Illinois trooper hit, killed by vehicle
CHICAGO - Illinois State Police say a trooper has been killed in a suburban Chicago accident in which the winter weather might have played a role.
The director told reporters Saturday that Christopher Lambert had gotten out of his squad car that afternoon responding to a three-vehicle crash when a car struck him.
Leo Schmitz said snowfall could have been a factor. The investigation is ongoing.
House GOP leader vows action against King
WASHINGTON - The U.S. House Republican leader said Sunday he will meet with Rep. Steve King this week to discuss King's future and role in the party and promised action following the Iowa congressman's recent comments in defense of white supremacy.
"That language has no place in America. That is not the America I know and it's most definitely not the party of Lincoln," said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy,
R-Calif., referring to President Abraham Lincoln. "Action will be taken."
King was quoted in The New York Times last week as saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King has insisted he is an advocate for "Western civilization," not white supremacy or white nationalism.
He said it was a "mistake" to use phrasing that "created an unnecessary controversy" and denied being racist.
Chicago mayor proposes ethics reforms
CHICAGO - Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is proposing far-reaching ethics reforms for the City Council in the wake of a federal attempted-extortion charge filed this month against a powerful alderman.
A Sunday statement from the mayor's office doesn't mention Ed Burke directly. But several suggested changes directly address City Council duties Burke allegedly manipulated to squeeze fast-food company executives.
Emanuel's proposals include requiring that aldermen fully explain why they'd want construction-related permits denied. Conflict-of-interest rules also would be tightened.
The City Council would have to approve the changes, which haven't yet been formally introduced.
Man accused in death of girl who spilled juice
WAUKEGAN, Ill. - Prosecutors will seek a life sentence for a suburban Chicago man accused of beating a 4-year-old girl to death after she spilled juice on an Xbox video console.
Prosecutors said "heinous" circumstances justify the sentence for 19-year-old Johnathan Fair, of Waukegan, if he is eventually convicted of first-degree murder in the death of his girlfriend's daughter, Skylar Mendez, the Chicago Tribune reported.
Fair was baby-sitting Skylar on Dec. 13 at a Waukegan apartment when she was fatally injured. He brought her to a hospital after she lost consciousness and initially claimed she had fallen. She died a few days later at a Chicago hospital following surgery doctors had hoped would relieve swelling of her brain, the Lake County State's Attorney's Office said.
Skylar's mother was not at home at the time of the alleged beating, Waukegan police have said.
Fair's attorney, Sam Amirante, told The Associated Press Sunday his client deserves the presumption of innocence accorded to anyone accused of a crime.
Fair remains jailed after bail was set at $5 million. His arraignment is scheduled for Feb. 17.
Confederate monument removed from Madison cemetery
MADISON, Wis. - Madison officials have removed a century-old Confederate monument from a cemetery and donated the marker to the Wisconsin Veterans Museum.
Madison Parks Superintendent Eric Knepp told the Wisconsin State Journal that the large, stone monument listing the names of buried Confederate soldiers was recently removed from Forest Hill Cemetery. The marker used to sit in a section of the cemetery known as Confederate Rest, but it's now being held in crates at the State Archive Preservation Facility.
"There are no current plans for its exhibition either now or in the near future," said Michael Telzrow, director of the Wisconsin Veterans Museum. "It's highly unlikely that it would ever be permanently displayed."
The museum accepted the monument from the city because of its connections to Union veterans from Wisconsin, Telzrow said. Some state veterans had helped raise money for the marker and a local fraternal organization for Union veterans participated in its dedication ceremony, he said.
The Madison City Council voted in April to remove the monument, which was donated by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and installed in 1906. Some council members argued that the United Daughters group is part of the "Lost Cause" movement, which paints the Confederate cause as heroic and minimizes the role of slavery in the Civil War.

Match-fixing remains issue after latest arrests

Texto completo: With the Grand Slam calendar set to begin Sunday with the Australian Open, tennis once again is dealing with allegations of match fixing at its lowest levels, a problem the sport cannot seem to shake.
Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, announced Thursday that the Spanish Civil Guard has arrested 83 people, including 28 professional tennis players, over their alleged involvement in fixing matches at Challenger and ITF Futures tournaments in Spain. Such events represent the second and third tiers of professional tennis, where unknown professional players toil at hundreds of barely noticed tournaments each year with hopes of acquiring the points needed to move up the rankings.
One of the arrested players took part in last year's U.S. Open, though Europol did not divulge any names.
"The suspects bribed professional players to guarantee predetermined results and used the identities of thousands of citizens to bet on the prearranged games," Europol said in a news release. "A criminal group of Armenian individuals used a professional tennis player, who acted as the link between the gang and the rest of the criminal group.
"Once they bribed the players, the Armenian network members attended the matches to ensure that the tennis players complied with what was previously agreed, and gave orders to other members of the group to go ahead with the bets placed at national and international level."
It's the second time in a little more than two years that law-enforcement officials have cracked down on match fixing on the Iberian peninsula. In December 2016, Spanish law enforcement officials detained 34 people, including six tennis players ranked between Nos. 800 and 1,200 in the world, alleging they were involved in a match-fixing network in Spain and Portugal. The players allegedly received about $1,000 per match for losing specific points or games in 17 Futures and Challenger tournaments in Spain.
Therein lies one of the reasons match-fixing is so prevalent at these lower-tier events: The prize money involved is often paltry, giving players an incentive to throw matches at tournaments in far-flung locales that few people are watching.
For instance, a 24-year-old Spaniard named David Perez Sanz won six titles on the ITF Futures Tour last year - five in Egypt and one in Sri Lanka - but took home less than $20,000 in tournament winnings for the year. For comparison's sake, Roger Federer received nearly $3 million alone for winning last year's Australian Open. Players who lost first-round matches at the U.S. Open received $50,000.
"You hear so many stories about other players getting approached," Laslo Urrutia Fuentes, an ITF Futures Tour player, told The New York Times last year. "They say when they are playing really weak players, someone says, 'Lose the first set and you will get $6,000.' "
According to an International Tennis Federation study cited by The New York Times last year, 6,000 of the 14,000 players who entered ITF Futures tournaments around the globe in 2013 didn't earn one cent of prize money. Only 336 men and 253 women out of the 14,000 broke even, when factoring in costs for travel and lodging.
"That's quite astonishing for a sport that has almost $300 million in prize money," Kris Dent, the ITF's senior executive director of professional tennis, told the Times. "These smaller tournaments have no TV, no sponsorships and no one paying any money to go see them, and they never will."
Last year, an Independent Review Panel - sanctioned by tennis's governing bodies - issued recommendations on tackling match fixing in a report that took more than two years to complete. One of the proposals was to reduce the number of pro players at the sport's lowest levels to ensure that prize money "is better targeted to enable more of the men and women taking part to make a living." This year, the ITF is doing just that by putting the top 750 men and women into the Challenger Tour, where the prize money and opportunity for advancement are greater. The rest will play in something called the Transition Tour, which will still offer a pathway to tennis's higher ranks while offering more localized tournaments, cutting down on travel costs.
One level up, the Challenger Tour will increase the size of its singles draws to 48 from 32, creating 2,400 more spots per year. Plus, all Challenger tournaments will be required to supply players with hotel accommodations.
The sheer number of events at tennis's lower levels also can fuel match fixing. Players enter as many tournaments as they can, but if the next event on the schedule both offers more lucrative spoils and overlaps with their current tournament, it may give them incentive to tank.
"This is a significant, recurring problem at the lower levels of the tennis when doubles competitions, which are often viewed by players as less important or valuable, conflict with a singles event in the following week," the Independent Review Panel report said. "Players on occasion perceive themselves as better off losing and moving on than seeking to stay in a competition, and some act on that perception."
The report also recommended beefing up the Tennis Integrity Unity, which was established by the sport's governing bodies in 2008 but has been criticized as understaffed and ill-equipped to deal with the modern methods of match fixing. In 2018, the TIU sanctioned 21 people for offenses such as match fixing, failing to report corruption and refusing to cooperate with its investigations, banning eight players and officials from the sport for life. Most of the sanctioned players had career-high rankings in the triple digits.
Even with reform, the rise of online gambling and the very nature of the sport make it ripe for match-fixing.
"The nature of the game lends itself to manipulation for betting purposes," the Independent Review Panel report said. "There are many contingencies. There is only one player who must act. Detection is difficult, not least because at many lower level matches there are no spectators and inadequate facilities to protect players from potential corrupters. Moreover, underperformance is often attributed to 'tanking,' which too often has been tolerated."

Has the Democratic Party moved beyond Bernie Sanders?

Texto completo: Has the fire Berned out?
Yes, supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders are hosting house parties and signing petitions this month to show the Vermont independent that his loyal followers are still feeling the Bern and want him to run for president again in 2020.
But as Sanders weighs another campaign, some say that even as he has moved the Democratic Party ideologically — pushing issues such as Medicare for all, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage into the mainstream — the party has moved past him personally.
“I don't see a lot of lasting energy for Bernie," said Markos Moulitsas, the founder and publisher of Daily Kos.
The popular liberal website published an online poll last week of 35,000 users showing Sanders fifth and Senator Elizabeth Warren first among potential 2020 contenders. That was a shift from 2016, when Sanders was the consistent favorite in head-to-head matchups with Hillary Clinton.
“It's different from last time when he was the alternative to an unfortunately flawed front-runner, and there were just two of them," Moulitsas said. “Right now, the mantle of 'progressive' can be carried by any number of candidates and potential candidates," including Senator Kamala Harris and former representative Beto O'Rourke.
With Sanders, Moulitsas said, “people have mostly moved on."
Jonathan Tasini, a 2016 Sanders campaign surrogate who wrote the book “The Essential Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America," said the senator should consider backing a nationwide slate of left-wing candidates in 2020, rather than running for the White House.
“I'm torn . . . because I was in the midst of the campaign with Bernie, but I think the people who look at that campaign need to understand the context is different," Tasini said, noting that strong progressives such as Senator Sherrod Brown are eyeing presidential campaigns.
“The danger for Bernie running as a candidate: If he loses in the nomination process, what does that do to his movement and the message he's delivering?" Tasini said. “I think there's a strong case to be argued that him running not as a candidate but leading a slate of progressives at every level will have a much more lasting impact on the country and the progressive movement."
Will Bunch, a columnist for the Philadelphia Daily News who was so electrified by Sanders in 2016 that he wrote a book about the campaign, made a similar point in his column on Sunday. Sanders should head into 2020, Bunch wrote, as “the spiritual and intellectual leader of the movement that he's built over a half-century, not as an Oval Office hopeful."
Others argue the party should nominate a younger candidate, a woman, or a person of color, given the energy that nonwhite voters and women exerted in the midterms. Sanders would be 79 years old in 2020.
“We have got to have diversity in that ticket because the Democratic Party is a diverse coalition," said Kathy Sullivan, a Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire, who backed Clinton in the 2016 primary. “I don't think we can have two white guys representing us on the ticket."
Other party leaders say they are looking for the candidate who stands the best chance of defeating President Trump, not the one with the strongest progressive policy positions.
“It's important to have issues, but I think they pale in terms of what's in front of us," said Bill Shaheen, a Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire who also backed Clinton in the 2016 primary. “Free college tuition means nothing to a guy like Trump. It's never going to happen. So that's the No. 1 issue: taking Trump out."
Sanders's supporters say it is precisely because of his deeply held convictions — in support of universal government-funded health care and other policies to help the working class — that the senator stands the best chance of ousting Trump.
“We don't have the luxury to afford another person who is all talk," said Nichole Mossalam, a Sanders supporter and mother of three who filed for bankruptcy due to medical debt when she was 22, and whose husband is still paying off his student loans.
“That's why I'm excited about Bernie," said Mossalam, director of the Islamic Cultural Center of Medford. “Don't give me fluff. Give me substance."
Sanders's supporters are hoping that hundreds of house parties they hosted last weekend, sponsored by a group called Organizing for Bernie, will help draw him into the race. Another Sanders-aligned group, Our Revolution, sent an e-mail to its members last week urging them to sign a petition to send a message “loud and clear: Run, Bernie, Run!"
The efforts to rally support come amid reports in The New York Times and Politico from some women who say they faced sexual harassment and sexism in Sanders's 2016 campaign. Sanders has apologized twice, calling the mistreatment “absolutely unacceptable." On Wednesday, he plans to meet with the former staffers to address their concerns, the Times reported.
Mark Longabaugh, a senior Sanders adviser, said Sanders remains a vital figure in the progressive movement, closer to the activist base than the Democratic elite.
He pointed out that the senator is backing the “Green New Deal," an ambitious plan to combat climate change that has galvanized progressive activists, thanks in part to support from Sanders's star acolyte, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
He also pointed out that Sanders remains very popular with millennials and won that demographic by huge margins in the 2016 primary.
“I still think he has his fingers on the pulse of the party and the future of the party, because that's literally the future of the party," Longabaugh said.
And many of Sanders's followers remain as dedicated as ever.
Shannon O'Toole, a 59-year-old disabled veteran from Lee, N.H., said she is just waiting for Sanders to announce, as are her friends in the military who serve overseas.
She already has an ample collection of Sanders gear ready to go, including T-shirts, bumper stickers, pins, and a yellow vest on which she wrote “Bernie 2020," in a nod to the Yellow Vest protests against the French government.
“The world wants Bernie," she said. “The world is waiting."

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.

Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.

Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: Congressional Democrats Sunday pledged heightened scrutiny of President Donald Trump's dealings with Russia, spurred by news reports of extraordinary secrecy surrounding his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the opening in 2017 of an FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump worked on behalf of the Kremlin.
Trump's Republican allies in Congress and his administration defended him, impugning the motives of federal investigators, insisting the White House had been tough on Russia, and denouncing as "ludicrous" any suggestion that Trump had been compromised by Moscow.
The intensifying Russia-related furor coincides with a partial government shutdown that pushed over the weekend into a record-breaking fourth week. More than three-quarters of a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay. They missed their first paychecks of 2019 last week.
There was little sign of any imminent breakthrough in ending the shutdown, whose effects are being more broadly felt with each passing week.
Trump spent Sunday morning demanding on Twitter that Congress allocate funds for building a wall on the border with Mexico, a project Democrats vehemently oppose.
Trump called into a conservative talk show on Saturday to denounce a New York Times report that in 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was acting as an agent for Russia.
Asked on Fox News whether he had ever "worked for Russia," Trump fumed, but did not take the opportunity to directly respond to the query.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked -- I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written," he said.
On Sunday news shows, several leading congressional Democrats expressed deepening concerns over Trump and Russia, after the New York Times report and a Washington Post story about Trump's efforts to conceal what was said in meetings with Putin over the last two years.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said on "Fox News Sunday" that word of a counterintelligence investigation was "alarming," and that it showed the need for the wide-ranging Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller to proceed unimpeded.
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that opening a counterintelligence investigation on a sitting president shows the FBI must have had a "very deep level of concern."
With a new Democratic majority in the House, freshly anointed committee chairmen are pledging to use their expanded powers to look into Trump and Russia, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and sensitive documents.
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., who now heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his panel would hold hearings about what he called Trump's "bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies."
In a statement issued Saturday night, Engel suggested that secrecy about what was said when Trump met with the Russian leader -- to the extent of keeping his national security team in the dark -- was of paramount concern.
"Every time Trump meets with Putin, the country is told nothing," Engel said. "America deserves the truth, and the Foreign Affairs Committee will seek to get to the bottom of it."
Republican allies of the president said the acts of concealment described by the Post, including Trump's demand that an interpreter hand over the U.S. side's only notes of a private meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, were well within his authority.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said on CNN's "State of the Union" that "this is not a traditional president."
"He has unorthodox means," Johnson said. "But he is president of the United States. It's pretty much up to him in terms of who he wants to read in to his conversations with world leaders."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats had been stymied in previous efforts to learn what was said between Trump and Putin during a summit last year in Helsinki, Finland -- but signaled that was about to change.
"Last year, we sought to obtain the interpreter's notes or testimony, from the private meeting between Trump and Putin," he said in a statement. "The Republicans on our committee voted us down. Will they join us now?"
Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, said, "Shouldn't we find out whether our president is really putting 'America first?' "

Texto completo: 'STATEN' STATIC  A Change.org petition to cancel MTV's "Made in Staten Island" or to remove the borough's name from the title has garnered more than 7,500 signatures toward a goal of 10,000. Petitioner Joseph Maniscalco, who launched the campaign on Jan. 6, says the program is unfairly "built on the premise that kids from Staten Island all grow up surrounded by the [M]afia in their lives."The show premieres Monday at 10 p.m.
The petition echoes comments by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who tweeted, "Anyone who has spent any time on Staten Island knows MTV is peddling stereotypes in a shameless ratings grab." Joseph C. Borelli, a city councilmember from the borough, told The New York Times on Saturday, "We've been stereotyped before but now they are playing this stereotype out among kids and glorifying a life of crime," adding that the show was "stereotyping Italian-Americans on Staten Island."
An executive producer, Karen Gravano -- daughter of mob hit man turned government informant Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano -- did not address the stereotyping criticism, instead telling the Times the show does not promote crime. "I'm not out here asking kids to commit crime to be on a reality show," she said.
PREMIERES  After a more than year-long break, "Teen Mom 2" returns to MTV for season nine, Monday at 9 p.m. -- though now that it's eight years on for most of the cast, "teen" may no longer be entirely accurate ... then Tuesday at 10 p.m., returning after 18 years, is the rebooted singles paradise of "Temptation Island," shifting from Fox to USA but with the same ol' host, Mark Walberg ("Antiques Roadshow") ... Thursday, Bravo gives us "Backyard Envy" at 10 p.m., with the high-end landscaping firm the Manscapers (which notwithstanding includes a woman) ... and on Sunday, it's a full night of polygamy on TLC, with the Brown family of "Sister Wives" season nine in a two-hour premiere at 8 p.m., immediately followed at 10 by season two of "Seeking Sister Wife," following three plural families, including an African-American couple seeking a second wife.
RECAPS  "America's Got Talent" season 13, an all-star edition, kicked off with Singer Susan Boyle receiving a Golden Buzzer to the finals and standup comic Preacher Lawson continuing on to the next round ... Adrianne "Jane" Aver, Revian Chang, Devin Gooden, Tahzjuan Hawkins, Erin Landry and Laura Pellerito are the first six women ousted by Colton Underwood from "The Bachelor" season 23 ... "Hell's Kitchen" kicked out Trevor McGrath ... Brother Luck returned from a previous season after winning the Last Chance Kitchen, but then was immediately eliminated ... and no one was sent home from "RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars."

Ted Cruz on Steve King's white supremacist comments: 'He needs to stop it'

Texto completo: Sen. Ted Cruz on Sunday joined a growing chorus of GOP lawmakers and other party officials in condemning comments from Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa in support of white nationalism.

"What Steve King said was stupid. It was stupid, it was hurtful, it was wrong. And he needs to stop it," the Texas Republican told NBC's "Meet the Press."

In a recent interview with the New York Times, King -- who served as the national co-chair for Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign -- questioned why words like "white nationalist" are now considered racist.

"How did that language become offensive?" he told the outlet. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"

In a statement issued after the report was published, King rejected the suggestion he is an advocate for white nationalism. He later apologized on the House floor.

Alongside Cruz, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only African-American Republican in the chamber, wrote in a recent op-ed that opinions like King's "damage not only the Republican Party and the conservative brand but also our nation as a whole.”

“Some in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism—it is because of our silence when things like this are said," he wrote.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said King's comments have "no place in our society," while Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming labeled them "abhorrent and racist."

Amid the backlash, King this week drew a Republican primary opponent. Although the National Republican Congressional Committee pledged to not oppose King, the group also said it would not intervene in the race.

While Democrats are considering trying to censure King over his comments, House Republican are unlikely to support the motion.

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
The president's firing of the FBI director prompted the inquiry.

Texto completo: As a percentage of its population, Iowa sent more troops to fight in the Civil War than any other state. Iowans fought on the side of the Union against the Confederate South. Abraham Lincoln, president of the United States and the commander in chief of Union forces, was the first Republican president.
So it seems odd (to me, at least) that a Republican congressman from Iowa would display a Confederate flag on his desk. But that's what Rep. Steve King did as recently as 2016. (He removed it only after it was revealed that a cop killer had waved a Confederate flag at an Iowa high school football game.)
I'm not one of those people who thinks everyone who displays a Confederate flag is necessarily a racist or a bigot. But I usually reserve the benefit of the doubt for actual Southerners who are nodding to tradition or nostalgia.
If there's one thing King has not earned it's the benefit of the doubt. Even accounting for an IQ that seems to be in conflict with the idea that white people are superior, the man understands what he's up to.
In an interview with The New York Times published Thursday, King asked: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive? Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?" The obvious answer is because he needed an education - and still does.
At the 2016 Republican National Convention, King responded to the suggestion that the GOP needs to appeal to Americans other than old white people: "I'd ask you to go back through history and figure out, where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you're talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?"
Contrary to the prattle of white nationalists and supremacists (and, interestingly, various left-wing theorists and black nationalists), Western civilization is not synonymous with whiteness. Many of the people King would count as white today were not considered white by various giants of American white nationalism and white supremacy. Czechs, Hungarians, Poles, Italians, Greeks et al. weren't "whites" at the beginning of the 20th century, when the Steve Kings of that era were terrified of non-white immigrants.
In 1911, the joint congressional Immigration Commission completed a 41-volume report that included the Dictionary of Races or Peoples, a pseudoscientific grab bag containing "a motley compendium of ethnic stereotypes, skin complexion, head shape, and other hardy perennials of the race science literature," according to Princeton historian Thomas Leonard in his vital book "Illiberal Reformers."
In fairness, "white" wasn't a term of art back then, so white supremacists were actually Aryan or Nordic or English (not Irish!) supremacists. But you get the point.
Then there's the notion that non-whites haven't made worthy contributions to civilization. Leave aside that by not counting Italians (sorry, Galileo and Da Vinci!), East Europeans (sucks for you, Copernicus!) or Jews (Einstein? Good riddance) as white, you're bequeathing many of the glories of civilization to non-whites. But even with the most expansive definition of "white" possible, how do we account for the fact that Chinese, Ottoman and Arab societies were leaps and bounds ahead of Europe for centuries? The Chinese invented the compass, paper, movable type, mechanical clocks, iron smelting and countless other innovations when "white" Europe was a barbaric backwater.
And let's not forget that Christianity is a cultural import from that great melting pot that was the Middle East.
One is reminded of Benjamin Disraeli's famous retort to an Irish Catholic parliamentarian's anti-Semitic attack on his heritage: "Yes, I am a Jew, and when the ancestors of the right honorable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island, mine were priests in the temple of Solomon."
But this is the wrong way to respond to King's bigotry. Among the best ideas and ideals of Western, Christian and, most importantly, American civilization is that we are supposed to judge people on their individual merits, not keep score based on their ancestry.
This vision was central to the creation of the Republican Party, which is why it's so dismaying that Rep. King calls himself one.

Texto completo: Nobel Prize-winning scientist James Watson has been stripped of his honorary titles at the laboratory he once led after doubling down on racist comments.
Watson, who discovered DNA’s double helix structure alongside Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin in the 1950s, said that genes cause a difference on IQ tests between blacks and whites in a recent PBS documentary "American Masters: Decoding Watson. "
The leaders of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island said his comments were “reprehensible, unsupported by science,” in a statement.
This isn't Watson’s first controversial comment about race. He lost his position as chancellor at the lab in 2007 after he told the Sunday Times he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa" because "all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says not really. "
He added that although he wished everyone were equal, “people who have to deal with black employees find this not true. ”
His comments in the documentary “effectively reverse the written apology and retraction Dr. Watson made in 2007,” the lab’s statement read. As a result, the lab stripped him of his titles of Chancellor Emeritus, Oliver R. Grace Professor Emeritus and Honorary Trustee.
Watson became the first person to sell his Nobel Prize in 2014 as part of an attempt to restore his reputation, the New York Times reported.
His son Rufus told The Associated Press that his 90-year-old father is recovering at home from a car crash in October and has “very minimal” awareness of his surroundings.
“My dad’s statements might make him out to be a bigot and discriminatory,” he said. "They just represent his rather narrow interpretation of genetic destiny. ”

News industry needs to promote female leaders

Texto completo: When producer Susan Zirinsky was tapped as the new president of beleaguered CBS News, the media industry cheered.
"I was doing the happy dance. ... She is a badass in every sense of the word," announced a gleeful Gayle King on CBS This Morning. NPR heralded her as "legendary," while TheCut.com celebrated her as "a media icon." The New York Times reported that staffers greeted her with a "roaring ovation."
Here's my question: What took so long?
Zirinsky, the first woman ever to head up CBS News, is 66 years old. She has been working at the network for 46 years – which means she started a year before the executive she's replacing, David Rhodes, was born.
While it's great news that CBS finally chose a woman, I'm frankly bewildered by why she wasn't handed the reins long ago. Or why none of the other immensely talented women at the network were given a shot. Why was it only after CBS lost three of its male stars to allegations of sexual harassment – including corporate CEO Les Moonves, anchor Charlie Rose and "60 Minutes" head Jeff Fager – that it finally elevated a woman?
The news industry, for all of its admirable reporting on the #MeToo allegations that felled these and other men, has been woefully lacking in female leadership.
The Times has had a single female leader in its 167-year history; The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal are at zero. Television is no better. Zirinsky told The Times that she had never sought the job before, though it had been offered. NBC News and Fox News have each had one female news leader, with Fox's Suzanne Scott named recently after the network's own #MeToo scandals. (USA TODAY has had three female top editors, including myself and current Editor in Chief Nicole Carroll).
The industry's overwhelmingly male leadership has repercussions well beyond the newsroom. It infects what we believe is important, which issues we dismiss as trivial, and whom we consider authoritative.
How does that play out? Just one example: Think about how you first learned, four or so years ago, that Bill Cosby had allegedly drugged and sexually abused dozens of women. Most likely you saw it in a tabloid, or heard about it from late-night comics. Yes, there was some serious reporting on the case, but for the most part it was considered a salacious diversion from "real" news. It wasn't until the Harvey Weinstein allegations several years later that the #MeToo movement exploded, and the news media belatedly realized that sexual harassment is a systemic problem infecting society.
In short, we in the news media blew it. Cosby, like Weinstein, was a symptom of a far larger societal crisis impacting millions of women. We should have known better – and perhaps with a few more women in news leadership roles, we would have.
It's a heavy burden to expect that Zirinsky, or any one newsroom leader of any gender, can correct all of these ills. But another piece of research gives us a hint of what Zirinsky is up against. It turns out that women are far more likely to get the top job when an organization is in "precarious" shape – and if they can't turn it around they are marched right off the dreaded "glass cliff," a phrase coined by University of Exeter researchers Michelle K. Ryan and S. Alexander Haslam.
There is a solution to this, and a fairly straightforward one: Bring more women into news leadership. Identify promising women in media. Develop them. Promote them. And recognize when they have earned the right to ascend to the top job.

I'm Furloughed. Should I Take Up Pole Dancing?

Texto completo: Monday, Jan. 7
5:30 a.m.
It's the first full day I am furloughed, but I'm not sleeping in. My wife goes to a hot yoga class on Monday and she gets up at 5:30 a.m. to get there on time. I get up then, too, because she needs every light on.
6:43 a.m.
The kids are awake and I'm getting them ready for school. I have to dress the 5-year-old in his school uniform; help the 7-year-old find his school pullover -- "not sweatshirt!"; there's a big difference -- and keep the 3-year-old from destroying whatever she comes into contact with.
Usually I'm getting myself dressed, too. This morning, we're discussing what type of language is appropriate to use at school when the 7-year-old asks, "Where's your uniform, Daddy?" I tell him that I don't have to wear it today, because I'm off work.
"Is this like when you had jury duty?" he asks. I tell him this is different.
"Are you fired?"
"No, I'm furloughed," I say.
"That's a new F-word!" he says.
10:17 a.m.
I work at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, on the telecommunications support staff. Some of us from work are in a group chat together. Usually, we talk about sports and current events. Today, we are the current event.
"Don't watch the news," someone says. We share advice on how to stay afloat while we're not getting paid. Someone explains how to contact the mortgage company and request a month's reprieve without incurring penalties; someone else describes how to contact utility companies.
I chime in to say that I am watching a "Sopranos" marathon on HBO. I should be cleaning out the gutters, but instead I'm clearing out the DVR.
Another co-worker says that I should cut the cord and get rid of cable. Well, I have some time to explore that option.
Tuesday, Jan. 8
8 a.m.
School drop-off is a success. I run to the grocery store afterward and pick up juice, pull-up diapers and fruit. I'm in and out and back home in 30 minutes -- faster than it ever is. But usually I'm not grocery shopping at 8 a.m. on a Tuesday, I'm on my way to work. Traffic in D.C. always drops during the holidays, and returns full force the second week of January. Not this year.
10 a.m.
A few of my neighbors ask if I'm affected by the shutdown. I say not yet. I'm off work, but my pockets are O.K. for now. Most of the museum staff is furloughed like me. But skeleton crews are still at work, some unpaid.
The Matisse cutouts still have to be rotated in and out of light; the Van Gogh has to be guarded.
We call the people doing this work "the Essentials." That would be a great name for a band, I think. I imagine seeing that on iTunes. Then I think that if this goes on for much longer, I'll cancel my Apple Music subscription.
The first week of the shutdown, when we were still open, the museum got a call from someone who had tickets to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture that had been bought months in advance. The caller had Grandma come up from Georgia to see it, but the museum was closed when they arrived. The caller was glad that the National Gallery was open and had an exhibition of photographs by Gordon Parks to enjoy.
The gallery was closed the next day.
10:30 p.m.
President Trump gave a speech on television saying that the shutdown is all about the "wall." I remember that last month he tweeted that "most of the people not getting paid are Democrats." When I heard that, I thought about how many of the federal workers in Washington are African-American, which I think might be how the president meant it to sound. Funny, we tend to see ourselves as American citizens who have a right to pursue happiness -- which is kind of hard to do without a steady income.
Wednesday, Jan. 9
6:30 a.m.
My wife, Tracie, is getting ready to go to her job as a massage therapist. She started her business during the recession, when I was laid off from a nongovernment job. She usually works four days a week, but is adding extra hours during the furlough and thinking about adding an extra day.
11 a.m.
I pick up my mom and take her to get some medication. Her senior center had a field trip to the National Gallery scheduled for Monday. Now, of course, it's canceled. Since there are no other free museums open, the whole outing is off. It's probably for the best, my mom says. Another trip to the casino instead isn't great for the group's savings.
2 p.m.
I'm making decent progress on the DVR -- 70 hours left. That's a lot of TV. It probably is time to cut the cord.
8:10 p.m.
On stage at a comedy show, I talk about the furlough. Some of the audience is off work too. I say that I'm looking for a job that the president won't shut down. What should I do?
Pole dancing is suggested. No one really wants to see that, I say. A woman in front says that she does it and I ask if she's hiring. It's Saturday energy on a Wednesday.
Thursday, Jan. 10
10 a.m.
After school drop-off, my wife and I have to check out a possible day care center for our youngest. We like the place and fill out the forms. We may be able to qualify for financial help while I'm out on furlough. I'd much rather be at work earning my keep, but to be honest the assistance would be nice.
11:43 a.m.
"Are we getting a paycheck?" That's the talk on group chat today. It's close to payday, so close to when we'll really be noticing what the furlough costs. I don't follow the advice to avoid the news, and I see the president walked out of a meeting with Democrats. It doesn't seem as if we're any closer to ending this. And we're on track to break the shutdown record.
10:30 p.m.
My wife and I start watching a show on Hulu and we decide we're going to cancel it soon. We're thankful that we're this fortunate -- that the first things we need to give up are Hulu and Apple Music.
Friday, Jan. 11
7:25 a.m.
The 7-year-old asks if I want to go back to work.
I tell him that I do very much want to go back to work.
"Good," he says.
"Why?"
"Because I like to visit," he says.

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey tweeted out a single quote from former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt Saturday in response to tweets from President Trump about Comey's firing and the reports of an investigation into Trump as a possible Russian agent.

"I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made," Comey tweeted, attributing to FDR.

Trump called Comey a "total sleaze" Saturday in a series of tweets where Trump claimed that no other president has been as tough on Russia as he. Trump's statements come after the New York Times reported that Trump was secretly investigated by the FBI following Comey's firing on the suspicion that Trump may have been working for Russia, a counterintelligence investigation that has since been taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller's.

Trump had used the same quote without context in a November 2012 tweet.

The tweet from Comey was only his second of the new year, following a Jan. 2 tweet where he said that the "Republican tent was too small to fit integrity."

"Republicans attacked a Senator for truthfully calling out the President for his lack of character, while staying mute as he proved it by lying about Jim Mattis and approving the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan," Comey wrote.

Comey has been a vocal critic of Trump's since his firing and has said that Trump lacked an "external ethical framework."

The 32nd President of the United States, a Democrat, used the quote in his September 1932 speech in Portland, Ore., known as the Portland Speech, in regards to the federalization of public utilities.

Texto completo: Q. Where I live they have been changing the crosswalk buttons to these fancy new ones that beep, flash and talk to you. Why are all of the voices men’s voices? Isn’t this the age of equality?
– Patrick Shane, North Tustin
A. Patrick lives in unincorporated county territory, near the city of Tustin. After getting some specifics on the traffic signals, he and Honk agreed the city would be best to ask, as at least some of these new-school devices are in Tustin.
Krys Saldivar , the manager of the Tustin’s Public Works Department, said the city is upgrading all of its pedestrian push buttons tied to traffic signals, with about 40 percent having these newer devices.
“Those who are blind will be able to hear where they are crossing and when to cross, and those who are deaf will feel the vibration when it is safe to cross,” she told Honk in an email. “The first ones that have been installed in the city were actually programmed by the manufacturer.”
That would be Polara, a Texas-based company.
Its president, John McGaffey , said if a city asks, Polara can provide a female voice; it has done so before. But it generally uses a male voice.
“In controlled studies using … accessible pedestrian signals, the majority of the visually impaired participants said they were able to hear a male voice better because it has greater low-range frequencies (under 800 Hz), which people can tend to hear, even with some hearing loss. We also try to keep the voice consistent so the messages sound similar, no matter where you are in the United States.”
Q. My license expires on my birthday in June. Should I go ahead and make an appointment with the Department of Motor Vehicles now because of the crowded DMV offices, with the popularity of the REAL ID? Or should I wait until they send me a notice? It’s very confusing! Thank you!
– Linda Wells, Mission Viejo
A. DMV officials and Honk readers have told the wise one, that would be Honk, that wait times have gone way down since the mess in the summer.
Still, appointments are the way to go if you must go into an office to renew your license (Typically every 15 years until you hit age 70, then every five years).
“She can make an appointment before she receives her renewal notice,” Marty Greenstein , a DMV spokesman up in Sacramento, said via email. “In fact, that’s something we encourage. If you know your license is going to expire in a few months, go ahead and make your appointment. We started sending out renewal notices 90 days in advance this summer (up from 60) to give people more time.”
The DMV takes appointments for several months out. Linda noticed that the two DMV offices near her home were completely booked. What about that?
“Appointment availability can change on a daily basis as offices perform daily assessments, or spots open when an appointment is canceled,” Greenstein said.
So keep trying, Linda.
But don’t go too early to a DMV office to renew, or you will be required to take what used to be called a “written” test and is now a “knowledge” test (it is usually done on a touchscreen these days) even if you weren’t scheduled for one. The DMV reasons that if you renew real early, then you are shortening up the time it has to monitor your track record out there on the roads, so the test is meant to ensure you are a safe motorist.
“In instances when a knowledge test is not required, coming in at any time during that 90-day window before your license expires should not trigger that requirement,” Greenstein added.
Honkin’ cool: A dad didn’t want his daughter to be alone on Christmas, so Hal Vaughan took six flights over three days to be with her. Pierce Vaughan is a rookie flight attendant for Delta Air Lines, and Dad shadowed her, able to jump on standby for free, a perk of his daughter’s job. A passenger heard about the journey, put it on Facebook and the cute story went viral. The trip: New Orleans; Detroit; Fort Myers, Fla.; Detroit; Hartford, Conn.; Atlanta; and back to New Orleans (Source: The New York Times).

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Law enforcement officials became so concerned by President Donald Trump's behavior in the days after he fired FBI Director James Comey that they began investigating whether he had been working for Russia against U.S. interests, The New York Times reported Friday.
The report cites unnamed former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
The inquiry forced counterintelligence investigators to evaluate whether Trump was a potential threat to national security, and they also sought to determine whether Trump was deliberately working for Russia or had unintentionally been influenced by Moscow.
The Times reports that FBI agents and some top officials became suspicious of Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign but didn't launch an investigation at that time because they weren't sure how to approach such a sensitive and important probe, according to the sources. But Trump's behavior in the days around Comey's May 2017 firing, specifically two instances in which he seemed to tie Comey's ousting to the Russia investigation, helped trigger the counterintelligence part of the investigation.
Robert Mueller took over the investigation when he was appointed special counsel soon after Comey's firing. The overall investigation is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russians. The Times says it's unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence angle.
Mexico deploys 4,000 troops, copters against pipeline theft
MEXICO CITY - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Friday he has ordered helicopters and 4,000 troops to guard the nation's pipelines and fuel depots in an offensive against massive fuel theft.
The helicopters are watching for organized gangs that drill illegal taps into underground ducts carrying gasoline and diesel. Lopez Obrador ordered key pipelines shut down after thefts soared recently.
Long lines continued at gas stations in Mexico City and outlying states Friday as tanker trucks struggled to supply fuel normally delivered through pipelines.
Most Mexicans understood the need to crack down on $3 billion per year in fuel thefts, but patience was wearing thin.
"We are asking for people's understanding," Lopez Obrador said.
Rookie California cop is shot, killed in ambush at crash scene
DAVIS, Calif. - A 22-year-old police officer on the job only a few weeks was shot and killed by a suspect who opened fire as she was investigating a three-car crash, authorities in Northern California said.
The suspect, who has not been identified, was later found dead inside a home with a self-inflicted gunshot wound following a short standoff with officers, the Davis Police Department said Friday.
Police said Officer Natalie Corona was ambushed by a gunman on a bicycle shot after responding alone to a traffic accident Thursday evening in the city west of Sacramento.
One of the drivers in the crash, Christian Pascual, 25, told the Sacramento Bee that the shooter appeared to have been a bystander who fired from behind him.
Woman sought in death of
Nev. manicurist found in Ariz.
LAS VEGAS - A 21-year-old woman sought for almost two weeks by authorities in Las Vegas after allegedly skipping out on a $35 manicure and using a stolen car to run over and kill a manicurist has been arrested in Arizona, police said Friday.
Krystal Whipple was taken into custody in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, authorities said.
Las Vegas police said prosecutors will seek her extradition to Las Vegas where Whipple was sought in a warrant on murder and robbery charges in the killing of Ngoc Nguyen, 51.
Police said Whipple tried to pay for her manicure with a fraudulent credit card Dec. 29 before telling Nguyen that she was going to her car to get cash, then drove away, killing Nguyen as she stood in front of of the vehicle as it accelerated.
In Europe, 21 deaths deemed weather-related
BELGRADE, Serbia - Heavy snow paralyzed much of Europe for yet another day, cutting off mountain villages, sparking avalanches like one that crashed into a Swiss hotel and killing at least four more people Friday.
Workers at the Hotel Saentis in eastern Switzerland spent Friday shoveling out hip-deep snow after a 330-yard-wide avalanche smashed through the hotel's windows Thursday.
In all, at least 21 weather-related deaths have been reported in Europe in the last 10 days.
The Bulgarian Red Cross said two snowboarders were killed in an avalanche in southwest Bulgaria's Pirin Mountains.
A snowplow driver died Friday in Germany after his vehicle toppled into an icy river, while an electrical worker in Albania suffered a fatal heart attack while repairing damaged power lines.
Court says Ginsburg has no cancer remaining
WASHINGTON - Tests revealed that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has no additional cancer following her surgery in December, and no further treatment is needed, the Supreme Court announced Friday.
"Justice Ginsburg will continue to work from home next week and will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts of oral arguments," court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said in a statement.
Ginsburg had surgery Dec. 21 for two malignant nodules in her left lung, the 85-year-old justice's third bout with cancer.
This week, for the first time since she joined the court in 1993, she missed a round of oral arguments. Ginsburg is the oldest member of the court, and the longest-serving member of the court's four-member liberal wing.
Saudi woman: Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, who said she was abused by her family and feared for her life if deported back home to Saudi Arabia, left Thailand on Friday night for Canada, which has granted her asylum, officials said.

Hat in the ring: Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has announced that she is running for president in 2020.
Gabbard, a 37-year-old Iraq War veteran and the first Hindu elected to Congress, said in a CNN interview slated to air Saturday night that she will formally announce her candidacy next week.

Iowa should reform cosmetology laws

Texto completo: A recent New York Times investigation underscores what the Des Moines Register editorial board has been saying for years: Attending an Iowa cosmetology school may be a huge and expensive mistake.
The Times interviewed Tracy Lozana, who borrowed $21,000 to cover tuition and supplies at a beauty school near Des Moines. After graduating and obtaining the required state license to legally cut hair in this state, the young mother got a job at Great Clips, where she earned $9 per hour.
Thirteen years later — after also working at Pizza Hut and relying on food stamps — she still owes more than $8,000. The story is familiar. It is one a Register editorial writer has heard repeatedly from young Iowa women who dreamed of "doing hair" for a living. They are among the victims of this state's cosmetology laws, which the Iowa Legislature needs to reform.
In this state, anyone who so much as touches the hair on someone else's head must obtain a state license. That requires 2,100 hours of education and training under Iowa law. With no community colleges offering cosmetology education here, people who want to work in the beauty industry head to for-profit schools.
A 2013 Register editorial investigation into these businesses found the average cost of attendance ranged from about $20,000 to more than $30,000 to complete programs that run about 14 months — more than the cost of attending a community college for two years.
Once enrolled, students become unpaid laborers who work for months providing haircuts, facials and manicures to customers. Students interviewed by the Register also reported spending their time sweeping floors, cleaning bathrooms and standing around waiting for customers to visit. Some said they were pressured to sell shampoo and other products.
Money flows to the school from every direction. It collects tuition from students, payments from the federal government for education loans and grants, and money from customers for beauty services.
If you're a business, it doesn't get any better than this.
If you're a student, it is not such a good deal. A spokesperson for Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said last week the office has received an average of about one complaint per month over the last two years about La' James International College, which offers cosmetology classes.
It has been more than 50 years since Clyde Kenyon, a former director of the Iowa Department of Public Health's Barbering Division, observed what remains true today: Barber and cosmetology schools are the only business where "people pay you to work for nothing."
Lawmakers can abolish cosmetology licensing, and the industry can offer certification and training. They could also dramatically reduce Iowa's ridiculously high 2,100-hour training requirement. No state mandates more hours, and most require significantly less. New York requires 1,000, and it's doubtful people in the Big Apple are suffering any more bad haircuts than people here.
Iowa has many arcane licensing laws that thwart business growth, make it more difficult for people to find work, limit competition and hurt our economy. A state license should not be required to interpret sign language or fit hearing aids. But the worst of all licensing laws are the ones related to cosmetology.
They neither protect public safety nor ensure students receive a quality education. Instead, they force students — frequently young women who are poor enough to obtain Pell grants — into slave labor at beauty schools. And the ones who actually do graduate will be lucky if they earn enough to pay off their student loan debt.

Texto completo: Steve King, the Iowa congressman who has long outraged Democrats and liberals with racist remarks and demeaning insults about immigrants, is now facing extraordinary blowback from within his own party following an interview in The New York Times in which he questioned why white supremacy is considered offensive.
Mr. King, 69, who narrowly won re-election in November, has made racist comments for more than a decade that party leaders have mostly ignored. But his statements published Thursday in The Times went further than ever, triggering a barrage of public criticism from top House Republicans as well as a former G.O.P. presidential candidate and conservatives in the media.
In the interview, which focused on how Mr. King's once-fringe immigration views set the stage for the border wall and white identity politics pursued by President Trump, the congressman said: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?"
Reflecting on the record number of black people and women in the new Congress, he added: "You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men."
Mr. King took to the House floor on Friday to try to explain his remarks, saying he was "simply an American nationalist." He did not apologize for his remarks to The Times.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, was among the party leaders who denounced him. "Steve's language is reckless, wrong and has no place in our society," Mr. McCarthy said.
Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-highest ranking Republican in the House, wrote in a tweet that Mr. King's remarks "are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse."
Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, published an opinion column in The Washington Post on Friday criticizing his party for frequently failing to condemn people like Mr. King.
"Some in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism -- it is because of our silence when things like this are said," Mr. Scott said.
In a statement after The Times article was published online, and in a six-minute speech in the House on Friday, Mr. King strenuously denied that he was a white nationalist or white supremacist.
"I reject those labels and the evil ideology they define," he said. He did not dispute making the original remarks, but argued that he was raising a historical question about how and when the phrases came to be used to criticize people.
Mr. King, a former bulldozer operator who is in his ninth term, began his speech by saying he had made "a freshman mistake" by speaking to The Times.
"I regret the heartburn that has poured forth upon this Congress and this country and especially in my state and in my congressional district," he said.
There were rumblings in the House on Friday about trying to formally reprimand Mr. King. Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, said that he was considering drafting a House resolution censuring him. And at least one top Democratic leader, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest ranking African-American in Congress, told CNN he would support Mr. Ryan's move.
Still, it was far from clear that Democrats would actually follow through. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned the comments and acknowledged Democratic interest in taking some action, but said late Friday she was not prepared to make any announcements.
Democrats are focused on the shutdown fight with the president and may be inclined to let Republicans sort out their own dirty laundry.
And strategists in both parties said the reaction, to some degree, reflects the degree to which Mr. King has become a millstone for his party. If Mr. King is on the ballot in 2020, they say, it could benefit Democrats by depressing support for the re-election of Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican.
"What I don't like is he's a drag on all our candidates and an in-kind contribution to Pelosi," said David Kochel, a Republican strategist in Iowa.
Two Iowa Republicans announced this week they would challenge Mr. King in a primary in 2020 for his Fourth District seat. He will likely face severe difficulties in raising money if he seeks re-election.
Jeb Bush, the former 2016 presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter, "Republican leaders must actively support a worthy primary opponent to defeat King, because he won't have the decency to resign."
The conservative National Review published an editorial on Friday: "Dump Steve King."

A July 1944 Plot: Hitler's Generals Turned on Him

Texto completo: Headnote COMMENTARY....
Recent events with the Trump administration, including the Bob Woodward book - Fear - and the anonymous op-ed in the New York Times from an alleged member of the Trump administration had me thinking about the July 1944 plot by some of the German military to overthrow Adolph Hitler.
My reference to Hitler, just before you jump out of your seat, is not a direct comparison. Rather it is to make a different point.
Germany began an active military buildup shortly after Hitler assumed power. He made an agreement with the Reichswehr (the name for the Germany military) that he would curtail the more radical elements of the Nazi movement - specifically the S.A. or Stormtroopers - and, as a result, the Reichswehr would lend its support to Hitler's political and military ambitions.
While there were probably some in the German military who questioned Hitler's approach, there was little opposition. Instead, the Reichswehr, which later became the Wehrmacht, went forward with naked aggression.
Additionally, it abetted the Holocaust carried out against Jews, other minorities and political dissidents.
It was only in 1943/1944 when the tide of the war had turned with the German defeat at the hands of Soviet troops in the battle of Stalingrad, and the later collapse of Mussolini in Italy, that there was a rethinking.
It was a rethinking not based on a moral reawakening among these generals but a recognition that Hitler was in the process of taking Germany down rather than leading it to victory.
The lesson here is important in looking at this moment. There appear to be an increasing number of Republicans who are, quietly and sheepishly, beginning to question the wisdom of the great leader, excuse me, of President Trump.
This has been captured through the interviews in Bob Woodward's book, Fear, and equally illuminated by the anonymous op-ed.
To be clear, the covert opponents of Trump are NOT questioning the basic objectives of the administration. Rather, they are questioning the methods being undertaken and the instability brought about by the fact that Trump is, apparently, quite prepared to discard the rule of law.
They are not questioning the disemboweling of the Environmental Protection Agency; they are not questioning Trump's picks for the judiciary; they are not questioning the revoking of the Iran nuclear deal...the list goes on. But what they do realize is that Trump is bringing the temple down on everyone.
None of this is to suggest that the covert opponents of Trump should be ignored or even ridiculed. Opposition to Trump's authoritarianism is always welcomed. But the rest of us must always keep in mind that there are those who resist the demon and the demonic agenda, while there are those who resist the demon because the agenda is under threat.

Hey, Frank Bruni! When will the media 'redeem' itself for Barack Obama's election?

Texto completo: In between the lines of Frank Bruni’s column Friday in the New York Times, he admits what any normal person should have accepted long ago: President Trump won the 2016 election in spite of the news media, not because of it.

I literally mean between the lines. The piece is largely a plea for the national news media to “redeem” itself (the actual word he used), but here and there, he confesses that his complaint may not only be hopeless but also pointless.

“That’s a specific question but also an overarching one — about the degree to which we’ll let [Trump] set the terms of the 2020 presidential campaign, about our appetite for antics versus substance, and about whether we’ll repeat the mistakes that we made in 2016 and continued to make during the first stages of his presidency,” wrote Bruni.

The “mistakes” he’s referring to were attempts to cover Trump’s surprise campaign that amounted to anything less than repeatedly insisting he should under no circumstances be elected.

Bruni continued: “Trump was and is a perverse gift to the mainstream, establishment media, a magnet for eyeballs at a juncture when we were struggling economically and desperately needed one. Just present him as the high-wire act and car crash that he is; the audience gorges on it. But readers’ news appetite isn’t infinite, so they’re starved of information about the fraudulence of his supposed populism and the toll of his incompetence.”

Of all people, he turns to Dan Rather to illuminate how the media should operate during a presidential campaign.

“The shadow of what we did last time looms over this next time,” Rather told Bruni, without a flicker of irony. (Rather has still yet to apologize for the massive journalistic malpractice he oversaw at CBS during the 2004 election.)

Bruni complains that the news media only covered Trump superficially while at the same time admitting, “I’m not certain that more firepower would have made a difference. For one thing, there were many exposés of Trump’s shady history.” His own colleague, Maggie Haberman, a fantastic reporter, said last week that “Voters had a great deal of information about Trump and voted for him anyway.”

“But it’s on us,” Bruni writes, “to try to interest them [voters] in more and to leaven that concentration of attention with full, vivid introductions to Trump’s alternatives.”

Is anyone under the impression that the public wasn’t fully informed of who Hillary Clinton is? She’s been in the national conscience since 1991.

The next election will be different in that most of the leading Democratic candidates are unknown on a national level, but to blame the media (to the extent that Bruni does, before alternately throwing his hands up) for Trump’s success is to suggest that the coverage of his campaign was wildly positive rather than what it was: hostile to an extent that has no precedent. It remains that way.

If you want a real case study in negligent media coverage of a presidential campaign, look squarely at 2008.

The longtime broadcaster Tom Brokaw of NBC and Charlie Rose, then of PBS, said just days before that election that they and the rest of the public had virtually no clue who then-candidate Barack Obama was, thanks to the news media’s lack of in-depth coverage of his campaign and his history.

Brokaw: “I don’t know what books he’s read.”

Rose: “I mean, it is more likely we'll know more about John McCain, because he has been speaking about foreign policy, just over a longer time. But I really don't know — and do we know anything about the people who are advising [Obama]?”

Brokaw: “We don’t know a lot about Barack Obama and the universe of his thinking about foreign policy.”

Rose: “I don’t know what Barack Obama’s worldview is.”

Brokaw: “No, I don’t either.”

Rose: “He is principally known through his autobiography and through very aspirational speeches.”

Will the media take the opportunity to “redeem” itself for the 2008 election? Of course not, and that’s not what Bruni wants. What he wants is for Trump to have never been elected and for the media to do everything it can to ensure he doesn't win a second term.

Trump was elected, and unlike Obama, it was no thanks to the media.

POW's wedding ring was lost in German prison camp 75 years ago and now his son will get it back

Texto completo: KERRVILLE, Texas — Wayne Gotke already owns several pieces of memorabilia from the time his father, also named Wayne, spent in a German prisoner-of-war camp during World War II.
There's the POW identification tag each prisoner was issued upon entering a camp. A copy of the silk map of France and Germany many escapees used to help guide them to freedom, reports The San Antonio Express-News. And a leaflet distributed by the Germans tempting POWs to join them in fighting the Russians for one year in exchange for the promise that they'd be allowed safe passage home at war's end.
But the San Antonio native, who now lives in Kerrville, will receive perhaps the most valuable piece of memorabilia: His father's inscribed gold wedding ring, recently rediscovered more than 75 years after it was lost in Stalag Luft III, the German POW camp later made famous by the movie "The Great Escape."
Gotke will receive the ring during a presentation at the Kerr County War Memorial on the grounds of the county courthouse in Kerrville.
"My parents divorced when I was a baby, and I never had an adult conversation with my father," said Gotke, 72, and a retired federal law enforcement agent. "But I'm truly excited to receive my father's ring."
The story of the ring's return is one of post-war reconciliation and efforts to pay respects due to former POWs. It began in September, during a routine excavation by a team from the POW Camps Museum of what was one of the many prisoner huts at the camp which, during the war, was located near the German of Sagan.
"We do two kinds of work here," said Marek Lazarz, director of the museum. The museum is located in an area that, at the end of the war, was given to Poland as part of war reparations and is now near the renamed town of Zagan. "We do archaeological searching, but we also clear away the brush that grows over some of the abandoned areas that used to be foundations of the prison barracks."
On this day, one of the volunteers was excavating a dirt-filled sink and drain in what had been the bathroom of barracks No. 139. As he knocked the accumulated dirt out of the drain, a metal ring fell out.
"We were not very excited at first, because we find stuff all the time," Lazarz said. "Pieces of metal, pilots wings, even rings."
But upon closer inspection, they realized that the inside of the ring was inscribed with the words "Ann to Wayne 1942" and "MIZPAH" in all caps. That's the Hebrew word for "watchtower" but has also come to mean an emotional bond between two people who are separated but hope to reunite.
"That's when we became excited," he added.
Located 100 miles southeast of Berlin, Stalag Luft III housed up to 10,000 Allied prisoners during the war, mostly officers, mainly British and Americans. The camp was run by the German Luftwaffe, and, while by no means easy, life there was more comfortable than that for enlisted airmen at other camps, according to Marilyn Walton, a historical researcher and author of three books (two with Michael C. Eberhardt) about the camp.
"It was more boring than desperate," said Walton, whose father also was a Stalag Luft III prisoner. "They'd get mail from home, Red Cross food packages and they had sports equipment so they played ice hockey and baseball."
The POWs also had very particular sets of skills, such tunneling, building clandestine radios or forging documents to help escapees travel to safety. These skills helped support numerous escape attempts, the most famous being the one immortalized in "The Great Escape," the 1963 epic starring Steve McQueen, James Garner and Richard Attenborough.
To prepare for that March 1944 attempt, prisoners spent nearly a year digging three tunnels, nicknamed Tom, Dick and Harry. The Germans discovered Tom, and Dick was abandoned after it collapsed. While 76 prisoners eventually escaped through Harry, only three made it to freedom. The rest were captured and 50 of those were killed by the Germans on direct orders from Adolf Hitler. According to Walton, Hitler wanted to have them all killed but was talked out of it by Hermann Göring who feared retaliation against German POWs in the U.S.
The elder Wayne Gotke was not involved in the Great Escape, but he did make several attempts of his own. He had a unique strategy for staying free.
"Dad was dark complected and, because he grew up in San Antonio and went to Alamo Heights High School, he spoke Spanish fluently," said his son. "Spain was neutral during World War II, so there were a lot of Spanish laborers in Germany. So if he came across a German soldier during an escape, he'd start speaking Spanish. The Germans usually couldn't understand, so eventually they'd just let him go."
But not every German soldier was fooled, and Wayne Gotke never hit what his son calls a "home run," making it to freedom.
Before becoming a prisoner, Wayne Gotke was a navigator on a B-24D bomber flying out of Shipdham, United Kingdom. In February 1943, while on his 11th or 12th mission, his plane was shot down by German fighters near Bad Zwischenahn, Germany, exploding in midair and killing eight of the 10 crew members. Although wounded, Wayne Gotke was able to parachute to safety, eventually being captured and sent to Stalag Luft III.
Flying with the crew that day was New York Times correspondent Robert Post, who was a member of the "Writing 69th," a group of eight war correspondents, including Andy Rooney and Walter Cronkite, who'd completed a rigorous, weeklong training program to prepare them to accompany crews on bombing missions.
Post was the first of the group to fly a mission and his death put a quick end to the program.
After the ring was cleaned, a researcher and guide at the camp museum painstakingly reviewed records kept by the prisoners themselves looking for a POW in the South Compound section of the camp named Wayne. There was only one, Wayne Gotke.
Lazarz had worked with Walton on previous efforts to track down prisoners and it took only a quick online search for her to find Gotke's home phone number in Kerrville.
Gotke surprised her by describing the ring inscription exactly, including the names and the word "Mizpah."
"I asked Marilyn if I could have the ring back, and she told me they would try," he said. Technically, the ring was property of the Polish government, but officials there quickly released it so it could be returned.
Despite the sentiment expressed in the ring's inscription, Ann and Wayne Gotke divorced not long after his return, when their son was only 4 months old. His mother, who died in 2002, remarried when he was 6. Over the years they lost contact with the elder Gotke and learned he'd died in 1979 only when his then-wife called to inform them.
Although Gotke remembers his mother describing the ring, no one knows exactly how it was lost — although he has a couple of theories.
"My father was in the camp for almost two years, so he probably lost a lot of weight," he said. "Since the ring was found in a bathroom sink drain, it could have slipped off his finger while he was washing his hands. And the Germans wouldn't have wanted to help him retrieve it."
As it was becoming increasingly obvious that the war had turned inexorably against the Germans, the camp was hastily evacuated in January 1945. Gotke believes that, in the chaos, his father may have inadvertently left the ring behind.
The prisoners were first marched 52 miles in subzero temperatures to Spremberg and then taken by train to Stalag VII-A POW camp near the town of Moosburg in southern Bavaria. That camp was liberated in April by Patton's Third Army and Gotke returned home shortly thereafter.
Like all those who've been touched by the ring, Gotke said he is surprised that, after being lost for more than three-quarters of a century, the ring was finally found.
"You could have knocked me down when Marilyn told me they'd found the ring," he said. "I've always had an interest in what my father did during the war. All that I know came from my mother and from other POWs I've talked with. But having the ring will help fill in some of the blanks."
Gotke was so thankful for the help he's received he made a $500 donation to the museum and said he hopes to visit sometime in the next few years. He's also decided that the ring will be passed on to his own son, who is 43, lives in Austin and is also named Wayne.
And Lazarz said he plans to install an exhibit in the museum telling the story of this ring.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran confirmed Wednesday it is holding U.S. Navy veteran Michael R. White at a prison in the country, making him the first American known to be detained under President Trump's administration.
White's detention adds new pressure to the rising tension between Iran and the U.S., which under Trump has pursued a maximalist campaign against Tehran that includes pulling out of its nuclear deal with world powers.
Although the circumstances of White's detention remain unclear, Iran in the past has used its detention of Westerners and dual nationals as leverage in negotiations.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported the confirmation, citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi.
"An American citizen was arrested in the city of Mashhad some time ago and his case was conveyed to the U.S administration on the first days" of his incarceration, Ghasemi was quoted as saying.
The New York Times has quoted White's mother saying she learned three weeks ago that her son is alive and being held at an Iranian prison. His arrest was first reported by IranWire, an online news service run by Iranian expatriates, which interviewed a former Iranian prisoner who said he met White at Vakilabad Prison in Mashhad in October.
The Associated Press has been unable to reach members of White's family. The State Department said it was aware of reports of an American citizen's arrest, but was otherwise unable to comment.
White's mother, Joanne White, had told the Times that her 46-year-old son, who lives in Imperial Beach, Calif., went to Iran to see his girlfriend and had booked a July 27 flight back home to San Diego via the United Arab Emirates. She filed a missing person report with the State Department after he did not board the flight. She added that he had been undergoing treatment for a neck tumor and has asthma.
There are four other known American citizens being held in Iran.
Iranian-American Siamak Namazi and his 82-year-old father Baquer, a former UNICEF representative who served as governor of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province under the U.S.-backed shah, are both serving 10-year sentences on espionage charges. Iranian-American art dealer Karan Vafadari and his Iranian wife, Afarin Neyssari, received 27-year and 16-year prison sentences, respectively. Chinese-American graduate student Xiyue Wang was sentenced to 10 years in prison for allegedly "infiltrating" the country while doing doctoral research on Iran's Qajar dynasty.
Iranian-American Robin Shahini was released on bail in 2017 after staging a hunger strike while serving an 18-year prison sentence for "collaboration with a hostile government." Shahini is believed to still be in Iran.
Also in an Iranian prison is Nizar Zakka, a U.S. permanent resident from Lebanon who advocated for internet freedom and has done work for the U.S. government. He was sentenced to 10 years on espionage-related charges.
Former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished in Iran in 2007 while on an unauthorized CIA mission, remains missing as well. Iran says that Levinson is not in the country and that it has no further information about him, though his family holds Tehran responsible for his disappearance. Tehran now says it has no information about him.

The Pentagon's now prepping to build a wall

Resumen: A USA TODAY exclusive. Plus: Jeff Bezos, R. Kelly and the rest of Thursday's top news.

Texto completo: An exclusive from us: The Pentagon's readying ways to build barriers on the southern border just in case President Donald Trump declares a national emergency there. Meanwhile, Trump visited the border Thursday in McAllen, Texas, where residents are asking: What emergency?
But first, pop your popcorn: Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and longtime confidant, will testify before lawmakers in February on dealings with Trump that led to the three years in prison Cohen is preparing to serve.
While Trump tours the border, workers suffer the shutdown
Trump met border officials in Texas and touted his vision for a wall, which he claimed would stop "cold" illicit drugs from entering the United States. (Probably not, as most drugs caught at the border come through legal entry points, data show. ) "They say it’s immoral,” Trump said of Democrats' opposition to a wall. “What’s immoral is all the killing that’s taking place. " (Immigrants are actually less likely overall to commit crimes, studies largely show. )
Meanwhile, hundreds rallied outside the White House to protest the partial government shutdown that is centered on the wall and has left 800,000 federal workers unpaid. "I live paycheck to paycheck," said Leisyka Lee, a single mom in Arcata, California, who works for the Bureau of Land Management.
About that whole Mexico-paying-for-the-wall thing: " I never meant they're going to write out a check," Trump claimed Thursday. Except he did: A 2016 memo from Trump's campaign calls for a "one-time payment of $5-10 billion" for the wall.
Bezos did not have a prenup, report says
Jeff Bezos' divorce may get complicated: The Amazon CEO and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, did not have a prenuptial agreement, TMZ reported Thursday, and the two plan to file for divorce in Washington. That state's law considers all the couple accrues during their marriage as community property. That doesn't necessarily mean a 50-50 split, but the court tries to divide assets — such as the Bezos' reported six homes — fair and equitably. She could become the richest woman in the world.
Real quick:
Jillian Michaels on the keto diet: "Bad plan, for a million reasons. "
An NFL team hired a losing coach. Why? White privilege, a sportscaster says.
Blue flecks in a medieval skull could rewrite women's history.
250 people got sick on a Carnival cruise ship, forcing it to turn back.
A school officer in Ohio was removed after giving the principal a parking ticket.
Actual GOP congressman: Why is 'white supremacist' offensive?
Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) isn't bothered that Republicans and Democrats condemn him for his history of racist rhetoric and ties to extremist groups. On the contrary, he said in an interview that he's fine with being called a "white supremacist. " "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King told the New York Times. he later walked back the comments on Twitter, saying "I reject those labels. " King narrowly won re-election in 2018, but will face a Republican challenger in 2020.
Lady Gaga regrets her R. Kelly track
Lady Gaga says "a dark time in my life" led her to record with R. Kelly, the singer accused of being a sexual predator in last week's Lifetime docu-series, "Surviving R. Kelly. " The singer appeared in Gaga's 2013 "Do What U Want. " The lyrics: "You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind, but do what you want with my body. " Gaga, herself a sexual assault victim, tweeted Wednesday night: "I think it’s clear how explicitly twisted my thinking was at the time. " Elsewhere in #MeToo, a judge on Thursday dismissed part of Ashley Judd's sexual harassment suit against former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.

Ex-Nazi camp guard deported from U.S. dies in nursing home in Germany

Resumen: Jakiw Palij was stripped of his U.S. citizenship in 2003 for concealing his Nazi past, but legal battles lasted until 2018.

Texto completo: Jakiw Palij, a former Nazi concentration camp guard who was deported from the U. S. after a lengthy legal battle, has died in Germany in a nursing home at the age of 95, according to German officials.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Westfaelische Nachrichten newspapers quoted German officials as saying Palij died in elderly care home in the town of Ahlen
Palij, who was living in Queens in New York City when he was deported in 2018, had been stateless since a federal judge revoked his U. S. citizenship in 2003.
Born in Poland in 1923 as an ethnic Ukrainian, Palij was trained by the SS in the Trawniki concentration camp in southeastern Nazi-occupied Poland in 1941, according to Deutsche Welle. So-called "Trawniki men" went on to participate in the Holocaust as guards in Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka concentration camps.
Palij had emigrated to the U. S. as a war refugee in 1949 and became a naturalized citizen in 1957.
He was tracked down in 2001 by the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigation, which hunted Nazi collaborators who had concealed their activities when emigrating to the U. S. At the time, he acknowledged his service during the war in a sworn statement, The Washington Post reported.
That, in turn, led District Judge Allyne R. Ross to strip Palij of his citizenship in 2003 for concealing his Nazi past, saying in her opinion that he "does not submit a single affidavit affirming his innocence. "
A U. S. Justice Department statement at the time noted that Ross had found "that on November 3 and 4, 1943, 'in a brutal spate of killing,' other units 'slaughtered Trawniki's entire inmate population' of some 6,000 Jewish civilians. '"
"Judge Ross also found that by March 1944 Palij was serving in the Deployment Company, a unit that perpetrated numerous atrocities against Polish civilians and others," the DOJ statement said. "When Palij applied for an immigration visa to the United States in 1949, the judge held, he falsely claimed that he worked on his father's farm and then in Germany during the period when he was actually in Nazi service. "
In 2003, Palij told the New York Times that he was forced into service and did not take part in any killings during the war. "I was never a collaborator," Palij said.
U. S. Ambassador Richard Grenell, who noted Palij's death on Twitter, praised President Donald Trump for resolving the lengthy case in 2018.
In a statement at the time, U. S. officials indicated that Palij's deportation followed negotiations by “President Trump and his team” and “collaborative efforts with a key European ally,” Germany.
Germany had long refused to accept Palij because he never had Germany nationality.
In an interview with “Fox & Friends” shortly after Palow's deportation, Trump said he took the action after earlier presidents had not.
“I have a lot of Jewish friends who said to me about this man living in Queens — I grew up in Queens," Trump said. "And he was a man that — not just a prison guard. He was a prison guard that supervised the killing of many, many Jews. Many, many Jews. And he’s lived here for decades. "
Upon deportation, Palij did not face any charges in Germany because German authorities indicated they did not have sufficient evidence to charge him. Instead, Palij, who arrived by military plane in Dusseldorf in 2018, was placed in a nursing home, Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: Joaquin Guzman Loera was part of what the New York Times has dubbed the Big Apple's latest attraction: narco-tourism. Forget the Empire State Building and the Christmas tree in the Rockefeller Center, reporter Alan Feuer proclaimed last week; the hot commodity is the El Chapo trial. Dozens of people have been traveling from all over the world to watch bits of the trial,
NEENAH — But for the presence of a woman right in front of him in a New York courtroom, Gary Merkling was in direct line for a kiss blown by one of the biggest drug cartel kingpins the world has ever known.
The kiss blown last week by Joaquin Guzman Loera — that's El Chapo, to you and me — was intended for his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, but Merkling, a factory worker from Neenah, was right behind her, and close enough for collateral damage.
Merkling wasn't there for a kiss. Just a glimpse. Merkling is sort of a drug cartel kingpin fanboy, and with Pablo Escobar dead, El Chapo is the kingpinniest of them all.
That's why Merkling took two days off from his job at Sonoco paper mill in Neenah so he could jump on a plane, fly to New York City, rush over to the courthouse in Brooklyn before dawn to be sure of getting a good seat, then head home after hearing about four hours of testimony.
Joaquin Guzman Loera was part of what the New York Times has dubbed the Big Apple's latest attraction: narco-tourism. Forget the Empire State Building and the Christmas tree in the Rockefeller Center, reporter Alan Feuer proclaimed last week; the hot commodity is the El Chapo trial.
Dozens of people have been traveling from all over the world to watch bits of the trial, Feuer wrote, including a French scholar, a pair of Lithuanian tourists, a retired Connecticut banker, and Merkling.
"The New York Times guy told me (that) in the first couple weeks of the trial, hundreds showed up, and they only let in 40," Merkling said.
Interest had dwindled after about a month's worth of testimony, so when Merkling went, he was one of about 50 people who showed up, and he was practically first in line. That got him the best seat in the house, right behind the press corps and then behind Mrs. Chapo.
"El Chapo was right there," Merkling said. "He was waving at his wife a lot and blowing kisses to her."
Merkling had been following the trial online as best as he could, Googling it every day, but he had no idea who or what he was going to see in court that day. It turned out to be one of El Chapo's Colombian supply guys. Alleged.
"They were asking him how they met, talking about drug routes, how he gifted El Chapo with a million-dollar helicopter," Merkling said. "He went into really in-depth details about smuggled drugs, how they chartered speedboats to go out on the ocean, and tuna-fishing boats ... All behind-the-scenes stuff."
Testimony was all in Spanish but with an interpreter.
Outside the courtroom was interesting, too, Merkling said. Federal agents were walking around with bulletproof vests under their suit jackets.
Merkling had to pass through two lines of security, give up his cellphone, get up close and personal with drug dogs and sniffing machines. During one of the breaks, he looked out one of the windows of the eighth floor they were on and saw armed SWAT snipers on the roof of the adjoining building.
So what got Merkling so interested in El Chapo, anyway?
"I've always been fascinated," he said. "I had just heard of him when he broke out of prison, I forget, maybe the second time, or whatever, but I just started following him, looking up stuff about him. Once I saw his trial had started, I said it would be crazy to go to that, but I kept looking online to see if it was open to the public."
He was similarly fascinated with Pablo Escobar. A year ago last fall, he sprung for a week's vacation to go to Colombia and tour Escobar's estate.
"I just find it fascinating, the money, the crazy lifestyle," he said. "They say Pablo supplied like 80 percent of all the cocaine in the U.S. One man supplied that? The power and how crazy the money is ... I've been interested in Escobar for a long time."
Merkling, who is single, makes it kind of his lifestyle to take quick, random little trips all over, and it's not all about cocaine kingpins.
"I went to Dubai this September, me and a buddy, for a week. The week before I went to New York, I went to North Carolina to watch a Duke basketball game. In November, me and my girlfriend flew to Seattle for the Packer game, and just flew right back."
Otherwise, he works 60 to 70 hours a week, stockpiles his money, and, if something comes up, like a major cocaine conspiracy trial in New York, he can just go.
The New York trip would have cost him just a couple of hundred bucks for airfare, an Uber and room and board for a night, except for a two-day weather layover in Chicago on his way home.
"I had to rent a car, and it cost me $300, basically the cost of the whole trip otherwise," he said. "That sucked. It would have been a nice, cheap trip otherwise."
El Chapo's trial, which began in November, is expected to last several months.

Trump's wall-to-wall lies hitting wall as he wails

Texto completo: President Donald Trump forced his way onto network television Tuesday night and delivered an address that looked for all the world like an unfunny "Saturday Night Live" skit aimed at mocking President Donald Trump.
His voice droned. He sniffed and sniffed. He squinted at the teleprompter, sleepily delivering lies about immigration and immigrants and the ludicrous border wall he will never see built.
The wall will pay for itself! (Nonsense.)
There's a crisis at our border! (Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border are far below their historic highs of the early 2000s, according to Customs and Border Protection, and the only crisis is the one Trump's administration created by separating asylum seekers from their children.)
Illegal aliens are violent and a threat to our safety! (Boilerplate xenophobic rhetoric easily debunked by data that have repeatedly shown immigrants living in the U.S. illegally commit crimes at rates far lower than U.S. citizens.)
The fact-checking could go on and on, but it gets tiresome. Even Trump seemed bored of the lies he was spouting during a prime-time address from the Oval Office, and he carried the look of a man who knows he's losing. A man who wished he were doing something else, like golfing at taxpayer expense or hobnobbing with wealthy pals or having his ego pumped up at a campaign rally by the cheering fans he conned into thinking he could actually deliver a wall.
He can't. He won't. Setting aside the absurdity, offensiveness and impracticality of a more than 1,000-mile-long edifice to Trump's ego, there isn't enough support for a wall, nor is there money for such a pointless project.
The Trump-induced government shutdown is dragging on, hurting working Americans and, with each passing day, increasing the pressure on Republican lawmakers to turn on the president and vote with Democrats to reopen the government.
So what did Tuesday night's address to the nation accomplish? Zilch.
The loyal Trumpists who believe every word the president speaks and know in their hearts that a big, beautiful wall -- or maybe a sleek steel-slat barrier! -- will soon rise from the Texas desert and keep them safe from marauding hordes of bloodthirsty immigrants are still just as sure as ever that everything's going according to plan.
But everyone else saw a man who will never admit failure looking a lot like he knows he has failed.
The New York Times reported late Tuesday on an off-the-record lunch Trump held with television anchors just hours before he gave the address, with two sources telling the newspaper that Trump "was not inclined to give the speech" or take his planned Thursday trip to the Texas border. The sources said Trump saw the Texas trip as nothing more than a photo opportunity.
I don't think Trump has ever cared a bit about immigration or protecting the border. I don't think he gives a whip about who comes in or where or how or why they enter the country.
The wall, for our narcissist in chief, has never been more than an abstraction, something large and impressive-sounding he could use to get the people who like him excited. I doubt its functionality or purpose has any meaning to him. It simply became a part of his nationalist brand, an idea that was fun to toss around in a crowded auditorium, like a giant beach ball at a concert.
But now that the government is shut down and Trump's temper tantrum isn't swaying Democrats in Congress one bit, that fun, giant bouncing ball of an idea isn't feeling so fun to our self-serving president.
What Trump needed, in the wake of Democrats winning back the House of Representatives and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation closing in on him, was a distraction. The focus had to move away from all the people in his inner circle who were flipping or being sentenced to prison time, and he -- the Donald -- had to grab the spotlight.
So he fell back on the part of his presidential brand he thought he could always count on: The Wall!
But it backfired. It stopped being fun. It required Trump to do a televised speech he didn't want to do, and now he'll have to fly down to the border and pretend to care.
He doesn't care. The wall has never been more than an applause line. And now it's nothing more than a Trumpian attempt to distract from other things that might make Trump look bad.
It's not working. It's just adding to the things making Trump look bad.
You could see it on the president's face Tuesday night as he squinted at the American people and delivered the divisive, dishonest words that others fed him.
He looked like he knows the con isn't working. Like he just figured out that the fall guy is him.

Touch of magic; Faerie court to cast a spell at MarsCon 2019 weekend

Texto completo: Correction: Published correction ran Saturday, Jan. 12, 2019.
Correction: James Ford Allen's name was misspelled in an article on MarsCon in Williamsburg magazine. The article also incorrectly stated when MarsCon moved to Williamsburg; it was 1994. (Text corrected.)
Longtime local science, science fiction and fantasy convention MarsCon will have some big names and big crowds - and just a touch of magic - when it returns to Williamsburg in 2019.
"This year, MarsCon's theme is "The Land of the Faerie," and as such, we're bringing a lot of guests and holding a number of events based around those touched by the fae folk, with that usual MarsCon touch thrown in," said James Ford Allen , the MarsCon convention chairman. "If you're a fan, this is such a great place to make new friends and discover some great writers and authors."
Among those on the guest list for this year's event are Hugo and Nebula award-nominated author Seanan McGuire, New York Times best-selling author Catherine M. Valente, and the musical duo Valentine Wolfe. In addition to big names being a draw, MarsCon highlights include a weekend of panels, concerts, a costume contest, as well as gaming and cosplay.
MarsCon has been one of the area's biggest conventions since it moved to Williamsburg in 1994; more than 1,300 attended last year's convention. More than the guests, the panels and the costumes though, for some the biggest MarsCon draw is the community, sharing a weekend celebrating the things you're passionate about with others who share them.
"MarsCon is a weekend-long party with more than a thousand of your closest friends," said longtime attendee Rich Stow. "If you've never been to a convention before, you just won't find a feeling like that anywhere else."

Want to go?
MarsCon will be held at the Williamsburg Doubletree Jan. 18-20. The event begins at noon on Friday and runs until 4 p.m. on Sunday. Tickets for the weekend are $50 for adults, $25 for 6- to 12-year-olds, and free for children under six, with daily tickets priced depending on the day and availability.

The Memorable Corrections of 2018

Texto completo: It's embarrassing to err so publicly, and having to correct any of our journalism is regrettable. But some of the corrections we ran in 2018 not only set the record straight. They also did so while affording our readers the pleasure of schadenfreude at our expense.
Now that we have closed out 2018, here's a look back at seven of our most surprising -- and comical -- corrections of the year.
This one rendered one Times editor and lots of readers nearly speechless on Twitter.
It corrected the already startling Science article "Why Are Some Crows Committing Acts of Necrophilia?"
What about the time we forgot to remove our "Millennials to Snake People" browser extension before cutting and pasting? Don't you hate it when that happens?
No one sets out to write an article that requires a formal correction. Unfortunately, mistakes happen. We published more than 4,100 corrections on digital articles in 2018.
We estimate that hundreds more ran on videos, podcasts and graphics features. Other corrections were published only in print.
For perspective: The Times published more than 55,000 articles in 2018, and more than 50 million words.
Many of our mistakes are typos that don't require formal corrections. We mixed metaphors and wrote of rankled feathers when we meant ruffled ones.
We talked of honing in on issues when we meant homing in. (Phil Corbett, our assistant managing editor for standards, has the best advice for avoiding this one: "Think pigeons, not knives.")
Errors like these are remedied as quickly as possible, usually without a formal correction appended.

But factual errors necessitate a formal fix, and it is these corrections to which our readers point as a barometer of our transparency and our willingness to admit our mistakes.
Here, for example, we corrected our error on a tweet about Elon Musk, Tesla's founder and chief executive.
In an article about Vespas not depreciating in value, we ran a photo misidentifying the scooters. Oops.
In a Cooking article about salmon with harissa, we misstated one of the main ingredients of the spicy sauce.
A New York Times correction follows a distinct pattern: First we tell you the type of error we committed. Then we state the fact -- minus the inaccuracy -- as clearly as possible.
Sometimes numbers get the best of us. Here we wildly understated the odds of winning the Powerball.
Sometimes we type too fast and end up saying something completely different than we intended. Rage, wage -- what a difference a letter makes!
Our New Year's resolution is to keep delivering great journalism. Here's hoping we make fewer errors in the process.
Rogene Jacquette contributed reporting.
______
Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the error we made in calculating the odds of winning the Powerball. We understated -- not overstated -- them. (Did we mention how embarrassing it is to err so publicly? Onward.)

Cambridge advances proposal to add gender-neutral option to city birth certificates

Texto completo: Cambridge officials Monday advanced a proposal to add a gender-neutral option to birth certificates issued in the city while letting those who don't identify with the gender assigned to them at birth amend the document without having to jump through certain administrative hoops.
The policy order, which was introduced this month by Mayor Marc McGovern, was passed unanimously by the City Council during the first meeting of the New Year Monday night.
The proposal specifically asks the city solicitor to draft a home-rule petition to the state Legislature, because adding a third gender category — “X" — on birth certificates would require state approval.
The city solicitor did not immediately reply to a request for comment about how long that process could take.
Under current state law, Massachusetts residents can amend the sex on a birth certificate with what is termed “proper evidence," according to the state's website. The process requires a note from a physician stating a person has completed medical intervention for the purpose of permanent sex reassignment, the website says.
Cambridge officials have said adding “X" would give residents born in the city “more control in defining for the government who they are and affirming their humanity and dignity," according to details of the order.
The proposal follows in the footsteps of similar legislation passed across the country.
In October, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a bill allowing residents who don't identify as male or female to amend a birth certificate and select “X" instead.
The bill also removed the requirement for people to get a note from a doctor or mental health professional before making the change, according to the New York Times. It went into effect in New York City on Jan. 1, 2019.
California, Oregon, Washington state — and soon, New Jersey — offer similar gender-neutral options for those who want to amend their assigned gender on legal documents.
Officials said they hope by advancing the order to the state Legislature, other communities throughout Massachusetts will do likewise.
During Monday night's meeting, McGovern said he's spoken to delegates at the State House who have been supportive of the measure and that the proposal is long overdue.
“Hopefully this will give it some momentum on a larger scale," McGovern said.
A spokeswoman for House Speaker Robert DeLeo said in a statement Monday that the House would “review any proposal sent" its way.
On Tuesday morning, after the initial proposal was approved, Cambridge City Councilor Alanna Mallonsaid in a tweet that the move is “a signal to the transgender and non-binary conforming community that their municipal leaders care about them."
She added, “This would be one step in ensuring that transgender residents receive the dignity and respect they deserve."
Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui, who cosponsored the proposal, said in a statement to The Boston Globe that the changes would be a simple step with substantial effect for anyone who does not feel the sex indicated on their birth records match their identity.
“The current system is one that does not uphold our community values," she said of the process to make changes to the document. “I feel it's the government's responsibility to remove complex and dehumanizing barriers wherever possible."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump vowed a "prudent" withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, embracing a new, more cautious timeline on Monday while appearing to deny that he had ever ordered an immediate troop departure in the first place.
"We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!" Trump said in a morning tweet. That was "no different from my original statements," he said, accusing the news media of inaccurately reporting "my intentions on Syria."
Last month, Trump declared the Islamic State group defeated in Syria and said troops would be "coming back now." Since then, senior officials have issued a series of statements that have cast doubt on his promise of a quick departure.
The president's endorsement of a flexible departure, conditioned on the still-to-come defeat of the Islamic State, was the latest indication of his administration's zigzagging foreign policy, in which decisions are often made by dramatic presidential tweets and followed by more circumspect policies reflecting top advisers' views.
The initial plan for a quick withdrawal, which would require turning over the U.S.-supported effort against remaining militants to NATO ally Turkey, was met with dismay among officials and lawmakers who feared the Islamic State could return in force. A day after Trump's announcement, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest.
Trump's new remarks appeared to endorse a revised proposal, floated by National Security Adviser John Bolton a day earlier, that would allow U.S. troops and their local allies to extinguish a small but stubborn militant force before they depart. It would also require Turkey to refrain from attacking Syrian Kurdish troops who are the chief U.S. partner on the ground.
The evolving plans came as Bolton traveled Monday to Ankara, Turkey's capital, for talks with Turkish officials on the U.S. withdrawal, including protection of the American-allied Syrian Democratic Forces, which Turkey has vowed to expel from northeast Syria.
Officials across the government have scrambled in recent days to keep up with shifting statements from administration leaders, even as they continued to make plans for a near-term military exit that they cautioned could squander the fruits of a four-year military effort. There are more than 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria.
While Trump initially demanded a 30-day departure, officials said the administration later settled on an exit within 120 days to give the military more time to break down bases and safely remove equipment and personnel. The latest comments from Trump and Bolton intensified uncertainty about what would occur.
Trump's pullout plan fueled concerns among allied nations, including France and Britain, who have sent their own troops to Syria. It also drew criticism from his own party, including from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who on Sunday said Trump had "made a mistake" with his initial pronouncement but was now "slowing down."
On Monday, the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee accused Trump of "changing course like a drunken sailor."
"It shows that our president literally doesn't know what he is doing. He is making it up as he goes," Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., told CNN. "The way he is going about it is disastrous."
But Trump and his top advisers were defiant Monday as they denied that their Syria plans had changed.
"The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria," Trump said in the same tweet, referring to articles on Sunday from numerous publications, including the Times and The Washington Post, that noted the shifting accounts of the military exit. "No different from my original statements."

Texto completo: Emotions ran high at a packed Huntington school board meeting Monday  at which residents, administrators and board members spoke out about a New York Times article on the role of a school resource officer in the deportation of a Honduras native who attended the high school.
About 500 people crowded into Jack Abrams STEM Magnet Intermediate School, where the plight of a former student named Alex took center stage. He was arrested in 2017 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after  being questioned by a school resource officer and the school principal about alleged gang-related actions.
But Brendan Cusack, the principal, said Monday night that the Dec. 27 article was a misrepresentation of him and the school.
"The story as published is not the whole story," he said during the public comment portion of the meeting, drawing sustained applause. "It is hard, however, to read a piece and for your students, your faculty, your community and your family to read a piece which puts you in a way that is exactly the opposite of what you stand for and believe in."
Board member Xavier Palacios said, "What happened to Alex is an unfortunate series of events that resulted in unintended consequences. No one single person is to blame here, not the SRO and certainly not our school principal."
Paul Caleca, dean of students at the high school, defended his colleague, saying Cusack is "one of the most outstanding, not only principals, but men that I have ever met."
Superintendent James Polansky defended the school resource officer program that has been in the district for 15 years, adding that there were "many things that were upsetting" in the Times article. He said that the district had been portrayed "a place that I don't really recognize. It's not the school or the people in it that I have come to know in any way shape or form."
According to the story, a school resource officer who worked for the police department told Alex the blue of  his shoes was the color of MS-13. Alex said the shoes had been a gift from his mother,  that "504" was "about being proud of your country," and the devil was the school mascot.
The teen was among about a dozen Huntington High students arrested under Operation Matador, a program to promote information-sharing between police departments and ICE, the story says. According to the story, Alex said that, after his June 2017 arrest, an ICE agent told him the government was detaining him because of a report "from the school that you were a gang member."
The teen, who was legally seeking asylum, was eventually deported to his native Honduras, the story said.
School resource officers collect tips and information and share it with their department, which can pass it on to immigration agents, according to the Times story.
Shortly after the story appeared, the district released a letter saying it was reviewing its relationship with the Suffolk County Police Department. Speakers at the meeting supported the idea of a more defined agreement with the department on the role of the school resource officer.
Diane Weaving, a resident with a group known as the Huntington School District Community, read part of a group statement saying the district should establish a memorandum of agreement that "must clearly delineate the relationship between school administrators and SROs."

TRUMP’S THREAT TO USE EMERGENCY AUTHORITY TO BUILD WALL MIRRORS COAL PLAN: President Trump tweeted Monday morning that he “no doubt” has the authority to build a border wall without Congress, but wishes to move ahead with a legislative deal anyway.


What Trump is likely referring to are little-known, and limited, powers given to the president to act in the country’s interest in a national emergency. The suggestion resembles a similar plan that the White House floated last year to save financially-ailing coal-fired power plants.


That plan would make use of the Defense Production Act, and other Cold War-era laws and regulations, that give the president the authority to order specific actions — like keeping power plants open — in light of a national emergency.


But it appears the coal plan lost steam in the waning days of 2018, with many tracking the deliberations saying there were doubts within the White House that the president could successfully, and legally, pull off a national security argument to keep coal plants open.


Instead, the administration seems content to leave it up to federal regulators at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to engage in a more lengthy, deliberate, and legally-weighted process to determine whether some power plants should be given market-based subsidies in order to keep the grid secure and resilient.


But the White House pulling the plug on the coal plan begs the question: Does the White House really think Trump can use his presidential authority in order to build a border wall?  


His tweet would suggest that he may be walking the threat back a little in favor of a bipartisan, legislative deal.


“Congressman Adam Smith [D-Wash.], the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, just stated, ‘Yes, there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. It’s been done a number of times,’” Trump tweeted. “No doubt, but let’s get our deal done in Congress!”


Open to court rebuke, while costing too much: What Trump didn’t say is what Smith also said: “In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, where is the emergency? You have to establish that in order to do this.”


Smith appeared on ABC News on Sunday, where he was asked whether the president has the authority to order the construction of a border law.


Smith also said that, beyond the court challenges, the border wall “would be a terrible use of Department of Defense dollars.”


No deal, yet: The administration announced no breakthrough in discussions over the weekend to gain a deal to end the government shutdown and. The shutdown now enters week three.

WHILE TAKING TRUMP'S BARBS, HONDURAS HAS BEEN GOOD FOR HIS PRO-COAL AGENDA: U.S. coal exports surged last year in Honduras, which has been the target of barbs from the president related to immigration and border security.


Honduras showed a 242 percent year-to-date increase in U.S. coal in the third quarter, making it the largest increase in coal of any country in 2018, according to new federal Energy Information Administration data released last week detailing production and exports from the past three quarters of the year.


Trump had referred to a caravan of thousands of Hondurans seeking to migrate to the U.S. as an "invasion," sending troops to the border in an effort to head them off.


Trump also said during a rally in November that Honduras does nothing for the U.S. and that he will be cutting foreign aid the U.S. sends there very soon.


At the same time, Trump has made exporting more coal a key part of his "energy dominance" agenda.


The number two country for increasing imports of U.S. coal for power plants was Pakistan. Other more traditional allies, like Canada, France, and Germany, cut their imports of coal last year, according to the Energy Department.


SUPREME COURT DECLINES EXXON’S BID TO AVOID MASSACHUSETTS CLIMATE COVER-UP PROBE: Supreme Court justices on Monday rejected Exxon Mobil Corp.’s appeal of a Massachusetts court decision that the company must hand over documents to the state’s attorney general related to an investigation of its plans to withhold climate change data from investors.


The high court’s decision is the latest setback to the company's push against Democratic attorneys general investigating allegations that the oil company sought to undermine its own scientists’ research concluding that climate change would hurt its future business.


The court’s decision upholds Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey’s legal push for the company to hand over records that go as far back as the 1970s, which she hopes will reveal that the company sought to cover up the findings, which, if released, could have dissuaded investors.


Activists cheer: Climate change activists applauded the decision, saying it adds momentum for holding fossil fuel companies accountable for causing manmade climate change.


“This latest decision brings great momentum in the fight to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for causing the climate crisis,” said Thanu Yakupitiyage , spokesman for the anti-fossil fuel group 350.org.


“Executives at Exxon knew about climate change decades ago, but they chose to lie to the rest of us to line their oily pockets,” said Yakupitiyage. “Now, it’s those who have done the least to cause the problem who are paying the cost of this deception through our lives and livelihoods.”


PELOSI PLANS TO RESURRECT FAILED CAP-AND-TRADE BILL FROM A DECADE AGO: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that she plans to resurrect something similar to the failed cap-and-trade bill that the House passed nearly a decade ago but that the Senate couldn't muster the votes to pass.


“We couldn’t pass in the Senate our climate bill, and we’ll be returning to that,” Pelosi said on Friday at as part of MSNBC’s “The Speaker” town hall broadcast.


Old ideas reborn: Pelosi is referring to the bill named after former Reps. Henry Waxman and Ed Markey , who is now a senator. The bill put in place a cap on carbon dioxide emissions, while offering emission credits to the power plant operators, which they would have to purchase in order to meet the cap. The price of the credit would adjust as an incentive to reduce emissions.


TRUMP APPLAUDS HIS OWN 'TALENT' FOR LOWERING GASOLINE PRICES: Trump took credit for low gasoline prices on Friday, saying he used his "talent" for negotiating and well-placed phone calls to OPEC nations to bring oil prices lower.


Tax Cut II? Trump explained that keeping gasoline prices lower is part of his administration's efforts to reduce costs for Americans. Earlier last week, he called the lower fuel costs a second tax cut.


But some of his talks with Saudi Arabia ahead of re-imposing oil sanctions in November were based on faulty assumptions. Saudi Arabia did inject more oil into the market ahead of Trump's sanctions, but only to find that the U.S. issued numerous waivers to countries to allow them to continue purchasing Iranian oil.


OPEC cuts: Now, OPEC is poised to cut production because the price of oil has fallen too low due to an oil glut, which could also harm U.S. oil drillers if the oil price goes too low. The average price of oil hovered around $45 per barrel this week.


On Monday, oil prices rallied on Wall Street as the most recent analysis showed OPEC production cuts were beginning to have an effect.

Resumen: Read More Top Official at Memorial Sloan Kettering Resigns After Failing to Disclose Industry Ties Dr. José Baselga, the hospital’s chief medical officer, stepped down days after a report by ProPublica and the New York Times that he failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from the health care and drug industry in research articles. Before that, he was a leader at the Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain. Since September, Baselga has corrected his conflict-of-interest disclosures in several journals, including in The New England Journal of Medicine and in Cancer Discovery. Under the company’s new structure, Baselga will oversee the development of cancer drugs from early research to late-stage clinical trials, and a separate research unit will focus on other disease areas.

Texto completo: Dr. José Baselga, who resigned his position as the top doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center after failing to disclose millions of dollars in payments from drug companies, is now going to work for one of them.
AstraZeneca, the British-Swedish drug maker, announced on Monday that it had hired Dr. Baselga as its head of research and development in oncology, a newly created unit that reflects the company’s shift toward cancer treatments, one of the hottest areas in the drug industry.
In a statement, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, described Baselga as “an outstanding scientific leader.” “José’s research and clinical achievements have led to the development of several innovative medicines, and he is an international thought leader in cancer care and clinical research,” he said.
Baselga stepped down in September from his role as chief medical officer at the cancer center after The New York Times and ProPublica reported that he had failed to accurately disclose his conflicts of interest in dozens of articles in medical journals. He later resigned from the boards of the drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb and the radiation equipment manufacturer Varian Medical Systems.
Although Memorial Sloan Kettering has said that Baselga was not fired, hospital leaders have indicated that he was forced out. In October, Douglas A. Warner III, then the chairman of the cancer center’s board, told the staff that Baselga’s actions “left us no choice.”
In December, the American Association for Cancer Research said that Baselga, at its request, had resigned his post as one of two editors in chief of its medical journal Cancer Discovery because he did “not adhere to the high standards” of conflict-of-interest disclosures that the group expects of its leaders. Some of his omissions involved articles that were published in Cancer Discovery while he was an editor in chief.
A spokesman for AstraZeneca said Baselga was not available for comment, but the doctor told Reuters on Monday that he took responsibility for his disclosure lapses. He also said the cancer association had concluded his failures were “inadvertent,” and said many of his company relationships were publicly available on a federal database of physician payments by drug and device manufacturers. However, some of the relationships that Baselga failed to disclose were with small biotech startups that are not required to report to the federal government.
“Dr. Baselga is one of the best scientists in the field of oncology,” said the spokesman, Gonzalo Viña. “We evaluated the series of inadvertent omissions, which have since been addressed and it is not for us to comment about the previous roles he held.”

Top Official at Memorial Sloan Kettering Resigns After Failing to Disclose Industry Ties
Dr. José Baselga, the hospital’s chief medical officer, stepped down days after a report by ProPublica and the New York Times that he failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from the health care and drug industry in research articles.
AstraZeneca paid Baselga $28,750 for consulting work in 2013 and 2014 related to unspecified drugs, according to the federal database. He failed to disclose any relationships with companies, including AstraZeneca, in dozens of articles in recent years.
Baselga, 59, is an expert in breast cancer research and played a key role in the development of Herceptin by Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche. He came to Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2013 after serving as chief of hematology and oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Before that, he was a leader at the Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain.
Since September, Baselga has corrected his conflict-of-interest disclosures in several journals, including in The New England Journal of Medicine and in Cancer Discovery. In a note that accompanied Baselga’s correction in The New England Journal of Medicine, editors described his failure as a “breach of trust.”
AstraZeneca’s decision to hire Baselga is part of an effort by the drug maker to focus more directly on cancer research, which has generated extensive interest from investors and companies in recent years amid a series of breakthroughs. The company sells several cancer drugs, including the lung cancer drug Tagrisso and Lynparza, which treats a number of cancers. It has suffered some recent setbacks, such as a failed trial of its lung cancer drug Imfinzi.
Under the company’s new structure, Baselga will oversee the development of cancer drugs from early research to late-stage clinical trials, and a separate research unit will focus on other disease areas. Each unit will have its own commercial team to promote the products.
“This new structure will support growth and sharpen the focus on our main therapy areas, speeding up decisions and making us more productive in our mission to bring innovative medicines to patients,” Soriot said in the statement.
In the same statement, Baselga described his new role as a “dream job” and said the reorganization will “accelerate our work to bring transformative medicines to patients.”

Texto completo: We know you're busy, and we want to provide you with a news and opinion filled way to start your week — our fresh takes. We'll publish them every Monday morning.
Do black lives specifically matter to Nancy Pelosi?
It's certainly clear that all lives matter to the newly re-elected House speaker. She stated that at least twice in her answer to a question about the Black Lives Matter movement during a recent town hall meeting hosted by MSNBC's Joy Reid.
When asked by a student at Trinity University (the Washington D. C. school where the town hall was held Friday, and from which Pelosi herself graduated) if she "supported the Black Lives Matter movement," Pelosi stated that she supports "the recognition that black lives matter for sure. . . . I think all lives matter. " She also mentioned the need to "redress past grievances" toward the African American community.
Pelosi stumbled through more of her answer to the question. After prompting from Reid, who asked if there was a political solution to racism in America and brought up voter suppression, Pelosi talked about voting rights, "lifting up the economic well-being of all Americans" and getting rid of dark money in politics.
"We're all working to make sure that every part of our community, whether it's the immigrant community, whether it's the black community, whether it's the women's community, and the rest, not only matter, but rule. "
Federal prison misconduct
A congressional report, released Wednesday, confirmed what a "New York Times" investigation revealed months ago — misconduct, including sexual assault, at federal prisons not only happens among prisoners and staff, but is routinely ignored and covered up through retaliation. The report, from the Subcommittee on National Security, stated that "discipline remains inconsistent" and that "the investigation or disciplinary phase" of an incident "can be thwarted entirely. "
The report included information about a 2017 lawsuit that included more than 500 women who stated that inmates at a Bureau of Prisons facility were allowed to sexually harass them without anything being done to stop or punish the behavior. That case ended with a $20 million settlement.
What did 2018 teach us about police use of force?
Despite national conversations about de-escalation training for police officers, a growing awareness about implicit racial bias and efforts by the federal government to track police use of fatal force, the number of people shot and killed by cops went up in 2018.
Police fatally shot nearly 1,000 people last year, up from 987 the year before, according to a "Washington Post" report on fatal force. And of the 1,147 people killed by police in 2017, a quarter were black. Last year, the overall number of people killed by police also went up.
For more 2018 data on fatal police use of force, take a look at this report by The Root.

Texto completo: Most people spend their lives accumulating things. We buy homes and cars and the latest technology. Closets overflow, junk drawers swell, garages threaten to erupt. We don't dare part with old letters or old journals. Our personal spaces are defined by personal things.
But what if the "stuff" in our lives got a demotion? Americans have a reputation for mindless consumerism, but in the last several years a growing minimalist movement has claimed abundance is the ultimate burden, and that clearing clutter is how to make space for real joy.
A search for #minimalism on Instagram shows the hashtag has been used more than 9 million times. Embracing the philosophy, it seems, starts with decluttering, the process of purging excess stuff. Many point to Marie Kondo's 2014 mega-seller, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing, as the moment minimalism went mainstream (the book remained on USA TODAY’s best-seller list for 123 weeks). In 2015, "declutter" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.
More: Want to get organized? Marie Kondo's tips for decluttering
In the years since, much attention has been paid to the minimalist phenomenon — and its lofty goal of enlightenment.
"I think that the recent interest in tidying is showing that people began to shift their mindset, and are now feeling the need to possess only what is necessary and lead a simpler life," Kondo recently told USA TODAY. Mass production made people's lives easier, she said, but it also meant people ended up owning a lot more than was required (or even desired).
Minimalists like Kondo — who proselytize a more intentional kind of consumerism — say clearing clutter isn't just practical, it's healthful. Psychologists tend to agree.
"Less stuff that clutters our space and our mind can help us be more attuned to what we feel and think," said New York psychologist Vivian Diller, who has treated people who declutter obsessively (any behavior, she says, can become compulsive).
"It's like writers who clear their desks and sharpen their pencils, or artists who clean their pallets or organize their paints," she said. "A sense of internal order can promote external productivity. "
Kondo said the greatest impediment to clearing clutter is nostalgia.
"When trying to let go of things, people often feel as though they are also parting with the effort it took to possess the item and the memories that come with it," she said. "But even if the things are gone, it doesn’t mean that the memory is. "
Emily Evans, owner of Eliminate: Professional Organizing in Lexington, Ky. , said this is why some people who want to organize need a fresh set of eyes.
"A professional organizer is trained to help you see your belongings in a new way," she said.
Jason Cubert, a 44-year-old lawyer in Lexington, said he hired Evans last fall to help him declutter his home.
"I think anytime you free up space for one thing — spiritually, emotionally, practically — you spiritually, emotionally, and practically have room for something else, and you want that something else to be more personally beneficial than just 'stuff,'" he said.
Cubert said his parents were notorious for not throwing things away, and he didn't want his living situation to mirror theirs. He hired Evans in an effort to save himself time spent (looking for things) and money (purchasing items he already had but couldn't find). He found the clutter made it difficult to concentrate in his own home.
"Emily would get in there and really question me about, 'Do you really need this? Have you used this? Is this really that important to you? If and when the time came that you did need it, would it set you back financially?'" he said. "You can have everything organized, and still be overwhelmed by stuff, whereas if you purge I think you can get a bigger picture. You can see space for more things in your life. "
The stream of weekly blog posts and stories on decluttering, and the increasing popularity of services like the one Evan's provides, (the National Association of Professional Organizers started with only a handful of members and now boasts around 4,000) show how drawn we are to the promise of a simpler, more organized life. But the social phenomenon also has its fair share of critics — those who find it difficult to discern how much of minimalism is about shaking off the yolk of consumerism, and how much of it is style dressed up as spirituality.
Even Evans admits that if minimalism is nothing more than an aesthetic, it isn't minimalism at all.
"If you’re getting rid of stuff in your home because you’re going for 'a look' or are planning to replace it with 'simpler' furniture, you’re still buying into our capitalist, consumerist society," she said. "Decluttering should be about making your life easier so you can take part in things that are important to you. "
But what about those who have less — and not by choice? Some critics of the mainstream minimalism movement say it tends to ignore that for many people, an easier life may actually mean having more "stuff. "
Stephanie Land, a social and economic justice writer who spent years as a single mother in Missoula, Mont. , was living in a 600-square-foot apartment in low-income housing with her two young daughters when she saw the trailer for Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things. The 2016 Netflix film was produced by the hosts of The Minimalists podcast, Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, who maintain minimalism is the path to freedom.
Land, who worked as a house cleaner to put herself through college as a single mom (and details the experience in her forthcoming memoir Maid) knows all too well what it's like to live with less.
She calls herself "a minimalist in nature," and while she said she supports more mindful consumerism, what she saw in the trailer was a kind of "social shaming" that made her so uncomfortable she wrote an op-ed about it for The New York Times, "The Class Politics of Decluttering. " When she eventually watched the full documentary, she was even angrier.
"They showed flashes of Black Friday shoppers rushing — presumably Walmart or Best Buy — and pointed to them as a need for this minimalism movement, and that really upset me, because those aren't the people who need minimalism," she said. "When you're living on the very edge or under the poverty level, all the world is a bunch of things that you can't have. When one does come into your reach, you're going to want it. "
Minimalism is only "a virtue," she said, when it's "a choice. "
After years of being forced to live sparsely, Land has moved into a house that boasts a new couch, a stocked fridge and an abundance of space that may not be considered minimal, but still feels pretty joyous.
"I have my very own office," she said. "My daughters can play in our fenced-in backyard. . . . It's blowing my mind constantly. "
Some of us probably ought to live with less. Many of us deserve to live with more. But deciding what to keep and what to toss doesn't just say something about who we are and what possessions, as Kondo famously says, "spark joy. " It reveals how we see our future. Where we think we'll be, where we hope we'll be and what we aren't worried about missing when we get there.

Texto completo: It's now 2019 and many of us have made some kind of New Year's resolutions. We all want to change: lose weight, build relationships, reduce global warming.
I've recently gone through a lot of change. Last November I received a new cat - a stray who spent the night in our church and was found by our organist. Another week, for my birthday, our office manager got me my first smartphone. And at Thanksgiving, I got a dog. Lots of change, and it's all good, or mostly so, like life.
Americans are about all kinds of change - with three big areas many of us are focused on being: government gridlock; immigration and Catholic Church abuse. We'll see about these in the coming days and weeks now that Congress has reconvened and the pope has called bishops to the Vatican for a February summit to discuss preventing clergy sex abuse and protecting children.
The timeline for personal change is a little more flexible. From self-esteem fixes to exercise and dieting, American pursuits and personalities seem infinitely fungible and plastic.
I recently went to the dentist and got my usual cleaning, and the kindly hygienist then asked me how often I floss. Yikes, after my Catholic guilt kicked in, I replied, "once a week." The hygienist then said, "Maybe you can bump that up to twice a week, or so." I smilingly agreed, on Jan. 2, and made that one of my New Year's resolutions. Never too late!
As a priest, I'm in the "change business." And so through that "floss challenge," I realized, there are at least three essentials to change: First, an idea or challenge to rise to must be planted in the mind. Second, it must be realistic and achievable. Third, it must be transformative.
I recently challenged our flock on New Year's Day to pray more, read spiritual literature and develop bonds with others. A New York Times op-ed I read that same day - titled: "In Search of Lost Screen Time" - explored what we could do with a year away from smartphones. You could buy land and plant trees, make love, motivate others, read and read and read, wrote Paul Greenburg. Something to think about.
Happiness studies indicate contentment comes more from relation-building and human solidarity than from money and professional success. So, I'm working on my family - the spiritual and natural ones.
Exercise, too, is a proven way to improve your quality of life. Get off the grid and sofa, and move. It's so easy now for Americans with limited time as more physical studies imply that short, intense physical spurts of exercise, instead of long marathons, can alter one's body and mind, if done regularly.
As a pragmatic American, I recently found myself doing several of these activities all at once On my new smartphone I realized I could carry it while taking my Labrador dog, Bella, along the Potomac C&O Canal Oath for a walk while listening to Mozart's "The Magic Flute" playing joyfully in my shirt pocket. Good exercise while deepening a canine relationship and enjoying the arts (on a smartphone, yes, but two out of three ain't bad).

A Look at a Retail Giant's Blind Spots

Texto completo: Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.
Hi, I'm David Streitfeld, reporting from a very quiet week in Silicon Valley. The venture capitalists were at their vacation homes or exotic resorts, dreaming of riches to come. Entrepreneurs also must have taken time off, because I made it to San Jose in less than two hours, a personal record. There wasn't even a new data privacy scandal to occupy the pundits.
Amazon, however, never lets up. Chances are, something under your family Christmas tree or at your Hanukkah or Kwanzaa celebration was from the retailer. Perhaps everything was. Amazon's 210th and final press release of the year summarized the company's holiday season: best ever. If history is any guide, more than half those sales were made by third parties -- shops big and small that are in essence renting a stall in the Amazon bazaar.
With millions of marketplace sellers battling for a piece of the lucrative Amazon action, competition is fierce. Exactly how tough I didn't realize until I read a piece called "Prime and Punishment: Dirty Dealing in the $175 Billion Amazon Marketplace," by Josh Dzieza on the tech site the Verge. Almost as an aside, the article mentions that some unscrupulous sellers were taking an established competitor's product, setting it on fire and then posting photos saying it exploded. Amazon would go nuts and pull the product as a safety hazard, leaving a clear field for the shady new arrival.
Another common move, the article says, is to get a competitor's product reclassified as a sex toy, suppressing it from ordinary search results. This happened to a seller of childproof locks and outlet covers, whose sales dwindled to zero because absolutely no one was searching for "sexual childproof door lock."
At Amazon, the customer reigns supreme, which means sellers who are accused of doing something wrong need to confess to something, anything, even if they are the victim of another seller's sabotage. It's so difficult to mount a successful appeal that many merchants hire professional advisers to get them out of Amazon jail.
(I asked Amazon how often sellers took the arson route. In a statement, the retailer replied, "There are bad actors who attempt to undermine our store, but they do not reflect the flourishing community of honest entrepreneurs that make up the vast majority of our seller community.")
Amazon also turns up in a new story in Wired, which asks: Whatever happened to the Future Book? That is the writer Craig Mod's term for the immersive, interactive, highly connected thrill ride that would finally kill off the traditional boring physical book by, oh, 2015.
It didn't happen. "My Kindle Oasis -- one of the most svelte, elegant and expensive digital book containers you can buy in 2018 -- is about as interactive as a potato," Mr. Mod writes. One possible reason: Amazon had little competition for the Kindle, so innovation in e-readers ground to a halt.
Both the Wired and the Verge stories might seem to be about how Amazon is overextended, can't be all things to all people and needs to do what it already does better rather than keep expanding into new fields. But they're really about how Amazon wins even when it loses.
Mr. Mod's point is that while Kindles never killed physical books, there has nevertheless been an explosion of activity around the book. For instance, it is much simpler and much cheaper to publish yourself than it was 20 years ago. There has also been an explosion in recorded books that will only grow as smart speakers in the home become ubiquitous.
And who owns the leading home speaker company, the leading recorded books company and the biggest -- by far -- physical and digital bookstore? You guessed it.
As for the Amazon Marketplace sellers who are undermined by bad guys, Amazon has an answer: protection, for a price.
"When sellers get in trouble for customer complaints or attacks from counterfeiters," Mr. Dzieza writes, "the solution is often to more fully meld with Amazon -- to enroll in its fulfillment program, to purchase Amazon's labels to make sure product isn't being diverted or even make their brand exclusive to Amazon, which brings special protections."
A wrinkle about the third-party sellers that the Verge doesn't tackle is the way Amazon makes them sign what is called a most-favored-nation or M.F.N. clause, which stipulates they cannot sell on another site cheaper than they sell on Amazon. British and German regulators investigated the retailer's use of these clauses a few years ago, with the result that Amazon dropped the practice in Europe. But they're still in use in the United States.
In May, two law professors detailed the case against the M.F.N. restrictions as harmful to consumers in a Yale Law Journal article, "Antitrust Enforcement Against Platform MFNs." A few days before Christmas, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut picked up on the issue and wrote a four-page letter to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department saying he was "deeply concerned" that Amazon's M.F.N. contracts could stifle market competition and artificially inflate prices.
For instance, Mr. Blumenthal wrote, a competitor to Amazon might try to gain an edge by charging merchants a smaller commission. If those merchants also sell on Amazon, however, they could not pass along those savings to their customers, because of the M.F.N. clause. That would be bad for consumers while reinforcing Amazon's dominance. Amazon declined to comment.
■ It used to be that only a few cranks criticized Amazon, but that is rapidly shifting. Still, I was surprised at the take-no-prisoners tone of David Heinemeier Hansson, the programmer who writes and tweets as DHH, in an open letter to Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, on Medium.
"I think you're currently making bad decisions that you're going to regret. Maybe even decisions that we as a whole society will come to regret," DHH wrote. He added that Mr. Bezos still had time to shape his legacy "into something more than the man who killed retail, extracted the greatest loot from its HQ cities, and who expanded the most monopoly holdings the fastest."
DHH wrote his piece in November, but Medium surfaced it in its daily digest just last week. What makes his criticism especially noteworthy is that Mr. Bezos is a shareholder in DHH's software development company, Basecamp. DHH notes that he and his co-founder have not talked to Mr. Bezos for at least seven years but that "if we get another chance, this would be the most pressing topic."
■ One last new Amazon development, which might be the biggest of all: unionization. Workers at Amazon's biggest warehouse in Spain began a two-day strike on Thursday. Warehouse employees on Staten Island are calling for unionization, following the lead of colleagues in Minnesota. Here is a good wrap-up from the Guardian. Amazon has successfully stymied unionization efforts since the company began, so this shift is momentous.
■ In non-Amazon news, it appears that the answer to the eternal question of whether the world can have too many iPhones is: Quite likely.
■ Thanks to Apple's news, the stock market as I write is again plunging. But there's a silver lining for tech companies: They are big, and getting bigger, and a recession might only help them against the competition.

Texto completo: She was a sprightly girl of 18 when she ascended to the throne of the British Empire in 1837, and a revered global presence when she died in 1901 at 81.
In 2019, the Victorian Era will be again celebrated throughout Britain as the country honors the 200th anniversary of the queen's birth.
For those wanting to cross the Atlantic and join the celebrations, here is a roundup of the festivities that will be taking place, from museum exhibits to travel packages and tours.
Where it all began: Start at London's Kensington Palace, Victoria's birthplace, where a new exhibition opens May 24, the date the future queen was born in 1819. The preserved suite of rooms that Victoria and her mother, the Duchess of Kent, once occupied, will be filled with new interactive displays and objects never before seen by the public.
Don't miss the Pigott Gallery, where another new exhibit re-examines her life and legacy as a monarch, wife, mother and grandmother (she had nine children and 42 grandchildren), as well as the wardrobe room where one can see the queen's fashionable side, in contrast to the black gowns she donned during her long widowhood.
"We are celebrating an exceptional woman who was powerful, yet feminine, royal, and yet appealed to ordinary people," said Polly Putnam, the curator of the exhibit at the royal palace.
A royal tour: Though it's possible to visit the places frequented by Victoria on your own, National Trust Tours has created a 10-day Queen Victoria 200 trip that features important landmarks. It includes stops at Windsor Castle, Westminster Abbey and the chapel where she married Prince Albert. Priced at $4,950 a person, not including airfare.
Victoria in Yorkshire: Thanks to PBS, which has compiled a list of the filming locations from Season 2 of its popular British import, "Victoria," fans of the series can head to Yorkshire and see many of the coastal towns, gardens and estates featured in the show.
Just don't be disappointed to learn that certain locations are used as stand-ins, like Harewood House for Buckingham Palace, and Wentworth Woodhouse for Kensington Palace. The good news is that Wentworth, which was closed for 25 years, is now open to the public.

Resumen: From its post-recession low of 7,365 in February 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to 26,828 on Oct. 3, 2018. Since that lofty high, however, the Dow has lost one-sixth of its value, mostly because difficult-but-solvable economic problems - implementation of Brexit, for example, or the year-ending U.S. budget standoff - ran smack into political hackery and demagogy. Equally worrisome, the White House is becoming an empty island: 65 percent of "all senior White House aides," according to the Dec. 31 New York Times, "have departed" since Inauguration Day. Worse, the overall national debt is forecast to climb by $16 trillion over the next decade, due mostly to the 2017 tax cut and increased spending pushed by the White House and Congress.

Texto completo: Man, that ended badly.
December limped to an ugly conclusion as nearly everyone from Wall Street to Main Street took a year-end pounding not seen in three generations. Pick an investment sector (stocks, bonds, commodities); a nation state (the U.S., China, or the European Union); or a political system (a democratic republic, parliamentary, or single-party rule), and almost every one of them finished 2018 underwater, under siege, or under a cloud.
The connective tissue to all is as old and bowlegged as Father Time himself - bitter, stalemated politics. When national and international leaders fail to solve regional problems (Brexit, anyone?) or go out of their way to fuel new, global problems (cue tariffs), then investors from New York to Tokyo take their money and run.
Run where?
Out the door. Any door. Every door.
That anywhere-but-here behavior is in direct contrast to the past 10 years where the safest place to run was Wall Street. From its post-recession low of 7,365 in February 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to 26,828 on Oct. 3, 2018. Since that lofty high, however, the Dow has lost one-sixth of its value, mostly because difficult-but-solvable economic problems - implementation of Brexit, for example, or the year-ending U.S. budget standoff - ran smack into political hackery and demagogy.
And that's not just the case in Washington or London, but also in Paris, Brussels, Warsaw, New Delhi, Budapest, Brasilia, Mexico City and elsewhere.
Washington, once a beacon for freedom and free markets, now leads this parade of retreat. After using 2017 to tear up treaties, betray friendships, and shred hard-won, post-war norms, the U.S. spent most of last year confirming that it's an erratic trader, unreliable ally, and geo-political cipher.
As such, 2019 begins with much of the world thinking America has lost its political bearing and collective marbles. It's right.
For proof, consider where New Year's Day found the nation.
One-fourth of the U.S government, including the Department of Agriculture, was closed for the 11th straight day over a piddling $3.5 billion, literally a microscopic grain of sand in the miles of beach that is our federal spending.
Even more incredible, the number of active investigations of alleged corruption within the Trump administration now stands at 17. That's a staggering total made even more so in that it occurred under a Republican-led government.
Equally worrisome, the White House is becoming an empty island: 65 percent of "all senior White House aides," according to the Dec. 31 New York Times, "have departed" since Inauguration Day. Even more remarkable, 10 of these now-gone officials were members of the Trump Cabinet.
And for those of us whose last civics lesson was decades ago, there are 15 Cabinet posts; 16, if you include the vice president. By either measure, losing two-thirds of your departmental leaders in less than two years is historical, debilitating, and just plain nuts.
Arguably, the only numbers worse than the White House unemployment rate are numbers that detail the U.S. economy.
One year after Republicans in Congress bulled through a $1.9 trillion tax cut, their outrageous (and they knew it) prediction of 5 percent Gross Domestic Product growth has given way to - and fingers crossed at that - a much-more-realistic estimate of 2 percent growth.
That downward GDP revision means their supply-side, "voodoo" tax cut, however, is certain to increase one thing: the federal deficit. Before the cut, the 2018 deficit was projected to be $500 billion. This past October - at, not coincidentally, the same time the stock market began stumbling toward its worst December since 1931 - the deficit weighed in at a fat $779 billion.
The 2019 federal deficit will be even higher; current estimates place it north of $1 trillion. Worse, the overall national debt is forecast to climb by $16 trillion over the next decade, due mostly to the 2017 tax cut and increased spending pushed by the White House and Congress.
So, Happy New Year and let's pray 2019's rough start isn't a precursor of the year ahead.
But don't count on it.

Gun deaths rise to record levels in US

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
Even with Democrats taking power in the House on Thursday, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream.
The good news is that after last year's shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns, and a license to buy handguns. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat. It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3.4 per 100,000.
Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchases of guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt "red flag" laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person's firearm until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Despite the disconnect between the majority of Americans who want sensible gun control and a Congress that does nothing about it, headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks. American carnage doesn't have to be a tragedy without end. — USA TODAY

Three Resolutions For the New Year

Texto completo: It's not uncommon for people to set unrealistic expectations when making New Year's resolutions, which likely contributes to most of them failing. Over 90 percent of them do, according to research by the University of Scranton.
So this year, why not focus on improving just one area: your travels, and making sure you travel well.
"Vacation is essential to our well being," said Penny Zenker, a business strategy and life coach. "In order to be creative, think strategically and create balance in our lives we need to disconnect from our day to day activities."
With this in mind, here are three ways to get the most out of your travels in 2019.
Take more time off
It's important to remember that vacation days are typically part of one's compensation but the onus is on you to take them. (The GfK-Oxford Economics study found that 52 percent of American workers had unused vacation days by the end of 2017, which equates to 705 million unused days for the year.)
"The employer agreed to the terms of vacation, which is usually its duration, not its timing, at hiring," said Holly Weeks, a communication consultant and professor at the Harvard Kennedy School. "Timing is generally not part of the agreement and is left to the preference and discretion of the employee, with accommodation of the employer as a courtesy."
There are things you can do to make it a smoother process for everyone involved.
Plan early so you can give as much advance notice as possible, being mindful of when your company or team's busy times of the year are. Also, consider a vacation-planning lunch or shared calendar with your colleagues to avoid potential timing conflicts.
When you make the request with your boss, treat it with the same amount of respect as any other important workplace issue.
"I would not apologize for my decision," Ms. Weeks said. "I would honor it as important and valuable, the same way I would honor a business decision I made after thoughtful consideration."
Ease up on the to-do lists
"I find one of the biggest killers of fun while traveling is forcing yourself to adhere to a strict daily schedule," said Kayla Matthews, a productivity and technology expert.
Unfortunately, trips don't plan themselves (unless you hire a travel planner). But you can strike a middle ground of having solid logistics while still leaving room for spontaneity.
"Checklists definitely help for the major components: flights, hotels, car rental, tickets or reservations. As for organizational techniques, I'd say that different people have different comfort levels with plans and schedules," said Laura Vanderkam, time management expert and author of "Off the Clock: Feel Less Busy While Getting More Done."
For the trip itself, Ms. Vanderkam suggests planning one anchor activity for each day of the trip, especially if you're traveling with a group. "People who like plans and schedules will probably be fine if they know they've got one cool thing planned for the day -- the rest of the day can go as it will. People who like to be spontaneous can take comfort that there's only one thing on the schedule," Ms. Vanderkam said.
Stress less about packing
Do you insist on never checking a bag? Maybe it's time to let this one go and cut some stress.
"Yes, getting gate checked is a small hassle, but your luggage is usually taken by hand and put into the front of the hold, which means it's often the first bag to come out when the plane is unloaded," Kit Dillon, an editor at Wirecutter, The New York Times company that reviews products, said. "It really doesn't add that much time to your trip, unless you need to make a connection."
If you're ready to take this leap, treat yourself to a new checked luggage bag. For most travelers, Mr. Dillon recommends Travelpro's Elite 25-Inch Expandable Spinner Suiter. It can comfortably hold two weeks' worth of clothes, is sleek and durable, and comes with a lifetime warranty.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets of the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
U.S. News and World Report has released its annual rankings of the Best Diets for 2019, revealing the Mediterranean diet was the best overall choice.
Each diet description below is a rating of its effectiveness, based on U.S. News and World Report rankings. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions this year.
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet. Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.1/5 Weight Loss | 1.5/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.7/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 3.0/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.4/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.9/5 on Healthy
A healthy diet doesn't require a complete life change. Instead, make smarter choices more often when shopping, cooking and eating.

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts —started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change . . . To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2. 2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99. 8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown is headed towards a third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House, only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off.
Trump, who has demanded $5. 6 billion to help pay for a border wall, acknowledged he had warned Democrat leaders that an impasse could last for months or even years if a deal cannot be reached on financing for the wall.

Texto completo: FRONT PAGE
An article on Friday about Paul N. Whelan's arrest in Russia described incorrectly his university education. Mr. Whelan attended Northern Michigan University from the fall semester of 1988 until the fall semester of 1990 but did not complete his bachelor's degree, according to the school; he did not graduate from the University of Michigan. (The information came from Mr. Whelan's Russian social media account, where he said he studied at the University of Michigan.)
NATIONAL
An article on Wednesday about how Native Americans have been affected by the government shutdown, using information from an Interior Department report from January 2018, gave outdated figures for the number of employees set to be furloughed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. It is 2,295 of 4,057, not 2,662 of 4,490.
BUSINESS
The Wheels column on Friday about high-end sound systems for cars misidentified an Acura model in reference to sound profiles. The RLX has a sound profile different from the hybrid versions, not the RDX.
WEEKEND ARTS
An article on Friday about recommended winter TV series misstated the premiere date for the third season of "High Maintenance." It will debut on Jan. 20, not Jan. 19.
ARTS & LEISURE
An article on Page 1 about the artists Gillie and Marc Schattner, using information from the artists and the MetroTech BID, misidentifies the organization that secured "The Last Three" sculpture in Brooklyn's MetroTech Commons. While MetroTech Commons is a privately operated space within the MetroTech BID, the BID did not secure the work. The error is repeated in a picture caption. The article also misstates Jennifer Lantzas's position with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. She is its deputy director of public art, not its public arts coordinator.
TRAVEL
An article on Page 1 about Jada Yuan's experiences traveling the world for The New York Times misstates the surname of a woman who was murdered in Washington last year. She was Wendy Martinez, not Marina. The article also misidentifies a farmer in Puerto Rico who told her and a friend about a party. He is Elmer Sánchez, not Rafael.
OBITUARIES
An obituary on Friday about Herb Kelleher, the co-founder of Southwest Airlines, misstated his middle name. It was David, not Dwight.

Weather affecting public opinion

Texto completo: Our best hope may be the weather.
For a long time, many people thought that it was a mistake to use the weather as evidence of climate change. Weather patterns contain a lot of randomness. Even as the Earth warms and extreme weather becomes more common, some years are colder and calmer than others. If you argue that climate change is causing some weather trend, a climate denier may respond by making grand claims about a recent snowfall.
And yet the weather still has one big advantage over every other argument about the urgency of climate change: We experience the weather. We see it and feel it.
It is not a complex data series in an academic study or government report. It's not a measurement of sea level or ice depth in a place you've never been. It's right in front of you. And although weather patterns do have a lot of randomness, they are indeed changing. That's the thing about climate change: It changes the climate.
The story of climate change in 2018 was complicated - overwhelmingly bad, yet with two reasons for hope. The bad and the good were connected, too: Thanks to the changing weather, more Americans seem to be waking up to the problem.
I'll start with the alarming parts of the story. The past year is on pace to be the Earth's fourth-warmest on record, and the five warmest years have all occurred since 2010. This warming is now starting to cause a lot of damage.
In 2018, heat waves killed people in Montreal, Karachi, Tokyo and elsewhere. Extreme rain battered North Carolina and the Indian state of Kerala. The Horn of Africa suffered from drought. Large swaths of the American West burned. When I was in Portland, Ore., this summer, the air quality - from nearby wildfires - was among the worst in the world. It would have been healthier to be breathing outdoors in Beijing or Mumbai.
Amid all of this destruction, Donald Trump's climate agenda consists of making the problem worse. His administration is filled with former corporate lobbyists, and they have been changing federal policy to make it easier for companies to pollute. These officials like to talk about free enterprise and scientific uncertainty, but their real motive is usually money. Sometimes, they don't even wait to return to industry jobs. Both Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke, two now-departed pro-pollution Cabinet secretaries, engaged in on-the-job corruption.
I often want to ask these officials: Deep down, do you really believe that future generations of your own family will be immune from climate change's damage? Or have you chosen not to think very much about them?
As for the two main reasons for hope: The first is that the Trump administration is an outlier. Most major governments are trying to slow climate change. So are many states in this country, as well as some big companies and nonprofit groups. This global coalition is the reason that the recent climate summit in Poland "yielded much more," as Nat Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund said, "than many of us had thought might be possible."
The second reason for hope is public opinion. No, it isn't changing nearly as rapidly as I wish. Yet it is changing, and the weather seems to be a factor. The growing number of extreme events - wildfires, storms, floods and so on - are hard to ignore.
Only 40 percent of Americans called the quality of environment "good" or "excellent" in a Gallup Poll this past year, the lowest level in almost a decade. And 61 percent said the environment was getting worse. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 66 percent of Americans said they wanted to see action to combat climate change. Some polls even suggest that Republican voters are becoming anxious about the situation.
The politics of climate change remains devilishly hard, especially because so many people around the world feel frustrated about their living standards. France's "gilet jaune" protests, after all, were sparked by a proposed energy tax. Compared with day-to-day life, the effects of climate change have long felt distant, almost theoretical.
But now those effects are becoming real, and they are terrifying. To anyone who worries about making a case for climate action based on the weather, I would simply ask: Do you have a better idea?

Powell: Fed 'will be patient' as it mulls more rate hikes, boosting stocks

Texto completo: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank “will be patient” as it weighs future interest rate hikes in light of low inflation, adding that policymakers will also take into account recent stock market volatility.
Powell seemed to deliberately convey a more cautious approach to rate hikes this year than he did during a news conference last month after the Fed raised rates for a fourth time in 2018.
"With muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves,” Powell said in a discussion with former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke at the American Economic Association and Allied Social Science Association's annual meeting in Atlanta. The talk was moderated by New York Times reporter Neil Irwin.
The Dow Jones industrial average, already up about 400 points after a booming jobs report, leaped another 400 points by early afternoon following Powell’s remarks.
Powell also said he would not resign if asked to do so by President Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Powell for lifting rates and crimping the faster economic growth Trump has promised. Trump has reportedly discussed the possibility of firing Powell, news that further intensified a market sell-off last month.
A president can dismiss a Fed board member only “for cause,” and it’s unclear if he can remove a Fed chief who could continue to serve on the board. Experts, however, have said such a move would roil markets and jeopardize the Fed’s independence.
While Fed officials have been providing a generally upbeat view of the economy, Powell noted the market has plunged from its early fall peak because of fears of slowing global growth and the Trump administration’s trade fight with China, among other factors.
“We're listening carefully to that and we’re going to be taking that downside risk into account” as Fed policymakers decide whether to raise interest rates, Powell said Friday.
He seemed to compare the Fed's flexible approach to early 2016, when the central bank forecast four rate hikes that year but wound up hiking just once amid a market sell-off, economic troubles abroad and a drop in oil prices.
"Powell’s message was unmistakable, in our opinion," says economist Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase.
Powell also said the Fed would be willing to pause its campaign to shrink the $3. 5 trillion portfolio of bonds that it purchased during and after the Great Recession to lower long-term interest rates – presumably if the economy weakened significantly.
“We said we’d be prepared to adjust” the plan “as appropriate to achieve our” objectives of solid economic growth and stable inflation, Powell said. “We wouldn’t hesitate to change it. ”
By contrast, at his December news conference, Powell reiterated the Fed’s view that the balance sheet reduction was on autopilot and the Fed was relying on its benchmark short-term interest rate to tweak the economy’s temperature. His remarks further fueled investor concerns that Powell and the Fed were blithely moving forward with a campaign to tap the brakes on the economy despite scant evidence of inflation, market turbulence, slowing global growth and forecasts for weakening activity in the U. S.
Fed officials instead focused on the economy’s recent performance, which has reflected healthy growth and unemployment that has dropped below 4 percent.
Last month, Fed policymakers forecast two rate hikes in 2019, down from its previous estimate of three, but fed fund futures markets were pricing in just one move. Lately, markets have expected none.
The stock market punished the Fed by plummeting further after Powell's December news conference, hurting consumer and business confidence and raising the prospect that the dimmer outlook could itself hurt the economy.
On Friday, Powell seemed to be acknowledging that he and other Fed officials got the message, and markets responded in kind.
"When we get conflicting signals, policy is very much about risk management," Powell said.

Texto completo: COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa — When Elizabeth Warren walked into the event room next to a bowling alley here Friday evening, she effectively kicked off a presidential primary contest that is already making Democrats' heads spin.
“There's going to be so many candidates this year," Scott Punteney, chair of the Pottawattamie County Democratic Party, said before Warren's arrival. “It's just way early."
For Warren, that may be precisely the point. With her five-city campaign swing on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, as well as the hiring of four staffers who know the state well, the Massachusetts senator appears to be betting she can plant her flag and shape the race before other top candidates are officially in.
Speaking to a crowd of about 500 that spilled into the parking lot outside, Warren mixed the story of her biography with the economic populism she hopes will capture voters far from her base in Massachusetts.
“Every issue that we face — gun safety, environmental disaster, student loan debt, Social Security — they all intersect at this problem of corruption, they all intersect at a Washington that is working for the wealthy and well connected, and not for you," Warren said, drawing knowing groans and cheers from the crowd as she pilloried the influence of money in politics and called for fundamental economic change, raising her voice to compensate for her microphone cutting out.
At times, Warren joked about her inexperience on the stump — although she has won two elections — and exclaimed excitedly in response to voters' questions. Cutting funding for Planned Parenthood clinics? “Bad," she said, before launching into a longer answer. A question on foreign policy elicited a loud “Alright!" before she identified autocratic leaders around the globe as a threat to the United States and took a dig at President Trump: “I believe that you should know the difference between your friends and your enemies."
Warren's visit this weekend, four days after announcing she is exploring a run for president, will be a crucial test of her appeal beyond Massachusetts, but Iowa could be a tricky battleground. She has not campaigned there in years, and while her economic message may resonate with voters, she may find some discomfort with her willingness to tangle so openly with the president and other Republicans. Still, her decision to go to Iowa first — and build up her campaign staff there — suggests she views it as critical to her efforts to rise to the top of a crowded field.
“She's not waiting around to see if Bernie's in the race, she's not waiting to see if there are other women," said Joe Trippi, a longtime campaign manager and Democratic political consultant. “Get in now, start to build your network in Iowa."
Speaking to reporters after she took a series of questions from the audience, Warren rejected the idea that her status as a progressive firebrand makes her too liberal for a purple state like Iowa. “I have to say, on these core economic issues, on the notion of a level playing field, I think there are a lot of Democrats and a lot of Republicans who want our country to work better," she said.
But Warren is already a top target for Republicans, even though the 2020 presidential race has barely begun. Trump made an effort to ensure the lingering questions over her claims of Native American heritage — and her attempt to substantiate them — will follow her to the first caucus state by tweeting a dig at the controversy earlier this week, although the issue did not come up at Friday's event.
This weekend's trip is Warren's first swing through Iowa since she stumped for a Senate candidate there in 2014 — making her a latecomer to the state following visits by possible presidential candidates including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and a particularly buzzy speech by Cory Booker last fall.
“It's important for everybody this year. I think it's even more important than usual, because of how fast the calendar plays out," Trippi said, explaining that a win in Iowa might help candidates pick up a pile of delegates in California's primary, which is scheduled to begin early voting the same day as the Iowa caucuses.
Warren's weekend itinerary includes a mix of small and large events. After Council Bluffs, she will appear in a grand theater in Sioux City on Saturday before heading to a roundtable in Storm Lake and another event in Des Moines. She is scheduled to cap the weekend with a “conversation with women leaders" in Ankeny, a suburb of Des Moines, on Sunday.
Some of the voters who squeezed in to see Warren wore “She persisted" T-shirts, referencing the time she was reprimanded by Mitch McConnell, ostensibly for speaking too long on the Senate floor. Others spoke glowingly of her work on consumer protection. But Warren tried to connect more deeply with voters by talking about her modest upbringing, far from the halls of Harvard and the Capitol with which she is more readily associated.
Some of the voters gathered in Council Bluffs drew a connection between Warren's story and their own economic frustrations.
“I have a master's degree, and I make as much as my dad did, and he had a high school diploma," said Heather Reikofski, a social worker who lives in town. She said she supported Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016, but said she could see herself supporting Warren this time.
Iowa is also a place where people watching the prices of agricultural commodities such as soybeans and hogs fall under Trump's tariffs may take a shine to Warren's trademark message of economic populism.
“Iowa was devastated in the farm crisis in the 1980s when I grew up there and they understand what it's like to be left behind, to have the economy shift and have the ground fall out underneath you, and Warren understands that," said Katie Porter, a newly elected California congresswoman, in an interview outside a swearing-in-day reception for Warren at the Capitol.
Progressives who wanted to draft Warren to run for president in 2016 kicked off their campaign in the state. But that was before Sanders, of Vermont, nearly won the Iowa caucus with his populist message, and, this time around, the state's progressives already seem to be dividing their loyalties.
A poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers taken by CNN and the Des Moines Register in December found Warren in fourth place behind Joe Biden, Beto O'Rourke, and Sanders, none of whom have announced exploratory committees. That underscores two challenges for Warren this weekend: She is not coming in as an obvious front-runner, and she might be compared, in voters' minds, to the idealized versions of other campaigns that have yet to take shape.
“What I want to see is what the field's going to look like, and how these individuals do in putting together outreach around the state," said Matt McCoy, a former Democratic state senator and current Polk County supervisor, adding that Warren had called him late last year as she laid the groundwork for her presidential announcement.
“I think people in rural Iowa are going to be more open to her message than they would be if things were booming," McCoy said.
Warren's willingness to take on Trump in Twitter tangles and pointed public speeches could give some voters additional pause.
“I don't know if it's important to get into arguments with the president. I don't think that does any good," said Punteney, the chair of the Pottawattamie County Democratic Party, who said he is nevertheless looking for a candidate “who's definitely going to stand up for themselves."
On Wednesday, Warren's exploratory committee announced it had added four campaign operatives in Iowa, including one who was Sanders' caucus director in 2016, which could be seen as a progressive coup for Warren. Pat Rynard, a political blogger in Iowa, wrote that it was “noteworthy" Warren had already taken a considerable bite out of the universe of Iowa political staffers.
“Taking this group of people off the board so early may put pressure on other potential candidates to speed up their timelines," Rynard wrote.

Texto completo: Alvin Ailey was an African-American choreographer and activist who founded the Alivin Ailey American Dance Theater (1958) and the Ailey School (1969) in New York City. He is credited with helping to popularize modern dance and helping to revolutionize African-American participation in concert type performance dance. Ailey went on to receive the Kennedy Center Honors in 1988 and, in 2014, President Obama selected Ailey to be a posthumous recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
I first became aware of the brilliance of Alvin Ailey while learning the lead role of Odette/Odile in Swan Lake. I had the good fortune to be taught the role by the great dramatic ballerina, Sallie Wilson, who often spoke about working with Alvin Ailey in 1970 in the creation of his magnificent work, The River, and I became an immediate fan of the choreographer after seeing Wilson perform it.
And when I was on a program that featured Judith Jamison in Ailey's solo work, "Cry" (created in 1970), I was again made acutely aware of the innovative genius of this choreographer. I remember standing in the wings watching the statuesque, magnificent female artist, thinking, "This is one of the best pieces of performance art I have ever seen." (Jameson became the Artistic Director of the Ailey company from 1989 to 2011).
It was in 1974, inspired by Ailey's mission to provide dance performances, training, and community programs for all people, that the Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble was established under the direction of Sylvia Waters to combine rigorous touring with extensive community outreach. I had the good fortune to hire one of the original members of the Ailey Ensemble as a guest principal artist when, prior to the formation of Sierra Nevada Ballet, I co-directed The Reno Ballet with Raphael Barkley in 1995 and 1996. Jonathan Reisling's powerful athleticism, artistic nuance and professional good humor were the direct result of the Ailey experience and made him a fine example to dancers everywhere.
Presently under artistic director Troy Powell, this second company (now known as Ailey II) continues to thrive. The New York Times declared, "There's nothing like an evening with Ailey II, the younger version of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater."
Ailey II's 2018-19 tour will reach audiences in dozens of cities across the globe, including Nevada's "Biggest Little City."
Thanks to Artown, Woodburn and Wedge, Ailey II will perform at the Pioneer Center in Reno on Feb 22 at 7:30 p.m.
"I am very excited about this incredible opportunity coming to Reno," said Artown executive director Beth Macmillan. "We at Artown make every effort to inspire our community through the arts by offering Artown members a 10 percent discount and $15 student tickets."
We are very fortunate to have such a spectacular event, and our community should not miss seeing this company that Dance Magazine calls: "second to none."
Ailey II performs Friday, Febr. 22, 2019 at 7:30 p.m. at the Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts in Reno. Tickets range from $25 to $55 with a student ticket price of $15.
For tickets, call the Pioneer at 866-553-6605, go online to PioneerCenter.com or visit the Pioneer Center Box Office Monday through Friday, 11 a.m to 6 p.m.). For additional information, visit Artown.org or call the Artown office at 775-322-1538.

Five ways to give yourself a raise

Texto completo: Everyone starts out a new year with the best intentions. We're going to lose weight, or eat better, or work out more. I don't know about you, but I'm as guilty as anyone when it comes to shelling out a bunch of money for a workout class and then quitting by Valentine's Day.
One of the biggest areas where people miss an opportunity to be intentional is in their personal finances. Seventy-eight percent of Americans aren't getting ahead because they live paycheck to paycheck. Money problems remain a top reason that married couples fight. And one in five of you reading this aren't putting any money into savings.
Instead, Americans are maxing out credit cards, making hefty car payments, and are up to their eyeballs in debt. It's the same story year after year. So why not make 2019 the year you start winning with money? Here are five ways to give yourself a raise this year:
Cut back on your monthly subscriptions. Take a look at your online subscriptions. Is there anything you need to cancel? Maybe an online fitness class you only use once every three months? That cash could be an extra something in your pocket! Or can you go down a level to save money? For example, Hulu has three price points — in the cheaper version, you'll just see a few more ads.
Make the "unsubscribe" button your new BFF. Set aside 30 minutes to sift through your email inbox. Open up all those promotional emails tempting you with sales and special offers, scroll to the bottom and click "unsubscribe." Once you stop getting the emails, you won't be tempted to spend so much money on things you weren't even looking for to begin with.
Create monthly financial resolutions. This may sound overwhelming, but quick wins are important. Write down 12 financial goals you'd like to achieve by the end of 2019, and assign one to each month. Maybe you want to pay off a credit card by May, or save $500 by September. You'll be more likely to reach your goals if you keep them simple, make them tangible, and believe you can do it.
Transition your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. The traditional IRA works on the "save money now, pay later" system. In this system, you don't pay taxes on the money you contribute now, but you will have to pay taxes when you take the money out. A better choice is the Roth IRA. With this retirement savings account, you pay taxes up front. That way, you're not taxed when you withdraw in retirement. Translation: a Roth IRA lets you grow your money tax-free, saving you thousands in the long run.
Create sinking funds. Life happens. Come up with a list of things you might need extra cash for — things like holidays, birthdays, weddings, new tires, home repairs, and more. Save for those things using sinking funds.
For example, let's say you want to save $400 to travel to your friend's June wedding. Divide $400 by the number of months you have left to save: $400 divided by six months is $67. You'll need to save $67 per month in order to dance the night away at that wedding. If you're looking for an easy-to-use, free budgeting app, I recommend EveryDollar. This app will help you make a plan for your money. And they have a fund feature built right into the app.
If you're serious about making a fresh start with your money, these tips will get you set up financially for 2019. This time next year, you could be in an entirely different situation. So, make 2019 the year you start winning with money!

I Found Iris Murdoch in a Stranger's Closet

Texto completo: I grew up in a family in which reading wasn't simply a regular activity, it was a public one. Books were everywhere, lying broken-spined on kitchen counters and bathroom radiators, in unmade beds, splayed on chair arms. They were passed from one of us to another -- volumes by Agatha Christie, C.S. Lewis, Georgette Heyer, Jane Austen, George Eliot, Charles Dickens -- and discussed at the dinner table, in the car, on walks. Keeping tabs on other people's reading was a form of check-in, a way of showing love.
"I've got nothing to read," one of my sisters might complain and one of our parents would say, "Here," and hand her something, and off she would go, into her room, into a corner, for hours.
Visiting other homes was also a way to discover people's books, what they liked, what we shared. But one summer when I was 10, I found myself in a bookless house in southern Sicily for a month with my academic father, my writer mother and my two older sisters, accompanied only by the Agatha Christie I'd taken for the plane, and which I'd finished before we landed. "What was I thinking? Why hadn't I brought anything else? I suddenly had Nothing to Read.
I scoured the airy, cliff side house until, finally, up high in a closet, I found a small box of books in English. All by a contemporary British writer I had never heard of: Iris Murdoch. The first one I opened was called "The Severed Head," and it -- like much of Murdoch's work -- combined a kind of dark mythological bent with a cerebral, talkative, psychologically misguided set of characters. Oh, and lots of discreetly mentioned sex -- hetero- and homo-, extramarital, even incestuous, all charged with violence, betrayal and yearning -- utterly thrilling to an overly protected kid like me.
If you're not familiar with the works of Iris Murdoch, "The Severed Head" is an excellent place to start. Married man with mistress discovers wife is leaving him for their psychoanalyst. Everyone is so concerned for everyone else -- husband and wife help each other move, the analyst's sister (also his lover, it turns out) sticks her nose in everywhere, and by the end, each character has a new partner and it seems that the world has reshuffled into better order, at least for the moment. Madcap as it sounds, it's calm on the page. Murdoch's prose is elegant, validating itself by its own certainty.
"I loved to give Georgie outrageous things, absurd garments and gewgaws which I could not possibly have given Antonia, barbarous necklaces and velvet pants and purple underwear and black openwork tights which drove me mad. I rose now and wandered about the room, watching her possessively as with a tense demure consciousness of my gaze she adjusted the lurid stockings." Reading this passage alone in my room, I began to see why my sisters found the adult world so fascinating.
I went on to read the rest of the books in that box, which included "The Bell," "The Red and the Green," "The Italian Girl" and "The Nice and the Good." This was the summer of 1969, and so Murdoch had only published 12 of what would turn out to be 26 novels. She was 50 years old, and had not yet been named to the order of the British Empire or won the Booker Prize, nor exhibited symptoms of the Alzheimer's disease that would end her life in 1999. The sexually open-minded Murdoch had only a few years earlier married the largely asexual literary critic John Bayley, but I knew nothing of her past, or her present, and, of course, nothing of her future. (I would learn more later by reading A.N. Wilson's "Iris Murdoch as I Knew Her" and John Bayley's own memoir, Elegy for Iris.) I only knew at the time that I responded to -- no, loved -- her books.
I read "my" Murdochs in my tiny bedroom that summer, acutely aware of the noises of my family going about its vacation life on the other side of the door. I did not share her with them. If someone had asked me, "What's your book?" I might have lied, even going so far as to say I was reading "Murder on the Orient Express" yet again.
After all these years, I have to ask myself why did I need to keep Iris Murdoch's novels to myself? Was it simply because the books were "dirty"? They weren't really, at least not in the way of dirty books, which I would find my way to later on. They were frank about the omnipresence of sex, of longing, the wish to be taken seriously, of grown-ups with sudden childish passions that seemed, at least to me, to be true. Her people voiced prejudice, held misguided notions, and Murdoch took them down, but with understanding and affection. Marriages ended, things were said, there was way too much drinking and even some fighting, and life went on. Yes, in Murdoch's world, characters behaved badly and were not always punished for it. And even if they were, they found their way to reasonable fates.
In my "Read this" and "I have a book for you" family, no one had ever mentioned Murdoch. Her novels weren't part of our approved canon. And yet I adored her and her belief that love could come from any direction and in any guise, that there were different kinds and each of them was good. Men were sometimes superior to women, and sometimes women were in charge. Children were wise and adults idiotic, and everyone was attempting some humanly self-interested version of their best. Dame Iris Murdoch had been a philosophy don at Oxford before she became a novelist, and as far as I was concerned, her philosophy of life was spot on, as someone in a British novel might say.
I had, I think, finally been introduced to the private world of reading that many people inhabit; a dream state I now regard as a portal to the act of breathing life into fictional worlds of one's own. That first Murdoch novel seemed like a belief system transformed into story, given to me to make of it what I wanted, on my own. Her novels were, that summer, an introduction to the acceptability of strangeness, to the beauty found outside shared experience, and most of all, an introduction to the glorious privacy of reading.
Beyond 'A Severed Head': An Iris Murdoch Starter Kit
Go for the books Murdoch is best known for, particularly the Booker Prize-winning, 'THE SEA, THE SEA,' about a retired theater director who learns that his adolescent love, Hartley, has retired with her husband to the same coastal town and decides that they should, decades later, renew their relationship. Stay tuned for kidnapping, attempted murder, a roundelay of appearances from past lovers and their lovers, plus wonderful descriptive passages about the sea in all phases of weather.
'THE UNICORN,' in which a young governess comes to live with a wealthy woman who is being held prisoner in a remote seaside house by the employees of her absent husband.
'A FAIRLY HONORABLE DEFEAT.' One of its strands a terrific fictional portrait of enduring gay love, here tested when the devilish Julius King bets another friend that he can break up the long partnership of Axel and Simon.
The Whitbread-winning 'THE SACRED AND PROFANE LOVE MACHINE' for more adultery and much ado about whether "pure" love or erotic love matters most.
'THE GREEN KNIGHT,' loosely based on Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and featuring a possible murder, a mother and her rivalrous daughters, and a monk and his dog.

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Two of the five worst mass shootings in recent U. S. history occurred in 2017, including in Las Vegas where a gunman barricaded in a high-rise hotel slaughtered 58 people at a music concert below. Mass killings kept happening last year: at a high school in Parkland, Florida; another school in Santa Fe, Texas; a synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Then, of course, there was the daily toll of less-publicized shootings and self-inflicted fatalities.
SEN. JOHN KENNEDY: Don't trample on the Second Amendment
Even with Democrats taking power in the House on Thursday, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream, particularly given the power of the national gun lobby and continued Republican control of the Senate and White House.
The good news is that after the Parkland shooting, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
►More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns, and a license to buy handguns. The restrictions go further than federal background checks. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat.
It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3. 4 per 100,000.
►Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchasing guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards buying firearms and ammo, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
►Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt “red flag” laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person’s firearm for a limited period of time until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Despite the disconnect between the majority of Americans who want sensible gun control and a Congress that does nothing about it, headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks. American carnage doesn't have to be a tragedy without end.

Texto completo: The power ballad that anchors "Vox Lux" might stick with you for some time - if not for its almost mechanical catchiness, then for the circumstances surrounding its creation. In real life, "Wrapped Up" was co-written by Sia, the Australian multi-hyphenate known for her pop earworms. In the movie, it's co-written by Celeste (Raffey Cassidy), a Staten Island eighth-grader who narrowly survives a school shooting in 1999.
Celeste and her older sister perform "Wrapped Up" in front of their community as a means to heal. But after a record label takes notice and encourages Celeste to change a lyric from "I" to "we," the song leaps from the memorial service to the radio waves. Suddenly, her trauma belongs to the world.
"A lot of the songs that are early on in this movie ... they weren't designed for the masses. They just came from the heart," director Brady Corbet told The Washington Post. "As the film progresses, the songs sort of change. The lyrics, at least in the context of the film, speak to generalities and platitudes that are a little bit like an audience having their tarot read."
That could apply to many forms of mainstream art, but "Vox Lux" posits that it is especially true of pop music. Corbet's film highlights the sincere but fixates on what he calls the "rather disturbing aspects" of pop stardom, both of which 31-year-old Celeste (a melodramatic Natalie Portman) captures when she explains the reasoning behind her shallow lyrics: "I don't want people to think too hard," she says about halfway through the film. "I just want them to feel good."
But are those experiences mutually exclusive? What is "Vox Lux," a movie sympathetic to its troubled artist, trying to say about pop music?
If the questions sound familiar, that's because similar ones came up about two months ago with "A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper's movie featuring enamored protagonists who famously sing about being "far from the shallow now." (Jude Law, who plays Celeste's manager, once referred to "Vox Lux" as the other film's "wicked sister.") As country rocker Jackson Maine (Cooper) struggles with addiction and witnesses his career fall apart, aspiring songwriter-turned-pop star Ally (Lady Gaga) goes from writing songs Jackson considers meaningful to performing a catchy song with lyrics that praise his, ahem, assets on "Saturday Night Live."
Jackson doesn't take the compliment well and instead laments the direction Ally's career has taken - basically, the selling-out story line that we've seen many times before. But this conversation is layered. The songwriters, including Diane Warren, didn't intend for "Why Did You Do That?" to be considered a bad song. And while Gaga told Variety the song is "relatively shallow," Cooper said he didn't "necessarily view (Ally's) music as superficial. I think she's performing with all her heart."
The song signifies Ally selling out, yes, but is that from Jackson's point of view or the filmmaker's? Are we, as audience members, supposed to side with him? Or is he, as some have cleverly mused online, an "unreliable narrator whose world view the film critiques throughout"?
When asked whether he thinks his film and "A Star Is Born" portray pop music in a negative light, Corbet laughed at the implied notion that, as he put it, "something which is very popular is under attack."
"The idea that anybody needs to come to the defense of one of the most lucrative industries in America is totally ridiculous," he continued.
The songs in "Vox Lux" aren't supposed to be bad, per se. Corbet recruited Sia to co-write the music and described the results as "affected and intoxicating," which is especially true of "Wrapped Up." Songs like "Private Girl," in which Celeste declares that she is "a private girl in a public world," and "Firecracker," in which she claims to have "a sixth sense on where the party is headed," are a bit more grating.
"Natalie's character serves as an avatar to talk about the ... patterns that mark our contemporary values in this country," Corbet explained. "It's not about pop music, it's about pop culture. The pop songs are avatars to describe the pros and cons of pop culture."
So it isn't necessarily Celeste's music at which "Vox Lux" takes aim, but the detriments of the culture surrounding it. Her tragedy is "exploited by the pop music industry," according to Corbet, and she is encouraged to produce music that often speaks more to generic experiences than her own. Without a proper emotional outlet, and haunted by childhood trauma, she acts out. She uses drugs. She yells at her manager. She yells at her sister. She yells at complete strangers.
Celeste ends up a cog in a machine, but at the same time, she sort of is the machine. The first half of the film is about how the culture shaped her, Corbet said, and the second is about how she, in turn, shapes the culture. Celeste not only sings but also speaks to her fans in those "generalities and platitudes." During the concert sequence that closes out the film, she asks her audience: Have you ever had a boy break your heart? Has anyone ever called you ugly? Has anyone ever called you fat? If so, this one's for you.
"There's something so pathetic about this moment and yet, of course, what she's saying is so commonplace - it's totally ordinary, but it's delivered as if it's vital and important and unique," Corbet said. "There's something about that I find really interesting, the idea of exploiting the insecurities that, of course, people have."
But pop stars no longer shape culture with generic messages - at least, not to the same extent. While Taylor Swift sells out stadiums and speaks to the masses about issues they all face, like online bullying, she has also started to speak out on topics that in another era could have ended her career, like politics. Ariana Grande's "Thank u, next" preaches self-acceptance in a way that few breakup songs have. On top of it all, a recent Vanity Fair piece argues that the definition of "pop star" has been so in flux throughout 2018 that traditional pop stars like Ally and Celeste are "no longer the de-facto agenda-setters" for mass audiences. The New York Times adds that the power has been transferred to pop subgenres: "K-pop, Latin trap, melodic hip-hop and more."
Perhaps "Vox Lux" presents an image of pop stardom that will soon feel dated. Regardless, unlike Celeste's lyrics, it makes you think - and that's all Corbet wants.
"I really appreciate the debate that ensues when the film is finished," he said. "I think that it's important, and it's welcome. The film was designed to stir these kinds of conversations."

Californians Voted for Legal Cannabis, but Good Luck Getting Them to Buy It

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- A billion dollars of tax revenue, the taming of the black market, the convenience of retail cannabis stores throughout the state -- these were some of the promises made by proponents of marijuana legalization in California.
One year after the start of recreational sales, they are still just promises.
California's experiment in legalization is mired by debates over regulation and hamstrung by cities and towns that do not want cannabis businesses on their streets.
California was the sixth state to introduce the sale of recreational marijuana -- Alaska, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington paved the way -- but the enormous size of the market led to predictions of soaring legal cannabis sales.
Instead, sales fell. Around $2.5 billion of legal cannabis was sold in California in 2018, half a billion dollars less than in 2017 when only medical marijuana was legal, according to GreenEdge, a sales tracking company.
"There are definitely days that I think that legalization has been a failure," said Lynda Hopkins, who is on the board of supervisors in Sonoma County, which took a lead in licensing marijuana businesses but became embroiled in disputes over regulations and taxes, not to mention angry residents who did not want cannabis grown in their neighborhoods.
The easy part of legalization was persuading people to vote for it, industry analysts say. The hard part, now that it's legal, is persuading people to stop buying from the black market.
In Colorado and Washington licensed sales soared after legalization. One crucial difference with California is its massive surplus -- the state produces far more pot than it can consume.
The tons of extra cannabis continue to leach out across the country into states where it is legal.
"The bottom line is that there's always been a robust illicit market in California -- and it's still there," said Tom Adams of BDS Analytics, which tracks the cannabis market. "Regulators ignored that and thought they could go straight into an incredibly strict and high-tax environment."
The most recent official estimates of California's cannabis production, a report published a year ago by the California Department of Food and Agriculture, showed the state producing as much as 15.5 million pounds of cannabis and consuming just 2.5 million pounds.
California's surplus -- equal to 13 times Colorado's total annual production -- is smuggled eastward, especially across the Rockies and Mississippi where the wholesale price is as much as three times as high.
Cannabis Benchmarks, a company that tracks marijuana prices, reported at the end of December that the average price of regulated cannabis in California was $1,183 a pound, compared with $3,044 in Illinois, $3,072 in Connecticut and $2,846 in Washington, D.C.
Supporters of legalization long ago acknowledged the problems of California's surplus and said it would take years to address.
In an interview in 2016, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who takes office as governor next week, estimated that 85 to 90 percent of the cannabis that California produced was exported. "It's a very serious issue," he said, "and it's going to create a dynamic where the black market will likely persist in a very stubborn way."
The distinction between legal cannabis businesses and scofflaws is about to become much sharper. The loosely regulated system of medical cannabis cooperatives that has existed for two decades will be illegal after Jan. 9. This gives law enforcement more clarity.
Jonathan Rubin, the head of Cannabis Benchmarks, says market forces -- low prices and extreme competition -- will also force many smaller California marijuana companies out of business.
This is straining another promise made by proponents of legalization: that small producers would be protected.
"The icon for cannabis is going to become the Marlboro Man," Ms. Hopkins, the Sonoma County supervisor, said referring to the symbol of the tobacco industry, to which critics often compare the cannabis business. "In California we've done what we always do -- regulate, regulate, regulate, which ultimately gives significant advantage to large companies with significant economies of scale."
The popular image of California's marijuana growers may still be hippies hiding out in the forests of Humboldt County but increasingly the reality is more like the operations of NorCal Cannabis Company in Santa Rosa, north of San Francisco.
The company has converted what was a semiconductor factory into a cannabis production operation where employees walking down antiseptic hallways wear latex gloves and supervise an Israeli-style irrigation system and a $1 million air filtration system. Next door is a company that makes coatings for aircraft cockpit gauges.
Legalization has been liberating for big players like NorCal Cannabis.
"This is our coming-out party," said Jigar Patel, the president of the company, who toured the complex in a white lab coat. "It's waking up and doing what you love without wondering if the man is behind you."
But for hundreds of other smaller producers the paperwork alone has been enough to put them out of business. A cannabis producer must submit applications to as many as five state agencies, including obtaining a certificate to ensure they are able to use a scale.
Lori Ajax, the head of California's Bureau of Cannabis Control who is sometimes called the state's cannabis czar, described 2018 as "rough" both for the regulators and the industry.
Her office is planning a public information campaign to try to persuade consumers to stop buying illegal pot.
"We have to get more consumers buying from the licensed market," she said.
Legalization was promoted as helping to end the war on drugs. But Ms. Ajax says California has no choice but to "step up" enforcement of cannabis scofflaws.
"As a state we have to get more aggressive," she said.
With less than two dozen enforcement officers, she will need help from other government agencies.
Ms. Ajax said she was encouraged by the "surge" of applications by cannabis businesses at the end of 2018. The Bureau of Cannabis Control has issued 2,500 temporary licenses. Yet this is still a fraction of the tens of thousands of cannabis businesses in the state.
Mr. Adams of BDS Analytics says 2018 was a year of "constantly diminishing forecasts" of cannabis sales. But he and others believe the legal market can only grow, especially after the disputed decision by Ms. Ajax's office to allow cannabis delivery services to operate across the state -- even in areas where local municipalities have chosen to ban pot businesses.
Increased sales could push tax revenue closer to the forecasts on the 2016 ballot, which predicted revenue would reach the "high hundreds of millions of dollars to over $1 billion annually."
Through September, Sacramento has collected only $234 million in cannabis taxes. Colorado, with a population half the size of Los Angeles County, collected around the same amount last year.
Gov. Jerry Brown, who leaves office Jan. 7, described cannabis revenue as unreliable in a recent interview with The New York Times.
"I have not counted on any revenue from marijuana," he said. "Who's counting on the marijuana revenue? People said that to make it more plausible for voters."
Still, in many ways 2018 was a banner year for cannabis legalization. Canada became the first industrialized country to allow sales of recreational cannabis; the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that banning cannabis was unconstitutional, paving the way for legalization; Vermont and Michigan legalized recreational marijuana and Oklahoma became the 30th state to legalize medical marijuana.
Ms. Ajax sees a solution to California's cannabis surplus if and when marijuana becomes legal nationwide.
"It would be wonderful if we could sell to other states," she said.

Texto completo: The Trump White House isn't big on sharing information or answering questions asked on behalf of the public.
The so-called daily briefings are not even monthly.
The "communications" office specializes in stonewalling, often not even deigning to issue a "no comment."
So White House correspondents must rely on inside sources, direct observation, documents and other reportorial wiles to perform their jobs: informing citizens about what the executive branch is up to.
When they do, President Trump is quick to trash-talk them.
"The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House," went one broadside after the many departures among his top appointees were reported.
"Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy!"
But the reporting he criticizes as false - he claims it is invented from sources that don't exist - is validated when
top officials leave the White House staff and give on-the-record interviews.
Take, for instance, an article based on an interview with just-departed Chief of Staff John F. Kelly by Molly O'Toole in the Dec. 30 Los Angeles Times, which carried some remarkable headline words: that Kelly's time as Trump's top aide "is best measured by what the president did not do."
That Kelly was, in other words, often in the position of restraining a whimsical and incurious president.
If that sounds more like chaos than "great energy," consider this passage from the same article:
Kelly faulted the administration for failing to follow procedure and failing to anticipate the public outrage for the two most controversial initiatives of his tenure: Trump's travel ban in January 2017, and the "zero tolerance" immigration policy and family separations this year. Shortly after taking office, Trump issued an executive order immediately suspending the entire U.S. refugee program for 120 days, indefinitely freezing the entry of refugees from Syria and barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. Refugees already approved for resettlement, green card holders and others were turned away from flights, detained, and in some cases deported. Federal judges issued emergency stays, and several iterations of the travel ban have been challenged in court. At the time, despite reports he'd been caught off-guard by the president's order, Kelly gave a full-throated defense. "I had very little opportunity to look at them" before the orders were announced, Kelly acknowledged in The Times interview.
In other words, media reports that Kelly, then secretary of homeland security, had been caught off-guard by this impetuous blunder were accurate.
And Kelly's defense, at that time, was a charade.
"It's remarkable that Kelly now admits the chaos of travel ban implementation . . . when he previously lied to the public and press," CNN senior justice reporter Evan Perez said, responding on Twitter to the Los Angeles Times interview.
Perez added: "The reporting, it turns out, was spot on. Kelly was lying."
And Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent for the New York Times, made a broader point about the coverage overall: "The current theme out of some in the WH comms shop is 'there's no chaos to see in this White House,' a narrative Trump has hoped will replace the actual reporting. This Kelly interview affirms most of the real-time reporting about how it is there."
This is far from the first time that top Trump officials have validated real-time reporting in after-the-fact interviews.
Just weeks ago, former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, in an interview with CBS News's Bob Schieffer, described the president as someone who is "pretty undisciplined, doesn't like to read, isn't interested in deeply understanding policy decisions, and who repeatedly attempted to do illegal things." (Trump responded by calling Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, "dumb as a rock.")
The situation Tillerson and Kelly have described is far closer to what the mainstream media reported than to what Trump claimed a few months ago: "The White House is truly, as you would say, a well-oiled machine. It is working so well."
This doesn't mean, of course, that every anonymously sourced White House report turns out to be accurate to the letter. (After all, rumors of Kelly's departure circulated for months before he actually departed.)
But it does suggest that news reports describing high staff turnover, impulsive decision-making, an increasingly isolated chief executive and a chaotic atmosphere are valid. Far from being made up out of whole cloth, they are quite an accurate representation of an unsettling reality - despite what Trump would have us believe.
In a particularly unhinged-sounding tweet on Tuesday, the president sent New Year's greetings to the nation, including "the fake news media."
Presidential good wishes? Or just wishful thinking?

Ex-New York Times top editor: News stories now 'unmistakably anti-Trump'

Texto completo: A former New York Times executive editor says the paper’s news stories about the president aren't objective but “unmistakably anti-Trump.”

Jill Abramson, who ran the newspaper from 2011 to 2014, writes in her upcoming book, “Merchants of Truth,” that the Times has financial incentive to bash Trump, Fox News reported.

In the first six months of Trump’s presidency, the Times saw a digital subscription jump from 600,000 to more than 2 million.

“Given its mostly liberal audience, there was an implicit financial reward for the Times in running lots of Trump stories, almost all of them negative: they drove big traffic numbers and, despite the blip of cancellations after the election, inflated subscription orders to levels no one anticipated,” Abramson wrote.

The first and only female executive editor of the Times also said that the bias is contributing to eroding the outlet’s credibility. Abramson was fired in 2014 by Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., the Time’s publisher.

In the book, which is expected to be published in February 2019, Abramson also expressed discontent with her successor, Dean Baquet.

“Though Baquet said publicly he didn’t want the Times to be the opposition party, his news pages were unmistakably anti-Trump,” Abramson writes.

She said that the Washington Post has the same flaws. “Some headlines contained raw opinion, as did some of the stories that were labeled as news analysis.”

Abramson attributed a lot of the paper’s more outwardly anti-Trump stances in supposed news pieces to the generational split at the paper, adding that younger staff wanted to be more open about the bias.

“The more ‘woke’ staff thought that urgent times called for urgent measures; the dangers of Trump’s presidency obviated the old standards,” Abramson said.

Texto completo: On New Year's morning of 1863, President Abraham Lincoln hosted a three-hour reception in the White House. That afternoon, Lincoln slipped into his office and - without fanfare - signed a document that changed America forever.
It was the Emancipation Proclamation, decreeing "that all persons held as slaves" within the rebellious Southern states "are, and henceforward shall be, free."
However, the proclamation did not immediately free any of the nation's nearly 4 million slaves. The biggest impact was that for the first time, ending slavery became a goal of the Union in the bloody civil war with the Confederacy.
The news sent shock waves throughout the divided country. Southern newspapers responded with outrage. Lincoln's action was "the most startling political crime, the most stupid political blunder yet known in American history, the Richmond Enquirer thundered. "The Southern people have now only to choose between victory and death.
In the North, the Cleveland Morning Leader exulted "The day of Jubilee has arrived, and the all important words Be Free' have been spoken. The New York Times declared "President Lincoln's proclamation marks an era in history, not only of this war, but of the world. But some Northern whites opposed fighting for the freedom of black slaves. The Cincinnati Enquirer said Lincoln's proclamation represented the "complete overthrow of the Constitution he swore to protect and defend.
Free African-Americans in the North celebrated the news. "We are all liberated by this proclamation, said the noted orator and former slave Frederick Douglass. "Everybody is liberated. The white man is liberated, the black man is liberated, the brave men now fighting the battles of their country against rebels and traitors are now liberated. But Douglass cautioned that the proclamation was only a first step; slaves who celebrated the proclamation risked being beaten or hung.
The proclamation was not a surprise. Lincoln had presented his draft of a preliminary order at a Cabinet meeting on July 22, 1862. Secretary of State William Seward suggested the president wait until after the North had scored a fresh win over Southern troops before releasing the document. On Sept. 22, a few days after Union forces claimed victory in the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln issued the preliminary proclamation. It stated that if Southern states did not surrender by Jan. 1, 1863, the president would issue a final order to make their slaves "forever free.
The fighting continued. Some doubted Lincoln would back up his threat. But on the afternoon of Jan. 1, he paused only to steady his hand before signing the final Emancipation Proclamation. "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right than I do in signing this paper, Lincoln said. "If my name goes into history, it will be for this act, and my whole soul is in it.
Many abolitionists criticized Lincoln's action as too limited. The proclamation purported to free millions of slaves in the Southern states that had seceded from the Union. It exempted 850,000 slaves in border states and parts of three Southern states that were not in rebellion. The New York Herald said of Lincoln's order: "While the proclamation leaves slavery untouched where his decree can be enforced, he emancipates slaves where his decree cannot be enforced.
While Lincoln believed freeing the slaves was the right thing to do, his proclamation was a strategic "war measure in the battle to defeat the Confederacy. The proclamation allowed black men to join the Union military forces. Eventually, nearly 200,000 African Americans fought for the North. By making the abolition of slavery a Union goal, the proclamation also discouraged intervention by anti-slavery foreign nations, such as England, on the Confederate side.
Lincoln, who won re-election in 1864, knew his war order was temporary and pressed Congress to amend the Constitution to end slavery forever. By Jan. 31, 1865, both houses of Congress passed the 13th Amendment that "neither slavery or involuntary servitude ... shall exist in the United States.
Slavery officially ended on Dec. 18, 1865 after 27, or two-thirds, of the 36 states ratified the amendment. Lincoln did not live to see the culmination of his proclamation. On April 14, 1865 - five days after the South surrendered - the president was shot and killed by Southern sympathizer John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C.
The end of slavery was just the beginning of a long struggle by African-Americans for full rights as U.S. citizens. Racial segregation in the South continued into the 1960s in everything from public accommodations to schools. At the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington in 1922, the crowd of 50,000 people was segregated by race.
An integrated crowd of more than 250,000 swarmed around the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963 for the March on Washington. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. began his "I Have A Dream speech by praising the Emancipation Proclamation as a "great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. ... But 100 years later, the Negro still is not free.
Though the outcome was far from certain when Lincoln signed the proclamation, one group of black Americans had faith when they met in mid-January 1863 at the Oak Grove school in Leesburg, Ohio. The group agreed on a resolution expressing hope that the proclamation would lead to freedom for all black people in America.
"Should all this be accomplished, the resolution said, "the name of Abraham Lincoln will ever be gratefully remembered by the colored race of America; and the 1st of January should be celebrated to our latest posterity as the most important event in all our history.

Texto completo: Neflix has pulled an episode of “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj" from its streaming service in Saudi Arabia after the kingdom complained that the episode violated its cybercrime laws.
The episode, first made available in October, included an episode where the comedian delivering pointed criticism of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and the United States' relationship with the Saudi government after the Oct. 2 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor.
US intelligence officials concluded that bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's killing, but both bin Salman and President Trump have brushed aside the CIA's conclusions.
“Every single president since FDR has maintained a strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia," Minhaj says during the episode. “Whether it's for oil or arms deals, we have always played it cool with the Saudis no matter what they do."
Minhaj goes on to outline bin Salman's rise to power and mentions a nickname that he says Saudi people have for the crown prince: “Abu Rasasa," or “Father of the bullet."
Netflix removed the episode last week after the Saudi Communications and Information Technology Commission demanded it be taken down.
The episode is still available to Netflix customers outside of Saudi Arabia and can be seen on the “Patriot Act" YouTube page. You can also watch it below.
WARNING: This video includes language some may find offensive.
Article 6 of the Saudi anti-cybercrime law, which was cited by the Saudi commission in its request to Netflix, prohibits the “production, preparation, transmission or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals and privacy" on the internet. Journalism advocates call it an instrument for the Saudi government to censor virtually any speech online.
In a statement, Netflix defended its decision: “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request — and to comply with local law."

Texto completo: Pete Davidson laughed his way into 2019.
The "Saturday Night Live" star, 25, talked about his emotional breakup with Ariana Grande during two stand-up sets in Massachusetts on New Year's Eve. It marked the comedian's first return to the stage since posting on Instagram that he didn't "want to be on this earth anymore" in December.
During a "Pete Davidson & Friends" show in Boston, the comedian revealed that he cried to his mother following his broken engagement to Grande and shared his thoughts on her breakup anthem, "Thank U, Next. "
"Usually, breakup songs you know who it's about but you don't really know," Davidson said, according to E! News and The New York Times. "Bam. She named all of us. "
Davidson recalled the song (in which Grande sings: "Even almost got married / And for Pete, I'm so thankful") was released right before "SNL" aired, describing it as a "sad day. "
"That (expletive) came out before I had to put on a (expletive) duck hat and be like, 'derrrp here's the pizza!' So all my friends were there. …We didn't know it was going to happen," he said, according to E!

Davidson also took some time to slam fellow comedian Louis C. K. , who sparked controversy over the weekend after audio surfaced of him allegedly mocking Parkland survivors.
"I got a Harry Potter tattoo. Then the next day, Alan Rickman, the guy who played Snape, died, and I was like, 'Oh, what a weird coincidence,' " Davidson joked, according to E!
He continued: "Then I got a Willy Wonka tattoo. Next day, Gene Wilder dies. Now I'm like, all right, that's a coincidence, that's weird. So I'm thinking of getting a tattoo of Louis C. K. , what do you guys think?"
Davidson caused some concern last month after sharing a disturbing Instagram post about his mental health, before deleting his account entirely: "I'm doing my best to stay here for you but I actually don't know how much longer I can last. All I've ever tried to do was help people. Just remember I told you so. "
The comedian split with fiancée Ariana Grande in October after a whirlwind romance. He appeared briefly on "SNL" to introduce musical guest Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson the same night he deleted his account, but has maintained a low profile since.
He was spotted above the stage at friend Machine Gun Kelly's concert in Cleveland last week.
