Texto completo: FARMINGTON — The Fire Rescue Department and the community have forever changed since the Sept. 16 propane explosion that killed Capt. Michael Bell and injured six firefighters and a maintenance supervisor at the LEAP Inc. building on Farmington Falls Road.
Adjusting to the changes, the department is proactively moving forward with much support from the community.
More than $400,000 has been donated to assist those affected by the explosion, including people who lost their homes, injured firefighters, the family of Capt. Bell, and LEAP Inc. employees.
Deputy Chief S. Clyde Ross, Capt. Tim “TD” Hardy and Joseph Hastings, all of whom were injured in the explosion at the LEAP building that day, are back on the job.
Bell’s brother, Chief Terry Bell, as

well as Capt. Scott Baxter and his father, firefighter Ted Baxter, are still recovering. LEAP maintenance supervisor Larry Lord of Jay was listed in serious condition last week at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
“We are all sad but we all have a job to do, our personal experiences help us through it,” Ross said. “We are all facing different stages in the process. There is no set healing rate or time. We all received different injuries.”
Tower 3 recently returned to the firehouse after damages caused by the explosion were repaired. The truck, which was onsite, had damage to the cab and body, acting Chief Hardy said. It cost about $25,000 for the repairs, not including testing or any associated maintenance or services. Engine 2 had to be tested because it was at the explosion as well, he said.
People have a more heightened awareness about the smell of propane and are reporting it to dispatchers. Firefighters have investigated several reports, with some of them confirmed. At least two confirmed reports were caused by a faulty check valve and a leak found around a propane gauge.
“That speaks well for society to be more aware,” Ross said. “Those people are sincere in what they are saying. You have to be thankful for their awareness.”
More than 80 fire departments and individual firefighters stepped in to help Farmington continue to provide services to the community for more than a month after the disaster, with Farmington firefighters always in the mix.
“We’ve had to make some changes in staff. We had to make some changes in the schedule and how we scheduled our staffing,” Hardy said.
They implemented a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. per diem shift. “That’s to ensure that we do have coverage during those hours,” he said.
They are filling a lot of shifts with Farmington firefighters and some from outside the department, he said.
Also visiting the station occasionally are Chief Bell and firefighter Baxter, while well-wishers have been making calls on Bell and Capt. Baxter at their homes.
Even though the injured firefighters are not able to participate in the department’s activities, Ross said the visits offer additional healing for everyone.
Meanwhile, he noted, other firefighters have been taking on more responsibility and are making more decisions within the department. “You see the responsibility acceptance, not that it didn’t happen before,” Ross said.
In the wake of the tragedy, community support has been tremendous, firefighters said. Cards and messages of support continue to cross Hardy’s desk daily — some from people they know, others from unfamiliar supporters.
One message let firefighters know “angels are watching over” them. Another was a donation from a child, unsigned. It is very heartening, Ross said, how many people from across the country have taken their time to send a note or card, thanking the Farmington firefighters for what they do.
“People have been gracious in what they have done. It has just taken me into a different thought process. It’s humbling for what you do. You don’t know how you’ve touched these people and in what way,” Ross said.
Thirty-three people were also displaced when they lost their homes near the explosion site. And more than a dozen LEAP employees were significantly affected as well as two businesses.
“Our thoughts are with the people who lost their homes,” Hardy said. “This didn’t just change the lives of firefighters, but the community as a whole.”
The displaced families were said to have all found homes.
In November, the LEAP Explosion Fund had reached nearly $180,000. The committee overseeing the fund has met four times since the explosion and allocated $136,119.26 to date. Those funds have helped with a variety of needs for the displaced families, including first and last month’s rent and security deposits, replacement of household items, transportation costs and infrastructure repair, according to Executive Director Lisa Park Laflin of the United Way of the Tri-Valley Area.
There have been no new developments in the investigation by the Maine Fire Marshal’s Office as of the week of Dec. 16, according to Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the state’s Department of Public Safety. State and federal investigators determined there was a gas leak in the line that ran from the propane tank behind the LEAP building, under the parking lot and into the basement of the building. The investigation continues into what caused the gas to ignite.

Texto completo: In 2019, central Maine saw Belgrade postal workers help a man escape a burning tanker truck, Kennebec County enact criminal justice system reforms, a cyberattack that shut down Augusta’s city government and a local resident who sought a kidney donor by advertising on her lawn later work to find organ donors for others in need.
The morning of Jan. 2, Belgrade mail carriers Nick Claudel and Joe Arsenault were working at the Route 27 post office. That’s when they and their co-workers were forced to evacuate after a fuel-filled tanker truck struck a vehicle that had pulled in front of it and overturned, bursting into a wall of flames.
The driver of the truck, Mark Tuttle, of Albion, remained inside the cab trying to grab a fire extinguisher. The two mail carriers went into the cab of the truck through its broken windshield and pulled Tuttle to safety, less than a minute before the fuel erupted into a wall of flames reaching some 50 feet into the sky. Their actions earned the duo the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association’s Hero of the Year Award.
In May, Kennebec County officials announced new initiatives seeking to reduce the amount of time poor or mentally ill people spend in custody in the criminal justice system without being convicted of a crime. They also said they would begin using medication-assisted treatment to help inmates at the county jail addicted to drugs escape their addictions.
Two of the initiatives — switching to a risk-assessment based bail system in which only high-risk suspects are required to post cash bail and using medication to help inmates fight drug addiction in jail — were the first of their kind in Maine. A third created a “mental health docket” in the courts that meets once a
Year, Page A6
month in an effort to reduce the amount of time people with mental illness who are accused of crimes and are arrested spend stuck in the system waiting for an assessment of whether they are mentally competent and speed the process of them connecting with services that could help them.
Downtown Augusta’s Water Street, which for the previous 75 years was one-way only, was converted to two-way traffic in August, in large part to try to help downtown businesses by increasing the traffic count. So far reviews of the change have been mixed, with police saying there have been no accidents reported there since the change, but some shop owners saying their customers are having a hard time getting to their stores because they can’t find parking.
Hallowell’s downtown Water Street underwent some changes in 2019, too, with work wrapping up on a major reconstruction of the street, which saw the removal of a large crown that had built up toward the center of the street. The work included the addition of a controversial section of sidewalk running from Lucky Garden Chinese restaurant to the state boat landing.
Augusta resident Krystal Reardon, who was able to get a donated kidney from an anonymous donor to replace her damaged kidney in February, responded by looking to help other Mainers in need of a transplant. She used colorful signs placed on her lawn to help find a living donor. She then continued to post signs on her lawn, helping to raise awareness for others in need of help.
Augusta City Center was forced to close for two days in April by a cyberattack that shut down the city’s computer network. The unknown source of the cyberattack sought a ransom payment of more than $100,000 to unlock the frozen system. Instead of paying that ransom, city officials — who as soon as they knew an attack was underway disconnected the network — decided they had the necessary data backed up so they erased the city’s servers and restored them.
Andrew Sherman, 48, was found deceased at his Richmond home Oct. 11, with authorities classifying his death as a homicide, a crime that so far remains unsolved. His body was found by a friend who was concerned he had not heard from him and police have interviewed family members, friends and area residents.
Also left unresolved in Richmond is the disappearance of resident Anneliese Heinig, a 37-year-old mother of two reported missing Nov. 28. She was last spotted walking along Interstate 295 two days earlier, having left her vehicle on the side of the road.
In neighboring Litchfield, a local couple, Derek, 48, and Stephanie Trudeau, 40, were killed in November after another Litchfield resident, 60-year-old Shawn W. Metayer allegedly crossed over the center line with his sport utility vehicle and struck the truck Derek Trudeau was driving. Metayer was later arrested and charged with two felony counts of manslaughter and one count of aggravated operating under the influence.
In December, Boys & Girls Club of Kennebec Valley officials launched a community fundraising effort to build a new, larger, $10 million facility that would be built next to the current building on the club’s 7.5 acres adjacent to Gardiner Area High School in Gardiner.
Prominent central Mainers who died in 2019 included former Augusta mayor, city councilor, businessman and philanthropist John Bridge, Hallowell businessman known for his work with local immigrant communities Joel Davis, and former Winthrop resident, police officer and decorated U.S. Army veteran Gilbert R. Turcotte.
In October, new court proceedings for a Sidney man, who in 2014 pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison for allegedly raping a 4-year-old girl got underway, after the Maine Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bard’s appeal in 2018 and granted him a new trial. The high court ruled Bard was deprived of due process because Maeghan Maloney, district attorney for Kennebec and Somerset counties, met during the trial with Superior Court Justice Donald Marden, at his request, without a lawyer for the defendant present.
Maloney was admonished for meeting with Marden by a Maine Board of Overseers of the Bar panel in May. Whether Marden is also facing disciplinary action is unclear. Unlike complaints against attorneys, complaints against judges in Maine are handled confidentially, unless disciplinary action is taken by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.
Several area residents were sentenced this year after being convicted of crimes. They included three teenagers accused of killing Kimberly Mironovas, of the mother of one of the three teens. Her son Lukas Mironovas, 16, pleaded guilty to murder and conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced to 33 years in prison, William Smith, 17, pleaded guilty to those same charges and was sentenced to 28 years in prison and Thomas “TJ” Severance, 14, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced to Long Creek Youth Development Center until he is 21 years old.
Also sentenced to prison this year were:
• Ryan Beaudette, the former Litchfield Fair treasurer who admitted to stealing more than $150,000 from the Litchfield Farmers’ Club, who was sentenced to 18 months and ordered to pay back the roughly $129,000 he owed the fair;
• Augusta convicted sex offender Robert L. Robinson III, who before his arrest drew complaints from area parents about him photographing young girls in public, who was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography; and
• Derrick Dupont, of Whitefield, who shot James Haskell eight times, killing him, in a 2017 early morning altercation in West Gardiner, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison on a manslaughter charge.

Texto completo: Central Maine is expected to ring in the new year with a storm predicted to deliver between 6 and 10 inches of wet, heavy snow and sleet by tonight, according to the National Weather Service in Gray.
Local emergency officials said slick travel conditions could affect people’s holiday plans, but local road crews were trying Monday to get ahead of the storm.
Sean Goodwin, director of the Kennebec County Emergency Management Agency, said state and Augusta road crews were salting and sanding by about 2 p.m. Monday.
Temperatures today are expected to be in the low 30s during the day and dip into the mid-20s at night.
A winter storm warning went into effect at about 1 p.m. Monday in central, northern and western Maine, and was
Snow, Page A6
expected to be lifted at about 7 p.m. tonight.
Ahead of the storm Monday, state offices closed at 3 p.m. and the University of Maine at Augusta at 4 p.m.
Goodwin said temperatures in the 20s lead to thick snow, which is harder to clean for road crews. He said the wet snow could stick to power lines, weighing them down and making it easier for wind gusts to bring down the lines.
Central Maine Power Co. said Monday afternoon the company is bringing in help from Connecticut to prepare for “mixed storm impacts.”
“While winter storms do not necessarily lead to outages, we are closely monitoring how wet and heavy the snow may be inland, as well as the probability of mixed precipitation on the coast, and how those conditions could lead to the potential for broken tree limbs falling on power lines,” said Kevin Elwell, CMP’s director of electric distribution.
“We are working to stage our employee and contractor crews for the most efficient response given this scenario.”
Tony Laplante, director of the Gardiner Public Works Department, said his crews would be reacting to whatever mixed precipitation the storm delivers. He said the region will likely miss some of the freezing rain that will hit other areas of Maine, but sleet could hamper cleanup efforts.
“I’m expecting snow, mainly until early morning tomorrow, and then it looks like sleet’s going to slide its way in,” Laplante said. “It just depends on how much sleet you get, because that does create a bit of a headache.”
Sunshine is expected Wednesday in much of central Maine, with temperatures reaching 36 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.

Texto completo: A gas explosion in Farmington that left a fire captain dead and seven people injured, the alleged murder of a mother by her boyfriend in the South End of Waterville and the sentencing of John Williams to life in prison for the killing of Somerset County Sheriff’s Cpl. Eugene Cole were among the Morning Sentinel’s top stories of 2019.
Killed in the propane gas explosion Sept. 16 at the Life Enrichment Advancing People building was Farmington fire Capt. Michael Bell, 68, whose brother, Fire Rescue Chief Terry Bell, 62, and the building’s maintenance manager, Larry Lord, 60, were seriously injured. Lord remains at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston where he has been since the explosion and where his condition two days before Christmas was listed as serious.
Others injured in the explosion were Capt. Tim Hardy, 40, Capt. Scott Baxter, 37, his father, Firefighter Theodore Baxter, 64, Firefighter Joseph Hastings, 24, and Fire Rescue Deputy Chief Clyde Ross.
In Waterville on Oct. 23, the body of Melissa Sousa, 29, was found wrapped in a tarp in the basement of the apartment building at 32 Gold St. in the city’s South End, where she lived with her longtime boyfriend, Nicholas Lovejoy, 28, and their 8-year-old twin daughters.
Sousa had been shot twice in the stomach. Lovejoy was later charged with her murder and remains in jail.
The murder sent Sousa’s family and the friends with whom she worked at Dunkin Donuts on Main Street in Waterville into mourning. Her funeral Oct. 31 was overflowing with more than 100 people.
In a long-awaited resolution to the killing of Cole, the Somerset sheriff’s corporal, in April 2018, Williams was found guilty Sept. 12 and sentenced
Year, Page A6
to life in prison for Cole’s murder. The sentence was handed down in Cumberland County Superior Court.
It was a tragic year for shootings nationwide. The danger law enforcement officials face hit close to home four days before Christmas when Waterville police Officer Timothy Hinton was shot in both arms after he made a traffic stop while responding to a report of a shoplifter at Walmart.
Hinton continued to pursue the suspect, Richard Murray-Burns, 29, of Harmony, through Fairfield and into Canaan, where several other law enforcement officials had joined the pursuit and Murray-Burns was shot multiple times. He remains in the hospital. Hinton was treated at a hospital Dec. 22, the day of the shooting, and released later that day.
NOTABLE DEATHS
This year saw the death of longtime Morning Sentinel reporter Doug Harlow, who regularly wrote the newspaper’s annual story reflecting on the top stories of the year. Harlow, 70, died Sept. 12, of cancer.
Other 2019 deaths included that of Winslow firefighter Scott Higgins, affectionately known as “Scoot” to his family, co-workers and friends. The state Medical Examiner’s Office has not yet determined a cause of death. Higgins died unexpectedly Nov. 11.
Former Fairfield fire Captain Jim Lane, of Parkman, died Aug. 9 from complications related to heart surgery. He was 66. Former Waterville fire Captain Phil Simonds died the day before Christmas from complications related to a lung transplant, according to Waterville fire officials. Gary Morrison, an on-call firefighter for Winslow Fire Department, died Dec. 18, of cancer. He was 70.
Art collector and longtime Colby College benefactor Paul J. Schupf, whose name will grace a future art and film center on Main Street in Waterville, died Dec. 4 of cancer. He was 82.
Schupf, of Hamilton, New York, a business leader and generous supporter of Colby who was also an emeritus trustee of the college, altered the landscape at Colby with gifts that supported the arts, the sciences and residential life, Colby officials said after his death. Schupf donated not only to the Colby College Museum of Art. Earlier this year, he made a significant leadership gift to support the future downtown building for art and film to be named the “Paul J. Schupf Art Center.”
OTHER MAJOR STORIES
In Skowhegan, the School Administrative District 54 Board of Directors voted March 7 to retire the longtime Skowhegan Area High School and Skowhegan Area Middle School Indian sports mascot after a long and controversial debate. The board also designed a process for selecting a new mascot.
The student body in grades six through 12 will be asked for input in choosing a new mascot, but the school board will make the final decision. The board plans to resume discussions Jan. 7. SAD 54 includes schools in Skowhegan, Norridgewock, Canaan, Cornville, Mercer and Smithfield.
In School Administrative District 49, which includes schools in Fairfield, Benton, Albion and Clinton, Roberta Hersom was named superintendent after Reza Namin resigned effective Aug. 2. Namin served as superintendent for just one year.
Namin’s time at SAD 49 was marked with controversy starting with his divisive restructuring plans that cost the district $417,665 in administrative buyouts. Former Lawrence High School Principal Mark Campbell was the recipient of $199,825 of that buyout after his position was eliminated. He resigned in April.
The SAD 49 Board of Directors chose Hersom, who worked 21 years in the district, the last two as assistant superintendent and interim superintendent, for the superintendent’s position and Dan Bowers as the new principal at Lawrence High School. Dan Bowers was assistant principal at Messalonskee for 11 years.
Also this year, downtown Waterville revitalization efforts continued with millions of dollars being invested in the heart of the city by Colby College and others. Colby started constructing a $26 million, 53-room Lockwood Hotel on Main Street on the sites of the former Levine’s clothing store and Camden National Bank, the latter of which moved late last year into Colby’s $25 million Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons father north on Main. The four-story hotel, expected to open in 2020, will include a restaurant and bar.
Also as part of revitalization efforts, a redesign for Castonguay Square was chosen after a series of workshops and a lot of input from residents and downtown leaders and businesses. The architectural firm, Beyer Blinder Belle, of New York, as well as Mitchell & Associates, landscape architects from Portland, presented the redesign concept.
Castonguay Square is located next to City Hall in the heart of downtown and is used as a park, concert space and venue for small gatherings.
The redesign process was funded by a $75,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts’ Our Town program, with support from the city, Waterville Creates! and Colby College, which hosted the workshops.
In May this year, former Waterville resident Justin DiPetro emerged from behind the scenes to face a civil suit over the death of his daughter, Ayla Reynolds, with his lawyer saying DiPietro had nothing to do with the toddler’s disappearance from his Waterville home in 2011 and does not know what happened to her.
The wrongful-death suit filed on behalf of Ayla’s mother, Trista Reynolds, contends DiPietro, now a California resident, should be held responsible for their daughter’s death. No one ever was charged criminally in the case, but police have said all along that the people staying in the Violette Avenue house the night Ayla disappeared — including DiPietro — know more about her disappearance than they have said.
In other Waterville-related stories, a plastic bag ban went into effect Sept. 1, prohibiting stores that are 10,000-square-feet or larger from dispensing single-use plastic bags to customers at checkout. The ban affects stores including Shaw’s, Hannaford, JC Penney and Walmart.
Earlier in the year, the state Legislature passed a law banning the practice at all Maine businesses, and in June, Gov. Janet Mills signed the bill into law. The statewide ban will go into effect on Earth Day, April 22, 2020.
Waterville’s bag ban ordinance was to have gone into effect this year on Earth Day, April 22, but Mayor Nick Isgro led an effort to collect signatures from residents to force the votes to be recounted. The bag issue eventually went to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court after a recount reversed the election results, defeating the controversial measure by seven votes. The court dismissed the case and the bag ban ultimately was upheld. The city council in the spring voted 6-0 to extend the plastic bag ban launch to Sept. 1 to allow time for a city board to hear the appeal.
Also this year, a proposal by Central Maine Power Co. and its parent company, Avangrid, to build a powerline 53 miles through a corridor from Canada to The Forks, in Somerset County, continues to face scrutiny. The $950 million New England Clean Energy Connect project is being sought by Massachusetts as a way to bring more renewable energy into that state.
The Maine Public Utilities Commission in April approved the corridor but it still faces review by the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Land Use Planning Commission. Meanwhile, a group is garnering petition signatures to try to get the question about whether the transmission should be built on the November 2020 ballot.
In another story involving state agencies, the state Department of Transportation decided to stop using a type of road sealant on the state’s travel lanes following the investigation of a near-deadly crash in Rome where the slick surface was found to have been a factor.
In October, the DOT temporarily halted the use of the product, called surface fog sealant, after a story in the Morning Sentinel spotlighted dangers associated with its use. Fog sealant is a diluted asphalt that is sprayed onto roads to cost-effectively repair cracks and extend the life of pavement, according to DOT officials.

Texto completo: About 1,600 salaried workers in Maine will be newly eligible for overtime pay under regulations that will take effect Wednesday.
Federal and state laws require that salaried administrative workers who earn less than a set threshold — $33,000 under current Maine law — be paid overtime for hours they work in excess of 40 hours a week. But that threshold is increasing with the new year — in Maine’s case from $33,000 to $36,000 a year. The rules affect white-collar jobs and also require that workers meet a duties test to make sure that they qualify as administrative, professional or other job classifications under the law.
A proposal that the Legislature may take up in its upcoming session would raise the threshold to $55,224 — above even the level that the Obama administration sought five years ago that was struck down by a federal judge.
The threshold under federal law is going up Jan. 1 from the current level of about $23,000 — workers who earned above that amount were exempt from being paid overtime. That will jump to about $35,500 on Wednesday, but the Obama administration in 2014 wanted to increase it to about $47,000.
That proposal encountered strong opposition from business groups and a lawsuit by some states. A federal judge in Texas eventually ruled that the administration didn’t have the authority to make such a significant change.
Maine and federal thresholds are different because Maine has since 1999 tied its overtime eligibility to the state’s minimum wage. Under the formula, the minimum hourly wage is multiplied by 3,000 to set the state standard for an annual salary. Maine’s minimum wage is rising from $11 to $12 an hour Wednesday, resulting in the increase in the level for annual salaries to avoid overtime pay from $33,000 to $36,000.
Federal levels are determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. Maine wage and hour laws do not cover federal employees, so the slightly lower threshold under federal law will apply to federal workers in the state.
The federal threshold for overtime pay “was definitely not keeping pace,” said Laura Fortman, commissioner of the Maine Department of Labor, who provided the estimate that the higher threshold levels would affect about 1,600 workers in the state.
She said she thinks the change will likely affect workers in retail and fast food establishments for positions such as assistant managers.
Curtis Picard, president and chief executive officer of the Retail Association of Maine, said most businesses in the state see the increase that’s coming Wednesday as reasonable.
Picard said most businesses saw the $23,000 federal threshold as too low, but they will oppose the increase to more than $55,000 in the bill that was carried over in the Legislature. He said if that higher level passed, many businesses would shift pay for employees from salary to hourly pay to avoid having to raise pay significantly to avoid the requirement for overtime pay.
“That’s something that we would be concerned about,” Picard said. A new threshold of more than $55,000 would be “absolutely too high,” he said.
The overtime eligibility law dates back to the New Deal in the 1930s and is designed to prevent businesses from classifying employees as administrators and paying them a relatively low salary to avoid paying higher hourly wages for overtime work. Most administrative and professional workers aren’t compensated for overtime they work as long as their salaries are above the threshold.
Maine’s threshold has been rising in recent years because of the increasing minimum wage in the state. Voters in 2016 decided to increase the wage from $7.50 an hour to $12 an hour next year. After that, it will rise annually based on the increase in the cost of living.
The federal minimum wage has been set at $7.25 an hour since 2009.

Texto completo: A Scarborough woman rescued a boy Friday morning after he fell through the ice into a pond behind her home.
An ambulance took the boy to Maine Medical Center, where he was treated for mild hypothermia, said Fire Capt. Nate Contreras. The woman did not need medical treatment.
Contreras said the incident was a reminder to be cautious on the ice at this time of year. The Maine Warden Service issued an advisory last week reminding people to check the thickness of any ice before venturing onto the frozen water.
"Stay off the ice right now, and listen to the state wardens," Contreras said.
Contreras said the small pond is tucked behind homes on Minuteman Drive. A child who lives inside one of the houses heard screaming around 9 a.m. and called to his mother. The woman then ran outside and pulled the boy from the pond. The fire captain estimated the boy who fell in was 6 or 7 years old, and he was submerged up to his waist. A group of kids appeared to be playing in that area, he said.
"The rescuer reported he was crying and being frantic, trying to get out of the water and shivering quite a bit," Contreras said.
The boy was inside the woman's home when the

ambulance arrived. Contreras said her actions helped save him from more serious injury. She could not be reached Monday afternoon.
The warden service urged people to check ice in several different places by making test holes to determine its thickness. They suggested doing this with a partner in case of emergency and to wear a life jacket if acting alone.
"If ice at the shoreline is cracked or squishy, stay off," the advisory said. "Watch out for thin, clear or honeycombed ice. Dark snow and dark ice are other signs of weak spots."
The warden service also offered strategies for dealing with a similar accident. They said a person who has fallen through should lay both arms on unbroken ice and kick hard to get onto the surface, and then roll to safety. A person who needs to act as a rescuer should lie down flat, reaching out with a branch or rope, or make a human chain. The warden service advised people not to stand on the ice when getting back to shore.

Texto completo: Police say the armed robbery suspect shot and killed by a York County Sheriff's deputy Friday night in Limerick was a 16-year-old high school student.
The suspect was 16-year-old Christopher Camacho of Limerick, said Marc Malon, spokesman for the Maine Attorney General's Office in a news release Monday. Camacho was a student at Massabesic High School in Waterboro, according to school district officials.
Malon said that the Medical Examiner's Office determined that Camacho died from a single gunshot wound. He was shot by York County Deputy Robert Carr during a robbery attempt at the Dollar General store. The Attorney General's Office investigates all officer involved uses of deadly force.
The confrontation occurred around 7 p.m. Friday as Carr was responding to a report of an armed robbery in progress at the store.
Please see student, Back Page
"Deputy Carr engaged in an armed confrontation with the suspect when the deputy entered the store in response to a report that an employee was being held and threatened at gunpoint," said York County Sheriff William King.
Few other details have been released about the confrontation or how it unfolded. Carr has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice while the use of deadly force in investigated.
Not much else is known about Camacho other than what Larry Malone, superintendent of schools for Regional School Unit 57, posted on the district's website Monday.
"RSU 57 has been informed that the Maine Attorney General's Office has released the identity of the individual killed in the officer involved shooting in Limerick on Friday, Dec. 27, as a 16-year-old student at Massabesic High School," Malone wrote in a post.
Malone did not specify what grade Camacho was in, and attempts to reach Malone on Monday night were unsuccessful.
"Our hearts and condolences go out to all those touched by this tragic incident," Malone wrote. " Massabesic Schools will have counselors and staff available at school on January 2nd, when students return from the holiday recess."
Malon said the shooting in Limerick is the eighth officer-involved deadly force incident of 2019 - the most recent prior to Friday involved a police chase earlier this month that started in Waterville and ended with a shootout in Canaan. The suspect in that case, 29-year-old Richard Murray-Burns of Harmony, remains hospitalized.
Murray-Burns allegedly shot and wounded a Waterville police officer who tried to pull his vehicle over to question him about a shoplifting complaint at a Walmart.
Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety, said Monday night that Murray-Burns is recovering from his wounds. He has not yet been charged.
"We continue to monitor his condition," McCausland said.

Texto completo: The volunteers behind the Press Herald Toy Fund get to hear many "thank yous" from the families they help.
Mothers and fathers are filled with relief and gratitude when they come to pick up the toys for their children in the weeks leading up to Christmas. For volunteers, that direct interaction is a reminder of why they do the work and
Please see toy fund, Page B4
how the simple gift of new toys can provide joy for families going through difficult times.
But you, the readers who donate the money that buys those gifts, don't get to meet the parents, accept their thanks or see the appreciation on their faces. The fact that you nevertheless give so generously is one of the enduring and essential elements of the 70-year-old charity.
But fortunately, some parents also put their appreciation in writing. So this is for you, dear readers: a note from a father in southern Maine whose family you touched this year.
"To all - A great big thank you for my children's gifts. You made the difference between no presents and a great Christmas."
While the gifts have been unwrapped and decorations are coming down, the toy fund is still in need of cash donations from readers to cover its costs and to sustain the charity as it moves into it's seventh decade helping Maine families.
Donations received during the holiday season are published in the newspaper, and those that have not yet been published will be listed in a future edition of the newspaper and online. Financial support also is accepted year-round and ensures that the fund will have the resources to buy gifts the next year.
THE PRESS HERALD TOY FUND in the Spirit of Bruce Roberts uses donations from readers to provide toys to thousands of Maine children who might otherwise not receive holiday gifts because of hardships faced by their parents. Now in its 70th year, the fund provides toys to needy families in York, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, Androscoggin, Lincoln and Knox counties.
n DONATIONS to help buy the toys can be made year round at pressheraldtoyfund.org or by writing checks to the Portland Press Herald Toy Fund and mailing them to the fund at P.O. Box 7310, Portland, ME 04112.

Texto completo: Commissioner of Economic and Community Development Heather Johnson will talk about moving Maine forward and creating a sustainable economy for all during the Thomas College and Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce’s December Business Breakfast.
The breakfast will be held from 7:15 to 9 a.m. Thursday, Jan. 9, in the Spann Student Commons Summit Room on Thomas College’s campus at 180 West River Road in Waterville, according to a news release from the college.
Johnson grew up in Skowhegan and graduated from the University of Maine. She began her career by building a diverse background in the private technology sector including sales, operations and general management roles at Nokia, Gateway and Toshiba. With continually expanding roles she created startup operations inside large companies, developed new products for new markets, and ran a $1.2 billion retail business.
After leaving the private sector, Johnson had the opportunity to concentrate on rural economic development at Somerset Economic Development Corporation. During her time as the executive director she focused on key economic drivers, such as connectivity, workforce participation, and potential growth markets.
While serving as the director of ConnectME, Johnson was responsible for managing a small grant program, mapping key assets, working with communities and businesses to help them identify needs and opportunities to utilize connectivity to enable their goals. She was able to make changes that position ConnectME to move forward into the connectivity space.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON -- The Fire Rescue Department and the community have forever changed since the Sept. 16 propane explosion that killed Capt. Michael Bell and injured six firefighters and a maintenance supervisor at the LEAP Inc. building on Farmington Falls Road.
As it adjusts to the changes, the department is moving forward, and the community has stepped in to help.
More than $400,000 has been donated to assist those affected by the explosion, including people who lost their homes, injured firefighters, the family of Capt. Bell, and LEAP Inc. employees.
Deputy Chief S. Clyde Ross, Capt. Tim "TD" Hardy and Joseph Hastings, all of whom were injured in the explosion at the LEAP building that day, are back on the job.
Bell's brother, Chief Terry Bell, as well as Capt. Scott Baxter and his father, firefighter Ted Baxter, are still recovering. LEAP maintenance supervisor Larry Lord of Jay was listed in serious condition last week at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
"We are all sad but we all have a job to do, our personal experiences help us through it," Ross said. "We are all facing different stages in the process. There is no set healing rate or time. We all received different injuries."
There have been no new developments in the investigation by the Maine Fire Marshal's Office as of the week of Dec. 16, according to Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the state's Department of Public Safety. State and federal investigators determined there was a gas leak in the line that ran from the propane tank behind the LEAP building, under the parking lot and into the basement of the building. The investigation continues into what caused the gas to ignite.
TOWER 3 RETURNS
Tower 3 recently returned to the firehouse after damage caused by the explosion were repaired. The truck, which was at the site when the explosion occurred, had damage to the cab and body, acting Chief Hardy said. It cost about $25,000 for the repairs. Engine 2 had to be tested because it was at the explosion site as well, he said.
People have a more heightened awareness about the smell of propane and are reporting it to dispatchers. Firefighters have investigated several reports, with some confirmed as leaks.
"That speaks well for society to be more aware," Ross said. "Those people are sincere in what they are saying. You have to be thankful for their awareness."
More than 80 fire departments and individual firefighters stepped in to help Farmington provide services for more than a month after the disaster, with Farmington firefighters always in the mix.
"We've had to make some changes in staff. We had to make some changes in the schedule and how we scheduled our staffing," Hardy said.
They implemented a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. per diem shift. "That's to ensure that we do have coverage during those hours," he said. They are filling a lot of shifts with Farmington firefighters and some from outside the department, he said.
VISITS TO THE STATION
Also visiting the station occasionally are Chief Bell and firefighter Baxter. Even though the injured firefighters are not able to participate in the department's activities, Ross said the visits offer additional healing for everyone.
Meanwhile, he noted, other firefighters have been taking on more responsibility and are making more decisions within the department. "You see the responsibility acceptance, not that it didn't happen before," Ross said.
In the wake of the tragedy, community support has been tremendous, firefighters said. Cards and messages of support continue to cross Hardy's desk daily - some from people they know, others from unfamiliar supporters.
One message let firefighters know "angels are watching over" them. Another was a donation from a child, unsigned. It is very heartening, Ross said, how many people from across the country have taken their time to send a note or card, thanking the Farmington firefighters for what they do.
'IT'S HUMBLING'
"People have been gracious in what they have done. It has just taken me into a different thought process. It's humbling for what you do. You don't know how you've touched these people and in what way," Ross said.
Thirty-three people were also displaced when they lost their homes near the explosion site. And more than a dozen LEAP employees were significantly affected as well as two businesses.
"Our thoughts are with the people who lost their homes," Hardy said. "This didn't just change the lives of firefighters, but the community as a whole."
The displaced families were said to have all found homes.
In November, the LEAP Explosion Fund had reached nearly $180,000. The committee overseeing the fund has met four times since the explosion and allocated $136,119.26 to date. Those funds have helped with a variety of needs for the displaced families, including first and last month's rent and security deposits, replacement of household items, transportation costs and infrastructure repair, according to Executive Director Lisa Park Laflin of the United Way of the Tri-Valley Area.

Texto completo: A South Carolina man charged with kidnapping a woman who said she was repeatedly raped and beaten on a trip from that state to Lewiston in July pleaded not guiltyto that and other charges Monday.
Dustin Beach, 25, of Green Pond, South Carolina, appeared in U.S. District Court in Portland, shackled and wearing an orange jail suit, where he pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping, interstate stalking and four counts of witness tampering.
A federal grand jury handed up the additional charges earlier this month.
Beach faces up to life in prison on the Class A felony kidnapping charge. Maximum punishment for stalking is 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000; for witness tampering, 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
A judge ruled in August that Beach be held in jail on the kidnapping charge pending trial, which had been scheduled for this month before the other charges were added. Beach's attorney had waived his right last summer to a bail hearing because of an active warrant for Beach's arrest from South Carolina.
On Monday, David Beneman, Beach's court-appointed attorney, asked U.S. Magistrate Judge John H. Rich III for additional time to file motions and to push back Beach's trial to March, given the new charges.
Rich agreed.
Federal investigators said Beach is facing similar kidnapping charges in South Carolina, plus drug and gun charges. His arrest stemmed from a report that he had assaulted his girlfriend with a bullwhip, a stick, a shotgun and a pistol over two days in February. She said he had taken her cellphone to prevent her from seeking help.
Beach reportedly cut off a GPS monitor after being released on bail.
In the Maine case, Beach forced a woman to stay in his pickup truck after offering her a ride to a Walmart in South Carolina, then told her he couldn't release her because he was wanted, investigators wrote in court papers.
The woman told investigators that Beach smashed her cellphone and raped and beat her during the trip to Maine.
At one point, she said, he held her face under water until she passed out. He hit her at various times with a cane, a hammer, the center console of his truck and his fists, feet and elbow.
She said she repeatedly pleaded to be released, but Beach refused and threatened to kill her and her children.
Lewiston police were dispatched shortly after 2:30 a.m. July 25 to the Super 8 Motel on Lisbon Street for a report of a woman who'd been hit with a hammer.
Police saw the woman sitting in the lobby wearing large, dark sunglasses. Police could see bruises on her throat and chest. She asked police if they could take her from the motel before her assailant returned.
When later interviewed by police, Beach said he had asked the woman if she wanted to go to Maine and she accepted his invitation. He said he had been trying to help her leave the house she had lived in.
Beach told police the woman's injuries predated his contacts with her. He said they had consensual sex.
Evidence found in Beach's truck included items the woman told police they would find, including her smashed cellphone, a black-handled hammer, a cane and a shirt she claimed she had worn that was stained with her blood.
In a superseding indictment, a federal grand jury charged Beach with transporting his alleged victim across state lines "with the intent to injure, harass and intimidate" her and he placed her in "reasonable fear of serious bodily injury and caused (her) substantial emotional distress."
Beach also attempted to influence testimony of one or more witnesses on four occasions in August after he was incarcerated, according to court papers.
In one of the counts of witness tampering, Beach is charged with having said: "You let that (expletive) know, every (expletive) day I do in here ... if he is still alive when I get out, I'm going to think about that (expletive) every single (expletive) day. You let that (expletive) know, he is going to be the main thought in in my head for 360 (expletive) months. He better hope to god that he is (expletive) dead by the time I get out, you hear me?"

Texto completo: The Maine Community Foundation now has funds for all 16 Maine counties with the addition of the Kennebec County Fund, a permanent endowment that supports projects and nonprofits that strengthen communities. An anonymous family has pledged $250,000 to match all contributions to the fund in 2019 and 2020, according to a news release from the foundation.
A steering committee of community leaders in Kennebec County launched efforts last year to create a fund for the future. “This effort is bringing the county together — from Waterville to Gardiner, from Wayne to Unity — to address the needs of the region, inspire philanthropy in Kennebec County, and strengthen nonprofit organizations that are helping to build communities,” said Wick Johnson, member of MaineCF’s Kennebec County Steering Committee, according to the release.
A committee of local leaders will review Community Building Grant Program applications from Kennebec County’s nonprofit organizations. The next proposal deadline is Feb. 15. For application and guidelines, visit mainecf.org.
MaineCF began its County and Regional Fund Program in 1986. The county funds are built through donations from the community. Those who would like more information about the Kennebec County Fund can contact Vice President for Philanthropy Laura Young at 877-700-6800 or by email at lyoung

The Huskies received 19 first-place votes on Monday, beating No. 2 Oregon and No. 3 Oregon State, which both got five first-place votes. South Carolina and Stanford round out the top five.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
(6) BAYLOR 83, JACKSON STATE 57: Jared Butler scored 18 points, Freddie Gillespie had another double-double and the Bears (10-1) won their ninth game in a row, beating the Tigers (3-10) in Waco, Texas.
The Bears, playing for the first time in 12 days, missed their first six shots. They didn't score until MaCio Teague had a three-point play after both teams went scoreless for nearly the first four minutes of the game.

Texto completo: The Wilton CareerCenter has announced the following January sessions will be held at the center at 865 U.S. Route 2 in East Wilton:
• MEOC-101-Essentials of College Planning will be held from 10 a.m. to noon Wednesday, Jan. 22.

Texto completo: Now that the hearings in the House of Representatives - in the Intelligence and Judiciary committees - have resulted in a vote to impeach President Trump, the focus has shifted to the role of the Senate in this process. That role has been called a "trial," which will result in either removing or retaining the president.
A "not guilty" finding in the Republican dominated Senate is generally seen as the much more likely outcome. It is also consistently and frequently referred to by Trump, Republican senators, and Trump supporters as a "full and total exoneration" (as they did in response to the findings of the Muller Report that explicitly refuted such a conclusion).
Yet, the upcoming action in the Senate is clearly less like a trial and more like a sentencing. Trump will be allowed to continue as president or be removed from office - a simple binary decision.
His guilt has already been amply demonstrated during the House hearings and will not suddenly disappear were he to continue in office.
The House has the constitutional duty to decide his guilt or innocence and has done so by voting on two Articles of Impeachment. The Senate's role is merely to decide his fate - essentially a sentencing role.
Trump's guilt will remain regardless of that decision; that guilt and the Republicans' reaction to it cannot be forgotten or forgiven as we approach the 2020 elections.

As a bleary-eyed new father and state employee, in 2011 I accepted the $500 Alfond college education grant for my daughter. I had no choice on how it was invested and came to find out recently it is all invested with BlackRock, considered the largest driver of climate change through its investments in oil, gas, and deforestation, as well as the largest investor in weapons manufacture.
Wow! We have our children invest in the potential destruction of our planet with the idea that it is to create a better future for them.
I recently called Finance Authority of Maine (FAME) regarding my child's Alfond Grant investment and options to move it to socially responsible investments. There was no choice available, but because it was before July 1, 2013 I have the option to have the funds rescinded and taken away to clear my conscience and the future conscience of my daughter.
The names of all kids born in Maine hospitals, after July 1, 2013, are automatically attached to BlackRock investments with the Alfond Grant and I was told by FAME their parents can't get them out of it or have the investments changed to be more socially responsible.
Before I ask my wife and daughter about giving the money back, it's now just over $1,000, I'll give a go at writing to FAME and myalfondgrant.org to request different options and maybe you could too.

There's good news on climate you won't read elsewhere:
The Economists' Statement on Carbon Dividends outlines a plan for cutting carbon dioxide emissions by pricing carbon fuels, returning the proceeds equitably to every household. More than 3,500 U.S. economists have signed it.
There are now no fewer than seven carbon-pricing bills being considered in the House. Four are bipartisan. The first and favorite is HR 763, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, with 75 co-sponsors.
An independent study by Columbia University showed that, by enacting HR 763 soon, current U.S. commitments to the Paris Agreement will be exceeded by 2030.
We are not alone. Eighty percent of U.S. imports are from countries already with carbon pricing. In the Senate, Angus King co-founded the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. Sen. Susan Collins is working on other climate change bills, including the BEST Act, to focus on energy storage research, so necessary for solar and wind electricity generation.
Republican members of Congress are showing interest. This follows a survey by conservative pollster Frank Luntz showing that 75 percent of Republican voters under 40 want climate action in Congress. At the climate conference in Madrid, the U.N. secretary-general said that the world only lacks the political will to mitigate climate change.
What can you do to build political will in Congress? Log on here: citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/#/48 to find your representative, together with appropriate wording for a letter from you. No stamps or envelopes to lick. Do it now. It's that easy. Your effort makes a difference.

Sen. Susan Collins just announced she is running for her fifth term. When she first ran, 23 years ago, she told the citizens of Maine that if elected, she would serve only two terms, as 12 years was enough for one person.
Many years ago, I corresponded with the senator multiple times, requesting help on an issue that hurt thousands of Maine citizens financially. I got the same computer-generated response every time I wrote and was stonewalled by her office when I called. I was promised a meeting with the senator but it never happened.
I will not vote for her until she satisfactorily explains why she failed to keep her word about serving only two terms and explains why she refused to help with the issue I raised.
We need term limits, but until that happens it is up to the voters of Maine to oust those who worry only about their next election, fail to keep their word and ignore the needs of the citizens they are supposed to represent.
In 2020, the election mantra needs to be: ABC - anybody but Collins.

It is difficult to discern truth/reality when words are loosed from their meaning and thus serve to distort the situation itself. The impeachment vote is largely described, on Dec. 19, as being along "partisan lines." This unfortunate description is not limited to impeachment but to most of the political activity in Washington today.
Partisanship, by definition, would suggest that both sides were acting out of "strong support for their party's policies and are reluctant to compromise with their political opponents." This description gives honest people the impression that the opposing sides are pursing/defending a policy-based agenda. Many will dismiss the results of impeachment as merely a difference of policy direction- because of the "partisan" label.
From almost everything I have seen related to this impeachment process there has been little to no discussion of political policies or policy differences on either side. This impeachment is about behavior and has little to nothing to do with either party's political policy or direction. The specific behavior cited in the indictment would earn any civil servant or military member a jail sentence- period. No well-run organization, public or private, would prosper with such leadership behavior and this has been proven over decades if not centuries. The behavior in question translated to our daily personal interactions would see us shunned by colleagues, friends or family members.
This is not "political partisanship," this is about what values and standards of behavior we support for our nation and our children.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — The Fire Rescue Department and the community have forever changed since the Sept. 16 propane explosion that killed Capt. Michael Bell and injured six firefighters and a maintenance supervisor at the LEAP Inc. building on Farmington Falls Road.
Adjusting to the changes, the department is proactively moving forward with much support from the community.
More than $400,000 has been donated to assist those affected by the explosion, including people who lost their homes, injured firefighters, the family of Capt. Bell, and LEAP Inc. employees.
Deputy Chief S. Clyde Ross, Capt. Tim “TD” Hardy and Joseph Hastings, all of whom were injured in the explosion at the LEAP building that day, are back on the job.
Bell’s brother, Chief Terry Bell, as well as Capt. Scott Baxter and his father, firefighter Ted Baxter, are still recovering. LEAP maintenance supervisor Larry Lord of Jay was listed in serious condition last week at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
“We are all sad but we all have a job to do, our personal experiences help us through it,” Ross said. “We are all facing different stages in the process. There is no set healing rate or time. We all received different injuries.”
Tower 3 recently returned to the firehouse after damages caused by the explosion were repaired. The truck, which was onsite, had damage to the cab and body, acting Chief Hardy said. It cost about $25,000 for the repairs, not including testing or any associated maintenance or services. Engine 2 had to be tested because it was at the explosion as well, he said.
People have a more heightened awareness about the smell of propane and are reporting it to dispatchers. Firefighters have investigated several reports, with some of them confirmed. At least two confirmed reports were caused by a faulty check valve and a leak found around a propane gauge.
“That speaks well for society to be more aware,” Ross said. “Those people are sincere in what they are saying. You have to be thankful for their awareness.”
More than 80 fire departments and individual firefighters stepped in to help Farmington continue to provide services to the community for more than a month after the disaster, with Farmington firefighters always in the mix.
“We’ve had to make some changes in staff. We had to make some changes in the schedule and how we scheduled our staffing,” Hardy said.
They implemented a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. per diem shift. “That’s to ensure that we do have coverage during those hours,” he said.
They are filling a lot of shifts with Farmington firefighters and some from outside the department, he said.
Also visiting the station occasionally are Chief Bell and firefighter Baxter, while well-wishers have been making calls on Bell and Capt. Baxter at their homes.
Even though the injured firefighters are not able to participate in the department’s activities, Ross said the visits offer additional healing for everyone.
Meanwhile, he noted, other firefighters have been taking on more responsibility and are making more decisions within the department. “You see the responsibility acceptance, not that it didn’t happen before,” Ross said.
In the wake of the tragedy, community support has been tremendous, firefighters said. Cards and messages of support continue to cross Hardy’s desk daily — some from people they know, others from unfamiliar supporters.
One message let firefighters know “angels are watching over” them. Another was a donation from a child, unsigned. It is very heartening, Ross said, how many people from across the country have taken their time to send a note or card, thanking the Farmington firefighters for what they do.
“People have been gracious in what they have done. It has just taken me into a different thought process. It’s humbling for what you do. You don’t know how you’ve touched these people and in what way,” Ross said.
Thirty-three people were also displaced when they lost their homes near the explosion site. And more than a dozen LEAP employees were significantly affected as well as two businesses.
“Our thoughts are with the people who lost their homes,” Hardy said. “This didn’t just change the lives of firefighters, but the community as a whole.”
The displaced families were said to have all found homes.
In November, the LEAP Explosion Fund had reached nearly $180,000. The committee overseeing the fund has met four times since the explosion and allocated $136,119.26 to date. Those funds have helped with a variety of needs for the displaced families, including first and last month’s rent and security deposits, replacement of household items, transportation costs and infrastructure repair, according to Executive Director Lisa Park Laflin of the United Way of the Tri-Valley Area.
There have been no new developments in the investigation by the Maine Fire Marshal’s Office as of the week of Dec. 16, according to Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the state’s Department of Public Safety. State and federal investigators determined there was a gas leak in the line that ran from the propane tank behind the LEAP building, under the parking lot and into the basement of the building. The investigation continues into what caused the gas to ignite.

Texto completo: Two Standish elementary schools are providing counseling after a weekend crash killed a third-grade student and critically injured a school custodian.
Owen Oates, an 8-year-old student at Edna Libby, died in the Saturday morning crash. His parents - Vincent Oates, 51, and Kerry Oates, 46 - were critically injured in the crash on Route 35. Danilo Warrick, 75, of Standish, who was driving one of three cars involved in the accident, was also taken to Maine Medical Center with critical injuries.
Warrick was in serious condition Monday, said Maine Medical Center spokesman Clay Holtzman. Warrick is a custodian at Edna Libby and George E. Jack elementary schools, according to school officials.
Vincent Oates has been upgraded to serious condition and Kerry Oates remained in critical condition Monday night, Holtzman said.
The crash remains under investigation and no new information about a possible cause was available Monday, according to Capt. Craig Smith of the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office. The road conditions at the time of the crash were unknown, but will likely be looked at by an accident reconstruction team, police said.
Warrick - known as "Mr. Dan" to students and staff - has been a custodian at Edna Libby for 26 years. The school's Sunshine Committee launched an online fundraiser to support Warrick as he heals. The fundraiser had raised more than $4,400 by Monday afternoon.
"He adores our students and goes above and beyond in supporting them and the events at our school," organizer Marissa Cutter wrote on the GoFundMe page.
A separate GoFundMe page was set up over the weekend for the Oates family. By Monday afternoon, nearly 700 people had donated a total of more than $45,000.
The organizer of the GoFundMe page for the Oates family said Monday that Vincent was out of surgery, but faces a long recovery period.
In a message to parents posted on Facebook, staff from both Edna Libby and George E. Jack elementary schools said counselors were available to par

ents Monday morning to provide information about how to communicate with their children about the death of a peer.
When Edna Libby students return to school Thursday from winter break, teachers will start the day with a brief discussion with their class about what happened. After that, counseling services will be available for students. A supervised quiet place will be set aside on Thursday and Friday for students who need space to process.
School officials said in the note to parents that counseling support will be focused on Edna Libby students and staff, but staff at George E. Jack will monitor students for signs of distress.

Cole Farms Restaurant closing after 68 years Calling it 'a tough and emotional decision,' the owner says the Gray business's last day will be Jan. 13.

Texto completo: Cole Farms, the Gray restaurant where friends and neighbors have gathered for a cup of coffee and a slice of pie for the past 68 years, is closing.
Calling it "a tough an emotional decision," owner Brad Pollard said in a press release that the restaurant's last day serving customers will be Jan. 13.
The sprawling roadside restaurant at 64 Lewiston Road was founded in 1952 by two brothers. Originally a hamburger and ice cream stand, the 24-by-30-foot building that sprang up in a rocky pasture expanded to seat as many as 300 diners and employed thousands of locals over the years. More recently, Cole Farms underwent extensive renovations as it tried to downsize a bit and change with the times. It now serves brick-oven pizza alongside the classic comfort foods that
Please see Cole, Page C2
helped build its reputation - open-faced chicken sandwich, liver and onions and baked haddock - and includes a bakery and pub.
Wil Beriau, a retired chef who taught culinary arts at Southern Maine Community College for 26 years, said Monday he was "shocked" by news of the closing.
"That truly was an institution in Gray," he said. "To see it go by, it's just a little nostalgic."
Cole Farms was the place that locals relied on over the years for inexpensive American food served in generous portions, but it was also an important community gathering place. High school students dropped by for a bite after basketball games. It was a regular stop for police and state troopers.
"Since its opening, Cole Farms has served millions of meals to customers just like you," Pollard, who declined to be interviewed, wrote in a press release. "You've come to Cole Farms to celebrate with family, discuss business with colleagues, and refuel after basketball games, Little League or dances. ...We've been part of your ups and downs, that's what has made this place so special. We've also had the privilege of supporting school sports and civic activities, lending help when needed, not only in Gray, but in several neighboring towns. We're honored that in return you've offered your patronage of Cole Farms for more than seven decades."
But the restaurant and the community it served also struggled through a dark period three decades ago, when one of its co-founders, Warren Cole, was exposed as a child molester. Cole, who was 75 at the time, pleaded guilty in 1992 to two counts of child sexual abuse for molesting a boy in 1987 and was sentenced to 6 [1/2] years in prison. He eventually admitted to abusing more than 20 children. Cole cut all ties to the restaurant, and died in 2004 at age 84.
The restaurant passed into the hands of other family members and soldiered on. One Maine Sunday Telegram reviewer described Cole Farms as a place you could count on, a place that "blended hominess with efficiency." It followed farm-to-table principles before it was popular, using local eggs and serving only fresh chicken and seafood. Over the years, the restaurant made its own soups, chowders, clam cakes and pies.
From a 2012 restaurant review: "The menu is all about Maine standards, with many nods to the older crowd. Thursday is boiled dinner night, chicken pot pie on Wednesday, and meatloaf and American chop suey are available every night. Add Indian pudding and white rolls with cold butter pats in a basket, and the menu reads like an index of postwar Maine comfort food."
Pollard noted in his announcement Monday that it's become "increasingly more difficult" to sustain that recipe for success. When Pollard announced in January that the restaurant was closing for eight weeks to undergo extensive renovations, he told the Lakes Region Weekly that the restaurant's customer base was changing as elderly patrons die or retire south.
"Kids today don't gravitate to a place like this like they did years ago," Pollard said. "Times have changed. If there's a time to reinvent ourselves, this is it."
Beriau agreed that Cole Farms, which has 70 employees, is fighting against a generational shift in the restaurant industry, adding that it's also facing competition from the explosion of restaurants in the region.
"I believe the restaurant industry now is very bold and exciting, and it's for people in their 20s and 30s and even 40s," he said. "They want new and exciting flavors. They want boutique restaurants that are very exciting and very avant garde."
Beriau ate dinner at Cole's "very nice bar and cocktail lounge" just two weeks ago, when he and his wife went there to watch the New England Patriots battle the Buffalo Bills. He tried the broiled scallops, and said they were good, but noted that the pub-style atmosphere with big-screen TVs could also be found at one of the many craft breweries that have appeared in the Portland area in the past few years. That's where younger people are hanging out, he said.
"We are nationally acclaimed now, and there are so many fine chefs and cooks in Portland," Beriau said. "That is part of the reason, I think, that the old traditional restaurants, one by one, are having hard time."
For his part, Pollard - who worked at his family's restaurant himself for almost 50 years - still sounds hopeful about the future.
"Cole Farms is a great property with a lot of potential," he said in his written statement. "Perhaps someone with vision and fresh ideas can transform it into something new that can serve the community for another 68 years."

Texto completo: Two Standish elementary schools are providing counseling after a weekend crash killed a third-grade student and critically injured a school custodian.
Owen Oates, an 8-year-old student at Edna Libby, died in the Saturday morning crash. His parents — Vincent Oates, 51, and Kerry Oates, 46 — were critically injured in the crash on Route 35. Danilo Warrick, 75, of Standish, who was driving one of three cars involved in the accident, was also taken to Maine Medical Center with critical injuries.
Warrick was in serious condition Monday, said Maine Medical Center spokesman Clay Holtzman. Warrick is a custodian at Edna Libby and George E. Jack elementary schools, according to school officials.
Vincent Oates has been upgraded to serious condition and Kerry Oates remained in critical condition Monday night, Holtzman said.
The crash remains under investigation and no new information about a possible cause was available Monday, according to Capt. Craig Smith of the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office. The road conditions at the time of the crash were unknown, but will likely be looked at by an accident reconstruction team, police said.
Warrick — known as “Mr. Dan” to students and staff — has been a custodian at Edna Libby for 26 years. The school’s Sunshine Committee launched an online fundraiser to support Warrick as he heals. The fundraiser had raised more than $4,400 by Monday afternoon.
“He adores our students and goes above and beyond in supporting them and the events at our school,” organizer Marissa Cutter wrote on the GoFundMe page.
A separate GoFundMe page was set up over the weekend for the Oates family. By Monday afternoon, nearly 700 people had donated a total of more than $45,000.
The organizer of the GoFundMe page for the Oates family said Monday that Vincent was out of surgery, but faces a long recovery period.
In a message to parents posted on Facebook, staff from both Edna Libby and George E. Jack elementary schools said counselors were available to parents Monday morning to provide information about how to communicate with their children about the death of a peer.
When Edna Libby students return to school Thursday from winter break, teachers will start the day with a brief discussion with their class about what happened. After that, counseling services will be available for students. A supervised quiet place will be set aside Thursday and Friday for students who need space to process.
School officials said in the note to parents that counseling support will be focused on Edna Libby students and staff, but staff at George E. Jack will monitor students for signs of distress.

PORTLAND'S DECADE of change

Texto completo: Portland wasn't exactly a city on the move as it prepared to enter 2010 and begin a new decade. It seemed more like a city idling in neutral.
Still in the grips of the Great Recession, city and school officials struggled to balance budgets amid declining revenues, developers couldn't secure funding to move forward with new projects and the number of people without homes or in substandard apartments was on the rise.
Now, 10 years later, Portland city is cruising in overdrive. And the decade in between has been one of dramatic change in Maine's largest city.
Portland poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's "beautiful town that is seated by the sea" has established its reputation as a small destination city and appears regularly on national rankings as a top place to visit, due in large part to its working waterfront, historic charm, foodie reputation and tourist-friendly businesses. The decade has produced a seemingly endless list of options for fine dining and craft breweries, distilleries and wineries, with chefs and brewers among the best in the nation.
To host all those visitors, more than 521 hotels rooms have been added and another 600-plus are in the pipeline. And hundreds of apartments are listed for nightly or weekly rental on websites such as Airbnb.
Portland embraced technology in a big way during the decade, with street lights that provide free WiFi, traffic lights that analyze and react to traffic flow and video cameras mounted on the chest of each police officer. The city manager's vision of a smart city also includes self-driving buses to shuttle people on and off the peninsula.
But with change has come growing pains.
Portland renters experienced steep rent increases -
Please see decade, Back Page
including a 40-percent spike in the first half of the decade for a typical two-bedroom unit. In 2014, the city experienced one of the deadliest fires in Maine history when six young adults perished in a duplex with known code violations. In response, the city ramped up housing safety efforts. Buildings changed owners. Investments were made. But more low-income and affordable housing was lost.
What began as a ripple eventually grew into a wave of gentrification - one that continues to wash over the peninsula, especially the East End, where some residents are fighting to create a historic district in hope of retaining what character remains.
City neighborhoods were reshaped by new development, often in the form of luxury condominiums, hotels, office buildings or parking garages.
Affordable housing has become more scarce, forcing workers in Portland's booming service economy to struggle or move out. And in stark contrast to the city's prosperity and low unemployment rate, homelessness and addiction are growing crises.
"Overall, the 20th century took a long time to make it to Maine, but the 21st century has hit Maine hard," said Herb Adams, a former state legislator, historian and adjunct professor at Southern Maine Community College. "Yankee Maine is a land of steady habits where change comes slow. But when the rubber finally hits the road, places like Portland feel it first."
SOCIAL UNREST
As the decade began, the global economic collapse of 2008 was still fresh and Portland was swept up in demonstrations happening across the country to protest the growing income inequality and the financial institutions whose predatory and irresponsible practices brought about the Great Recession.
Inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement, a group calling itself Occupy Maine took to the streets in Portland in the fall of 2011 and built an encampment in Lincoln Park, between City Hall and two courthouses, that included a geodesic dome and a library.
The movement grew into a nearly five-month standoff between the demonstrators and city officials. As the snow fell, demonstrators went to court to argue for their First Amendment right to occupy the public space, but they ultimately lost and broke camp in February of 2012.
It wouldn't be the only time national outrage manifested itself in Portland during the decade.
Black Lives Matter protesters shut down Commercial Street in 2016 to protest police killings of unarmed black men in several other states. President Trump's election sparked women's marches across the United States in 2017, including one in Portland that drew more than 10,000 people. And rallies in support of immigrants drew hundreds when newly-elected President Trump began clamping down on immigration.
REFORM IN CITY HALL
Voters in 2010 approved a fundamental change in city government that, 10 years later, is still considered a work in progress.
Rather than having a mayor appointed by fellow councilors to serve part-time for a one-year term, voters approved a full-time mayor, elected by voters citywide, to serve a four-year term. The newly defined mayor's post didn't have any executive power to implement policy or run daily city operations, but was envisioned as a leadership position that could coordinate the council's work and put it into a cohesive vision for the city.
It's long-term success is still a much-debated question. Some have blamed the hybrid position for conflicts at City Hall, and the high profile position has contributed to an exponential increase in the amount of money pouring into municipal elections.
Voters have changed mayors in each election since the job was created. Michael Brennan became Portland's first popularly-elected mayor in nearly 90 years, but was ousted by Ethan Strimling, who was ousted in November by Kate Snyder.
A SERIES OF MAINE FIRSTS
Portland clearly established itself as a political trend-setter.
It became the first municipality in Maine to use ranked-choice voting, successfully demonstrating the unconventional method during a 2011 mayoral race that allowed voters to rank 15 candidates in order of their preference. Today, ranked-choice voting is used throughout Maine to choose U.S. senators and representatives - a first in the nation - and in primaries for state legislative and gubernatorial nominations. And voters in Portland will be asked in 2020 whether to use the voting method for all City Council and school board races.
In 2012, Portland became the first Maine community to perform a same-sex marriage, opening City Hall at midnight as soon as the new law went into effect. It was the first to declare recreational use of marijuana legal - which it did in a 2013 referendum, three years before the state Legislature followed suit. And in 2015, it was the first Maine community to establish its own local minimum wage that was higher than the state and federal minimum.
EAT, DRINK, BE MERRY
The last decade has seen Portland's meteoric rise as a destination for foodies, craft beer enthusiasts and other tourists.
In 2010, six breweries and two wineries called Portland home. Today, the city hosts 19 breweries, 11 wineries and eight distilleries. That growth was fueled mostly by a change in state law that allowed tasting rooms to charge customers for samples, creating a beer tourism industry with family friendly social clubs featuring live entertainment, games and food.
The city's restaurant scene continues to grow and receive national accolades, as evidenced by being named the "2018 Restaurant City of The Year" by Bon Appetit magazine.
Area chefs are regularly nominated for coveted James Beard Awards. And several have won, including a godfather of the city's craft beer scene, Rob Tod, who owns Allagash Brewing Co.
The food at breweries is often provided by a food truck sitting in the parking lot - another culinary experience to take root in Portland within the last decade. First allowed to operate in Portland in 2012, 45 food truck operators are now licensed with the city.
And, along with growth in overall tourism, the number of people disembarking cruise ships has nearly doubled, from 81,749 people on 67 ships in 2010 to 153,564 people on 99 ships in 2019.
UNPRECEDENTED DEVELOPMENT
Perhaps the most dramatic changes in Portland come from an explosive period of development. City planners have said the development boom is rivaled only by the rebuilding efforts following the Great Fire of 1866, which destroyed a third of the city's downtown.
Consider the India Street neighborhood on Portland's East End.
In 2010, vacant, weed-strewn lots sat directly across Thames Street from the Ocean Gateway Terminal on the eastern waterfront. More vacant land surrounded Hancock Street, including the site of the former Village Cafe, along with more vacant parcels just across Newbury and Middle streets.
Today, all of these sites have been developed into upscale hotels, condominiums or office buildings, including the new, glass-walled corporate headquarters for the payment processing firm, Wex.
Also on the East End, buildings in the former Portland Co. complex have been demolished as part of an ambitious plan to redevelop the 10-acre waterfront site into a new mixed-use neighborhood resembling the Old Port. Shipyard Brewing Co. is undergoing its own transformation into a new beer-themed hotel, or brewtel.
All of this change has brought about anxiety and public opposition, especially on Munjoy Hill, where developers have been tearing down traditional triple-decker apartment buildings and constructing boxy buildings with luxury condos.
"More than ever in Portland, neighbors have a strong sense of citizenship and caring about what makes their part of town special and livable and worth keeping and there's more neighborhood associations with that spirit than ever," Adams said. "And that spirit is a sign and a symbol that the city would do well to listen. When the city does not, that results in the rise of these public referendums."
PUSHBACK
The anti-development zeitgeist first reared its head in 2013.
The Eastland Hotel had just been sold to a developer from Ohio, who later renovated the building into the Westin Portland Harborview Hotel.
The council had voted to sell the adjacent Congress Square Park so it could be turned into an event center, culminating months of debate, opposition and protests. In response, residents launched a citywide campaign and successfully overturned the sale through a referendum that put into place greater protections for Portland's open spaces. Today, the park is alive with activity, thanks to an energized friends group.
Munjoy Hill residents and advocates for the working waterfront have convinced city officials to enact several development moratoriums, one of which led to the preservation of views across the city from Fort Sumner Park. And a lawsuit forced a developer to scale back a massive development project called Midtown that was slated for Bayside but was never built.
GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN
Portland said goodbye to a number of local institutions, including The Pepper Club, Sangillo's, Silly's, Momma's Crow Bar, Happy Wheels and Rufus Deering Lumber Co., which is now being redeveloped into condominiums.
"I am smart enough to know my business model won't work in a city destined to be Seattle, which isn't meant to be a slam it is just my opinion of where Portland is going," Silly's owner Colleen Kelley wrote on Facebook when announcing the closure of her landmark East End restaurant. "I don't want anything but wonderful things for Portland, Maine, I have enjoyed many years here. However, I am a fat woman who serves fat, over-portioned food and I won't charge 24.00 dollars for 4 oz of dip and some pita bread."
Joe's Smoke Shop on Congress Street was torn down, but reopened on the first floor of a new apartment complex. Paul's Food Center closed after 40 years downtown. And Mike's Guitar Grave pawn shop left downtown after 15 years and moved to South Portland.
And 2019 also featured the final year of the Old Port Festival, an early summer staple for the last 46 years. Organizers said the annual event was no longer needed to draw people downtown. "The festival is an event that's achieved its mission," said Casey Gilbert, executive director of Portland Downtown, the nonprofit downtown improvement group that ran the festival for 20 years.
HOMELESSNESS RISES
Despite an economy that appeared to be booming in many respects, numbers of homeless people seeking shelter grew significantly. In 2010, the city-run Oxford Street Shelter served a total of 1,402 men. In 2018, that same shelter served 1,872 people, including 465 women, a 34 percent increase over eight years.
Efforts to find housing have been challenged by economic forces as demand increased for housing among retiring Baby Boomers and young professionals. Low-income renters with housing vouchers can no longer pay market rents, so they remain in city shelters for longer periods and in some cases lose their vouchers simply because no housing is available.
In addition to serving greater numbers, more than twice as many people in the adult shelter report that they are struggling with substance use. Ten years ago, 43 percent of those staying at Oxford Street self-reported as having substance use issues, but eight years later that portion grew to 88 percent. And the last decade has brought a shift from alcoholism to addictive street drugs such as opioids and crystal meth.
IMMIGRATION SHIFTS
The city also saw a dramatic rise in the number of people from foreign lands who came to the United States seeking asylum from violence and persecution and saw Portland as a welcoming community and a safe haven.
Last summer, more than 450 people seeking asylum showed up in a period of weeks, prompting city officials to use the Portland Expo building as a temporary shelter. That was followed by another, smaller wave of nearly 200 people who have arrived since late November.
Portland has long been a hub of immigration for Maine, but the shift in immigration patterns from refugee resettlement to asylum seekers has presented a unique challenge for city officials.
Refugees arrive with federal support to meet their basic needs, such as housing, food, medicine, education and more. And they are allowed work as soon as they arrive.
Asylum seekers are typically professionals, business owners or workers who have the means to come to the U.S. on their own to escape violence and persecution based on political, religious, ethic and other grounds. They are legally present no matter how they got here, but they do not receive federal support and are not allowed to work for months, or even years, after they arrive. For many, the homeless shelter is their only option.
Portland maintained its commitment to sheltering those in need during the past decade regardless of where they come from, defying efforts by former Gov. Paul LePage to reduce funding or adopt more restrictive rules.
When LePage won a court case to make asylum seekers ineligible for public assistance, Portland stepped up and created its own fund. And Portland residents have welcomed all newcomers with open arms, helping to donate more than $1 million in 2019 to help newly arrived families of asylum seekers who risked their lives to get here.
"There's no question that the face and pace of immigration has changed abruptly and the city's reaction to it has been generous and openhearted thus far," Adams said. "My concern is will the feeling of generosity and open heartedness continue if the wave of immigration continues?"

Texto completo: Central Maine is expected to ring in the new year with a storm predicted to deliver between 6 and 10 inches of wet, heavy snow and sleet by tonight, according to the National Weather Service in Gray.
Local emergency officials said slick travel conditions could affect people’s holiday plans, but local road crews were trying Monday to get ahead of the storm.
Sean Goodwin, director of the Kennebec County Emergency Management Agency, said state and Augusta road crews were salting and sanding by about 2 p.m. Monday.
Temperatures today are expected to be in the low 30s during the day and dip into the mid-20s at night.
A winter storm warning went into effect at about 1 p.m. Monday in central, northern and western Maine, and was
Snow, Page A6
expected to be lifted at about 7 p.m. tonight.
Ahead of the storm Monday, state offices closed at 3 p.m. and the University of Maine at Augusta at 4 p.m.
Goodwin said temperatures in the 20s lead to thick snow, which is harder to clean for road crews. He said the wet snow could stick to power lines, weighing them down and making it easier for wind gusts to bring down the lines.
Central Maine Power Co. said Monday afternoon the company is bringing in help from Connecticut to prepare for “mixed storm impacts.”
“While winter storms do not necessarily lead to outages, we are closely monitoring how wet and heavy the snow may be inland, as well as the probability of mixed precipitation on the coast, and how those conditions could lead to the potential for broken tree limbs falling on power lines,” said Kevin Elwell, CMP’s director of electric distribution.
“We are working to stage our employee and contractor crews for the most efficient response given this scenario.”
Tony Laplante, director of the Gardiner Public Works Department, said his crews would be reacting to whatever mixed precipitation the storm delivers. He said the region will likely miss some of the freezing rain that will hit other areas of Maine, but sleet could hamper cleanup efforts.
“I’m expecting snow, mainly until early morning tomorrow, and then it looks like sleet’s going to slide its way in,” Laplante said. “It just depends on how much sleet you get, because that does create a bit of a headache.”
Sunshine is expected Wednesday in much of central Maine, with temperatures reaching 36 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.

Texto completo: WINSLOW — The Maine Central Institute boys basketball team’s fast start was in danger of being erased, and one of its architects, guard Gavin McArthur, was out with a shoulder injury.
Huskies coach Josh Tardy needed someone to step up. And Owen Williams was ready.
The senior guard scored 37 points, 26 in the second half alone, to lead the Huskies to a 71-45 victory over the Black Raiders in a matchup of two teams near the top of Class B North. Both teams moved to 5-2.
“Winslow is our rival, they’re a (Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference) powerhouse,” Tardy said. “These kids are competitors, they know each other, they have a lot of respect for each other, it’s a healthy rivalry. We knew it was a big game, so we were up for it.”
And right from the start, though the good feeling was fading when McArthur dislocated his shoulder going for a rebound with 5:45 left in the second quarter, and it had really diminished by the time the Black Raiders turned what was a 10-point disparity earlier in the quarter into a manageable 30-26 deficit by the end of the half.
Enter Williams, though, who had 11 points in the first half but had plenty more saved for the second. He hit a turnaround jumper, got a steal and score, and drained a 3-pointer to turn a 38-30 lead into a 45-34 advantage with 2:02 left in the third.
Williams was feeling it, and there was nothing Winslow could do to slow him down. After scoring MCI’s last three points of the quarter, he opened the fourth with another three. And then another, with 7:28 left. Another came 29 seconds later. And yet another, with 6:36 to go.
As if that wasn’t enough, he got a putback to prompt Winslow to call for a timeout to stop the bleeding with 5:58 left. Williams had scored 16 points in 3 minutes and 7 seconds, and the score was now out of hand at 65-36.
“I’ve been around high school basketball for a while,” Tardy said, “and I don’t know that I’ve seen a half like that in about 15 years. That’s as good a half as I’ve seen. It was an incredible performance.”
Harrison Sites, MCI’s post presence who played a vital role in the Huskies’ hot start, had the best seat in the house — under the basket as one Williams shot after another swished in.
“You see him hit the first two or three, and you’re like ‘Okay, that’s pretty good,’” he said. “And then they just kept falling. It was ridiculous.”
Williams, who added six rebounds and four steals, said he was just trying to step up for a hurt teammate.
Huskies, Page C3
“That was really fun,” he said. “Teammates just got me the ball where I wanted it, and it was just fun playing out there with all of us, having a great time beating a good team.”
Williams said he’d never felt a rhythm like that.
“I was taking what the defense was giving me,” he said. “I just (tried) not to force it and let the game come to me.”
Williams’s run allowed MCI to take control of a game they had from the opening tip. Sites, who finished with 12 points and 14 rebounds, dominated the glass and had eight first-quarter points as MCI scored the first seven points and took a 17-9 lead into the second.
“I’ve always been told all my life, defense and rebounding. Especially rebounding, because on offense, it’s a whole (new) shot that you get,” Sites said. “That’s huge to the team. And kids that need to get hot, if they miss one or two, you can keep dishing to them and they’ll get hot off that.”
“(Sites has) been a little bit of a secret. The jig might be up on that,” said Tardy, whose team also got nine points from Dominic Wilson and six rebounds from Caleb Willis. “He’s a tremendous high school athlete. His effort is unbelievable, and he is just a strong human being.”
Winslow coach Ken Lindlof said the slow start put the Black Raiders in too much of a bind, even before Williams’s spree.
“The first half problem was not coming out with energy and allowing them to dominate the boards and get offensive rebounds and second shots,” he said. “We just never got it going offensively, and I think that affected our defense.”
Colby Pomeroy led Winslow with 16 points, 14 coming in the first half as he tried to rally the Black Raiders back from the early deficit.
“I think we forgot what got us to (our record), which is being a high-energy, kind of gritty team,” Lindlof said. “We don’t necessarily have a lot of firepower, but we find ways to manufacture points and get stops. Today, none of that happened.”

Texto completo: The impeachment spotlight now shifts to vulnerable Republican senators like Cory Gardner, R-Colo., Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Martha McSally, R-Ariz., all seeking reelection in 2020.On currently available evidence, the president should be convicted both for abusing his office and for obstructing Congress. He is guilty as charged. The man cannot distinguish right from wrong. His continued presence in the White House is a clear and present danger to the republic.
Republicans have argued that the evidence for conviction is inadequate.
But the president himself has prevented witnesses with direct knowledge of his actions from testifying and has denied access to relevant government documents. lf the Senate acquits after a trial that denies access to live testimony and documentary evidence that the president has suppressed, the American people most certainly will treat the proceeding as a whitewash and likely would penalize those vulnerable senators who allowed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to trivialize this most important constitutional proceeding.

Progressively worse
Each outrage by Donald Trump and his administration numbs the moral sensibilities of the population, leaving it vulnerable to progressively worse outrages. And so it continues, step by step.
Distracted and intoxicated by fear and hatred, Trump's so-called "base" welcomes these outrages even though its members will be victims as much as those they fear and hate; so do plutocrats, radical right-wingers, many corporate leaders and their political servants, all intoxicated by privilege and power.
If Trump is reelected, the immorality, outrages and cruelties, many targeting children, will get worse, until most working people and their children are fully reduced to wage slavery, hunger and environmental devastation. In such a state, the struggle for mere survival will render them politically impotent. I submit that all this fits perfectly with the radical right-wing strategy to subvert liberty, justice and constitutional democracy in favor of plutocratic rule.

Stench of injustice
While so much legislation is stalled in the Senate, Donald Trump's federal court appointments continue to sail through.
This has been facilitated by the Senate's changing the rule for consideration of appointments from 30 hours to two hours. So far, 29 have been named to the Courts of Appeals and 53 to the federal district courts. Not one is African American or Latino. In addition, he has named two justices to the Supreme Court, which could well have a 7-2 conservative majority before he is finished. (Remember former President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, who was not even given a hearing.)
Historically, politics have proven to be cyclical in nature. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that there will come a day when Democrats control both houses of Congress and the office of the president. Yet, federal court appointments are for life. This calls to mind the ancient English parody, "That whatsoever king shall reign, still I'll be the Vicar of Bray, Sir."

Giving is good
Observing all the people on street corners asking for money, I do feel empathy for anyone that has to do this for whatever reasons, as it cannot be easy.
I, myself, would rather give to The New Mexican newspaper vendors who are on street corners in the extreme weather conditions, trying to make a living or supplementing their income by selling newspapers. I pay $5 for a newspaper every time I pick one up from these vendors. Just a thought for anyone who might want to give a tip to someone on a street corner.

Texto completo: Senior guard catches fire as Huskies take big road win over B North contender.
WINSLOW — The Maine Central Institute boys basketball team’s fast start was in danger of being erased, and one of its architects, guard Gavin McArthur, was out with a shoulder injury.
Huskies coach Josh Tardy needed someone to step up. And Owen Williams was ready.
The senior guard scored 37 points, 26 in the second half alone, to lead the Huskies to a 71-45 victory over the Black Raiders in a matchup of two teams near the top of Class B North. Both teams moved to 5-2.
“Winslow is our rival, they’re a (Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference) powerhouse,” Tardy said. “These kids are competitors, they know each other, they have a lot of respect for each other, it’s a healthy rivalry. We knew it was a big game, so we were up for it.”
And right from the start, though the good feeling was fading when McArthur dislocated his shoulder going for a rebound with 5:45 left in the second quarter, and it had really diminished by the time the Black Raiders turned what was a 10-point disparity earlier in the quarter into a manageable 30-26 deficit by the end of the half.
Enter Williams, though, who had 11 points in the first half but had plenty more saved for the second. He hit a turnaround jumper, got a steal and score, and drained a 3-pointer to turn a 38-30 lead into a 45-34 advantage with 2:02 left in the third.
Williams was feeling it, and there was nothing Winslow could do to slow him down. After scoring MCI’s last three points of the quarter, he opened the fourth with another three. And then another, with 7:28 left. Another came 29 seconds later. And yet another, with 6:36 to go.
As if that wasn’t enough, he got a putback to prompt Winslow to call for a timeout to stop the bleeding with 5:58 left. Williams had scored 16 points in 3 minutes and 7 seconds, and the score was now out of hand at 65-36.
“I’ve been around high school basketball for a while,” Tardy said, “and I don’t know that I’ve seen a half like that in about 15 years. That’s as good a half as I’ve seen. It was an incredible performance.”
Harrison Sites, MCI’s post presence who played a vital role in the Huskies’ hot start, had the best seat in the house — under the basket as one Williams shot after another swished in.
“You see him hit the first two or three, and you’re like ‘Okay, that’s pretty good,’” he said. “And then they just kept falling. It was ridiculous.”
Williams, who added six rebounds and four steals, said he was just trying to step up for a hurt teammate.
“That was really fun,” he said. “Teammates just got me the ball where I wanted it, and it was just fun playing out there with all of us, having a great time beating a good team.”
Williams said he’d never felt a rhythm like that.
“I was taking what the defense was giving me,” he said. “I just (tried) not to force it and let the game come to me.”
Williams’s run allowed MCI to take control of a game they had from the opening tip. Sites, who finished with 12 points and 14 rebounds, dominated the glass and had eight first-quarter points as MCI scored the first seven points and took a 17-9 lead into the second.
“I’ve always been told all my life, defense and rebounding. Especially rebounding, because on offense, it’s a whole (new) shot that you get,” Sites said. “That’s huge to the team. And kids that need to get hot, if they miss one or two, you can keep dishing to them and they’ll get hot off that.”
“(Sites has) been a little bit of a secret. The jig might be up on that,” said Tardy, whose team also got nine points from Dominic Wilson and six rebounds from Caleb Willis. “He’s a tremendous high school athlete. His effort is unbelievable, and he is just a strong human being.”
Winslow coach Ken Lindlof said the slow start put the Black Raiders in too much of a bind, even before Williams’s spree.
“The first half problem was not coming out with energy and allowing them to dominate the boards and get offensive rebounds and second shots,” he said. “We just never got it going offensively, and I think that affected our defense.”
Colby Pomeroy led Winslow with 16 points, 14 coming in the first half as he tried to rally the Black Raiders back from the early deficit.
“I think we forgot what got us to (our record), which is being a high-energy, kind of gritty team,” Lindlof said. “We don’t necessarily have a lot of firepower, but we find ways to manufacture points and get stops. Today, none of that happened.”

Minimum wage raise means more overtime pay

Texto completo: The increase will hike the pay level at which salaried workers are required to get overtime pay
About 1,600 salaried workers in Maine will be newly eligible for overtime pay under regulations that will take effect Wednesday.
Federal and state laws require that salaried administrative workers who earn less than a set threshold — $33,000 under current Maine law — be paid overtime for hours they work in excess of 40 hours a week. But that threshold is increasing with the new year — in Maine’s case from $33,000 to $36,000 a year. The rules affect white-collar jobs and also require that workers meet a duties test to make sure that they qualify as administrative, professional or other job classifications under the law.
A proposal that the Legislature may take up in its upcoming session would raise the threshold to $55,224 — above even the level that the Obama administration sought five years ago that was struck down by a federal judge.
The threshold under federal law is going up Jan. 1 from the current level of about $23,000 — workers who earned above that amount were exempt from being paid overtime. That will jump to about $35,500 on Wednesday, but the Obama administration in 2014 wanted to increase it to about $47,000.
That proposal encountered strong opposition from business groups and a lawsuit by some states. A federal judge in Texas eventually ruled that the administration didn’t have the authority to make such a significant change.
Maine and federal thresholds are different because Maine has since 1999 tied its overtime eligibility to the state’s minimum wage. Under the formula, the minimum hourly wage is multiplied by 3,000 to set the state standard for an annual salary. Maine’s minimum wage is rising from $11 to $12 an hour Wednesday, resulting in the increase in the level for annual salaries to avoid overtime pay from $33,000 to $36,000.
Federal levels are determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. Maine wage and hour laws do not cover federal employees, so the slightly lower threshold under federal law will apply to federal workers in the state.
The federal threshold for overtime pay “was definitely not keeping pace,” said Laura Fortman, commissioner of the Maine Department of Labor, who provided the estimate that the higher threshold levels would affect about 1,600 workers in the state.
She said she thinks the change will likely affect workers in retail and fast food establishments for positions such as assistant managers.
Curtis Picard, president and chief executive officer of the Retail Association of Maine, said most businesses in the state see the increase that’s coming Wednesday as reasonable.
Picard said most businesses saw the $23,000 federal threshold as too low, but they will oppose the increase to more than $55,000 in the bill that was carried over in the Legislature. He said if that higher level passed, many businesses would shift pay for employees from salary to hourly pay to avoid having to raise pay significantly to avoid the requirement for overtime pay.
“That’s something that we would be concerned about,” Picard said. A new threshold of more than $55,000 would be “absolutely too high,” he said.
The overtime eligibility law dates back to the New Deal in the 1930s and is designed to prevent businesses from classifying employees as administrators and paying them a relatively low salary to avoid paying higher hourly wages for overtime work. Most administrative and professional workers aren’t compensated for overtime they work as long as their salaries are above the threshold.
Maine’s threshold has been rising in recent years because of the increasing minimum wage in the state. Voters in 2016 decided to increase the wage from $7.50 an hour to $12 an hour next year. After that, it will rise annually based on the increase in the cost of living.
The federal minimum wage has been set at $7.25 an hour since 2009.

Central Maine in line for wet, heavy snow

Texto completo: Central and western areas of Maine can expect between 4 and 10 inches of snow late Monday into Tuesday night.
Forecasters say area residents can expect between 6 and 10 inches by tonight
Central Maine is expected to ring in the new year with a storm predicted to deliver between 6 and 10 inches of wet, heavy snow and sleet by tonight, according to the National Weather Service in Gray.
Local emergency officials said slick travel conditions could affect people’s holiday plans, but local road crews were trying Monday to get ahead of the storm.
Sean Goodwin, director of the Kennebec County Emergency Management Agency, said state and Augusta road crews were salting and sanding by about 2 p.m. Monday.
Temperatures today are expected to be in the low 30s during the day and dip into the mid-20s at night.
A winter storm warning went into effect at about 1 p.m. Monday in central, northern and western Maine, and was expected to be lifted at about 7 p.m. tonight.
Ahead of the storm Monday, state offices closed at 3 p.m. and the University of Maine at Augusta at 4 p.m.
Goodwin said temperatures in the 20s lead to thick snow, which is harder to clean for road crews. He said the wet snow could stick to power lines, weighing them down and making it easier for wind gusts to bring down the lines.
Central Maine Power Co. said Monday afternoon the company is bringing in help from Connecticut to prepare for “mixed storm impacts.”
“While winter storms do not necessarily lead to outages, we are closely monitoring how wet and heavy the snow may be inland, as well as the probability of mixed precipitation on the coast, and how those conditions could lead to the potential for broken tree limbs falling on power lines,” said Kevin Elwell, CMP’s director of electric distribution.
“We are working to stage our employee and contractor crews for the most efficient response given this scenario.”
Tony Laplante, director of the Gardiner Public Works Department, said his crews would be reacting to whatever mixed precipitation the storm delivers. He said the region will likely miss some of the freezing rain that will hit other areas of Maine, but sleet could hamper cleanup efforts.
“I’m expecting snow, mainly until early morning tomorrow, and then it looks like sleet’s going to slide its way in,” Laplante said. “It just depends on how much sleet you get, because that does create a bit of a headache.”
Sunshine is expected Wednesday in much of central Maine, with temperatures reaching 36 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.

Texto completo: The Maine Community Foundation now has funds for all 16 Maine counties with the addition of the Kennebec County Fund, a permanent endowment that supports projects and nonprofits that strengthen communities. An anonymous family has pledged $250,000 to match all contributions to the fund in 2019 and 2020, according to a news release from the foundation.
A steering committee of community leaders in Kennebec County launched efforts last year to create a fund for the future. “This effort is bringing the county together — from Waterville to Gardiner, from Wayne to Unity — to address the needs of the region, inspire philanthropy in Kennebec County, and strengthen nonprofit organizations that are helping to build communities,” said Wick Johnson, member of MaineCF’s Kennebec County Steering Committee, according to the release.
A committee of local leaders will review Community Building Grant Program applications from Kennebec County’s nonprofit organizations. The next proposal deadline is Feb. 15. For application and guidelines, visit mainecf.org.
MaineCF began its County and Regional Fund Program in 1986. The county funds are built through donations from the community. Those who would like more information about the Kennebec County Fund can contact Vice President for Philanthropy Laura Young at 877-700-6800 or by email at lyoung@mainecf.org.

2019 in review

Texto completo: The sentencing of John Williams to life in prison for the shooting death of Somerset County Sheriff's Cpl. Eugene Cole, the murder of the mother in Waterville and a propane explosion that killed a Farmington fire captain were some of the major Morning Sentinel stories of 2019.

A gas explosion in Farmington that left a fire captain dead and seven people injured, the alleged murder of a mother by her boyfriend in the South End of Waterville and the sentencing of John Williams to life in prison for the killing of Somerset County Sheriff’s Cpl. Eugene Cole were among the Morning Sentinel’s top stories of 2019.
Killed in the propane gas explosion Sept. 16 at the Life Enrichment Advancing People building was Farmington fire Capt. Michael Bell, 68, whose brother, Fire Rescue Chief Terry Bell, 62, and the building’s maintenance manager, Larry Lord, 60, were seriously injured. Lord remains at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston where he has been since the explosion and where his condition two days before Christmas was listed as serious.
Others injured in the explosion were Capt. Tim Hardy, 40, Capt. Scott Baxter, 37, his father, Firefighter Theodore Baxter, 64, Firefighter Joseph Hastings, 24, and Fire Rescue Deputy Chief Clyde Ross.
In Waterville on Oct. 23, the body of Melissa Sousa, 29, was found wrapped in a tarp in the basement of the apartment building at 32 Gold St. in the city’s South End, where she lived with her longtime boyfriend, Nicholas Lovejoy, 28, and their 8-year-old twin daughters.
Sousa had been shot twice in the stomach. Lovejoy was later charged with her murder and remains in jail.
The murder sent Sousa’s family and the friends with whom she worked at Dunkin Donuts on Main Street in Waterville into mourning. Her funeral Oct. 31 was overflowing with more than 100 people.
In a long-awaited resolution to the killing of Cole, the Somerset sheriff’s corporal, in April 2018, Williams was found guilty Sept. 12 and sentenced to life in prison for Cole’s murder. The sentence was handed down in Cumberland County Superior Court.
It was a tragic year for shootings nationwide. The danger law enforcement officials face hit close to home four days before Christmas when Waterville police Officer Timothy Hinton was shot in both arms after he made a traffic stop while responding to a report of a shoplifter at Walmart.
Hinton continued to pursue the suspect, Richard Murray-Burns, 29, of Harmony, through Fairfield and into Canaan, where several other law enforcement officials had joined the pursuit and Murray-Burns was shot multiple times. He remains in the hospital. Hinton was treated at a hospital Dec. 22, the day of the shooting, and released later that day.

NOTABLE DEATHS This year saw the death of longtime Morning Sentinel reporter Doug Harlow, who regularly wrote the newspaper’s annual story reflecting on the top stories of the year. Harlow, 70, died Sept. 12, of cancer.
Other 2019 deaths included that of Winslow firefighter Scott Higgins, affectionately known as “Scoot” to his family, co-workers and friends. The state Medical Examiner’s Office has not yet determined a cause of death. Higgins died unexpectedly Nov. 11.
Former Fairfield fire Captain Jim Lane, of Parkman, died Aug. 9 from complications related to heart surgery. He was 66. Former Waterville fire Captain Phil Simonds died the day before Christmas from complications related to a lung transplant, according to Waterville fire officials. Gary Morrison, an on-call firefighter for Winslow Fire Department, died Dec. 18, of cancer. He was 70.
Art collector and longtime Colby College benefactor Paul J. Schupf, whose name will grace a future art and film center on Main Street in Waterville, died Dec. 4 of cancer. He was 82.
Schupf, of Hamilton, New York, a business leader and generous supporter of Colby who was also an emeritus trustee of the college, altered the landscape at Colby with gifts that supported the arts, the sciences and residential life, Colby officials said after his death. Schupf donated not only to the Colby College Museum of Art. Earlier this year, he made a significant leadership gift to support the future downtown building for art and film to be named the “Paul J. Schupf Art Center.”

OTHER MAJOR STORIES In Skowhegan, the School Administrative District 54 Board of Directors voted March 7 to retire the longtime Skowhegan Area High School and Skowhegan Area Middle School Indian sports mascot after a long and controversial debate. The board also designed a process for selecting a new mascot.
The student body in grades six through 12 will be asked for input in choosing a new mascot, but the school board will make the final decision. The board plans to resume discussions Jan. 7. SAD 54 includes schools in Skowhegan, Norridgewock, Canaan, Cornville, Mercer and Smithfield.
In School Administrative District 49, which includes schools in Fairfield, Benton, Albion and Clinton, Roberta Hersom was named superintendent after Reza Namin resigned effective Aug. 2. Namin served as superintendent for just one year.
Namin’s time at SAD 49 was marked with controversy starting with his divisive restructuring plans that cost the district $417,665 in administrative buyouts. Former Lawrence High School Principal Mark Campbell was the recipient of $199,825 of that buyout after his position was eliminated. He resigned in April.
The SAD 49 Board of Directors chose Hersom, who worked 21 years in the district, the last two as assistant superintendent and interim superintendent, for the superintendent’s position and Dan Bowers as the new principal at Lawrence High School. Dan Bowers was assistant principal at Messalonskee for 11 years.
Also this year, downtown Waterville revitalization efforts continued with millions of dollars being invested in the heart of the city by Colby College and others. Colby started constructing a $26 million, 53-room Lockwood Hotel on Main Street on the sites of the former Levine’s clothing store and Camden National Bank, the latter of which moved late last year into Colby’s $25 million Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons father north on Main. The four-story hotel, expected to open in 2020, will include a restaurant and bar.
Also as part of revitalization efforts, a redesign for Castonguay Square was chosen after a series of workshops and a lot of input from residents and downtown leaders and businesses. The architectural firm, Beyer Blinder Belle, of New York, as well as Mitchell & Associates, landscape architects from Portland, presented the redesign concept.
Castonguay Square is located next to City Hall in the heart of downtown and is used as a park, concert space and venue for small gatherings.
The redesign process was funded by a $75,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts’ Our Town program, with support from the city, Waterville Creates! and Colby College, which hosted the workshops.
In May this year, former Waterville resident Justin DiPetro emerged from behind the scenes to face a civil suit over the death of his daughter, Ayla Reynolds, with his lawyer saying DiPietro had nothing to do with the toddler’s disappearance from his Waterville home in 2011 and does not know what happened to her.
The wrongful-death suit filed on behalf of Ayla’s mother, Trista Reynolds, contends DiPietro, now a California resident, should be held responsible for their daughter’s death. No one ever was charged criminally in the case, but police have said all along that the people staying in the Violette Avenue house the night Ayla disappeared — including DiPietro — know more about her disappearance than they have said.
In other Waterville-related stories, a plastic bag ban went into effect Sept. 1, prohibiting stores that are 10,000-square-feet or larger from dispensing single-use plastic bags to customers at checkout. The ban affects stores including Shaw’s, Hannaford, JC Penney and Walmart.
Earlier in the year, the state Legislature passed a law banning the practice at all Maine businesses, and in June, Gov. Janet Mills signed the bill into law. The statewide ban will go into effect on Earth Day, April 22, 2020.
Waterville’s bag ban ordinance was to have gone into effect this year on Earth Day, April 22, but Mayor Nick Isgro led an effort to collect signatures from residents to force the votes to be recounted. The bag issue eventually went to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court after a recount reversed the election results, defeating the controversial measure by seven votes. The court dismissed the case and the bag ban ultimately was upheld. The city council in the spring voted 6-0 to extend the plastic bag ban launch to Sept. 1 to allow time for a city board to hear the appeal.
Also this year, a proposal by Central Maine Power Co. and its parent company, Avangrid, to build a powerline 53 miles through a corridor from Canada to The Forks, in Somerset County, continues to face scrutiny. The $950 million New England Clean Energy Connect project is being sought by Massachusetts as a way to bring more renewable energy into that state.
The Maine Public Utilities Commission in April approved the corridor but it still faces review by the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Land Use Planning Commission. Meanwhile, a group is garnering petition signatures to try to get the question about whether the transmission should be built on the November 2020 ballot.
In another story involving state agencies, the state Department of Transportation decided to stop using a type of road sealant on the state’s travel lanes following the investigation of a near-deadly crash in Rome where the slick surface was found to have been a factor.
In October, the DOT temporarily halted the use of the product, called surface fog sealant, after a story in the Morning Sentinel spotlighted dangers associated with its use. Fog sealant is a diluted asphalt that is sprayed onto roads to cost-effectively repair cracks and extend the life of pavement, according to DOT officials.

Texto completo: Senior guard catches fire as Huskies take big road win over B North contender.
WINSLOW — The Maine Central Institute boys basketball team’s fast start was in danger of being erased, and one of its architects, guard Gavin McArthur, was out with a shoulder injury.
Huskies coach Josh Tardy needed someone to step up. And Owen Williams was ready.
The senior guard scored 37 points, 26 in the second half alone, to lead the Huskies to a 71-45 victory over the Black Raiders in a matchup of two teams near the top of Class B North. Both teams moved to 5-2.
“Winslow is our rival, they’re a (Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference) powerhouse,” Tardy said. “These kids are competitors, they know each other, they have a lot of respect for each other, it’s a healthy rivalry. We knew it was a big game, so we were up for it.”
And right from the start, though the good feeling was fading when McArthur dislocated his shoulder going for a rebound with 5:45 left in the second quarter, and it had really diminished by the time the Black Raiders turned what was a 10-point disparity earlier in the quarter into a manageable 30-26 deficit by the end of the half.
Enter Williams, though, who had 11 points in the first half but had plenty more saved for the second. He hit a turnaround jumper, got a steal and score, and drained a 3-pointer to turn a 38-30 lead into a 45-34 advantage with 2:02 left in the third.
Williams was feeling it, and there was nothing Winslow could do to slow him down. After scoring MCI’s last three points of the quarter, he opened the fourth with another three. And then another, with 7:28 left. Another came 29 seconds later. And yet another, with 6:36 to go.
As if that wasn’t enough, he got a putback to prompt Winslow to call for a timeout to stop the bleeding with 5:58 left. Williams had scored 16 points in 3 minutes and 7 seconds, and the score was now out of hand at 65-36.
“I’ve been around high school basketball for a while,” Tardy said, “and I don’t know that I’ve seen a half like that in about 15 years. That’s as good a half as I’ve seen. It was an incredible performance.”
Harrison Sites, MCI’s post presence who played a vital role in the Huskies’ hot start, had the best seat in the house — under the basket as one Williams shot after another swished in.
“You see him hit the first two or three, and you’re like ‘Okay, that’s pretty good,’” he said. “And then they just kept falling. It was ridiculous.”
Williams, who added six rebounds and four steals, said he was just trying to step up for a hurt teammate.
“That was really fun,” he said. “Teammates just got me the ball where I wanted it, and it was just fun playing out there with all of us, having a great time beating a good team.”
Williams said he’d never felt a rhythm like that.
“I was taking what the defense was giving me,” he said. “I just (tried) not to force it and let the game come to me.”
Williams’s run allowed MCI to take control of a game they had from the opening tip. Sites, who finished with 12 points and 14 rebounds, dominated the glass and had eight first-quarter points as MCI scored the first seven points and took a 17-9 lead into the second.
“I’ve always been told all my life, defense and rebounding. Especially rebounding, because on offense, it’s a whole (new) shot that you get,” Sites said. “That’s huge to the team. And kids that need to get hot, if they miss one or two, you can keep dishing to them and they’ll get hot off that.”
“(Sites has) been a little bit of a secret. The jig might be up on that,” said Tardy, whose team also got nine points from Dominic Wilson and six rebounds from Caleb Willis. “He’s a tremendous high school athlete. His effort is unbelievable, and he is just a strong human being.”
Winslow coach Ken Lindlof said the slow start put the Black Raiders in too much of a bind, even before Williams’s spree.
“The first half problem was not coming out with energy and allowing them to dominate the boards and get offensive rebounds and second shots,” he said. “We just never got it going offensively, and I think that affected our defense.”
Colby Pomeroy led Winslow with 16 points, 14 coming in the first half as he tried to rally the Black Raiders back from the early deficit.
“I think we forgot what got us to (our record), which is being a high-energy, kind of gritty team,” Lindlof said. “We don’t necessarily have a lot of firepower, but we find ways to manufacture points and get stops. Today, none of that happened.”

Farmington community stands strong after blast

September ignition of propane gas at LEAP building that killed firefighter still under investigation
FARMINGTON — The Fire Rescue Department and the community have forever changed since the Sept. 16 propane explosion that killed Capt. Michael Bell and injured six firefighters and a maintenance supervisor at the LEAP Inc. building on Farmington Falls Road.
Adjusting to the changes, the department is proactively moving forward with much support from the community.
More than $400,000 has been donated to assist those affected by the explosion, including people who lost their homes, injured firefighters, the family of Capt. Bell, and LEAP Inc. employees.
Deputy Chief S. Clyde Ross, Capt. Tim “TD” Hardy and Joseph Hastings, all of whom were injured in the explosion at the LEAP building that day, are back on the job.
Bell’s brother, Chief Terry Bell, as well as Capt. Scott Baxter and his father, firefighter Ted Baxter, are still recovering. LEAP maintenance supervisor Larry Lord of Jay was listed in serious condition last week at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
“We are all sad but we all have a job to do, our personal experiences help us through it,” Ross said. “We are all facing different stages in the process. There is no set healing rate or time. We all received different injuries.”
Tower 3 recently returned to the firehouse after damages caused by the explosion were repaired. The truck, which was onsite, had damage to the cab and body, acting Chief Hardy said. It cost about $25,000 for the repairs, not including testing or any associated maintenance or services. Engine 2 had to be tested because it was at the explosion as well, he said.
People have a more heightened awareness about the smell of propane and are reporting it to dispatchers. Firefighters have investigated several reports, with some of them confirmed. At least two confirmed reports were caused by a faulty check valve and a leak found around a propane gauge.
“That speaks well for society to be more aware,” Ross said. “Those people are sincere in what they are saying. You have to be thankful for their awareness.”
More than 80 fire departments and individual firefighters stepped in to help Farmington continue to provide services to the community for more than a month after the disaster, with Farmington firefighters always in the mix.
“We’ve had to make some changes in staff. We had to make some changes in the schedule and how we scheduled our staffing,” Hardy said.
They implemented a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. per diem shift. “That’s to ensure that we do have coverage during those hours,” he said.
They are filling a lot of shifts with Farmington firefighters and some from outside the department, he said.
Also visiting the station occasionally are Chief Bell and firefighter Baxter, while well-wishers have been making calls on Bell and Capt. Baxter at their homes.
Even though the injured firefighters are not able to participate in the department’s activities, Ross said the visits offer additional healing for everyone.
Meanwhile, he noted, other firefighters have been taking on more responsibility and are making more decisions within the department. “You see the responsibility acceptance, not that it didn’t happen before,” Ross said.
In the wake of the tragedy, community support has been tremendous, firefighters said. Cards and messages of support continue to cross Hardy’s desk daily — some from people they know, others from unfamiliar supporters.
One message let firefighters know “angels are watching over” them. Another was a donation from a child, unsigned. It is very heartening, Ross said, how many people from across the country have taken their time to send a note or card, thanking the Farmington firefighters for what they do.
“People have been gracious in what they have done. It has just taken me into a different thought process. It’s humbling for what you do. You don’t know how you’ve touched these people and in what way,” Ross said.
Thirty-three people were also displaced when they lost their homes near the explosion site. And more than a dozen LEAP employees were significantly affected as well as two businesses.
“Our thoughts are with the people who lost their homes,” Hardy said. “This didn’t just change the lives of firefighters, but the community as a whole.”
The displaced families were said to have all found homes.
In November, the LEAP Explosion Fund had reached nearly $180,000. The committee overseeing the fund has met four times since the explosion and allocated $136,119.26 to date. Those funds have helped with a variety of needs for the displaced families, including first and last month’s rent and security deposits, replacement of household items, transportation costs and infrastructure repair, according to Executive Director Lisa Park Laflin of the United Way of the Tri-Valley Area.
There have been no new developments in the investigation by the Maine Fire Marshal’s Office as of the week of Dec. 16, according to Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the state’s Department of Public Safety. State and federal investigators determined there was a gas leak in the line that ran from the propane tank behind the LEAP building, under the parking lot and into the basement of the building. The investigation continues into what caused the gas to ignite.

Kennebec County Fund launches

Texto completo: The Maine Community Foundation now has funds for all 16 Maine counties with the addition of the Kennebec County Fund, a permanent endowment that supports projects and nonprofits that strengthen communities. An anonymous family has pledged $250,000 to match all contributions to the fund in 2019 and 2020, according to a news release from the foundation.
A steering committee of community leaders in Kennebec County launched efforts last year to create a fund for the future. “This effort is bringing the county together — from Waterville to Gardiner, from Wayne to Unity — to address the needs of the region, inspire philanthropy in Kennebec County, and strengthen nonprofit organizations that are helping to build communities,” said Wick Johnson, member of MaineCF’s Kennebec County Steering Committee, according to the release.
A committee of local leaders will review Community Building Grant Program applications from Kennebec County’s nonprofit organizations. The next proposal deadline is Feb. 15. For application and guidelines, visit mainecf.org.
MaineCF began its County and Regional Fund Program in 1986. The county funds are built through donations from the community.

Texto completo: The four-story York County Courthouse on Route 1 would be nearly double the maximum height of 35 feet allowed and will require a zoning change.

BIDDEFORD — Residents who live near the site of a proposed $65 million courthouse are raising concerns about the impact the four-story, 117,000-square-foot building will have on the area.
They say the building, which will consolidate three District Courts and a Superior Court, will drastically change their neighborhood, bring more traffic to an already busy road and exacerbate existing issues with flooding and low water pressure.
The state selected a vacant lot on U.S. Route 1 south of downtown for the project three years ago, and Biddeford officials now are reviewing plans for the courthouse. At roughly 68 feet high, it would be nearly double the maximum height of 35 feet allowed in that zone, and city officials will need to approve a contract zone in order for the project to move forward on the parcel, known locally as the Pate property.
“I think this is the wrong place,” said Sterling Roop, who lives adjacent to the courthouse property, on Pinewood Circle. “It doesn’t match the character of the neighborhood.”
The project is the latest step in the state’s long-term plan to consolidate and modernize courthouses. Court officials say the consolidation in York County will help avoid backlogs, improve security and provide technology needed to efficiently handle cases.
“This is a place people are coming to to conduct very serious business. We want to make sure we’re able to give them appropriate access and a good facility for dealing with the issue they need to deal with,” State Court Administrator Ted Glessner said. “We think this is a good project.”
The city council gave its endorsement for a contract zone in September, starting the planning board review process that will continue into the new year. If the project is approved by the planning board, the council will need to give final approval to the contract zone.
Pending that approval, construction is expected to begin in the spring and the courthouse would open in summer 2022, Glessner said.

SITE SELECTED AFTER LONG PROCESS Currently, there are four courthouses spread out across York County, with small District Courts in York, Biddeford and Springvale. The Superior Court is housed in a historic county-owned courthouse in Alfred.
The stately brick Alfred courthouse was built in 1806, expanded in the 1850s and then rebuilt in 1934 following a fire. A 2016 feasibility report found that the courthouse is overcrowded, poses security risks, has no conference room and has courtrooms that are not equipped with necessary technology.
Court officials believe consolidating all four courts in one building will speed up cases that currently take longer than in other counties because of a shortage of courtrooms. Consolidation of District and Superior courts has already occurred in other locations across the state, including Cumberland County.
In 2015, the Legislature approved borrowing $95 million to build or renovate courthouses in York, Oxford and Knox counties as part of its long-range plan to consolidate and modernize courthouses around the state.
The process to choose the site for a new courthouse in York County was a long one. The commission charged with finding a new spot considered 28 locations across York County before whittling the list down to seven properties.
After narrowing it further, the commission considered two Biddeford locations and one in Alfred not far from the current courthouse. Ultimately, the commission chose Biddeford because it is the county’s population center, and selected the Pate property because of its visibility and accessibility from Route 1 and the Maine Turnpike.
“They wanted a place that people would know where it is,” former Sen. Linda Valentino of Saco, who sat on the selection commission, said in 2016. “People will know exactly where this courthouse is, and it will be easy to get to.”
The 28.5-acre parcel sits near the southern end of Route 1, also called Elm Street, between the busy Five Points intersection and the connector road that links Route 1 with Route 111 and the Maine Turnpike interchange.
That stretch of Elm Street is a mix of houses and businesses. A large cemetery sits just south of the courthouse property.
The city purchased the lot in 2014 for $650,000 with plans to use it to access other parcels of city-owned land. The city sold the property to the Maine Governmental Facility Authority in 2017 for $810,000, and Biddeford officials welcomed the idea of a new courthouse in the city.
“This is something that is monumental and unlike something we’ve seen before in terms of courts in York County,” Mayor Alan Casavant said after the Pate property was selected. “The entire gateway (to Biddeford) along Route 1 is going to change dramatically.”

RESIDENTS WANT FENCE, BUFFER It is that dramatic change that is raising concerns with residents who live near the property.
Märgen Soliman, who lives and runs a business in a house on Elm Street just north of the courthouse parcel, told the planning board that the building “does not match the character of the area whatsoever.”
“This shifts in a dramatic way the character of Route 1 as we know it,” she said at a recent meeting.
Conceptual plans presented to the planning board by Finegold Alexander Architects show a four-story courthouse with a brick facade on the section of the parcel closest to Elm Street. Renderings show large stands of trees between the rear of the courthouse and neighbors and a parking lot with roughly 325 spaces at the back of the property.
The building is approximately 117,000 square feet with courtrooms and offices on the first three floors. A “mechanical penthouse” — where mechanical systems are stored — is located on the fourth story. The building will include 11 courtrooms and a mediation suite.
Glessner said earlier plans called for 12 to 15 courtrooms, but the number was cut to 11 after a closer examination of the needs of the court. A mediation suite was added because many more cases are resolved before they go to trial, he said.
The large parking lot for courthouse visitors sits closest to homes in Pinewood Circle, a quiet cul-de-sac built among granite ledges. A tall stand of pine trees separates the homes from the field where the courthouse is planned.
Roop, who bought a house on Pinewood Circle two years ago, said he and his neighbors don’t believe there will be a sufficient buffer between their homes and the courthouse. They have gone to planning board meetings to ask the project managers about light pollution, sound impacts and security.
They have asked for bigger setbacks, a privacy fence around the parking lot and a close examination of how the project will impact traffic on Route 1.
“It shouldn’t be incumbent on every neighbor in our neighborhood to pay thousands of dollars for a fence so that we don’t have people standing in a parking lot looking into our backyards,” resident Meaghan Daly told the planning board at a recent meeting. “It seems a very simple thing for the state to put fencing around the entire parking lot.”
Roop said he and many of his neighbors have been frustrated by what they feel is a lack of communication about these concerns.
Even so, Glessner said the abutters have been helpful in coming forward to identify things they see as issues.
“It’s a big project, so it changes that area. We hope it will be better, and we hope we’ll be good neighbors,” he said. “It’s natural people would wonder what is this going to mean in terms of traffic and noise. We think this is a site that will be compatible and will be a good neighbor for the folks who are abutters.”
Clair Colburn, the project manager with Finegold Alexander Architects, told the planning board that a 6-foot privacy fence between the property and the neighborhood was added, and a buffer around the property line was extended to 30 feet.
Colburn said a tree survey was being done, along with other work to finalize plans and obtain traffic and stormwater permits from the state. The planning board has not yet taken any action but will continue the site plan approval process in 2020. City Planner Greg Tansley does not have an estimated timeline for how long that process will take.
Roop said he and others from the neighborhood will continue to review the plans and are optimistic their voices will be factored into the process.
“We care about this more than anyone else because we live there,” he said. “But we want to make sure this is done right.”

Texto completo: The parents of 8-year-old Owen Oates remain hospitalized Monday at Maine Medical Center in Portland.

Two Standish elementary schools are providing counseling after a weekend crash killed a third-grade student and critically injured a school custodian.
Owen Oates, an 8-year-old student at Edna Libby, died in the Saturday morning crash. His parents — Vincent Oates, 51, and Kerry Oates, 46 — were critically injured in the crash on Route 35. Danilo Warrick, 75, of Standish, who was driving one of three cars involved in the accident, was also taken to Maine Medical Center with critical injuries.
Warrick was in serious condition Monday, said Maine Medical Center spokesman Clay Holtzman. Warrick is a custodian at Edna Libby and George E. Jack elementary schools, according to school officials.
Vincent Oates has been upgraded to serious condition and Kerry Oates remained in critical condition Monday night, Holtzman said.
The crash remains under investigation and no new information about a possible cause was available Monday, according to Capt. Craig Smith of the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office. The road conditions at the time of the crash were unknown, but will likely be looked at by an accident reconstruction team, police said.
Warrick — known as “Mr. Dan” to students and staff — has been a custodian at Edna Libby for 26 years. The school’s Sunshine Committee launched an online fundraiser to support Warrick as he heals. The fundraiser had raised more than $4,400 by Monday afternoon.
“He adores our students and goes above and beyond in supporting them and the events at our school,” organizer Marissa Cutter wrote on the GoFundMe page.
A separate GoFundMe page was set up over the weekend for the Oates family. By Monday afternoon, nearly 700 people had donated a total of more than $45,000.
The organizer of the GoFundMe page for the Oates family said Monday that Vincent was out of surgery, but faces a long recovery period.
In a message to parents posted on Facebook, staff from both Edna Libby and George E. Jack elementary schools said counselors were available to parents Monday morning to provide information about how to communicate with their children about the death of a peer.
When Edna Libby students return to school Thursday from winter break, teachers will start the day with a brief discussion with their class about what happened. After that, counseling services will be available for students. A supervised quiet place will be set aside Thursday and Friday for students who need space to process.
School officials said in the note to parents that counseling support will be focused on Edna Libby students and staff, but staff at George E. Jack will monitor students for signs of distress.

Percy the opossum 'living his quiet life'

Texto completo: The Rumford animal made headlines this summer when his tail was cut off and he was left for dead.
AUBURN — Six months after his tail was cut off, Percy the elderly opossum is fat and happy at Misfits Rehab.
Happy-ish anyway.
“He’s a pain to deal with. You know, he’s a very wild animal,” said wildlife rehabilitator Jennifer Marchigiani. “But he’s a good boy. He eats well. He’s actually tolerant of us now. He’s gotten to the point where we’re no longer scary to him.”
Percy had been popular among some residents in Rumford, where he’d roamed the same neighborhood for at least a couple of years. But in June, one of those residents found Percy gravely injured after someone cut off his tail.
The Maine Warden Service investigated Rumford resident Erik Matthews, 32, and summonsed him for animal cruelty, a civil violation. According to the Warden Service, Matthews told the investigator the opossum attacked him, so he stomped on the animal, cut off his tail and left, believing he was dead. Those who know Percy said he’s always been docile and they doubted he attacked.
Matthews died in August after being hit by a car while walking in the dark on a road in Windham.
In the wild, opossums need their tails to help stabilize them as they climb trees, keep their balance along branches and gather food. Because he no longer has a tail, Percy can never be returned to the wild. He will live at Misfits Rehab in Auburn for the rest of his life.
Marchigiani received so many inquiries about Percy over the summer that she gave him his own Facebook page, where people can see a photo of him eating celebratory ice cream or watch a video of him getting a bubble bath. He now has 1,400 followers.
“I don’t want to stress him out, so I’m not going to be like, ‘Hey, pose for this picture!’ every day,” Marchigiani said. “So I let him do his thing and when I have an opportunity to take a cute picture, I’ll post it.”
Today, Percy spends his time in an indoor enclosure built for his needs. For climbing, he has a cat tree. For walking, he has a cat wheel — which is a lot like a giant hamster wheel for cats. Or, apparently, opossums.
“He actually walks on it, which is as cute as can be,” Marchigiani said. “We haven’t seen him run on it, but I have definitely seen him (walk). He gets on it and it starts to move and he just kind of continues walking, then trots on the wheel like, ‘OK, I’m going nowhere quickly.'”
Percy was too thin when he arrived at Misfits Rehab, but he has since gained weight. Because his teeth are poor — he has dental treatment scheduled with a local vet — he sticks to soft foods, favoring bananas, cat food, cooked vegetables, eggs and string cheese.
“I open the door and he’s like, ‘Hey, where’s my cheese stick?'” Marchigiani said. “He gets his string cheese daily.”
Percy will spend this winter indoors. In the spring, he will be able to spend time in an outdoor enclosure.
“Other than that, he’s just living his quiet life,” Marchigiani said.

Texto completo: The year was highlighted by acts of heroism, downtown changes and high profile crime.

In 2019, central Maine saw Belgrade postal workers help a man escape a burning tanker truck, Kennebec County enact criminal justice system reforms, a cyberattack that shut down Augusta’s city government and a local resident who sought a kidney donor by advertising on her lawn later work to find organ donors for others in need.
The morning of Jan. 2, Belgrade mail carriers Nick Claudel and Joe Arsenault were working at the Route 27 post office. That’s when they and their co-workers were forced to evacuate after a fuel-filled tanker truck struck a vehicle that had pulled in front of it and overturned, bursting into a wall of flames.
The driver of the truck, Mark Tuttle, of Albion, remained inside the cab trying to grab a fire extinguisher. The two mail carriers went into the cab of the truck through its broken windshield and pulled Tuttle to safety, less than a minute before the fuel erupted into a wall of flames reaching some 50 feet into the sky. Their actions earned the duo the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association’s Hero of the Year Award.
In May, Kennebec County officials announced new initiatives seeking to reduce the amount of time poor or mentally ill people spend in custody in the criminal justice system without being convicted of a crime. They also said they would begin using medication-assisted treatment to help inmates at the county jail addicted to drugs escape their addictions.
Two of the initiatives — switching to a risk-assessment based bail system in which only high-risk suspects are required to post cash bail and using medication to help inmates fight drug addiction in jail — were the first of their kind in Maine. A third created a “mental health docket” in the courts that meets once a month in an effort to reduce the amount of time people with mental illness who are accused of crimes and are arrested spend stuck in the system waiting for an assessment of whether they are mentally competent and speed the process of them connecting with services that could help them.
Downtown Augusta’s Water Street, which for the previous 75 years was one-way only, was converted to two-way traffic in August, in large part to try to help downtown businesses by increasing the traffic count. So far reviews of the change have been mixed, with police saying there have been no accidents reported there since the change, but some shop owners saying their customers are having a hard time getting to their stores because they can’t find parking.
Hallowell’s downtown Water Street underwent some changes in 2019, too, with work wrapping up on a major reconstruction of the street, which saw the removal of a large crown that had built up toward the center of the street. The work included the addition of a controversial section of sidewalk running from Lucky Garden Chinese restaurant to the state boat landing.
Augusta resident Krystal Reardon, who was able to get a donated kidney from an anonymous donor to replace her damaged kidney in February, responded by looking to help other Mainers in need of a transplant. She used colorful signs placed on her lawn to help find a living donor. She then continued to post signs on her lawn, helping to raise awareness for others in need of help.
Augusta City Center was forced to close for two days in April by a cyberattack that shut down the city’s computer network. The unknown source of the cyberattack sought a ransom payment of more than $100,000 to unlock the frozen system. Instead of paying that ransom, city officials — who as soon as they knew an attack was underway disconnected the network — decided they had the necessary data backed up so they erased the city’s servers and restored them.
Andrew Sherman, 48, was found deceased at his Richmond home Oct. 11, with authorities classifying his death as a homicide, a crime that so far remains unsolved. His body was found by a friend who was concerned he had not heard from him and police have interviewed family members, friends and area residents.
Also left unresolved in Richmond is the disappearance of resident Anneliese Heinig, a 37-year-old mother of two reported missing Nov. 28. She was last spotted walking along Interstate 295 two days earlier, having left her vehicle on the side of the road.
In neighboring Litchfield, a local couple, Derek, 48, and Stephanie Trudeau, 40, were killed in November after another Litchfield resident, 60-year-old Shawn W. Metayer allegedly crossed over the center line with his sport utility vehicle and struck the truck Derek Trudeau was driving. Metayer was later arrested and charged with two felony counts of manslaughter and one count of aggravated operating under the influence.
In December, Boys & Girls Club of Kennebec Valley officials launched a community fundraising effort to build a new, larger, $10 million facility that would be built next to the current building on the club’s 7.5 acres adjacent to Gardiner Area High School in Gardiner.
Prominent central Mainers who died in 2019 included former Augusta mayor, city councilor, businessman and philanthropist John Bridge, Hallowell businessman known for his work with local immigrant communities Joel Davis, and former Winthrop resident, police officer and decorated U.S. Army veteran Gilbert R. Turcotte.
In October, new court proceedings for a Sidney man, who in 2014 pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison for allegedly raping a 4-year-old girl got underway, after the Maine Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bard’s appeal in 2018 and granted him a new trial. The high court ruled Bard was deprived of due process because Maeghan Maloney, district attorney for Kennebec and Somerset counties, met during the trial with Superior Court Justice Donald Marden, at his request, without a lawyer for the defendant present.
Maloney was admonished for meeting with Marden by a Maine Board of Overseers of the Bar panel in May. Whether Marden is also facing disciplinary action is unclear. Unlike complaints against attorneys, complaints against judges in Maine are handled confidentially, unless disciplinary action is taken by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.
Several area residents were sentenced this year after being convicted of crimes. They included three teenagers accused of killing Kimberly Mironovas, of the mother of one of the three teens. Her son Lukas Mironovas, 16, pleaded guilty to murder and conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced to 33 years in prison, William Smith, 17, pleaded guilty to those same charges and was sentenced to 28 years in prison and Thomas “TJ” Severance, 14, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced to Long Creek Youth Development Center until he is 21 years old.
Also sentenced to prison this year were:
• Ryan Beaudette, the former Litchfield Fair treasurer who admitted to stealing more than $150,000 from the Litchfield Farmers’ Club, who was sentenced to 18 months and ordered to pay back the roughly $129,000 he owed the fair;
• Augusta convicted sex offender Robert L. Robinson III, who before his arrest drew complaints from area parents about him photographing young girls in public, who was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography; and
• Derrick Dupont, of Whitefield, who shot James Haskell eight times, killing him, in a 2017 early morning altercation in West Gardiner, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison on a manslaughter charge.

Texto completo: The parents of 8-year-old Owen Oates remain hospitalized Monday at Maine Medical Center in Portland.

Two Standish elementary schools are providing counseling after a weekend crash killed a third-grade student and critically injured a school custodian.
Owen Oates, an 8-year-old student at Edna Libby, died in the Saturday morning crash. His parents — Vincent Oates, 51, and Kerry Oates, 46 — were critically injured in the crash on Route 35. Danilo Warrick, 75, of Standish, who was driving one of three cars involved in the accident, was also taken to Maine Medical Center with critical injuries.
Warrick was in serious condition Monday, said Maine Medical Center spokesman Clay Holtzman. Warrick is a custodian at Edna Libby and George E. Jack elementary schools, according to school officials.
Vincent Oates has been upgraded to serious condition and Kerry Oates remained in critical condition Monday night, Holtzman said.
The crash remains under investigation and no new information about a possible cause was available Monday, according to Capt. Craig Smith of the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office. The road conditions at the time of the crash were unknown, but will likely be looked at by an accident reconstruction team, police said.
Warrick — known as “Mr. Dan” to students and staff — has been a custodian at Edna Libby for 26 years. The school’s Sunshine Committee launched an online fundraiser to support Warrick as he heals. The fundraiser had raised more than $4,400 by Monday afternoon.
“He adores our students and goes above and beyond in supporting them and the events at our school,” organizer Marissa Cutter wrote on the GoFundMe page.
A separate GoFundMe page was set up over the weekend for the Oates family. By Monday afternoon, nearly 700 people had donated a total of more than $45,000.
The organizer of the GoFundMe page for the Oates family said Monday that Vincent was out of surgery, but faces a long recovery period.
In a message to parents posted on Facebook, staff from both Edna Libby and George E. Jack elementary schools said counselors were available to parents Monday morning to provide information about how to communicate with their children about the death of a peer.
When Edna Libby students return to school Thursday from winter break, teachers will start the day with a brief discussion with their class about what happened. After that, counseling services will be available for students. A supervised quiet place will be set aside Thursday and Friday for students who need space to process.
School officials said in the note to parents that counseling support will be focused on Edna Libby students and staff, but staff at George E. Jack will monitor students for signs of distress.

Texto completo: Ignition of propane gas at LEAP building still under investigation.
FARMINGTON — The Fire Rescue Department and the community have forever changed since the Sept. 16 propane explosion that killed Capt. Michael Bell and injured six firefighters and a maintenance supervisor at the LEAP Inc. building on Farmington Falls Road.
Adjusting to the changes, the department is proactively moving forward with much support from the community.
More than $400,000 has been donated to assist those affected by the explosion, including people who lost their homes, injured firefighters, the family of Capt. Bell, and LEAP Inc. employees.
Deputy Chief S. Clyde Ross, Capt. Tim “TD” Hardy and Joseph Hastings, all of whom were injured in the explosion at the LEAP building that day, are back on the job.
Bell’s brother, Chief Terry Bell, as well as Capt. Scott Baxter and his father, firefighter Ted Baxter, are still recovering. LEAP maintenance supervisor Larry Lord of Jay was listed in serious condition last week at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
“We are all sad but we all have a job to do, our personal experiences help us through it,” Ross said. “We are all facing different stages in the process. There is no set healing rate or time. We all received different injuries.”
Tower 3 recently returned to the firehouse after damages caused by the explosion were repaired. The truck, which was onsite, had damage to the cab and body, acting Chief Hardy said. It cost about $25,000 for the repairs, not including testing or any associated maintenance or services. Engine 2 had to be tested because it was at the explosion as well, he said.
People have a more heightened awareness about the smell of propane and are reporting it to dispatchers. Firefighters have investigated several reports, with some of them confirmed. At least two confirmed reports were caused by a faulty check valve and a leak found around a propane gauge.
“That speaks well for society to be more aware,” Ross said. “Those people are sincere in what they are saying. You have to be thankful for their awareness.”
More than 80 fire departments and individual firefighters stepped in to help Farmington continue to provide services to the community for more than a month after the disaster, with Farmington firefighters always in the mix.
“We’ve had to make some changes in staff. We had to make some changes in the schedule and how we scheduled our staffing,” Hardy said.
They implemented a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. per diem shift. “That’s to ensure that we do have coverage during those hours,” he said.
They are filling a lot of shifts with Farmington firefighters and some from outside the department, he said.
Also visiting the station occasionally are Chief Bell and firefighter Baxter, while well-wishers have been making calls on Bell and Capt. Baxter at their homes.
Even though the injured firefighters are not able to participate in the department’s activities, Ross said the visits offer additional healing for everyone.
Meanwhile, he noted, other firefighters have been taking on more responsibility and are making more decisions within the department. “You see the responsibility acceptance, not that it didn’t happen before,” Ross said.
In the wake of the tragedy, community support has been tremendous, firefighters said. Cards and messages of support continue to cross Hardy’s desk daily — some from people they know, others from unfamiliar supporters.
One message let firefighters know “angels are watching over” them. Another was a donation from a child, unsigned. It is very heartening, Ross said, how many people from across the country have taken their time to send a note or card, thanking the Farmington firefighters for what they do.
“People have been gracious in what they have done. It has just taken me into a different thought process. It’s humbling for what you do. You don’t know how you’ve touched these people and in what way,” Ross said.
Thirty-three people were also displaced when they lost their homes near the explosion site. And more than a dozen LEAP employees were significantly affected as well as two businesses.
“Our thoughts are with the people who lost their homes,” Hardy said. “This didn’t just change the lives of firefighters, but the community as a whole.”
The displaced families were said to have all found homes.
In November, the LEAP Explosion Fund had reached nearly $180,000. The committee overseeing the fund has met four times since the explosion and allocated $136,119.26 to date. Those funds have helped with a variety of needs for the displaced families, including first and last month’s rent and security deposits, replacement of household items, transportation costs and infrastructure repair, according to Executive Director Lisa Park Laflin of the United Way of the Tri-Valley Area.
There have been no new developments in the investigation by the Maine Fire Marshal’s Office as of the week of Dec. 16, according to Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the state’s Department of Public Safety. State and federal investigators determined there was a gas leak in the line that ran from the propane tank behind the LEAP building, under the parking lot and into the basement of the building. The investigation continues into what caused the gas to ignite.

Texto completo: Two bald eagles, apparently juveniles, spent Sunday afternoon perched high atop a tree on Meetinghouse Hill, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers.

SOUTH PORTLAND — It was a rather unlikely place for two birds of prey to land and hang out for a few hours — a tall, leafless tree overlooking Hobbs Funeral Home in South Portland’s Meetinghouse Hill neighborhood.
But that’s exactly where two bald eagles, which appeared to be juveniles, ended up Sunday afternoon, perched in the upper branches of the tree in the front yard of a home at 241 Cottage Road.
The eagles spent most of the afternoon in the tree, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers, who pulled their cars over so that they could snap photographs of the birds.
“It has been pretty neat to see them. They’ve been causing quite a stir,” said Patrick Mosley, who brought his two children as well as a neighbor’s child to watch the eagles. A neighbor, who had been walking a dog near the eagles’ perch, made him aware of the spectacle.
“It’s so huge,” 5-year-old Bromwyn Mosley remarked as she and her two friends romped through a grassy area across the street from the tree.
“It’s great,” said 7-year-old Ariana Simpson as she peered up at one of the eagles.
The eagles’ appearance brought old friends together.
Beth Lubetkin, of Cape Elizabeth, spotted the birds earlier in the day and left the Meetinghouse Hill neighborhood to pick up a friend, Ruth Cohen, of Portland, since they were planning to have dinner together. When Lubetkin drove past a second time, the eagles were still in the tree.
While the women were watching the eagles, Cohen met another friend, Bobbie Muse. It turns out that Lubetkin had met Muse about five years ago at the Jewish Film Festival.
Doug Hitchcox, a staff naturalist with Maine Audubon in Falmouth, said it is not uncommon to see eagles in urban settings. The population of eagles in Maine is undergoing a resurgence, and Hitchcox said Mainers can expect to see more of the birds in areas that you might not expect to encounter one.
“The eagle population has come back in Maine and the odds of encountering one has gotten much higher,” he said. “It’s a highlight of a great success story of being able to reestablish the eagle population in Maine.”
The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife did a statewide inventory of nesting bald eagles in 2018 and determined there were 734 nesting pairs — an increase of 102 nesting pairs since 2013. Population increases occurred in all 16 counties, according to the inventory. Maine’s bald eagles are primarily fish eaters, but in coastal estuaries and offshore they can eat a more varied diet that includes seabirds and waterfowl. Scavenging for carrion becomes more prevalent when ice forms over waterways, limiting their food availability.
By late afternoon, more than 20 people stood on sidewalks and snapped photos of the one remaining bird. The bird — which appeared to be mostly black, as juvenile eagles are — remained still for several minutes.
Suddenly, without warning, just before 4 p.m., the last eagle left its perch, spread its wings, and took flight heading in the direction of Casco Bay.

Texto completo: If looking for a way to start 2020 on the right foot, consider a walk in Maine's snowy wilderness. And if you'd like some company or you don't know what trail to explore, you're in luck.
Five Maine state parks will be hosting guided First Day Hikes on Jan. 1, making it easy for people to kick off the New Year with a healthy outdoor activity.
The participating parks are Bradbury Mountain State Park in Pownal, Holbrook Island Sanctuary in Brooksville, Lake St. George State Park in Liberty, Lily Bay State Park in Beaver Cove and Wolfe's Neck Woods State Park in Freeport. The hikes will be led by park staff and volunteers. Distance and difficulty of the trails vary from park to park.
These guided hikes are a part of America's State Parks First Day Hikes program, which began more than 25 years ago at Blue Hills Reservation, a state park in Massachusetts. All 50 states now participate in this program, which is sponsored by the National Association of State Park Directors.
In addition, a number of Maine land trusts, hiking groups and other outdoor organizations have organized hikes for Jan. 1, including Greater Lovell Land Trust and the Appalachian Mountain Club.
The following list includes details about the Maine state park First Day Hikes. Dress warmly and wear suitable footwear. New Year's Day is expected to be breezy, with mostly cloudy skies and temperatures in the 30s throughout much of Maine (warmer in the south and colder in the north, as is often the case). Park admission is free for participants.
Bradbury Mountain State Park, Pownal -- A guided hike to the summit of Bradbury Mountain with Registered Maine Guide Jeanne Christie starting at 10 a.m. Along the way, you'll learn about the history of the park and identify species and animal tracks. The plan is to hike to the summit on the Northern Loop Trail and descend to the base on the Terrace Trail, where hot cocoa will be available. Meet at the upper parking lot at 528 Hallowell Road in Pownal. Plan on one to two hours. Snowshoe rentals are available. For more information, call 207-688-4712 or Jeanne Christy at 207-310-8708.
Holbrook Island Sanctuary, Brooksville -- A leisurely mile and a half walk from 1 to 3 p.m. to enjoy the peacefulness of the coast of Maine. The group will meet at the Backshore Trail parking area on Indian Bar Road on Cape Rosier in Brooksville. The walk will be on old roads to the Shoreline Trail with views of Holbrook and Islesboro Islands. The group will take a break at Goose Falls (a reversing tidal waterfall) and return by Back Road. Snacks and hot drinks will be provided. Leashed pets are welcome. For more information, call 207-326-4012.
Lake St. George State Park, Liberty -- An easy 1-mile hike through the day use area and campground or a more challenging 3-mile hike across the lake around Hawaii 2 Island, dependent on ice conditions. The event starts at 10 a.m. and may run until 1 p.m. Meet at the first day use parking lot past the entry booth at 278 Belfast Augusta Road (Route 3) in Liberty. Bring snowshoes, creepers, skis and or hiking boots, and dress for the weather. A warming hut will be located inside the barn. Snacks and hot beverages will be provided. Leashed dogs are welcome. For more information, call 207-589-4255.
Lily Bay State Park, Beaver Cove -- There will be two hikes: a 1-mile hike for beginners and a 3-mile hike for people looking for a longer trek. The event will run from noon to 3 p.m. Both hikes will be on fairly even woodland trails that visit the shore of Moosehead Lake. Snacks and hot drinks will be provided at the end of the hike, along with a warm bonfire. Meet at the entry booth parking lot on State Park Road, which is located off Lily Bay Road in Beaver Cove. For more information, call 207-695-2700.
Wolfe's Neck Woods State Park, Freeport -- An easy 0.3-mile guided walk to enjoy winter in the woods and learn about how plants and animals survive in the cold winter months. Meet at the picnic shelter by the second parking lot at 426 Wolf Neck Road in Freeport. The walk begins at 2 p.m. Plan for one hour. Pets are welcome but must be on a leash at all times. Hot cocoa and cookies will be provided after the hike. For information, call 207-865-4465.

New year will welcome pair of cold fronts

Texto completo: A cold front is forecast to precede the new year, ushering in 2020 with sunnier skies and an end to the spasms of rain plaguing South Florida.
The front, which is expected to make its way into the Florida Straits today, is no brute, with temperatures forecast to cool only to what’s normal for this time of year — upper 50s overnight, daytime highs in the mid-70s.
But a taste of drier air after a record-rainy December likely will be greeted with the same enthusiasm as the decade-ending calendar shift by visitors and residents alike.
“It’s beautiful in the sun for a couple hours, and then it rains, and then it’s back to sunshine,” said Rick Netzel, director of sales and marketing at the Best Western on Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard. “Our guests are just dealing with it. They pop out to our heated pool and then go under the tent when it rains.”
Through Monday, 9.36 inches of rain had fallen this month at Palm Beach International Airport. That’s a whopping 6.09 inches more than normal and put December in third place for the rainiest in records dating back more than a century.
The history-making accumulation was aided by a Saturday deluge that netted 2.23 inches of rain at the airport.
Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Miami, said a pattern of storms from the Great Plains through the Northeast positioned themselves this month so that rich tropical air surged as if on a conveyor belt into South Florida.
While some clouds may persist into today, sunny skies are forecast for New Year’s Day with a high of 75 degrees.
Cold front attached to major winter storm
Today’s cold front is attached to a major winter storm that has triggered ice storm warnings and forecasts of snow and sleet in parts of New York through northern Maine.
More than a half inch of ice is possible in some of the higher terrain areas of eastern New York, Vermont and western Massachusetts where ice storm and winter storm warnings are in effect, according to the National Weather Service.
“I’m sure some people may be disappointed by the rain, but, hey, the weather is better than any other place in the country right now, except maybe Hawaii,” said Glenn Jergensen, executive director of the Palm Beach County Tourist Development Council. “I think people know there are so many other things to do here besides going to the beach.”
Rip current risks, which have been high with a lingering northeast swell and blustery east winds, should be reduced following the front as winds shift out of the northwest and then north.
The dry weather may be short-lived, however, as a stronger cold front approaches South Florida later in the week. Mostly cloudy skies and rain chances of 20% are in Friday’s forecast, with wind gusts as high as 20 mph. By Sunday, the high temperature in West Palm Beach may struggle to reach 70.
Netzel said he’s heard no weather-related grousing from Best Western guests who filled his hotel this month to 75% capacity.
“A little R and R in our courtyard and around our pool and they’re fine,” he said.

Texto completo: Andrew Yang began his closing statement at the last Democratic debate with a charming bit of self-deprecation: “I know what you’re thinking, America. How am I still on this stage with them?”
Yang has never been elected to any office. He is a businessman who has never run a major company. Even so, he is one of the Democratic Party’s seven leading candidates for an election that everybody agrees is desperately important. The other six on the debate stage included another businessman who has never held office and a mayor who has never won an election with more than 10,991 votes.
As funny as Yang’s line may have been, he was highlighting a real problem: Our process for selecting presidential nominees is badly flawed.
It is, as Jonathan Rauch and Ray La Raja recently wrote in The Atlantic, “a spectacle that would have struck earlier generations as ludicrous.” It has come to resemble a reality television show, in which a pseudo-scientific process (polls plus donor numbers) winnows the field. The winner is then chosen by a distorted series of primaries and caucuses: The same few states always get outsize influence, and a crude, unranked voting system can produce a nominee whom most people don’t want.
No wonder the current president is a reality-television star, not to mention the most unfit occupant of the office in our country’s history. “The victory of Donald Trump in 2016 is best understood as a failure of the process,” political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has written, “and a failure of the Republican Party to prevent an outsider from taking its presidential nomination — the most important thing that U.S. political parties have.”
The current system may seem as if it’s simply an expression of democracy, but it’s not. It’s one version of democracy. And it’s one that virtually no other country uses. In other democracies, political parties have more sway in selecting the nominee, and voters then choose among the major nominees. Until recently, the United States also gave party leaders a larger role in selecting nominees.
Today’s leaders have abdicated this job, afraid to do anything that might appear elitist because it substitutes the judgment of experts for that of ordinary citizens. The irony is that the new process may actually do a poorer job of picking nominees whom ordinary citizens like, as research by Dennis Spies and André Kaiser, looking across countries, suggests.
How could this be? When voters are given the dominant role in choosing a nominee — as with primaries here — only an unrepresentative subset tends to participate, which skews the process. Party leaders, on the other hand, have a big incentive to choose a broadly liked candidate. Just think about American history: Nominees chosen by party leaders have included Abraham Lincoln, both Roosevelts and Dwight Eisenhower.
I’m not suggesting we return to the smoke-filled rooms of the past. But the current process puts a higher priority on the appearance of democracy than the reality of it. We’re left with candidates fighting to do well enough in early polls to get into the debates and then to win 30% of the vote in Iowa and New Hampshire, which can launch them toward the nomination.
A better approach would balance snapshots of popular opinion with rules more likely to produce strong, qualified nominees.
The first change should be to the debates. The candidates’ electoral history and qualifications currently count for nothing. The 2020 Democratic field, for example, has included four two-term governors, all of whom have been excluded from debates despite a track record of winning votes and governing successfully. In their place have been candidates, like Yang, who managed to crack 4% in a few polls.
It makes more sense for only the true polling leaders to be guaranteed debate slots. Beyond them, the party could set aside at least one spot for a governor and perhaps one for a senator from a large state or swing state.
A second set of changes would involve the primaries themselves. More states should adopt ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to list their second and third choices. Memphis, Minneapolis, New York City, San Francisco and the state of Maine, among other places, have adopted this system for some elections.
Ranked choice can prevent the Trump phenomenon during the 2016 Republican primaries. Trump may have solid Republican support today, but he didn’t back then. Even though most Republican voters opposed him, his dedicated base let him emerge from a large field.
It’s also past time to end the special treatment that Iowa and New Hampshire receive, by always voting first. They are two overwhelmingly white, disproportionately baby boomer states (and the fact that Iowa voted for Barack Obama in 2008 doesn’t give it a permanent pass). The primary calendar should instead rotate every four years, with the first states always including a mix of states: big and small, young and old, urban and rural, coastal and heartland.
The seven candidates who made the last Democratic debate stage all have their strengths, but as a group, they offer an indictment of the nomination process. There are three candidates in their 70s — and no African American or Latino. There are two people who have never won an election — and zero who have ever run a state.
Of course, the biggest sign that the process is broken isn’t any of those seven. It is the man in the Oval Office.

Texto completo: Washington • Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, criticized some of her Senate colleagues, including the majority leader, for appearing to “prejudge the evidence” in impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, becoming the second Republican senator to question Sen. Mitch McConnell’s pledge to coordinate with the White House.
Impeachment rules require a simple majority vote, meaning McConnell, R-Ky., can afford to lose only four members of his conference if he is to set the parameters of a trial. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, another moderate with an independent streak, said last week that she was “disturbed” by McConnell’s promise to work with the White House counsel to set the terms of the trial.
Both Murkowski and Collins also offered noncommittal positions on calling witnesses to an impeachment trial, which Democrats have pushed and McConnell has resisted. And both women questioned why the House did not go to court when administration officials ignored subpoenas. (Democrats, who control the House, have asserted that going to court to compel testimony from administration officials would take too long when the 2020 election is already in danger.)
“It is inappropriate, in my judgment, for senators on either side of the aisle to prejudge the evidence before they have heard what is presented to us, because each of us will take an oath, an oath that I take very seriously to render impartial justice,” Collins said in an interview with Maine Public Radio that was broadcast Monday. “That’s what it says, impartial justice.”
[ Read more: Sen. Mitt Romney isn’t taking sides ahead of Senate trial ]
She specifically referenced remarks from McConnell, that he would take his cues from the White House, and from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, who openly supported the impeachment of the president.
“There are senators on both sides of the aisle, who, to me, are not giving the appearance of and the reality of judging this in an impartial way,” she said, a sentiment she echoed in a separate interview with News Center Maine, a local television station.
With Collins and Murkowski doubting their leaders’ approach, scrutiny will fall on independent-minded Republicans like Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and retiring Republicans such as Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who could force Republican and Democratic leaders to work out the terms of a trial the way they did in 1999 with the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.
An aide to McConnell on Tuesday pointed to instances during the Clinton impeachment trial in which Clinton and his lawyers were in communication with Senate Democrats over proceedings, suggesting that the current leader’s pledge to coordinate was nothing new and nothing to apologize for.
Collins, who was in the Senate during that trial, has repeatedly refused to weigh in on the allegations that Trump abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress, citing the need to remain impartial. She told both news outlets that she had compiled a thick notebook with documents from the last trial and had pressed Senate leaders to adhere to the framework set in 1999.
Drawing on her experience from the Clinton trial, Collins also said she was “open” to hearing from witnesses during proceedings against Trump. Democrats, led by Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, have pressured McConnell to allow them to call members of the Trump administration to testify in a trial.
Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., one of his caucus’s most vulnerable members, said in an opinion article published Monday in The Washington Post that “for Americans to have confidence in the impeachment process, the Senate must conduct a full, fair and complete trial with all relevant evidence regarding the president’s conduct.”
But while Schumer said in his opening proposal to McConnell that the issue of witnesses and documents should be determined before the trial begins, Collins said that she would prefer to wait to decide who specifically should be called.
“I think it’s premature to decide who should be called until we see the evidence that is presented and get the answers to the questions that we senators can submit through the chief justice to both sides,” she told the radio station.

Texto completo: PORTLAND — The Portland Symphony Orchestra, led by PSO Music Director Eckart Preu with guest pianist Ran Dank, will perform at 2:30 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 19, and at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 21, at Merrill Auditorium. The program is comprised of Robin Holcomb, “No Thing Lives to Itself”; Saint-Saens, “Piano Concerto No. 2”; and Tchaikovsky, “Symphony No. 2 Little Russian.”
Contemporary composer Robin Holcomb’s piece is a PSO world premiere, commissioned by the League of American Orchestras with support from the Virginia B. Toulmin Foundation. This work is a reflection on the time that Rachel Carson, renowned American environmentalist and author, lived and worked in a small cottage she built in 1953 on Southport Island in Maine.
The title comes from a paper Carson delivered at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1953 in which she said, “So even in the waters of the sea, we are brought back to the fundamental truth that nothing lives to itself.” This is Holcomb’s second composition about Rachel Carson.
Eckart Preu will reveal the PSO 2020-21 season on stage at each concert.
Guest artist Ran Dank’s notable performances during 2019-20 season include appearances at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., the Hawaii Concert Society, Purdue Convocations, Gina Bachauer Concert Series, two consecutive recitals at the Pro Musica series in San Miguel de Allende in Mexico and a collaboration with Jayce Ogren and the Westchester Philharmonic. Ran Dank is the recipient of numerous honors, including the Naumburg Piano Competition and the Sydney International Piano Competition, and first prize winner of the Hilton Head International Piano Competition.
Related concert activities will include the following:
Music Lovers’ Luncheon: Featuring Eckart Preu and composer Robin Holcomb at noon Friday, Jan. 17, at the Portland Country Club. The luncheon is $35 a person and offers an opportunity to meet and hear from Preu and Holcomb. For reservations, visit portlandsymphony.org or call 207-773-6128, ext. 305. Space is limited.
Pre-Concert Conversation: An hour and 15 minutes prior to the concert. It is free to all ticket holders and held in Merrill Auditorium. The discussion will focus on works by Robin Holcomb, Saint-Saëns, and Tchaikovsky.

Matt Leonard hopes to unseat ‘super, super nice guy’

Texto completo: AUBURN – Republican Matt Leonard said state Sen. Ned Claxton, an Auburn Democrat, is “a super, super nice guy.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-9791583" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/Matt-Leonard-209x300.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="300" />
But he hopes to send him packing.
Leonard, 43, said Tuesday that he’s going to run against the first-term senator in Maine’s 20th Senate District and hopes he won’t have to deal with a GOP primary first.
Leonard, who lost a City Council race in November, said the dynamics of a Senate race are different because the district spans several towns and the race relies less on personal relations than in a purely local contest.
The council, he said, “is not the right size and scope for my skill set.”
Leonard, a Maine native, served 21 years in the U.S. Navy, retiring as a senior chief petty officer. He is a multi-tour combat veteran.
A business consultant, Leonard said he would push in Augusta for lower taxes, fewer regulations and greater personal liberty.
“We need to make it easier for people to live their best lives,” Leonard said.
He said that while “people really like Ned,” they don’t necessarily agree with his positions on the issues. Claxton, he said, “does what he’s told” by Democratic leaders.
Claxton, a retired physician, hasn’t said whether he will seek re-election. He won the seat in 2018 in a close race against Republican Ellie Espling of New Gloucester.
Before Claxton’s victory, the seat had been held for two terms by Republican Eric Brakey of Auburn, who gave it up for an unsuccessful U.S. Senate bid. Brakey is vying for the 2nd Congressional District seat.
The district, which includes Auburn, New Gloucester, Poland, Minot and Mechanic Falls, has often flipped between parties over the years. It is among the seats that Republicans are most keen to win back in 2020.
Leonard, a veteran who founded Military Talent Source, said he anticipates a lot of outside interest in the race, but hopes both sides will continue to refrain from nasty campaigning — something both Claxton and Espling decried in 2018.
The two contenders the last time around got along well with each other, and expressed dismay at the way outside groups poured so much venom into the race.
Leonard, a former executive director of the Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said he will start collecting the 100 signatures he needs this week.
He said he hasn’t heard of anyone else seeking Republican backing in the race.

The storm that has dumped about 9 inches of snow on the Lewiston-Auburn area is expected to end Tuesday afternoon — making the evening commute a bit less slick than in the morning.
Law enforcement officials were reporting sliding vehicles and crashes across the state.
Officials from the Maine Emergency Management Agency are keeping a close eye on the the storm and are in contact with electric companies and the National Weather Service, according to acting director Peter Rogers.
“We are particularly concerned about the changeover to sleet and freezing rain as the storm progresses,” Rogers said in a statement. “We handle winter storms pretty well in Maine. But we are also aware that many people will be traveling due to New Year’s Eve plans, so extra caution and preparation is encouraged.”
Central Maine Power was reporting 2,600 outages in Brunswick and Harpswell at 9:30 a.m.
The speed limit on the Maine Turnpike was reduced to 45 mph, but no significant crashes were reported Tuesday morning.
Gov. Janet Mills closed all state offices Tuesday and urged people to stay home if possible.
“I urge Maine people to avoid driving if possible and, if they must be on the roads, to exercise caution and to give road crews and first responders ample room as they work to keep us safe,” Mills said in a statement.

The National Weather Service had called for a mix of snow and rain is expected in southern and coastal Maine. Inland and mountain areas were expecting snow. As much as a foot of snow is expected.
Most snowfall Tuesday will be inland and mountains.
New Year’s Eve looks fairly quiet with clearing skies, and Maine will kick off the new year with bright skies and seasonably mild temperatures, according to WGME forecasts.

Texto completo: HOCKEY
Former University of Maine player Steven Swavely scored two goals and set up another Tuesday to lead the Reading Royals (18-10-4-0) to a 5-3 win over the Maine Mariners (16-12-0-1) in an ECHL game in Reading, Pennsylvania.
Maine’s Taylor Cammarata opened the scoring with a power-play goal, but the Mariners trailed 2-1 after one period.
After Reading extended its lead in the second period, Ted Hart cut the deficit to 3-2. But the Royals added two more goals before newcomer Eddie Matsushima got his first goal for the Mariners with 15 minutes left.
BASEBALL
MAJOR LEAGUES: The Minnesota Twins signed starting pitchers Homer Bailey and Rich Hill to one-year contracts.
Bailey, 33, is a 13-year major league veteran who split last season between Kansas City and Oakland, going 13-9 with a 4.57 ERA in 31 starts. His contract will be worth $7 million with incentives if he reaches 180 innings, a major league source told Minnesota’s Star Tribune.
Hill, a left-hander, will be 40 on Opening Day. He has pitched for eight teams in 15 seasons, but had only 13 starts for the Dodgers last season because a portion of the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow detached. He had surgery in October and will be out until at least June.
Hill was 4-1 with a 2.45 ERA and 72 strikeouts in 48 2/3 innings last season. His contract is for $3 million, with incentives worth close to $10 million, a source confirmed.
HOCKEY
WORLD JUNIORS: Canada routed host Czech Republic 7-2 to complete the preliminary round at the world junior hockey championship and clinch top spot in its group.
Joe Veleno, Nolan Foote, Barrett Hayton, Connor McMichael, Liam Foudy, Dylan Cozens and Jared McIsaac scored as Canada topped Group B with nine points.
Canada faces Slovakia, which finished fourth in Group A, in the quarterfinals.
The United States placed second in Group B – a point behind Canada – and next plays Finland, the third-place team in Group A.
Earlier Tuesday, Russia secured a quarterfinal spot with a 6-1 victory over Germany to finish third in Group B with six points.
The Russians will play Switzerland in the quarterfinals, which are all scheduled for Thursday.
Sweden won Group A by beating Slovakia 6-2. Alexander Holtz scored twice for the Swedes, who play the Czechs in the quarters.
MISCELLANY
ANTI-HARASSMENT BILL: Harassing sports officials in Wisconsin would be a crime punishable by up to a $10,000 fine and nine months in jail under a bipartisan proposal introduced this week in the Legislature.
The bill, which is supported by various sports organizations, is designed to protect referees and other officials from violent fans and remove a barrier to younger people signing up to officiate games, particularly at the high school level. There have been an increasing number of incidents in Wisconsin and across the country, particularly at youth sporting events, where parents and fans have attacked referees.
In February, former Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy was accused of confronting and berating referees after a loss by his stepson’s high school basketball team in Pulaski, Wisconsin. Also in February, parents at a youth wrestling tournament in Kimberly broke into a fight that was captured on cellphone video.

FARMINGTON — Members of the Roderick-Crosby American Legion Post 28 and Auxiliary in Farmington have been collecting toys for children being treated at the Barbara Bush Children’s Hospital at the Maine Medical Center. Arriving just in time for Christmas was a pickup truck full of new, unwrapped toys for children of all ages.
The toys, accepted all year long, help to provide therapeutic play activities, entertainment, distraction, prizes, birthdays and holidays. Post Commander Matt Smith and First Vice Commander Steve Bunker traveled to Portland to make the delivery.
The post is already looking forward to another special winter event — the Special Olympics 2020 Winter games at Sugarloaf. For years the post has hosted a free lunch for the olympians.
Honorably discharged veterans are invited to contact the post at 207-778-9371 to join.

Forecasters’ terms for ‘foothills’ and ‘dinnertime’ raise questions (Sun Spots)

Texto completo: DEAR SUN SPOTS: When the forecasters mention the weather in the foothills, which towns does that include? Do they mean the foothills of the White Mountains?
Also, I guess we’re all used to it by now and I know times are changing, but when forecasters announce how the weather will change by “dinnertime” (are most of them “from away”? ), it makes me smile because us “country bumpkins” here in Maine know the noon meal as “dinnertime” and that’s when we have our main meal while the evening meal is considered to be “supper time.”
— Elvera, no town
ANSWER: According to the Western Maine Foothills webpage (http://foothills.mainememory.net/page/3515/display.html), the foothill region includes Buckfield, Byron, Dixfield, Mexico, Peru and Rumford. On the Maine Tourism website (mainetourism.com), I saw that Kingfield, Carrabassett Valley, Stratton, Coplin Plantation and Eustis are called the foothill communities of Bigelow and Sugarloaf mountains.
Upon further reading, I saw that the foothill region also includes any towns that are in the shadow of the scattered Longfellow Mountains, the state’s major range, considered to be an extension of New Hampshire’s White Mountains and part of the Appalachian Mountain Range. This would also include Wilton, Harrison, Norway, South Paris, Bethel, Oxford, Turner, Lewiston, Auburn and Farmington, Hallowell and Manchester.
Readers, please forgive me for leaving out any town (I’m sure I have) and please chime in if you have more to say about what is considered to be part of Maine’s foothill region.
As far as dinnertime vs. suppertime, it seems to be a generational thing, so along with forgiving me for leaving out any towns in the foothills, you’ll have to forgive these youngsters who are reporting the weather these days. Just assume they are referring to the evening repast unless they say differently.
As for myself, I don’t care what they call it, as long as I’m included. I wouldn’t want to miss a meal!
DEAR SUN SPOTS: Why do they play the audio in movies so loud, especially for children’s movies? The poor kids will be deaf by the time they’re in their teens. In fact, my grown son once went back and requested management lower the volume as most of the audience was complaining, and they did adjust it. I don’t know if they would do it whenever someone complains or if he was just lucky.
Thanks so much for all that you do. Your column is so interesting and helpful.
— Elvera, no town
ANSWER: Since Elvera’s letter had a couple topics, I chose to divide it into two entries. I have often wondered about the volume in movie theaters myself. I, too, have gotten up from my seat in a theater and requested that personnel adjust the sound. They have always done it and thanked me for speaking up.
Unlike old analog sound, digital sound doesn’t distort at loud volumes and can be increased to extreme levels without loss of sound quality. And although digital sound quality is great, the extreme volume levels can be harmful to your hearing. Movie producers, studios and directors specify that movie soundtracks be played at louder volumes, especially for trailers and ads. Some think that action movies should be loud to match the video and enhance the “wow” factor.
This column is for you, our readers. It is for your questions and comments. There are only two rules: You must write to the column and sign your name. We won’t use it if you ask us not to. Please include your phone number. Letters will not be returned or answered by mail, and telephone calls will not be accepted. Your letters will appear as quickly as space allows.

FARMINGTON — A recreational trail system created by a faculty member at the University of Maine at Farmington has been awarded a $3,500 grant from the Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund.
Proposed by James Hoisington, coordinator of UMF Alpine Operations, and Gina Oswald, UMF assistant professor of rehabilitation services, the grant will help improve the usability of a trail on land next to the university’s athletic fields.
Originally developed by Hoisington to support Nordic skiing and snowshoeing, the trail, about 10 kilometers long, has seen more non-winter use by members of the UMF community and area residents. The enhanced trail system will be more accessible, provide nature-based educational information and encourage appreciation of the area’s natural beauty.
Included in the project will be two kiosks and 25 nature trail educational signs. The kiosks will include information and maps of the trail system and will be designed to be accessible to individuals with visual impairments.

Texto completo: DEAR SUN SPOTS: I recently joined the board of Central Maine Adaptive Sports, which is based out of Lost Valley and provides adaptive sports opportunities to people with physical or intellectual disabilities.
We’re looking for individuals or businesses to sponsor athletes on the Special Olympics Winter Games Team. The winter games are held at Sunday River Ski Area in Newry at the end of January. It’s a weekend of ski and snowboard competitions and includes lodging and meals for the athletes. It costs $80 per athlete. If you, or the business you work for, is interested in sponsoring an athlete, please let me know!
— Christy, no town
ANSWER: This is a request that was posted on Lewiston Rocks’ Facebook page. For more information on how you can give to this organization, go to their website at maineadaptive.org, call their development office at 824-2440, or email info@maineadaptive.org.
There are also several volunteer opportunities, from filing to photographing events, posted on the organization’s website. Also, there are three upcoming winter activities: Veterans No Boundaries, which is a free winter camp held at Sunday River from Jan. 24-27 for veterans and their spouses/significant others.
NEVIFest, held at Sugarloaf on Feb. 9-12, provides on-snow lessons to beginners-advanced skiers/riders that have visual impairment and to teach caregivers how to become guides.
There will also be a three-day clinic for mono-skiers at Sunday River and a two-day clinic at Sugarloaf for improving skiing ability and comfort level from March 4-8.
DEAR SUN SPOTS: The person who has been doing my snow removal for years just hurt his back and won’t be able to do it for the rest of the winter. Do you have a list of people? I prefer someone with a snowblower and who can shovel my porch steps, not just someone who shoves the snow into a pile with a plow.
— Angela, South Paris
ANSWER: I just saw this recommendation on the Lewiston Rocks Facebook page this week: Keaton Fitzherbert at Imperial Home Improvements in Norway (520-8612). The recommendation said he was “reasonable and fast.”
Another Facebook recommendation is Chris Gould at Gould Enterprises in Lewiston (754-4345). And one more snow removal contractor who works in the Oxford area was recommended in the Oct. 11 Sun Spots. Our reader didn’t give us a name but the gentleman can be reached at 539-4004.
It does seem to be getting harder and harder to find individuals who are willing to take this on. The cost of trucks, plows, snowblowers, and the money needed to keep them maintained, as well as the crazy hours and unpredictability of the weather can make things really tough.
Many landscaping companies also provide this service, but I also think it’s good if you can find someone in your neighborhood willing to take care of your driveway and paths for you for a reasonable fee. Perhaps you can even trade a service. I think of this because for years, I had a neighbor who kept my driveway clear as long as I provided him and his wife with a weekly batch of homemade cookies and took care of their dog for them when they needed to go out of town. Now that was a deal!

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Twin boys who witnessed the fatal stabbing of their mother outside a local laundromat in 2018 are back in school and doing well academically, according to the victim’s uncle.
<img class="wp-image-7569125 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/IMG_0957-e1563398331818-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />
Robert Patterson of Connecticut said the 12-year-old sons of his niece, Kimberly Dobbie, who would have turned 50 this year, are still adjusting to life without their mother and continue to attend therapy sessions.
Dobbie was killed July 15, 2018, by Albert Flick, who was convicted of murder a year later in Androscoggin County Superior Court in Auburn and sentenced to life in prison. She encountered Flick while she and her boys lived temporarily at an Auburn shelter.
It was the second time Flick had been convicted of murder, the first time in 1979 for the stabbing death of his wife, Sandra Flick, in Westbrook.
Patterson said his sister’s sons took a late summer vacation to Martha’s Vineyard for a getaway in the sun and sand, but are back in school, living with their grandmother in Massachusetts.
She is seeking to adopt the boys, but has encountered some difficulties with Maine’s adoption process, Patterson said.
The boys, who are in middle school, both qualified for that school’s geographic spelling bee, he said. One of the boys won last year.
“They’re both smart as heck in school,” he said.
Patterson said he and his wife traveled to Mexico City recently with a church group and brought photographs of late family loved ones to which they paid homage during that city’s celebration of Day of the Dead.
They carried a photo of Dobbie, which they placed on an altar there, he said.
“It’s been a closure, but it hasn’t been,” he said, noting the pain lingers.
Patterson said his sister, Susan, who is in her 70s and lives alone with the boys, has been getting help from friends. Her son is in the process of moving back from Baltimore to help, Patterson added.

Texto completo: AUBURN — January marks the Auburn Community Concert Band’s semi-annual open-membership period. This is an opportunity for former high school and college band members to once again experience the enjoyment of performing for others.
All musicians who wish to participate in the band’s upcoming summer concert performances have until Wednesday, Jan. 22, to join the group and start participating in weekly rehearsals. The 52-member concert band would particular like to add members to its flute, clarinet, saxophone and French horn sections. Membership requires limited conflicts with the group’s weekly schedule of Wednesday evening rehearsals and concerts. Musicians must have their own instruments and music stands.
From January through early June, band members rehearse from 7 to 9 p.m. every Wednesday at the High Street Congregational Church. From mid-June through late August, the band presents weekly Wednesday evening concerts. The free 75-minute performances take place at Festival Plaza in downtown Auburn, weather permitting. In the case of inclement weather, concerts take place indoors at the Gendron Franco Center in Lewiston. A different selection of music is featured each week, appealing to audiences both young and old. The anticipated Wednesday concert dates for the 2020 summer season are June 17 to Aug. 19.
This summer will mark the organization’s 39th consecutive season. Director Milt Simon formed the group in 1981 to offer musicians, who had once been members of their high school and college bands, an opportunity to continue using and improving their performance skills. Members of the ACCB currently range in age from 15 to 90 and represent some 16 central Maine towns. Membership is open to anyone knowing how to play a wind or percussion instrument.
“New members are often nervous when attending their first few rehearsals because of the lapse of time from when they last performed,” said Simon. “For many, it’s been 20 or more years since they last touched their instrument.” Simon added that most people regain their musical skills relatively quickly. “It’s like riding a bicycle. Once you have learned, you never forget. You just may need to do some practicing.” He stated that the opportunity to perform in front of large audiences, numbering 300 to 400 people on a weekly basis, is typically quite appealing to both amateur and experienced musicians.
Over 420 people were in attendance at the band’s holiday performance at the Gendron Franco Center on Dec. 20. Following the concert, audience members donated over $1,300 to the Salvation Army’s Red Kettle campaign.
Interested musicians are asked to call Simon at 207-782-3917 prior to attending their first rehearsal. Additional information about the group is posted on the band’s website at www.auburncommunityband.com.

Texto completo: Editor’s Note: This is a correction to an article that ran on Page C12 on Thursday, Dec. 26, titled “The Harlow kicks off the new year with paintings by Keri Kimura, Jan Ter Weele.” The exhibition has been changed to a solo show of Keri Kimura’s artworks. The new exhibit is called “Keri Kimura Solo Show: Potluck of Both Worlds.”
HALLOWELL — The Harlow is excited to kick off 2020 with “Potluck of Both Worlds,” a solo exhibition of paintings by Keri Kimura of Southwest Harbor. The exhibit showcases a dynamic range of rich textures and vibrant colors and is on view Jan. 10 to Feb. 8. Meet the artist at an opening reception on from 5 to 7 p.m. Friday, Jan. 10. Exhibitions are always free and open to the public. Hours are from noon to 6 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays.
Kimura is a visual artist who studied painting at Smith College, the Glasgow School of Art and the New York Studio School. She moved to Maine in 2015 and set up a studio in her home where she paints full-time during the winter. Last spring she spent a month as a resident at The Golden Foundation for the Arts in upstate New York. This year Kimura’s work will also be shown at The Painting Center in New York City, Nahcotta Gallery in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Swallowfield in Southwest Harbor.
“When I moved to Maine, I became interested in the way nature has a kind of handwriting that combines pattern and chaos. The way the veins of leaves are mirrors of one another and the anarchy with which they are carried and laid down in a breeze. The way it is obvious when this handwriting has been disturbed, when humans have changed the balance. Around the same time I also began learning to sew. I have memories of my mother and grandmother making quilts when I was a small and I wanted to tap into that history of hand work. Painting for me has always been as much about process as anything else. These paintings came out of both these worlds. The landscape here, the serenity and strangeness and patterns and magic of the natural world. And also playing with textiles and layering color and weavings and the way things are intertwined. These are paintings about connectedness and exploration and mysteries and trees.”
In conjunction with this exhibition, The Harlow is hosting an introductory workshop on abstract art. Learn more and register at harlowgallery.org/intro-to-abstract-art-workshop/.
The Harlow, 100 Water St., is a membership based 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to connecting and celebrating art, artists and community in downtown historic Hallowell since 1963. For more information, visit harlowgallery.org or call 207-622-3813. For more information on the artist, visit www.kerikimura.com.

Texto completo: DAMARISCOTTA — Erica Qualey will teach a watercolor painting class at River Arts starting in January. Painting with watercolor can be so much fun when you have a basic understanding of how to work with the medium. It is spontaneous and predictable, all rolled into one.
Full of detailed instructions about creating a good painting, the class will help navigate all aspects of creating a successful piece, from laying out the initial drawing to figuring out when to say it is finished.
Meeting weekly, the class is designed to serve as an instructional painting group and will cater to the needs and interests of the group. Weekly instructions and demonstrations in drawing and painting, as well as friendly critiques, will help develop skill and confidence, with the goal of helping each participant further their own personal development.
The ongoing workshop will be organized into four weekly sessions, meeting from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Fridays, beginning Jan. 17. Tuition is $120 for River Arts’ members and $150 for nonmembers.
Originally from northern Maine, Qualey lives in mid-coast Maine. She is a landscape painter working primarily in watercolor and watercolor batik. Since earning a BFA from Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, Qualey has worked as a graphic designer as well as teaching in various venues, including a college in New Hampshire and the Farnsworth Museum in Rockland.
Call or visit River Arts to register for the class, 207-563-1507. River Arts is at 241 Rte. 1. Winter hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.

Texto completo: The Beech Hill Studio Painters, led by Liz Prescott, will be showing in the Freeport Community Library for the month of January. Painters Liz Prescott, Sandi Lemmerman, Arthur Schaefer, Nancy Gunzelmann, Tina Edwards, Susan Caldwell, Lisa Blanchard, Mary Mraz, Jennifer Pope, Judy Shank, Stacey Lodato, Betheda Edmonds, Bette York, Louise Price, Anne Kistler, Lucille Holt-Sottery, Kathleen Afiero and Shelly Elmer will all be showing pieces.
The Beech Hill Studio Painters is centered around the studio of Liz Prescott on Beech Hill Road in Freeport. She is a graduate of Maine College of Art (BFA ’00) and Vermont College (MFA ’03). She has been teaching acrylic and oil painting in a variety of genres for over a decade and many students have passed through her studio, some for a session or two, some for many years of painting instruction. A wonderful network of painters has sprung from this place, offering each other critical feedback, along with lots of laughs and comradery that continue beyond their time in class. Painting is very often a solitary undertaking, so the support and community offered through Beech Hill Studios and places like it are essential for the longevity of many a painter. They hope that library passersby enjoy this exhibit of recent work.
Art is on display throughout the adult reading room and is free and open to the public. For more information on Beech Hill Studio leader Liz Prescott, visit lizprescott.com. For questions or directions to the library, call (207) 865-3307 or visit freeportlibrary.com.

New year, new schedule for L-A’s Citylink bus system

LEWISTON — The bus system servicing Lewiston and Auburn will see considerable changes in 2020, including expanded service and a new stop at Auburn’s Senior Community Center.
The changes taking affect Thursday, Jan. 2, are the first significant ones to the Citylink bus service in the past few years, as funding levels that were previously cut in Auburn have been restored for this fiscal year.
The Citylink website has posted the updated schedule, which notes changes to six bus routes as well as a new Pettengill Park stop at Auburn’s new Senior Community Center.
The changes were agreed upon by the Lewiston-Auburn Transit Committee earlier this year, following two public meetings in September to get input from riders.
The public comment period for the proposed route changes ended in mid-September. The updated bus schedule will see route changes for the Main Street, New Auburn, Downtown Shuttle, Minot Avenue, Auburn Malls and Mall Shuttle routes.
City Councilor Belinda Gerry, an LATC member who has fiercely advocated for the Citylink system, said Tuesday that the changes are significant.
“It’s by far better,” Gerry said about the new schedule. “Anything that’s going to cut down on the time it takes to get people from point A to point B and back again is a win for our ridership.”
During budget negotiations for fiscal year 2017, the Auburn City Council voted to cut its share of funding for the Citylink system, which led to cuts in service in Auburn. It also ultimately led to more funding cuts, as decreased ridership cost the system federal dollars.
During previous discussions, Citylink Transit Coordinator Marsha Bennett reported some routes took an hour and a half.
While recommending that the city return to its previous funding levels earlier this year, City Manager Peter Crichton said Auburn had lost 25 percent of its ridership since 2016, when the funding was cut.
The resulting budgets approved in 2019 for fiscal 2020 are an increase of nearly 20%, with Auburn’s share going from roughly $217,500 to $336,300. Lewiston’s share went from $280,300 to $336,300.
During budget negotiations in 2019, Gerry faced resistance from Mayor Jason Levesque, who has pressured transportation officials to “think outside the box.” In 2018, he suggested it would be cheaper to give passes to residents to take an Uber.
“If we can restore the faith that we lost we can increase ridership, have more stability,” Gerry said Tuesday, adding that increased ridership will hopefully allow Citylink to see a return of its previous federal funding.
Due to the previous cuts, the bulk of the changes in 2020 will impact Auburn bus routes. In New Auburn, which saw its route times slashed three years ago, the route will increase from eight stop locations to 11.
The downtown shuttle route, designed to bring passengers between downtown Lewiston and Auburn, will also add another stop, at the Hampton Inn.
Gerry, who has also been a leading advocate for Auburn’s new senior center, said the new Pettengill Park stop will benefit seniors who are looking to take advantage of the new programming available at the center. Auburn’s inaugural ceremony took place there in December. On Tuesday, Gerry was among a crew of people making preparations for a New Year’s Eve meal.
“I’m very excited about the bus to the senior center,” she said. “Once you can get more seniors to the center, the more active it’s going to be.”
In December, the LATC also held a workshop to discuss an upcoming transit study scheduled for 2020.
The Citylink bus system is owned by the Lewiston-Auburn Transit Committee, but is operated and maintained by Western Maine Transportation Services.

Texto completo: DEAR SUN SPOTS: I know this is last minute, but I wanted to share with all you great Maine cooks out there that the Maine Bicentennial Community Cookbook is inviting everyone to submit your favorite family recipes, food stories, photos of family and friends cooking and eating together, and handwritten recipe cards. These items, as many as you would like to submit, will be gathered together into the book along with historic and contemporary Maine food photography and illustrations.
According to the website, “the book will create a beautiful testament to cooking in Maine, by and for our amazing food community, and will surely become a treasured gift of Maine’s Bicentennial celebration for everyone who loves to cook, or eat.”
— No name, no town
ANSWER: The deadline is Jan. 10 to submit. Before you do, be sure to read all the fine print and make sure you understand it. You can find the form here: https://www.maine200cookbook.com/ .
If you just want to buy a copy and support the making of this cookbook, there’s a Kickstarter crowdfunding page to preorder. Find more information here: https://tinyurl.com/vxpuqvv
DEAR SUN SPOTS: I had some delicious peanut butter fudge at Christmas and the experience reminded me of how much I like it! Do you have a recipe to share?
— Elaine, no town
ANSWER: This brings back a good memory of my mom making peanut butter fudge for us kids on snow-day afternoons. It was such a treat! Here is the Marjorie Standish recipe I use. It makes a lot and is a real winner.
Stir together 1 pound sugar, 1 pound brown sugar, and ½ teaspoon salt with ¾ cup milk in a large saucepan. Slowly bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and allow to boil for 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and quickly stir in 18 ounces chunky or smooth peanut butter (not the natural kind), 1 (7½ ounce) jar Fluff, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.
Pour into two well-buttered 8- by 8-inch glass pans (or line the pans with parchment paper). Allow the fudge to set until hard before cutting into squares.
DEAR SUN SPOTS: A baggie containing an upper partial denture plate was left in my white Kia Soul in error (probably mistaken for another similar car in a parking lot) and I’d like to reunite it with its owner. Could you put the word out? I can be contacted at 782-3824. Thank you.
— Paul, no town
ANSWER: Well! I’ll love to hear the rest of this story!
DEAR SUN SPOTS: I really love winterberries and have noticed how prolific and lush they are this year. I never see any birds or animals eating them. Are they poisonous? I didn’t think they were.
— Aggie, Norway
ANSWER: This species of holly that looks so beautiful against the dark green firs and white snow of winter are a food source for over 40 species of birds, while moose, deer, and rabbits like to munch on the stems and leaves. If you really keep an eye on any bushes you have near your home, you’ll eventually see some activity.
Those bright red berries that look so festive are toxic to humans, however, so keep them away from children.

Residents of Jay approved an application for a $60,000 Micro-Enterprise Assistance Grant to help two local businesses expand services. Maine Dojo & Fitness Center secured an additional 1,000 square feet at the space it leases so it could expand the gym area. Its $30,000 grant would be used to purchase fitness equipment and help hire another employee. Barker Enterprises/Wood Pellett Warehouse would use the other $30,000 to help purchase a new delivery truck with a forklift attached to the back.
The Livermore Falls Class of ’49 held its final class reunion at LeFleur’s Restaurant. The classmates held their first reunion in 1991. “We had a wonderful time keeping in touch,” Meredith Dalessandro said. “We have had a lot of fun.”
After an hour-long discussion, Chesterville voters joined other towns in western Maine opposing Central Maine Power’s Clean Energy Connect transmission line. Plans called for less than a mile of transmission line to pass through the town, crossing Route 156.
AUGUST
After nearly 50 years of milking cows, Richard Corey and his wife Michelle Mosher, owners of Dunlookin Farm in Wilton, decided to exit the dairy business. Unpalatable trends in milk prices and profits, coupled with health issues, led the couple to decide to sell their milk producers and downsize their operation.

After many years of planning and construction, Western Maine Play Museum in Wilton opened its doors on Friday, Aug. 9.
The fencing surrounding unusable tennis courts next to Spruce Mountain Elementary School was taken down Friday, Aug. 16. The courts were slated for upgrades using a $30,000 United States Tennis Association grant and $37,500 raised through the Hollandstrong Community Foundation. When completed, the three-court facility will be the site for RSU 73 home matches.
The second annual Maine Paper Makers Celebration was held at the Maine paper and Heritage Museum on Saturday, Aug. 24. Papermaking demonstrations, tours of the museum, a barbecue lunch and a large yard sale were part of the celebration.
SEPTEMBER

Livermore Falls selectmen voted 4-1 to set the tax rate at $22.60 per $1,000 of property value, an increase of $1 from last year. Prior to the vote, residents voted to use $150,000 from the town’s $1.9 million undesignated fund balance to offset the increase. In April, RSU 73 voters passed a $19.6 million school budget, an increase of more than $760,000. If the town’s share of the school budget did not increase as much as it did, the tax rate was slated to go down.
At 8:07 a.m. Sept. 16, Farmington firefighters were called to the LEAP, Inc. central office building on Farmington Falls Road for a smell of propane. Minutes later, an explosion leveled the building. Capt. Michael Bell was killed and seven other people — including six firefighters — were injured in the explosion. Thirty people were dislocated when their residences were destroyed or heavily damaged by the explosion.
Jay selectpersons voted 3-1 to no longer accept clear plastic or glass for recyclables at the transfer station. Selectperson Judy Diaz said there was no market for glass or clear plastic, which is any plastic except No. 2.
OCTOBER
The State Fire Marshal’s Office said the Sept. 16 explosion at LEAP, Inc., was the result of a propane leak. During the weekend before the explosion, nearly 400 gallons of propane leaked beneath its parking lot, some of it reaching the basement. Officials did not say what ignited the gas while four men were in the building’s basement.

Three sophomores, three juniors and one senior at Spruce Mountain High School were inducted into the National Honor Society Oct. 17. Ella Plourde, Sara Henderson, Drew Delaney, Katelynn Ladd, Hannah Coates, Courtney Hogan and Matthew Fenlason took the pledge to maintain high scholastic standing, hold an untarnished character, endeavor to be a leader and give freely in the service of others.
Spruce Mountain Middle School students are on a mission to remember the victims of the Holocaust, one pencil eraser at a time. Students are collecting 6 million erasers, one for each Jewish Holocaust victim, in the “Erase Hate, Write Tolerance” project.
Members of the Livermore community who need a helping hand now have access to ‘magic boxes’ that provide free food, reading materials and seeds thanks to the efforts of Ryan Bergman.
NOVEMBER
The Spruce Mountain High School football team squared off against Mountain Valley in the Class D South quarterfinal. The Phoenix came out on top with a 37-12 victory. The win secured the team’s placement in the semifinals where they met up with the top-seeded Winthrop/Monmouth/Hall-Dale team.

Members of local veterans organizations and auxiliaries were among those paying tribute to veterans past and present on Monday morning, Nov. 11. “We stand here today to pay tribute to the brave men and women, living and dead who have served their country in the armed forces,” Larry Bilodeau said in prayer at the Livermore Falls Memorial Bridge. “Accept our thanksgiving for their sacrifices and the sacrifices of their families to purchase us a free land.”
Spruce Mountain High School announced it would be looking at making a significant change to its football team next year to combat dwindling participation. “We need to do something, eight-man or a cooperative team,” Athletic Director Marc Keller said. “We need to sit down and talk with parents.” He anticipated the number of players returning next year to be in the mid- to high-teens, down from the 50s a few years ago.
Livermore Falls Town Manager Stephen Gould told selectmen that a special town meeting would be necessary to cover a $24,500 increase in workers’ compensation insurance. The premium increased from $23,500 to $48,000 because of an extremely expensive injury, he said.
DECEMBER
When SMHS Athletic Director Marc Keller was told the Lord family couldn’t organize the 8th annual Jake Lord Play It Safe Foundation basketball fundraiser, staff from the school and LEAP stepped in and made sure the event took place. The foundation was established in 2012 in memory of Jake Lord, a star athlete and Jay native who took his life at the age of 18 after enduring multiple sports-related concussions. Jake’s father, Larry Lord was critically injured in a propane gas explosion Sept. 16 at the LEAP central offices in Farmington where he served as maintenance supervisor.

Santa, a Grinch or two, a shelf full of elves, Cindy Lou Who and a whole bunch of Whovians set “A Storybook Scene” on Main Street in Farmington Saturday, Dec. 7 for the 43rd annual Chester Greenwood Day parade. The parade was the highlight of a celebration paying tribute to Chester Greenwood, a local man credited for inventing the earmuff.
When Brandon Coates of Livermore Falls decided to start working on an Eagle Scout project, he didn’t have to put much thought into where he wanted to focus his efforts. He knew the diesel fuel tank at Spruce Mountain Ski Slope needed to be replaced, and he knew the project would be a costly but necessary expense for the local ski area. By mid-December, Coates had a new 1,000-gallon tank installed on a concrete pad. He was raising funds to cover the remaining expenses and planned to build a structure over the tank in order to shield it from weather.
Curriculum Coordinator Chris Hollingsworth gave RSU 73 directors a comparison of that district’s and RSU 9’s latest state evaluation numbers. The Department of Education recently released the 2018-19 emPowerME, Maine Education Assessment and Scholastic Aptitude Test data. “Except for one area, the information pretty much mirrored that for RSU 9.” he said. Hollingsworth also said the number of RSU 73 students meeting or exceeding state expectations as compared to the 2017-18 school year increased 12% to 43%.

AUBURN – Hundreds of people braved the cold Tuesday evening for Auburn’s second annual New Year’s Eve celebration at Festival Plaza on Main Street.
Main Street was closed to make room for the party, and at 6 p.m. people began to arrive. By 8 p.m., the plaza was bustling with activity at several warming stations, or near the three food trucks parked next to the Skelton Taintor & Abbott building.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-13704670" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/sJ.CITnewyearsparty.010120-2-300x218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218" />
A beer garden was stationed at one end of Main Street, where local breweries, including Lost Valley, Gritty’s, Baxter, Craft Brew Underground, and Side by Each, set up shop and served customers.
Three local bands – The Jumpin’ Willies, The Farmhouse Project and Hello Newman – provided music.
Walter Crites of Auburn said that been to both of Auburn’s New Years Eve parties and both have been “great.”
“I came to the first one and it was great, and this one is just as good,” Crites said, who attended with his wife and sister-in-law. “We live right in Auburn, so having something so close is really nice.”
Dan Brown of Auburn said that he was happy to see the fireworks display starting at 10 p.m.
“My wife works late, so the fact that there’s fireworks at 10 p.m. instead of midnight is amazing,” Brown said. “That means we’re both able to make it out and see it.”
Linda Tanguay of Lewiston said the prospect of socializing outdoors with music, and food and drinks nearby was too tantalizing to pass up.
“I mean, my friends and I usually get dinner somewhere on New Year’s Eve, or go to a movie, but we heard about this, and it sounded like a lot of fun,” Tanguay said.
Dan Scott, a recently retired firefighter with nearly 50 years of experience, was watching the Jumpin’ Willies perform on stage with a friend, said the celebration was “a lot of fun.”
He said he lived in an apartment building a few hundred feet away from Festival Plaza, which made the party an enticing draw.
“It’s very convenient,” Scott said. “I have a bird’s-eye view of the party from where I live. If I need a bathroom break or want some food, I can just walk to my place and come right back after.”
Scott, who worked in Augusta for 22 years before retiring and volunteering with the Minot Fire Department, said that typically, he rings in the New Year with friends.
“Ever since I moved to (Main Street), this has been a fun way to pass New Year’s Eve,” Scott said.
The temperature hovered around 30 degrees, but nobody seemed to mind.
“We’re from Maine,” Crites said. “Can’t complain about a little cold.”

Texto completo: The old hockey adage of a two-goal lead being a dangerous one rang true for the Maine Nordiques on Tuesday, with a two-score cushion evaporating by the end of the first period of a 7-2 loss to the host Johnstown (Pennsylvania) Tomahawks.
Stefan Owens gave the Nordiques a 2-0 lead just 4:23 into the game after Manny Sanchez’s opening goal just over three minutes in. Jack Strauss and Kevin Pitts had assists on Sanchez’s score, while the newcomer Ignat Belov had the primary assist on Owens’ tally and Isaiah Fox had the secondary assist.
Things began to unravel for Maine when Christian Gorscak converted a Tomahawks penalty shot and Andrew Murphy scored a shorthanded goal (with goalie David Tomeo assisting) to tie the game with five minutes left in the opening period.
Brendan Blair scored for the first of his three points to give Johnstown the lead 2:15 into the second. Gorscak made it 4-2 less than a minute later, with Spencer DenBeste notching the first of two assists and Blair adding the secondary assist. Max Kouznetsov scored on the power play to make it 5-2 after two, with DenBeste and Gorscak assisting on the goal.
Tristan Poissant scored unassisted, and Murphy and Blair assisted on Sean Bauchens’ goal to round out the scoring.
Tomeo stopped 26 of 28 shots the Nordiques sent at him, while Marco Duronio made 34 saves for Maine.
The Tomahawks were 1-for-8 on the power play, the Nordiques 0-for-6.

Susan Collins Becomes Second GOP Senator to Question McConnell Over Impeachment Trial; With only a four-vote Senate majority, a small bloc of Republican senators could upend majority leader's efforts

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Maine Sen. Susan Collins has become the second Republican to question the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's approach to the impeachment trial of President Trump, underscoring how a few GOP defections could upset Mr. McConnell's control of the highly charged proceedings.
In an interview with Maine Public Radio, Ms. Collins said she was "open to witnesses" while the Republican leader from Kentucky wants a quick trial without witnesses.
Ms. Collins also criticized Mr. McConnell for saying that he was coordinating with the White House as it defends Mr. Trump against House-approved charges that he should be removed from office for abusing his power and obstructing Congress.
"I've heard the Senate majority leader saying that he's taking his cues from the White House," Ms. Collins said in the Monday interview. "There are senators on both sides of the aisle, who, to me, are not giving the appearance of and the reality of judging this in an impartial way."
The comments came days after Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) said she was disturbed by Mr. McConnell's promise of total coordination with the White House.
Republicans control the Senate with a narrow majority, holding 53 of 100 seats. That means that just four Republican senators breaking ranks could upend Mr. McConnell's strategy for the trial , assuming Democrats remain united behind Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). Mr. Schumer has called for hearing from four witnesses and for subpoenaing documents.
This is because Senate impeachment trials don't unfold according to any particular set of procedures. Instead, a simple majority of 51 votes would be needed to determine almost every step of the process, from witness testimony to the timing of a final vote.
The Democratic-controlled House last month voted to impeach Mr. Trump on charges that he abused power by pressuring Ukraine to initiate investigations that would help him politically, including one into former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democrat presidential nomination in 2020. The House also charged the president with obstructing Congress by blocking witnesses from testifying and subpoenaed documents. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
One sign that Democrats in the Senate may stick with Mr. Schumer is that Sen. Doug Jones (D., Ala.), who is up for re-election next year in a deep-red state, wrote an op-ed published Monday in the Washington Post that backed Mr. Schumer's call to hear from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and a top aide, Robert Blair, along with former national security adviser John Bolton and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey.
Mr. Schumer on Monday repeated his calls for the four witnesses to testify, citing a New York Times story that detailed some of their actions as Mr. Trump moved to withhold nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine without telling Congress.
"This new reporting shows that there were serious concerns raised by Trump administration officials about the propriety and legality of what the president was doing," Mr. Schumer said on Monday at a news conference in New York.
Messrs. Schumer and McConnell have remained deadlocked over the format of the trial. Mr. McConnell wants to open the trial first, and hold votes for witnesses after opening arguments—the same procedure as followed during the 1999 impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. McConnell's office and the White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in hearing from witnesses, suggesting the trial would be used to unmask the whistleblower whose complaint triggered the inquiry and undermine others who view his dealings with Ukraine as highly improper.
Mr. Schumer wants to lock in an agreement to bring in witnesses and subpoena documents, including communications between administration officials about the withholding of military assistance for Ukraine and requests for Ukraine to publicly commit to open investigations.

Sen. Susan Collins: 'It is inappropriate' for Mitch McConnell, Democrats to prejudge impeachment trial

Texto completo: Republican Sen. Susan Collins criticized Democrats in the Senate as well as GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for predetermining their votes on the pending impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
"It is inappropriate, in my judgment, for senators on either side of the aisle to prejudge the evidence before they have heard what is presented to us, because the each of us will take an oath, an oath that I take very seriously to render impartial justice," Collins said in an interview with Maine Public Radio on Monday.
The Maine lawmaker's comments came after fellow moderate Republican from Alaska, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, voiced her own reservations about McConnell's declaration that he was in lockstep with the White House to set the trial procedures. Murkowski said she was “disturbed," and that it "further confused the process. "
More: GOP senator 'disturbed' with McConnell 'total coordination' with the White House for impeachment trial
“Everything I do during this I'm coordinating with the White House counsel,” McConnell said earlier in December, before the House had cast its vote. “There will be no difference between the president's position and our position as to how to handle this, to the extent that we can. ”
"We know how it's going to end. There's no chance the president's going to be removed from office," he also said.
Collins, who faces a tough reelection for her fifth term, said her position during the impeachment trial would be as an impartial juror, and slammed senators from both sides of the aisle for indicating they would not do the same.
"I have heard Democrats like Elizabeth Warren saying that the president should be impeached, found guilty and removed from office. I've heard the Senate majority leader saying that he's taking his cues from the White House," Collins said. "There are senators on both sides of the aisle, who, to me, are not giving the appearance of, and the reality of judging this in an impartial way. "
More: Touting 'centrist' approach, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine announces she is running for a fifth term
Collins, like Murkowski, criticized House Democrats for impeaching Trump without going through court proceedings to enforce subpoenas that the White House was blocking. The House voted to impeach Trump on two articles of impeachment over his dealings with Ukraine: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
"I am open to witnesses," Collins said, breaking from what some Republicans in the Senate have indicated. "I think it's premature to decide who should be called until we see the evidence that is presented and get the answers to the questions that we senators can submit through the Chief Justice to both sides. "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold the articles of impeachment in the House also "seems like an odd way to operate," Collins said.
More: Trump's impeachment trial in Senate likely to be more partisan than Bill Clinton's was in 1999
Collins, one of the senators who was also present for former President Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings, said the "precedent established by the trial for President Clinton is one that our leaders should take a hard look at," specifically pointing to a bipartisan negotiation on trial terms.
"I can't imagine anything like that happening today, regrettably," Collins said.

Texto completo: In talking about year-end lists over the past week or two here in the newsroom at the BDN, it dawned on us that one of the most scorned parts of social media -- people taking pictures of their food -- becomes an invaluable resource when trying to figure out your favorite thing you ate. To wit, we polled various staffers about what they loved in 2019, and after a quick memory jog, here are their picks. Happy eating!
Chorizo tamales and horchata at Vazquez Mexican Takeout, Milbridge
[image id="2914291" size="half" pos="right" /]
Everything about Vazquez Mexican Takeout in Milbridge is great. Waiting in line at the cheerful, boisterous counter. Watching the mix of tourists and locals coming and going in the busy parking lot. And, most importantly, the food. My order is typically two of their delicious, savory tamales -- corn masa wrapped in corn husks and steamed -- stuffed with homemade chorizo and served with a healthy amount of green salsa. I get a decadent horchata (a sweet, cinnamon-y, rice milk-based drink) to go with it. And I usually steal bites of whatever my dining partner might have. The tostadas and flautas in particular are fantastic. The best Mexican food in Maine is in Washington County. Who knew?
-- Emily Burnham, city desk reporter
[image id="2914420" size="full" pos="center" /]
Bi Bim Bap, Red Curry, Augusta
This past year, I had some really wonderful, memorable meals around Maine. Here in Bangor, Novio's Lobster Bisque is always a delight, and at The Fiddlehead Restaurant, the duck breast sauerbraten with haluski on the winter menu is perfectly marinated and cooked. Also worth noting: Brunch at Provender Kitchen + Bar in Ellsworth, where the PKB Skillet, a combination of meaty short rib hash, sweet caramelized onions, spicy chorizo, creamy poached eggs and hollandaise, is divine. But my favorite meal was at a hole-in-the-wall place in Augusta called Red Curry. The menu features Thai, Korean and Japanese dishes. I was excited to find Bi Bim Bap served in a hot stone pot -- my very favorite Korean dish. I love mixing around the ingredients, finding bits of crispy rice and enjoying the creamy, spicy, meaty combination. I cannot wait to see what food delights 2020 brings.
-- Sarah Walker Caron, Bangor Metro and features editor

Fried fiddleheads, Grammy's Country Inn, Linneus
I recently moved back to Bangor after many years away. So in 2019, I made up for lost time by eating as much seafood chowder and as many whoopie pies as possible. But my favorite thing I ate was so very Maine -- and by that I mean the real Maine -- that I was simultaneously excited to find out it existed and disappointed in myself for never having had it before. I gorged on a heaping pile of deep-fried fiddleheads at Grammy's Country Inn in Linneus. The battered and fried little ferns were delicious, and their shape and flavor made it seem like inland Maine's answer to fried clams.
-- Josh Keefe, Maine Focus reporter
[image id="2914295" size="full" pos="center" /]
Mini wild Maine blueberry pie, Timber Kitchen & Bar, Bangor
The best food I've had in Maine is the blueberry pie at Timber Kitchen & Bar in Bangor. And yes, I've had great meals in Camden and Portland and even Linneus, but I keep coming back to the mini wild Maine blueberry pie that the lumberjack-chic restaurant serves. The tiny pie is made for one person, which means the sugared crust-to-filling ratio is perfect. It comes with lemon curd, which to me always sounded unnecessarily fancy, but in reality perfectly complements the filling. Timber also serves it with homemade vanilla ice cream, some kind of berry jam, and a thin wafer in the shape of a maple leaf. I mean, come on.
-- Eesha Pendharkar, city desk reporter
Vegan breakfast sandwiches at The Grind House and Wicked Brew Cafe, Bangor
[image id="2914297" size="half" pos="right" /]
I didn't realize Bangor was such a hotspot for vegan breakfast sandwiches until this year. The two best in town are the Just Impossible at The Grind House and the Vegan Breakfast Sandwich at Wicked Brew Cafe. The Just Impossible uses the best vegan egg replacement around (Just Egg), and the cafe churns out housemade breakfast sausage out of the Impossible burger. Wicked Brew's offering is a little more classic veg -- an everything bagel with hummus, spicy tofu, tomatoes and greens, making it the perfect blend of salty and spicy, then carby and fresh. Since they're so different, it's hard to pick one winner, but luckily you can have both.

Greens & Beans, Daily Soup, Belfast
This year, I've tried to make a practice of packing my lunch. But on the days that I don't, it's hard to resist Daily Soup in Belfast, a small eatery that consistently turns out delicious, creative soups and sandwiches. Although just about everything that I've tried there has been wonderful -- definitely don't miss the Hungarian stew or the Thai red curry beef and noodle soup, if you see them on the menu -- the one I come back to time and again is grilled bread with sauteed greens and white beans. It's simple, hearty, hot and wholesome, and while I've tried to replicate it at home, it's never quite as good as the version made in chef-owner Courtney Miller Sanders' friendly, bustling downtown kitchen.
-- Abigail Curtis, Waldo County reporter

Pan fried garlic chive rice cakes, Long Grain, Camden
In 2019, I learned that I am not willing to share an order of Long Grain's garlic chive rice cakes. Call it the "only child syndrome," I don't care. These little square morsels of garlicky goodness are gooey on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside and I want them all to myself. Served with sauteed bean sprouts and a dipping sauce you don't want to skip, these rice cakes are a delightfully poppable appetizer before diving into any one of Long Grain's amazing noodle dishes. But if you're anything like me, you should order a couple plates of rice cakes if anyone in your dining party mentions the words, "to share."

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE and CARIBOU, Maine -- During the month of November and the first week of December, customers at Dollar Tree stores in Caribou and Presque Isle were asked if they wished to purchase a toy for children of current military personnel and veterans.
Store customers donated a total of 12,000 items, which were collected weekly by the Presque Isle Elks Lodge 1954.
Members of the Elks transported, stored, sorted and assembled those 12,000 items for selection by current military personnel or their significant others, as well as military veterans and their spouses.
Soldiers from the United States Army National Guard 185th Engineering Support Battalion of Caribou and their significant others were able to select items for their children, grandchildren and other family members beginning Sunday, Dec. 8, 2019, at the Presque Isle Elks Lodge.
"The generosity of the Dollar Tree customers in Caribou and Presque Isle and their demonstration of support and appreciation for the sacrifices of current military personnel, and their families, as well as military veterans, was absolutely amazing," said Captain Dustin Cook, 185th Battalion commander.
"It means a lot to our families, especially at this time of year," Cook added.
"The Presque Isle Elks were truly honored to have been able to play a role in Operation Homefront," said Alan Harding, exalted ruler. "Twelve thousand items of toys represents a substantial volume. Through the efforts of several members of Elks Lodge 1954, as well as students from the Loring Job Corps military preparedness class under the direction of Carl Smith and Roger Felix, those toys were stored, sorted and displayed in order that selection could be made by the military personnel, their spouses, and military veterans.
"Ultimately, all of the donated toys were distributed to military personnel, veterans, Toys for Tots, and other local charities," said Harding. "It was truly a heartwarming endeavor for the Presque Isle Elks of Lodge 1954 to have been involved."

Texto completo: Ice anglers looking to find a safe place to fish on the traditional opening day of the season might want to consider a trip north, as the superintendent of the Allagash Wilderness Waterway reports that there is some fairly thick ice on the waterways lakes and ponds.
In much of the state, ice fishing is allowed as soon as safe ice forms. In the Allagash waterway, the season still begins Jan. 1, as used to be the custom statewide.
Matthew LaRoche, the waterway's superintendent, said rangers checked the ice on Sunday and found between 8 and 12 inches of good ice on Telos Lake, Round Pond, Chamberlain Lake, Allagash Lake and Churchill Lake.
That ice is not consistently thick, however, and caution is warranted.
"The south end of Chamberlain Lake skimmed over for the first time on Dec. 1," LaRoche said. "However, the middle of the lake did not freeze until the third week of December."
Rangers will continue to monitor ice conditions and will post on the waterway's conditions and alerts page on Maine.gov.
The waterway's rangers remind snowmobilers that they shouldn't assume ice is safe just because they see another snowmobile track leading across a lake or pond. Instead, check the ice as you progress.
They also encourage people to fish with a buddy, and leaving a travel plan with someone at home is also encouraged.
"We usually have a good crowd out ice fishing on the first weekend of the season," LaRoche said. "The native brook trout is usually excellent when the season first opens."
Closer to Bangor, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife fisheries biologist Wes Ashe spent some time checking central Maine anglers over the weekend, and advised abundant caution.
"The ice was sketchy, but it doesn't stop people [from fishing]," Ashe said.
Further south, a child fell through the ice of a Scarborough pond on Monday. The boy was rescued by a neighbor and taken to a hospital for treatment, according to CBS affiliate WGME.
The Maine Warden Service offered up the following ice safety tips:
-- Never guess the thickness of the ice. Check the ice in several different places using an auger or some other means to make a test hole and determine the thickness. Make several, beginning at the shore, and continuing as you go out.
-- Check the ice with a partner, so if something does happen, someone is there to help you. If you are doing it alone, wear a life jacket.
-- If ice at the shoreline is cracked or squishy, stay off! Watch out for thin, clear or honeycombed ice. Dark snow and dark ice are other signs of weak spots.
-- Avoid areas with currents, around bridges and pressure ridges. Wind and currents can break ice.
-- Parents should alert children of unsafe ice in their area, and make sure that they stay off the ice. If they insist on using their new skates, suggest an indoor skating rink.
And the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife offered up some potentially life-saving tips for those who fall through thin ice:
-- Don't panic
-- Don't try to climb out immediately -- you will probably break the ice again. Reach for solid ice.
-- Lay both arms on the unbroken ice and kick hard. This will help lift your body onto the ice. Once on the ice, roll, don't walk, to safety.
-- To help someone who has fallen through the ice, lie down flat and reach with a branch, plank or rope or form a human chain. Don't stand. After securing the victim, wiggle backward to the solid ice.

Pelletier twins reunite on basketball court to boost Greenville girls' title hopes

Texto completo: When Aleya Pelletier was filling out information on a form before taking her SATs, she had to list her extracurricular activities.
Even though she had been a skier for Greenville High School and didn't play basketball her first three years, she decided to check off the "Senior Basketball" box.
That meant she would finally team up with twin sister Halle -- the younger of the two by 1 hour, 27 minutes -- on the court this winter.
Aleya, who is still on the ski team, has helped lead the defending Class D South champion Lakers to a 5-1 start, including Saturday night's 39-35 victory over previously undefeated Deer Isle-Stonington during the Maine Basketball Hall of Fame Classic at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor.
The Pelletier twins are both 5-foot-11 and have been a force in the paint for the Lakers.
"It has been really fun," said Aleya, who had not played basketball since eighth grade.
Aleya Pelletier knew the Lakers were short on numbers, it was her senior year and she missed playing with her friends.
Only nine players are on the roster.
Having the opportunity to play with Halle also was a huge factor in the decision according to Aleya, who acknowledged that her sister was persistent in trying to lure her back onto the basketball court.
"She asked me multiple times [to play]," Aleya said.
"Every year she got closer to cracking. I knew I'd get her," said Halle, who a Bangor Daily News All-Maine honorable mention last season.
Halle said she loves having her sister on the team.
"She can play the five [center], and I can play the four [power forward]. I can pop out and hit outside shots, and she can have layups," Halle said.
However, juggling two sports means Aleya has a busy schedule. She goes to ski practice right after school and then goes to basketball practice at 5 p.m.
She said the physical demands have not been excessive.
Aleya is the first player of the bench, but she is capable of posting a double-double (10 or more points and rebounds). She said she is still trying to shake off the basketball rust, but has been satisfied with her performance so far.
Greenville coach Maren Mason has been elated with Aleya's contributions.
"She is a game-changer for us underneath the basket with her sister," Mason said. "She is a rebounder and a great finisher. She has a beautiful layup."
Mason said the time away didn't stop Aleya from contributing right away.
"I wished I had her the past three years," Mason said.
The Pelletiers are surrounded by a strong supporting cast as the Lakers look to win the program's first Class D girls basketball state title since 1985.
Last year's regional title was their first since 2010.
Southern Aroostook of Dyer Brook beat Greenville 55-30 in the 2019 state game to capture its second straight state title.
Mason and Halle Pelletier think this team, which is seasoned with five senior starters, is better than last season's group. All but one player returned and they added Aleya Pelletier.
"They're more determined this year," Mason said. "After getting to the state final last year, they knew they had another run in them this year if they really worked hard. They played a lot more summer ball and put more effort into it."
The improvement of senior point guard Morgan Noyes has been an important development. She scored 12 points and Halle Pelletier posted 13 in the victory over Deer Isle-Stonington.
"Morgan's 3-point shooting has come a long way as has her ball-handling," Mason said. "Nobody wanted to step up and play the point last year, but she has done that this year."
Guards Jessica Pomerleau and Tiegan Murray along with forward-guard Bianca Breton, who are all seniors, are experienced players and consistent contributors.
Pomerleau is a good outside shooter and sophomores Lila Kronholm, a 5-foot-10 forward, and guard Ashley Bussell, along with freshman guard Alex Bjork, supply the Lakers with depth.
Greenville has been stingy this season, allowing on 24 points per game. Its only loss came to defending Class C North champ Penobscot Valley High of Howland (38-32).
"We really key on our defense," Mason said. "That has really gotten us to where we are. So now we're really working hard on offense. We've never been a [good] shooting team so we're taking 150 to 200 shots every practice."
Greenville is averaging 43.7 points per game.
Halle Pelletier said the Lakers are trying to develop reliable 3-point shooters in practice to complement the inside game.
"We hit them in practice. We just have to translate that into the game," she said.
Mason said Halle Pelletier is closely guarded by opponents, so it is important for her team to develop consistent outside shooters.
"We've got to be able to knock down jump shots," Mason said.
Greenville hosts Class C North challenger Dexter at 6 p.m. Thursday.

100 essential Maine albums of the decade

Texto completo: It would be impossible to construct a truly objective list of the best albums made in Maine. There's no accounting for taste, and popularity has a loose relationship to quality. And besides -- do people even listen to albums anymore?
But as someone who's been covering Maine's music scene for the past decade -- writing and editing music reviews for alt-weekly newspapers the Portland Phoenix and DigPortland and monthly magazine Dispatch before joining the BDN -- I thought I'd at least try.
I looked at various factors. I examined album sales and streams, as measured by Bull Moose Top 15 lists and data from major streaming outlets. I asked a solid number of musicians, artists, producers and venue owners for their perspective. And I also considered the significance each record had in forming a movement, documenting a scene, attracting national attention, launching an artist's career or reshaping the cultural landscape. 
The following list should not be confused for a roster of personal favorites, but it does include some of my preferences. (There are also plenty of albums on this list I don't particularly care for, but I can't deny their significance.) The ranking system is designed for dramatic effect. 
For the most part, the musicians Mainers went to see play live 10 years ago are not the ones they're seeing now. Times change, but it shouldn't make the music -- or how we shared it -- any less important to remember and celebrate. And who knows -- maybe in another 10 years, the album format itself will be obsolete and we'll all be looking back at TikTok views. 
A quick note on criteria: Artists are Maine residents at the time the album was recorded -- we see you Kalie Shorr, but the Nashville resident's "Open Book" isn't eligible -- or the album was at least mostly recorded in the state. We considered all albums and EPs released between 2010 and 2019 (Michael O., who wrote several hit singles from Portland, didn't qualify here).
100. The Other Bones, In the Night With Me (2019)
[image id="2912358" size="full" pos="center" /]
digital album
Full disclosure: This record came out in December. The reason it's perfect for this list, though, is because the Other Bones, a sensational Portland electro-pop trio that broke up years ago, recently regrouped to finish its first and only full-length album. Fans may remember these songs from the early part of the decade, when this band, led by the incredible Loretta Allen and her soaring vocals, would fill up the newly rebuilt State Theatre. For diehards, the band also made a podcast about its dissolution titled The Breakup Album.
Recommended track: "In the Night"
99. The Class Machine, Swarm Theories (2013)
[image id="2912359" size="full" pos="center" /]
digital album
Belfast's Class Machine played heavy, swampy punk-bluesy stuff, but here's the twist: drummer Cody Tibbetts also played guitar -- like both instruments at the same time -- while bassist and singer Nathan Raleigh threw down his fuzzed-out bass extremely hard. Billed as a "two-man three-piece," what could have remained a novelty act evolved into the band's signature sound, a weird mix of Morphine, Kyuss and the White Stripes. The band recorded this full-length with Jonathan Wyman in Portland, and the rest is history.
Recommended track: "The Prince"
98. Mouth Washington, Fourth Floor (2017)
[image id="2912360" size="full" pos="center" /]
CD/CS/ digital
Mouth Washington's sprawling 55-minute record stands as its opus. Sounding like a weird mix of Mudhoney and Modest Mouse, the band seemed to have its hands in everything this decade, playing and organizing shows with the rock kids, the rap kids and the punks (which is what happens when your members work in record stores). Its live act hasn't lost a drop of intensity since the band began in 2011.
Recommended track: "Avia"
97. Cruel Hand, Lock & Key (2010)
[image id="2912363" size="full" pos="center" /]
Bridge Nine Records
Cruel Hand is a metallic hardcore band that formed two decades ago. Its members came up through Maine's grimy hardcore punk scene of the late '90s, when tough-as-bricks bands like Boston's Blood For Blood and New York City's Madball would play up here every other month, and put that knowledge to use. It has amassed a dedicated fanbase of hardcore fans worldwide, and a lot of them maintain that this is the band's best.
Recommended track: "Labyrinth"
96. When Particles Collide, Photoelectric (2014)
[image id="2912364" size="full" pos="center" /]
self-released
As the story goes, Sasha Alcott and Chris Viner met on the set of a Bangor production of the play Hedwig and the Angry Inch in 2010. They became so enamored of each other that they started this high-energy rock 'n' roll duo and then they got hitched. After an electric EP and a ton of touring, they released Photoelectric, their explosive 2014 peak, which sees the duo channeling their natural spark toward steady maturation.
Recommended track: "Constant Disaster"
95. Kesho Wazo: Youth Art Collective, Wazo Showcase Soundtrack, Vol. 1 (2017)
[image id="2912365" size="full" pos="center" /]
Self-released
The rise of Kesho Wazo, a youth art collective comprising Portland high school students building community and capacity for young students of color, was necessary stuff for a city like Portland when it happened during the summer of 2016. Over a prolific stretch, Kesho Wazo organized political protests, an annual summer festival (Wazofest) and fashion shows where members sold their own designs. They also made an album for it, led by the charismatic Wazo Daveed -- a Portlander via Kinshasa, Congo -- whose new album Starchild, released this year, is garnering national attention.
Recommended track: "Distant Ways"
94. Tom Kovacevic, Universe Thin as Skin (2014)
[image id="2912366" size="full" pos="center" /]
Immune
Tom Kovacevic plays an original style of folk ballads steeped in his long history of studying traditional Arabic music. On "Universe Thin as Skin," his otherworldly debut album, he plays the oud, the nay flute and a few different types of drum, but it's Tom K's reverent, rhythmic strumming patterns and idiosyncratic vocals -- indicative of an outsider's approach to traditional Arabic music -- that listeners will remember most. Kovacevic is a former member of Tarpigh and Cerberus Shoal, and a 20-year student of the craft. This record is a low-key Maine treasure.
Recommended track: "I'll Ask You"
93. Amy Allen, Honey (2010)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEMZsFtLyXM" width="600" height="367]
Crooked Cove
Today, the songwriter Amy Allen has multiple credits on the Billboard Top 100. Ten years ago, the 18-year-old Waynflete high school senior and South Portland resident released "Honey," a five-song EP that she made at Jonathan Wyman's recording studio The Halo, with Chuck Gagne (of The Lucid), Stu Mahan (of the Awesome) and Carter Logan (of Jerks of Grass) in tow. It's no longer available, but it launched a huge decade for the songwriter. After Allen's Warner Bros. debut this spring, we'll see if she's the next Taylor Swift.
Recommended track: "Tomorrow"
92. Kristina Kentigian, The Beginning Again (2012)
[image id="2912369" size="full" pos="center" /]
self-released
In possession of one of the loveliest voices in southern Maine, Kristina Kentigian heralded a very busy decade with this smooth and soulful R&B album. Her frequent collaborations throughout the city's hip-hop, funk and cover-night scenes have kept her in the spotlight, alongside a crew of dedicated musicians who made the leap from the Big Easy to the Portland House of Music in the middle of the decade.
Recommended track: "Mr. Wonderful"
91. Too Late the Hero, Survivor's Guilt (2017)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SoSAy1lNbxk" width="600" height="367"]
CD/digital
From Berwick, Too Late the Hero formed in 2003. By the time it released Statement of Purpose, it had largely honed their metallic hardcore toward the genre ideal of bands like Lamb of God, making it a welcome platter for young folks seeking the same throughout the expanses of the internet.
Recommended track: "Ghouls & Ghosts"
90. Correspondences, Split with Swaath (2012)
[image id="2912372" size="full" pos="center" /]
Self-released
Correspondences was a little-known, queer-identified cello-doom trio that took root in Portland in 2011. While the group only lasted a year, they were singularly spectacular, casting a warm and witchy glow through a Portland heavy scene long dominated by dudes. Members of Correspondences went on to do other good stuff -- Imogen Binnie became a popular novelist, Lee King started the poetry zine COME HELL and Emily Dix Thomas plays with Providence's The Huntress and Holder of Hands.
Recommended track: "Heavy Cream"
89. Herbcraft, Wot Oz (2015)
[image id="2912373" size="full" pos="center" /]
Woodsist / LP/digital
Herbcraft is the transcendental psych-blues project of Matt Lajoie, a Lewiston-raised artist who started the tape label L'Animaux Tryst last decade to put out like-minded artists of the drone, folk, and Deadhead variety. Wot Oz, the last full-length he'd put out before forming Ash & Herb, a joint effort between he and astral player Starbirthed.
Recommended track: "Push Through the Veil"
88. Hi Tiger, I Love Music (2011)
[image id="2912375" size="full" pos="center" /]
digital
It's been hard to live in Portland the last 10 years and not encounter Hi Tiger in some way. The shapeshifting art production vehicle of painter, singer and multidisciplinary artist Derek Jackson has lately been behind the Maine Academy for Electronic Music, a nonprofit that holds youth DJ clinics and dance parties for young people of color in Portland, Lewiston and Biddeford. But at its inception, Hi Tiger was a five-piece art-punk band -- and a good one as this album proves -- led by Jackson's flair for impressionistic storytelling. Hi Tiger may never be an actual band again, but this record marks an artist forging a way forward that we wish more musicians would take.
Recommended track: "pompous pilot"
87. Dean Ford, Get Messy (2015)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ubs-b0ZqJg" width="600" height="367"]
self-released
A former member of the pop-punk group The Goodnight Process, Ford went for it with "Get Messy," making the full transition into glammy electro dance. With help from music luminaries Renee Coolbrith, Spose and Saiyid Brent, Ford's album was drenched in hooks, and was even more impressive for being produced largely in GarageBand by the artist himself.
Recommended track: "Heartbeat"
86. The Milkman's Union, Telos EP (2011)
[image id="2912375" size="full" pos="center" /]
self-released
The Milkman's Union emerged in the middle part of last decade from the labors of two Bowdoin College students -- singer-songwriter Henry Jamison and drummer Peter McLaughlin. Its sparkling, jazz-inflected indie-folk had been pared down by "Telos," but it was only the beginning for these two. McLaughlin would launch the Maine-based label Pretty Purgatory and become the music programmer at Portland's SPACE, while Jamison is a darling of Rolling Stone magazine, touring internationally this year after a recent single topped 65 million Spotify streams.
Recommended track: "Alabaster Box"
85. Sparks the Rescue, Worst Thing I've Been Cursed With (2012)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psQNCRi5eNU" width="600" height="367"]
Fearless
Formed in 1999 while members were still in high school, this pop-punk turned rock quintet got a massive boost from Maine radio stations, which helped get its 2009 album attention from MTV and a spot on the Warped Tour. This album keeps its roots intact amid the mainstream polish, which got poured on a little more heavily later.
Recommended track: "High and Hazy"
84. Jason Spooner Band, Chemical (2014)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxR9IpkEg4Q" width="600" height="367"]
self-released
One of Maine's most dedicated independent musicians, Jason Spooner's soulful folk-pop songs put a homegrown spin on artists such as Martin Sexton, John Mayer and Ray Lamontagne. In venues along certain sun-drenched stretches along the coast, it's plenty common to hear "Chemical" booming from the speakers -- that is, if he's not playing a set there tonight himself.
Recommended track: "Shrouded"
83. Mike Clouds, Apollo's Stamina (2014)
[image id="2913477" size="full" pos="center" /]
Milled Pavement
Mike Clouds is a DJ and producer who's been producing and DJing in Portland for more than 20 years. His other records lean toward straight hip hop or trippy ambient, but this instrumental trap album is regarded as a keeper, with its burst of hi-hat flares and burbling basslines.
Recommended track: "Illkid"
82. id m theft able, Teeth Teething (2015)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9UpQvcQMwk" width="600" height="367"]
Editions Piednu/Mang Disc
We could choose virtually any of the umpteen works from Windham native Skot Spear. The avant-garde Amadeus is a true Maine original, and has found international adoration even while he enjoys obscurity at home. "Teeth Teething" is one of the most "accessible" -- it's released on CD through a French label, as well as Spear's own Mang Disc.

[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lubtN6zayo0" width="600" height="367"]
self-released
It may be cheating to include a live record here, but live is where The Renovators, a tireless Portland blues band, is best. This record captures Bob Rasero and company in their glory at Portland's intimate night club Blue, where the band tore through decades of its barroom blues jammers.

80. Myles Bullen, Not Dead Yet (2018)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dDBXkpA9CbI" width="600" height="367"]
self-released
The second album from rapper and spoken word artist Myles Bullen is louder and more cohesive than his 2017 debut, which makes a sturdier platform for him to rep his style -- conscious, vulnerable and all about healing. He's a young dude, but brave, and he's got a ton of folks on his side.

79. Mr. and Mrs. Garrett Soucy, Mr. and Mrs. Garrett Soucy (2013)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wYKQxOJsvWY" width="600" height="367"]
self-released
A lyric-forward album from Garrett and Siiri Soucy, residents of Belfast who once played in the austere Portland band Tree By Leaf. The duo's ministrations here are rendered more powerful by Garrett's terrific lyrics. The whole catalog is good, but this one gets high marks for making the seamless transition to a new chapter.

78. The Ghost of Paul Revere, Believe (2013)

self-released
They would soon attract national attention with breakthrough album "Monarch," but the Portland holler-folk group first released this proof of concept, elevating the group from a barroom novelty act (when they were called Griffin Sherry and the Ghost of Paul Revere) into something more cohesive and special.

77. Hessian, Bachelor of Black Arts (2014)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-2crOVTH2o" width="600" height="367"]
self-released
This fantasy metal band can pull off a straight face with tongues planted more firmly in their cheeks than anyone else on this list. In the early part of the decade, Hessian -- primarily its co-founders Angus MacFarland and Salli Wason -- were indefatigable. Playing a Manowar-style power-metal, Hessian would appear constantly at Geno's, Portland's eminent metal club, keeping one of Maine's last resorts of heavy music alive and influencing an entire generation of fans in the process.

76. Aleric Nez, Aleric Nez (2010)
[image id="2913481" size="full" pos="center" /]
Apohadion Records / LP/digital
While often overlooked, this is a raw and compelling folk record with nimble fingerpicking and dreamy, hallucinogenic lyrics. Some have compared it to John Frusciante's "Niandra Lades," which is not far off, but Aleric Nez (aka Vince Nez) has no studio trickery to offer here, just a resonator guitar and a microphone. Recorded by Dave Noyes and Pat Corrigan at Apohadion Records, heralding what would be a great decade at the Bayside venue.

Rising Records
While this was recorded in Nashville, the folk legend Jonathan Edwards resides in Portland, making this earnest spin the artist took remembering his youthful travels a welcome inclusion here. In lightly country-tinged style, Edwards bangs out new classics like "Sandy Girl," and reflects elsewhere on being reunited with his own adopted daughter, a story of special significance for a man who was adopted himself.

[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lWvUIxeT9Y" width="600" height="367"]
Tragic Hero
Roseview may be the latest Portland band to break through into the national spotlight. Formed in 2015, these five dudes' debut is all about intensity and personal catharsis, common virtues in the coming-of-age field of riffy melodic hardcore-metal in which they tarry. Roseview's version of it is indeed intense, and it has lifted them onto the festival circuit and a ton of Spotify streams.

[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9_PUeTODBs" width="600" height="367"]
self-released
The Baltic Sea was a post-rock band based in Portland that wrote long, atmospheric compositions with some prog influence. Think Slint or Explosions in the Sky, but with occasional doses of Yes. The seven songs on "Period Piece" were each separate journeys, and yet they're just as listenable today. Fact: one member, Todd Hutchisen, became one of the city's most sought-after recording engineers.

72. Johnny Cremains, Hollywoodland (2015)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XcCU99SHDss" width="600" height="367"]
self-released
Johnny Cremains is a dark lounge-rock band with a flair for dramatics, and it wouldn't work well without the musical chops of its players, most of them having transitioned out of more sensational metal acts. Some Mike Patton worship is evident here, though the group doesn't approach the level of techie weirdness of Mr. Bungle, and the howls of frontman Sean Libby, who seems teetering on the edge of madness, is the album's blue-beating heart.

self-released
This album sparked what would become a great decade for soul singer Kenya Hall. Anchored by her smooth, soaring vocals, Hall's backed here by a bevy of Portland musicians, some of those she would collaborate with for the next 10 years, as the Big Easy would evolve to the Portland House of Music, and as Hall would elevate her Stevie Wonder Tribute Night to become one of Maine music's annual holidays.

self-released
Spencer Albee's deep commitment to infectious pop shines through some nice arrangements on his 2013 eponymous album, which he settled into after building and disbanding two supergroups (Spencer and the School Street Mafia and Space Versus Speed) over the previous five years. In possession of one of the deepest CVs in all of Maine music, the former member of Rustic Overtones was also producing Clash of the Titans, Portland's weekly tribute night, around this time of this album's release.

[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMpRBXaDbjU" width="600" height="367"]
Teenarena Records
All decade long, Jeff Beam has made music that's as uncategorizable as it is listenable. "Is Believed to Have Been" can sound like Radiohead, Todd Rundgren, Spoon, Panda Bear or Phish, but Beam and his band -- which would not yet benefit from the addition of music therapist and future wife Kate Beever -- layer a carefully crafted psych-rock veneer over it all. The result is a depth that rewards multiple listens down the line, which is why this record still sounds fresh.

Teenarena Records
The brilliance of Brenda, a Portland indie power-pop trio, was that each of its members had an incredibly distinct personality, and none of them overshadowed the others. A darling of Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy, who selected them to play the band's curated Solid Sound Festival, the group disbanded shortly after this gem -- though members would go on to play in other bands higher up on this list.

[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iSUkezbVe4U" width="600" height="367"]
Immune
There's an aura of myth surrounding Maine folk artist Micah Blue Smaldone. Once a member of working-class street-punk band the Pinkerton Thugs, Smaldone reinvented himself as a sort of ragtime/Piedmont blues player around the turn of the century. After a time busking on the streets of Portland, Smaldone moved up the rural Maine coast and evolved a style all his own, evidenced by 2008's incredible and carefully orchestrated folk album "The Red River." This follow-up, which features arrangements with his brother, is of the same feather.

After years playing clubs as multi-dimensional J Biddy, the songwriter Jay Basiner went full-on country, joining up with Andrew Martelle and slinging terms such as outlaw. The act only lasted a couple years, but it kicked up enough dirt to get Basiner out of town and to Nashville proper, where his recent efforts landed him a slot opening up for Alan Jackson.

65. Endless Jags, Sell the Banquet (2014)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDb744vJQxE" width="600" height="367"]
self-released
Endless Jags was kind of like Portland's version of Broken Social Scene, but for people who were starting adult life at the time of the Great Recession. A group of friends who'd been playing together close to 10 years, the members wrote bitter, yearning, beautiful songs that seemed to revel in the knowledge that their brilliance would have no hope of rescuing them from obscurity. Driving, anthemic and brimming with guitars (the band's six members included three of them), it was the sound of dudes who had given up on chasing the American dream and just cared about each other instead.

64. Asa Irons, Knife Gift Debt (2013)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0jTNyacN5Vs" width="600" height="367"]
Turned Word/Laughable
This trim, austere eight-song LP from Asa Irons, a carpenter who played in the band Feathers and now lives near Belfast, is proof that Maine folk music can still be accessible without leaning into pop territory. Irons folds in elements of Irish music and workingman traditionals, and his sparse arrangements and a stoic commitment to storytelling ramps up intensity as the album unfolds.

63. Royal Hammer, My Bubble (2013)
[image id="2913482" size="full" pos="center" /]
self-released
When this debut record came out, it had been years since frontman Michael Taylor stepped out from his main gig in the Rustic Overtones to front Royal Hammer, the seven-piece roots-reggae act in the vein of Gregory Isaacs and Dennis Brown. That meant there were tons of partiers who had already rocked with them, both in the Old Port and on the edges of town, and needed a keepsake.

62. Marion Grace, Lying Down Looking Up (2010)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1eODAYTGgs" width="600" height="367"]
self-released
Portland's mighty roots-blues outfit took shape in 2006, when songwriter Ralph Graceffa played a few songs at an open mic one night at the Ale House -- the late, great Old Port dive bar -- which caught the attention of drummer Aaron Cloutier. A week later, Graceffa was introduced to fellow songwriter Clara Junken and bassist Aaron Frederick, and the rest was history. The group's sweet and soulful sound had undeniable mass appeal, and this album, recorded shortly before the split, captured it.

Clare Hubbard, aka Caethua, would later revamp herself as country artist Clay Camino, but her album of dreamy and haunting folk songs -- most of them made with piano and cello -- made while living in the woods of Waldo County should go down as her crowning achievement this decade.

Though he lives in Los Angeles, Elijah Ocean's latest album was recorded almost entirely in midcoast Maine, where the up-and-coming country artist was raised. A studious purveyor of the Bakersfield sound following in the Buck Owens mold, these 11 tracks are bright and spacious, and a healthy crop of Maine artists (including BDN Managing Editor Dan MacLeod on bass and mandolin) make up Ocean's backing band.

With her third full-length album, Sara Hallie Richardson truly got lifted.

Tyler Jackson's best record of the decade was also his most accessible. The prolific songwriter pumped out a lot of good albums under the Foam Castles name, but "Through That Door" is particularly majestic, its intricate, well-crafted indie rock contains a lot of sneaky earworms, touching on influences like the Beach Boys, Guided By Voices, Soft Boys and more. Jackson put the Foam Castles moniker to rest in 2017, and now fronts the band Golden Rules the Thumb, a more traditional vehicle for his songs.

By the time Darien Brahms released her sixth album, the Portland alt-rock songwriter had it figured out. She already spent a couple decades as one of the city's most respected artists, and had opened for major-label stars such as Chris Isaak and Ben Harper. All that was left was the lucrative record deal. Were it a different world (say, the '90s), "Dogwood" would slot between the David Bowie and Edie Brickell albums on your shelf.

The grain of Eric Bettencourt's voice is a special thing, matched by few living singers today. The former Portland songwriter spun a lot of heads when you put this out nearly 10 years ago. A mix of soulful dangling folk with breezy vocals recalling Shannon Hoon and Janis Joplin, "Secret Songs" had an urgency and tension beneath their breezy candor. Bettencourt moved to Austin, Texas, a few years later, but this one captured his Portland heyday.

Milled Pavement
The rapper Brzowski is an overeducated doomer whose verses are just as verbose as Aesop Rock. His 2011 album, "A Fitful Sleep," was also a contender, but the production on this album ages it better, as well as the fully fleshed "eff-it" vibe he had stepped into by this point. Real name Jason Cornell, Brzowski moved out of state after this release, but it still stands as one of the top hip-hop records of the decade.

Few metal bands could operate with the accessibility that Whitcomb did. That's because few metal bands have a weapon like Brant Daedalares at its disposal.

This duet from Anna Lombard and Rustic Overtones frontman Dave Gutter seemed like a money-making scheme concocted in a Burbank high rise, but it was an actual organic union. Rolling Stone magazine named its debut as one of "the best albums you didn't hear" of 2015, but this 2018 effort is stronger. The pair is blessed with two of the sweetest voices in the state, and a lot of Mainers' hearts were stopped hearing them together.

This album of slow-core folk songs (named after a roots-reggae album) wasn't the sort of music to send immediate shock waves through the scene.

On its second album, the dynamic Portland rock group Grand Hotel did everything it did on its self-titled debut a little brighter, smoother, hookier and more confident. Frontman Kyle Gervais, who launched this band after his Cosades project ended, would eventually have one of the most prolific decades of anybody on this list (not named id m theft able) with the carousel personnel of "KGFREEZE," but this album still feels like his pinnacle of the era.

After she performed for years in the Portland hip-hop scene under a different alias, Sarah Violette stepped into her name and threw down two enduring bangers a few years ago. This is the second one, a bit more vulnerable and bold than "Ultraviolette." She raps about the blurry lines between friendship and romance made blurrier by restrictive public norms around sexuality, and her flows about human desire are amped by the underrated local producer Ben Thompson and primo vocalist Renee Coolbrith.

This crass, crude, unapologetic punk band played brazenly effortlessly enjoyable songs that were barely more than a minute long. In stark contrast to an innumerable number of bands playing in a stylistically punk music, the Outfits understood the term correctly, scorching through a scene perpetually dominated by dudes who struggle with managing their misogyny. The Outfits were short-lived, but this album still rips, and paved the way for a much more egalitarian punk scene the rest of the decade.

Mousa is an alias of Vince Nez, but this dreamy record is a far cry from the self-titled fingerpicking joint he dropped earlier on the list. "Songs of the Universe" is a batch of hallucinatory, reverb-drenched songs and tasteful crooning about closely guarded meditations, the sort of album you can play 10 times in a row and not tire of.

Rustic dropped what sounded like a conventional Rustic album in 2012, and then it dropped this kooky follow-up.

Don't forget that Spose, a rapper from Wells who has spent an entire decade building his brand, is also a major champion of the Maine music scene. So in 2017, when he invited a slew of musicians to come to his studio and write, rehearse and record an album in 24 hours, it was more than a stunt. The results are what they are (and better than you think), but the gesture was a simple reminder why people make music at all -- to find your people, work alongside them and prop them up.

The past decade of Portland metal was dominated by Conifer and Ocean, two bands whose mastery of glacially paced bleakness made Maine metal synonymous with doom. Their splits left a huge void into which the pummeling metal quartet Sylvia came galloping in.

The band's frontman, Brendan Evans runs Strange Maine, the cult record/book/ephemera store in the heart of the arts district, making it a de facto home base for the group's bodyphilic, mutant no-wave proto punk (think early Gary Numan, Chrome, etc.) This LP collection of the Video Nasties various cassette-only releases serves as a reminder that progress isn't always for the best.

[image id="2913519" size="full" pos="center" /]
self-released
Portland musician Jimmy Dority is equally comfortable working highbrow or low. In the early part of the decade, he played by-request piano at the long-gone Crowbar on Munjoy Hill before the working-class watering hole was gutted, and he spent years writing and composing the 12 songs on this album, with arrangements for 21-piece pop orchestra featuring some of the city's most accomplished jazz players. Dority's goal all-along was a single show (he actually did two) and to make this record, and it stands as one of Portland's greatest collective musical accomplishments.

Nine Mile Records
The indie-rock band Spouse was a big part of the aughts. Led by frontman Jose Ayerve and his set of golden pipes, the band played a sweet sort of indie rock that served Ayerve's brooding depths and soaring swerves.

29. An Anderson, Very Machine (2016)
[image id="2913521" size="full" pos="center" /]
self-released
It's unclear whether math-rock fell out of fashion naturally, or it was a Clinton-era indulgence, before the internet zapped all the free time that well-educated musicians otherwise filled playing music together. Either way, it's certainly a modern indulgence that Mainers can witness An Anderson, the thrillingly complex four-piece instrumental unit that raised its own bar with this one-track, 35-minute album. The obvious touchstone here is Pittsburgh's late, great Don Caballero, who wrote dynamic rock forms around the stunningly octapodal abilities of its own drummer. An Anderson's is the incredible Elijah True, from Lewiston, whose performance here is worth the price of admission.

28. Ada, Ada (2018)
[image id="2913523" size="full" pos="center" /]
self-released
Ada started as a band called Butcher Boy that played a gnarly, punky bluegrass after a couple of its members split off from the post-rock band Pamola. Its music got progressively slower and dreamier over the years, incorporating jazz, ambient and post-rock. By the time it released this masterpiece, its songs felt like actual dreams themselves, blurring into one another in a dizzying, pleasurable blur. It recorded this final album with Efrim of the famed Canadian band Godspeed You! Black Emperor and then called it a day. For fans of Maine legends Cerberus Shoal, this album is the decade's equivalent of "Chaiming the Knoblessone."

Orindal
Lisa/Liza, the alias of Portland songwriter Liza Miller, debuted with the stunning "Ancient Edge," a hazy and melancholic folk record that echoed Liz Harris as well as former collaborator Tanner Olin Smith, (a brilliant Maine folk artist who passed away in 2017). Four years later, her "Deserts of Youth" album was a bit cleaner than her debut, but no less intimate and haunting, and Lisa/Liza caught some well-deserved national attention with this one, earning an 8.0 from a big review site and tons of local love from venues like the Apohadion, one of the only Portland venues built for deep listening.

26. Five of the Eyes, The Venus Transit (2017)

self-released
This explosive prog-rock record caught Portland by surprise. Started when the gifted singer Darrell Foster linked up with three-fifths of the members of a band called Chaos Sauce (and adding one of the member's brother), Five of the Eyes started writing together in 2014, fusing the dynamism of the Mars Volta with the deep charisma of Jeff Buckley -- all Foster. Prog rock is a niche genre, but there's not really much abrasive or off-putting about this record, and it could be the start of something even bigger.

Dontrusttheruin
Big Blood is a special band. Bandmates and partners Caleb Mulkerin and Colleen Kinsella formed it after the legendary Maine band Cerberus Shoal split up, playing a swampy, murky blues made wild by Kinsella's soaring falsetto. Nowadays, their adolescent daughter Quinnisa is a full-fledged member of the band, giving them dimensions this genre rarely allows, but "Dead Songs" was a huge statement, an "official"-seeming album after a slew of CD-Rs.

This one's on the edge of acceptability, because Channing Day reportedly wrote a good part of it after he moved to Los Angeles, where he now resides. But it was about his life in Portland and growing up in Maine, he said, and Day was such a major player in Maine this past decade it would feel wrong to exclude him. "Slush" is a beat record described as "surrealist" (check the cover), and Day himself calls it a coming-of-age record, the result of having submitted his music to L.A.'s Low End Theory Beat Invitational from his home in the cold Maine winter. He was accepted, and he's writing the rest of the story now.

Shockingly, Dominic and the Lucid started playing together all the way back in 2002. That meant they had already swept through many style shifts before "The Lucid," its 2011 album, which still stands as likely its mightiest of its catalog. It's less jammy than the band's earlier work, with Lavoie's songwriting and sonorous vocals tilting the album into Jeff Buckley territory at times.

self-released
After a decade playing in Penobscot County rock bands and a stint in Nashville, where he put out two solo records, the songwriter Chris Ross returned to Maine and found the North. His experience playing live was long and credentialed, so he patched together a rock band to help him flesh out his rough and tumble songs, which pulled no punches in their descriptions of Ross's love of hard living. This time though, he hit the mark -- "Young Once" is as honest a record as a Maine songwriter has put out this decade..

It's a smart bit of branding that kept Bar Harbor's Coke Weed lingering in your imagination when Mainers saw them on flyers, but anyone who metabolized this record knew its effects were hard to fade. The arresting indie-rock group was formed by singer Nina Donhia and guitarist Milan McAlevey, playing a plucky modern rendering of '60s psych rock led by Donghia's haunting vocals.

Try to find someone involved in the past 20 years of Maine hip hop who didn't have something kind to say about Brendon Whitney, the hip-hop producer born in Portland to a jazz pianist and a church organist. While most point to his 2008 album "Resurgam" as an apex, his skills were even more equipped on 2014's "Pitch Black Prism," the last album he released before his sudden passing in March 2018.

The stripped-down batch of country-folk songs from Texas transplant Wes Hartley and his trio contains some of the former Dead End Armory frontman's most affecting lyrics, from the dizzily verbose "Slow Shards" to the truly woeful "Acreless." It's a slowburn classic.

By the waning years of the past decade, everyone was already hyped to Samuel James the musician. But as this album progressed, they saw the artist elevate his work across a number of levels. A storyteller, prison justice advocate and internationally touring bluesman, James pieced it all together on his first album of the decade. This album marries his canny, winking wit to his deep knowledge of the history and context of the American blues, and the power that its proper treatment can have over a captive audience.

The Fogcutters mark the second of two live albums on this list, which is fitting, because that's where bandleader John MacLain and his big band were built to thrive. This live album of the 19-piece band's original big band jazz cuts would serve as a Kevin Bacon-like bedrock for Maine music (most longstanding bands are only two or three degrees away from a Fogcutter). Recording this album live at the State Theatre in 2011, it serves as a milestone for the revival of one of Maine's most popular venues, which was revitalized in 2010.

It's a dark sky that holds together the constellation of U.S. black metal, or USBM, but one of its most fiery stars is here in Maine. Forged in the Maine woods in 2005, the group fuses rural folk with dynamic, driving black metal that's as satisfying and cathartic as anyone else in the conversation. "Vigilance Perennial" is one of three that could make this list, though it's the most epic, the band letting their folk passages breathe for long stretches before diving into the darkest waters.

Jaw Gems put out two more recent albums of national acclaim, but this one dropped when they still belonged to Maine. The quartet combined jazz with hip hop's electronic production through the organic lens of a live set, which came to feel like the soundtrack to a certain shimmer of Portland nightlife for awhile. "Blades Plural" marked their glo-up from a humble house band playing Portland restaurant Local 188 every Tuesday night to the national act it is today, playing big venues and festival circuits and providing party soundtracks to the rest of the world.

After a barnstorming debut and fine follow-up, the Mallett Brothers Band fully arrived on "Lights Along the River." Brothers Luke and Will Mallett harvested their connections from the Maine music scene, where they had dabbled in rock, punk and hip hop, to make a profound and confident declaration. While the band would later weather some personnel changes, "Lights Along the River" found the Brothers at its steadiest and biggest-sounding to date.

Then he put out this excellent indie-soul record, which boasts more than 20 cellists, horn players, vocalists and other players. It was on the strength of this album that Divinsky would be recruited to front Denver's longstanding funk and Afrobeat band The Motet, where he remains today -- with the exception of a sellout show or three whenever he returns home.

Murcielago is an accessible, hard-rock band, dripping with Josh Homme influences and thick with pummeling, low-end density. These are all musicians and gearheads who have played integral roles in Maine music for decades, often with less heavy bands, so Murcielago's one album is infused with a sort of indulgence. They broke up soon after the release of this mighty full length, but the group still packs a house on its strength every year for an annual reunion.

Theodore Treehouse came out of nowhere and made an immediate mark. Fronted by charismatic Ian Ferrel, they played an irresistible and energetic indie rock with bluegrassy undertones and punked-up energy. A subsequent live album would capture some of the magic, but the Treehouse would split up soon after, releasing another little blast of an EP. But this first and only full-length remains an absolute delight.

Anything that Sonio Sturino touches turns to gold. The Portland singer and guitarist was tremendous in Box Tiger, the defunct power-pop band that split time between Portland and Toronto. And she's the star of Weakened Friends, a three-piece alt-rock group, whose new album Common Blah captured young punkers' hearts nationwide last fall (it even wowed Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis).

But it's Jones who truly shines here, and his delightful croon leads an album that would soon lead him to Los Angeles.

Portland's homegrown bluegrass and holler-folk group figured it all out here. "Monarch" is a steady mix of bluegrass, gospel, holler folk and Americana, primed for mass appeal yet keeping a dose of the rowdiness that has been there since its early storming. Even in today's fractured music industry, bandleader Griffin Sherry, bassist Sean McCarthy, banjo player Max Davis and, on this record, drummer Tony McNaboe are proof that a band can rise from Portland's bar scene to playing "Conan" in seven years.

This is one of the most interesting and mysterious bands in Maine music history. It formed in 2008 after frontman Jay Lobley's departure dissolved Cult Maze, the too-good indie-rock group that broke up in 2008. The circumspect Lobley then formed Metal Feathers with his brother Derek on keys, Diamond Sharp principal Jason Rogers on bass and Althea Pajak on drums. Its first album, available on streaming services, is spectacular, but this follow up captured the band in a critical flashpoint, having trimmed to a three-piece with Derek taking over on drums for Pajak, who would later join the all-femme punk band English Muffins. "Handful of Fog" was released on LP only, keeping it nicely tucked in a shroud, but it's worth the effort of tracking down.

The sudden death in March of David Noyes, founding member of the Rustic Overtones and collaborator on countless musical projects since the '90s, left an irreplaceable hole in the Maine music scene. The collective expression of love and grief could be felt throughout the city. The other members of Rustic, the state's most popular longstanding musical act, did the thing it was meant to do, making a record suffused with the energy of Noyes, an avid music historian collector with a deep reverence for international music. The group added horn player Jamie Colpoys, and reportedly built a full-length album using the notes that Noyes would leave for himself. The result is the most exciting and dexterous album of the band's career.

After spending a decade rocketing up to the indie-rap A-list, Milo, aka Rory Ferreira, moved back to Maine in 2017. A new father, he opened Soulfolks, a studio and record store next to a great Vietnamese restaurant on Main Street in Biddeford, right near where he'd grown up. It was from here that he brought us this incredible full-length, low-key tribute to Charlie Parker and the last, he said, he would release under the Milo name. It's a clear new chapter for Ferreira, and it shows. The flip observations and quixotic philosophizing that would define his early are still there, but Milo's rhymes have heightened intention now, a palpable understanding of the work that needs to be done. He proclaimed upon arrival that he was Maine's poet laureate, and while one of those already exists, who among us would disagree?

A lot of people think Spose's career took off with "I'm Awesome" -- but it's not true. That 2010 "comedy hip hop" bopper got the 24-year-old signed to a major label after execs saw it blowing up Maine radio stations (and it did well, reaching No. 37 on the Billboard Top 100). But Spose's decade would really begin with "The Audacity!," a 2012 album he wrote and released on his own after leaving Universal Republic Records less than a year after joining. From that point, the white rapper from Wells named Ryan Peters would truly launch his empire. Spose released 17 full-length albums this past decade, plus countless singles and even a children's book, and his tireless efforts to establish himself (and his friends) on his P-Dank label has likely made him Maine's most popular artist.

Texto completo: After a contentious year of debates over its merits and potential environmental impact, Central Maine Power's proposed $1 billion hydropower project looks set to gain another key regulatory approval, possibly as early as January.
On Monday, staff of the state's Land Use Planning Commission released a 34-page draft recommendation and a memo to commissioners and intervening parties that proposed approving CMP's use of land for its controversial New England Clean Energy Connect project, which would pipe hydroelectricity from Canada to Massachusetts through Maine.
The draft recommendation said CMP's project overall complies with the commission's land-use standards, although it requires CMP to remove and in some cases add vegetation, assure emergency vehicles can get into the planned hydropower corridor and get applicable construction permits.
It is the second regulator, behind the Maine Public Utilities Commission, to consider a permit for the project. The public utilities commission granted its permit in April.
"The next step is for the commissioners to deliberate for a possible vote on a decision at the Jan. 8 meeting," said Bill Hinkel, the commission's regional supervisor, who penned the Dec. 30 memo.
[iframe url="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6594614-slc9-Memo-Draft-Decision-Document.html" responsive=true height="550" width="400"]
The draft recommendation met with disapproval from some who oppose the CMP project.
"We are extremely disappointed in the LUPC staff's recommendation as it devalues the importance of preserving Maine's natural, scenic, and recreational resources of the Kennebec River and National Scenic Appalachian Trail in particular, which are the focus of this permit review," said Sandi Howard, director of the grassroots Say NO to NECEC group and co-leader of an initiative to bring the proposed CMP corridor to a statewide vote on the November 2020 ballot.
Howard said the draft recommendation reflects politics in Augusta. Gov. Janet Mills supports the project, although her hometown of Farmington in March voted to rescind an earlier letter of support for it.
"This is exactly why the people of Maine need to force a statewide vote to block the corridor," she said. "It's our best shot at protecting the future of our state."
"The NECEC remains on schedule to complete permitting and start construction in 2020 and to begin commercial operation in December 2022," said Thorn Dickinson, vice president of business development at Avangrid, the parent company of CMP. "While we are looking forward to the hearing in January, we will refrain from making any comment until a final decision is made."
The Land Use Planning Commission itself quibbled over the project and to what degree it might disturb remote lands and fishing sites in Maine.
In September, the commission failed to agree on granting a site law certification for the project to CMP. The commission's chairman, Everett Worcester, said at the time that the commissioners were close to agreeing on exceptions for the lines at the Kennebec River and Appalachian Trail, but remained deadlocked on Beattie Pond, a fishery that is protected.
Shortly after the meeting CMP asked the commission to amend its application to re-route the line from Beattie Pond to Merrill Strip Township, where it would be allowed with a permit. The move will add $1 million to the project.
The Land Use Planning Commission oversees the Unorganized Territory, the area of Maine where there are no incorporated municipal governments.
The commission is a nine-member board composed of county and gubernatorial appointees. It needs five votes to pass or deny any request.
In turn, its decision would certify to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection whether the CMP project is an allowed use within the areas where it is proposed. The DEP will consider the commission's recommendations within its own decision.
The commission is the second regulator, behind the Maine Public Utilities Commission, to consider a permit. The public utilities commission granted its permit in April.
Another key approval, for energy contracts, came from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in June.
The other required approvals for the CMP project are a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wetlands permit, an ISO New England section 1.3.9 approval and a U.S. Department of Energy presidential permit.
Municipal approvals also are required for construction of project components such as substations and transmission structures. The type and number of permits will vary, depending on location.

Texto completo: The Piscataquis Writers Alliance (PWA), formerly the Monson Writers Alliance, has some exciting changes to announce. The Alliance started in Monson with the support of the Monson Arts Center and Libra Foundation in December 2018. Meeting space was graciously made available in the Monson Public Library for the summer. Since then, the PWA has changed its meeting location and time to better accommodate its members. The Piscataquis Writers Alliance currently meets weekly at the Guilford Bed and Breakfast at 24 Elm St. in Guilford from 1-3 p.m. on Tuesdays.
A core group of committed members meet to analyze and provide helpful edits and reviews on pieces written by group members. We discuss characteristics such as grammar, punctuation, word choice, overall flow and elements of style. This is a working group of writers who share their experience and talents with each other for mutual support, stimulate creative writing skills, and streamline the craft of writing.
The diverse genres that our members are producing include the following:
Erik Stumpfel, a retired attorney from Bangor, has produced a delightful book of poems and supporting photographs inspired by central Maine's natural beauty. He is actively looking for a publisher.
Wendy Denney, proprietor of the Guilford Bed and Breakfast, is working on a Southern Gothic novel and yes, the unexpected keeps happening.
Will Macomber, a local native Mainer and engineer is honing his memoirs that involve growing up in the Dover-Foxcroft area, his extensive career including historic accounts of the lumber camps, mills and factories in central Maine.
Our newest member, Lou Sidell, owns and operates Perseverance Blueberry Farm and is polishing an interesting sequence of letters weaved together pertaining to his relocation to Maine.
Kevin P. Tremblay, local real estate broker and writer, is refining his fictional novel about dirty deals in real estate.
Are you a novice, experienced or published writer or poet in need of a boost? Can you see the considerable benefit of having accessible beta readers at your fingertips? PWA can help by locating errors and offering productive suggestions and recommendations to enhance and tighten your final piece. PWA members are serious about our writing, but we also like to laugh. Ultimately, we respect, appreciate, and thoroughly enjoy learning from each other with the purpose of improving our own personal writing skills.
If this sounds like a group you are interested in becoming a part of, contact Tremblay at me_real_estate@yahoo.com or call 207-270-1744. We may be a small group, but we are huge in what we can offer. And don't worry, what's read in PWA, stays in PWA! Finally, did we mention the complimentary coffee at the meetings?

$110M fish farm would mean changes for Jonesport, but locals hope not too many

Texto completo: Big changes could be in store for a quiet, lobster-fishing community in Washington County if a European firm ends up building a $110 million land-based fish farm on a largely undeveloped property overlooking Chandler Bay.
But Jonesport and its companion town of Beals, connected by a 1,000-foot arched concrete bridge over Moosabec Reach, already have been experiencing major changes in recent decades that have been more subtle, more gradual and less welcome. The towns have grappled with lackluster development, declining populations and school enrollments, and the effects of the opioid addiction crisis that has hit Washington County especially hard and led the FBI to Jonesport and Beals this past spring to raid three suspected drug houses in the community, as well as others in the county.
Nobody expects a major employer moving into town to solve all the challenges the towns face, even if the yellowtail aquaculture company Kingfish Zeeland does what CEO Ohad Maiman says it plans to do -- hire 70 people up front, establish a job-training program with the local high school and Maine colleges, and possibly expand production later. But local officials and residents say the development could help boost and diversify the area's economic prospects without sacrificing the rural, hard-working character of what has been a fishing town for more than 200 years.
[iframe url="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/730513762&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true" width="600" height="450"]
"Fishing has always been our go-to [occupation] and, as far as I'm concerned, always will be," said William "Billy" Milliken, a Jonesport selectman and local real estate agent. "But, as a Jonesport official, I've seen the need for change. Economic diversity is overdue in Jonesport."
Milliken said he has not been a vocal proponent of the specific proposal from Kingfish Zeeland because he is the listing agent for the 94-acre property where the company plans to build and he personally has a stake in the project's approval and the sale's completion. But regardless of location, he said, a $110 million private investment in Jonesport, which now has a townwide property valuation of only $200 million, would have a "big" impact.
Lobstering towns
Jonesport, which has roughly 1,400 residents, and the island town of Beals, with a population about half as big, have been fishing communities for their entire existence. Native Wabanaki fished for food along what is now the Maine coast long before Europeans and their descendents -- many of them with the last names Alley and Beal -- first appeared locally in the 1700s and later established a commercial sardine industry. After sardines declined, with the last of the canneries shutting down in the 1970s, local residents set their sights on lobster, now the biggest fishery in Maine.
[image id="2914307" size="full" pos="center" /]
Lobstering is by far the biggest enterprise in Jonesport and Beals, with much of the county's annual lobster haul coming ashore at the commercial docks that line each side of the ocean thoroughfare that separates the two towns. In 2018 more than 22 million pounds of lobster worth nearly $77 million were caught in Washington County, according to the state Department of Marine Resources.
That's a substantial amount of money for a county that long has been among the poorest in New England. With a population of roughly 31,000 people, Washington County had a median household income of more than $40,000 in 2017 -- just higher than Piscataquis and Aroostook counties, according to federal statistics. And its unemployment rate last year of 4.9 percent was one of the highest in this part of the country.
Even so, like most of Maine's lobstermen, many in Jonesport and Beals have seen their incomes improve as the fishery's fortunes have soared since the late 1990s, and they continue to haul in near-record amounts. Countywide annual catches that were around 4 million pounds in the late 1990s have grown to between 21 million and 23 million pounds each year more recently. During that same time, the yearly price Maine lobstermen have averaged for their catch has risen from just shy of $3 to roughly $4 per pound.
[image id="2914308" size="full" pos="center" /]
Despite the boom, and the long-held pride the two towns take in their signature industry, concerns about the future of lobstering have been on the minds of local residents and along the entire Maine coast as the inevitability of a climate-driven downturn -- already evident for lobstermen in southern New England -- has become widely accepted. The possibility that federal regulators may significantly tighten restrictions on the industry to protect critically endangered right whales also has some fishermen considering alternate work.
"This lobster prosperity won't last forever," Milliken said. "The fishermen have kept our towns alive."
'Increasing resilience in coastal communities'
[image id="2914313" size="full" pos="center" /]
Brian Beal, who grew up in Jonesport and now is a marine biology professor at the University of Maine at Machias, is optimistic Kingfish Zeeland's plans will blend in well with the community.
"Historically, it's already happened," Beal said, referring to the presence of major industrial employers in town. "There used to be three large sardine plants in Jonesport. [Together] they employed close to 100 people."
Growing imported fish in tanks also makes sense for the area, Beal said.
"Jobs that involve the marine environment, one way or another, is a great idea, as long as it is environmentally acceptable," he said, adding that the fish farm is not expected to have an adverse environmental impact on shore or the adjoining ocean. "It is increasing resilience in coastal communities."
When he graduated from Jonesport-Beals High School in 1975, Beal said there were 35 students in the senior class and roughly 130 in the school. According to local schools Superintendent Lewis Collins, 81 students are now enrolled at the high school.
"The younger population is leaving," Beal said. "The end result is fewer and fewer people. This [proposal from Kingfish Zeeland] might be a way to change the flow."
Albert Carver, owner of Beals seafood distribution firm A.C. Inc., was one of a small group of local men seated at a table at Moosabec Variety on Main Street on a recent Thursday afternoon who talked about the Kingfish Zeeland proposal.
[image id="2914309" size="full" pos="center" /]
Carver and others at the table said when they were younger, families often encouraged their grown children to move away for opportunities elsewhere, whether to attend college, join the military or look for work. If Kingfish Zeeland sets up shop in Jonesport and starts by hiring 70 people, that could mean dozens of local families would be spared having to repeat those same conversations, Carver said.
"It's going to be an explosion of opportunity," he said, though it could mean he has to offer more money to his 40 employees to keep them from changing jobs.
"If they're after my employees, I'm going to have to be competitive with my pay," Carver said. Still, he added, "it will breathe new life into the community."
Lagging development
Milliken said Jonesport and Beals draw more summer residents and visitors than they used to in the 1980s, when he started in the real estate business. Jonesport has a decent amount of housing, he said -- a legacy from the mid-20th century when its population was 3,500 people -- and amenities such as good local internet access and online vacation rental services have made it easier for visitors to find Jonesport and stay for weeks or even months at a time if they can work remotely.
But, he added, the growth in the town's tourism sector has been hampered by two big limitations: the lack of public water and sewer systems in Jonesport's central village. Neither of those is needed for the Kingfish Zeeland project, which would be a few miles east of the central village on Route 187, at Dun Garvan Road. But when it comes to operating hotels and restaurants on the small parcels of land on Main Street, Milliken said, it can be a challenge to find the space required for the wells and septic systems those types of businesses need.
As things stand, there are no hotels in Jonesport, and the only places that sell any kind of prepared food year-round -- Stewart's Grocery, Moosabec Variety and Jonesport Pizza -- sell most of their items to go. For many years there were restaurants in town such as Tall Barney's, which gained fame for its so-called "Liar's Table" before shutting down earlier this decade, but the number of retail businesses in town have thinned out over time, Milliken said.
[image id="2914311" size="full" pos="center" /]
"We've been trying to encourage that type of growth for a while," he said. Local residents are not interested in trying to become another Bar Harbor, he said, but having a few more retail businesses that appeal to local residents and visitors alike only makes sense.
The state's ongoing, multi-year bridge reconstruction project over Moosabec Reach has brought in a few dozen jobs with Freeport-based CPM Constructors that have helped to boost the customer base for local retail businesses, he noted, and the prospect of Kingfish Zeeland bringing in 100 or so more workers for an 18-month construction project could be a good opportunity to get a local restaurant off the ground.
The boost in property tax revenue from the fish farm one day could lead to the town making an investment in public water and sewer, Milliken added.
"It might start the conversation," the selectman said.
A 'priceless' quality of life
Despite the challenges facing the community, Milliken and Beal said they would not trade away the rural, independent, working-waterfront lifestyle of Jonesport and Beals simply for the promise of more money.
The beautiful coastal scenery, the lack of congestion and the comfort of living in a small town are appealing to a lot of people, Beal said.
[image id="{{wordpress_image_id}}" size="full" pos="center" /]
"This is a great place to live," he said. "It's great to be able to work in the place where you grew up."
[image id="2914312" size="full" pos="center" /]
Milliken represents the ninth generation of his family to live in the community, and he is proud that his two sons are local lobstermen. Between his sons and a daughter, who lives in Bangor, he said, he has three grandchildren whom he hopes will want to stick around and help extend his family's local lineage past 11 generations.
"We don't use our [vehicle] horns in anger. We use them to say hello," he said. "We want to keep it that way. The quality of life you get here is priceless."

Texto completo: Many of the stories that Bangor Daily News readers cared about the most this past year had one thing in common: loss.
We lost three heroic first responders in the line of duty. There was an exodus of health care providers. A popular wedding venue closed. So did longtime, beloved restaurants.
This year, we also saw justice for 10-year-old Marissa Kennedy, as her mother and stepfather were both found guilty of her murder. And we discovered a deeper understanding of Maine's archaeological past.
Here's a look back at the most-read BDN stories of 2019.
[image id="2914319" size="full" pos="center" /]
1 . Detective Ben Campbell is struck and killed by a tire on I-95 in Hampden
Maine State Police Detective Ben Campbell was assisting a stranded driver on the side of I-95 during an April 3 snowstorm when two tires detached from the trailer of a passing logging truck and one fatally struck the 31-year-old. He left behind a wife and 6-month-old son.
It was the first line-of-duty death of a state trooper since Oct. 17, 1997.
"If there's anything I can say as I try to wrap my head around this, it would be for all of you to slow down and take life in," Campbell's widow Hilary said through tears at his funeral, which drew a crowd of 3,000 in Portland. "Life gets crazy. Small things become larger than they should and get more attention than they deserve. If you're mad at a loved one, that's OK. But let it go. Don't let negative emotions fill your heart."
State police in June suspended the license of a mechanic alleging that his inadequate inspection of the logging truck contributed to the freak accident. Investigators also found that a week after the inspection, the faulty wheels had new tires mounted on them at Bangor Tire Co. 2 in Hermon, apparently without anyone noticing the wheels' poor condition. The truck's driver also failed to keep adequate maintenance records.

2 . Doctors quit EMMC as changes leave less time with patients, push morale to 'all-time low'
Eight doctors resigned from Bangor's Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in May amid a push by the hospital to reduce their ranks, cut their benefits and have fewer doctors work each day, forcing those on duty to see more patients in a shift.
This, according to one of the hospitalists who resigned, forced doctors to devote less attention to individual patients with complex health problems and affected the overall care residents of eastern Maine could expect from the state's second-largest hospital.
Northern Light Health, EMMC's parent organization, is poised to continue to grow in the new year due to a proposed merger with Mayo Regional Hospital in Dover-Foxcroft. Evidence from around the country suggests that new revenue could come from charging people who use the Dover-Foxcroft facility more for the health care they receive there.
[image id="2914321" size="full" pos="center" /]
3. Jurors don't buy 'victim claim' as they convict Carrillo mom for murdering daughter
In the year following 10-year-old Marissa Kennedy's tragic death, the two people who killed her -- mother Sharon Carrillo and stepfather Julio Carrillo -- were both found guilty of her murder.
Julio Carrillo pleaded guilty to the crime in August and was sentenced to 55 years in prison. Sharon Carrillo was found guilty during her December trial in which disturbing details of the Carrillos' abusive treatment of Kennedy came to light.
Kennedy was one of more than 20 children between the ages of 20 days and 10 years old who died since January 2017 after the state's child protective services system received concerns about abuse or neglect involving their families, according to data from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. A government watchdog agency reported earlier this year that the state's Office of Child and Family Services caseworkers were overburdened and burned out.
Since Kennedy's death, a state lawmaker proposed a bill to establish an ad hoc commission of lawmakers to reform child welfare services in Maine, and Gov. Janet Mills included $2.8 million in her two-year budget to hire more staff for the Office of Child and Protective Services.
[image id="2914322" size="full" pos="center" /]
4 . Archaeologists race to uncover colonial fort buried beneath a Maine road before it's too late
Historians had long suspected a colonial-era frontier fort's remains lay beneath River Road in Windham, but digging for evidence had been impossible since it was paved in the 1920s. In August, a long-planned road construction project gave archaeologists a chance to have a look.
The fort, a site of several clashes between Native Americans and white settlers, provided a unique look at Maine's history. The archaeologists were searching for signs of other buildings within the fort, such as a blacksmith's shop, and unearthed a 10-by-60-foot bed of stones that they suspect served as a boardwalk.
[image id="2914323" size="full" pos="center" /]
5. Couples scramble as popular Maine wedding venue says it will close by year's end
Just three months after new owners purchased Point Lookout Conference Center in Northport, they decided that running it as a business was not financially viable and said in June that it would close by the end of the year.
The announcement left couples who had already booked the venue for 2020 reeling.
"The last couple of days have really been a scramble," Mark Verrill of Marlborough, Massachusetts, said. "[My fiancee] was really, really upset. It was the only place we looked at. We're basically trying to replan our wedding now we're starting the entire process over again."
Three months later, the owners seemingly changed their minds, and said they would look for a partner to help them keep the venue open. However, two months after that they announced that those efforts had failed.

6. Farmington fire captain dead and 7 others hurt in massive building explosion
Farmington Fire Department Capt. Michael Bell, 68, died and his brother Terry, the town's fire chief, was among seven others injured in a September explosion on Route 2 that leveled the home of a nonprofit, destroyed nearby homes and scattered debris for more than a mile.
Bell's death was the second on-the-job death of a Maine firefighter in 2019, following Capt. Joel Barnes' death in March.
Three months later the community still feels a void as Larry Lord, the maintenance supervisor at LEAP Inc. hailed as a hero for evacuating the building after smelling gas, remains in serious condition at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
In the wake of the explosion, lawmakers will consider a bill that would require natural gas and propane leak detectors in certain buildings.

7. Bangor High told students of a peer's suicide over the intercom, going against expert advice
Bangor High School Principal Paul Butler came onto the school's intercom the morning of Nov. 20 with a somber announcement: a high school senior had died by suicide. But the announcement of a student's suicide to 1,200 students over the school's loudspeaker and other elements of Bangor High School's response went against the advice of mental health professionals with expertise in helping students digest the news of a peer's suicide.
In the weeks that followed, the Bangor School Department's actions prompted criticism from some parents at a school board meeting, while administrators defended their response. A debate also played out on the BDN's opinion pages.
[image id="2914326" size="full" pos="center" /]
8. St. Mary's hospital employees created a 'wall of shame' of patients with disabilities
Employees at St. Mary's Regional Medical Center in Lewiston created a "wall of shame" where they displayed confidential medical records of patients with disabilities detailing issues with their genitalia and bodily functions, according to an investigation by the Maine Human Rights Commission that found the exhibit had contributed to a hostile work environment.
The commission voted unanimously in January to support the investigator's findings.
Readers were shocked to find that the very people they had trusted with their health care were mocking patients behind their backs and breaching patient confidentiality.
[image id="2914327" size="full" pos="center" /]
9. Step by step, 2 women detail Maine university's failings in their rape cases
In January, two students at the University of Maine at Farmington came forward with troubling accounts of sexual assault -- and how the university failed to act in response. In one case, the school allowed an alleged attacker to remain on campus even after a committee found him responsible for sexually assaulting her and issued a two-year suspension.
When the school's response to both alleged victims was described to three national Title IX experts, they said there were clearly problems with due process and possibly violations of federal law.
After the BDN's initial story was published, five more female students came forward to report that one of the alleged attackers in the original story -- who had been cleared of rape by the university -- had assaulted or harrassed them, too.
The male student has since been suspended from UMF and is under investigation for sexual misconduct against four women. He filed a lawsuit against the university in September, alleging that he was, in fact, a sexual assault victim and that the school did not protect him. In response, the University of Maine System argued the student had no grounds to sue.

10. Restaurant closings hint at a gentrifying Portland, but there's more to it than that
In a span of four weeks this summer, four popular Portland pubs and eateries closed: Brian Boru Public House in the Old Port, Lolita on Munjoy Hill, Scattoloni Bakery in Monument Square and Silly's in East Bayside.
What made these closures surprising is that none suffered from a lack of business.
Instead, experts pointed to a worker housing shortage, coupled with a service industry that has been reluctant to raise wages despite the rising cost of living in Portland and beyond.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- Northern Light AR Gould Hospital has once again been recognized for its excellence in creating a tobacco-free environment for patients, employees, and the community. The County's largest and most comprehensive provider of healthcare services earned a Gold Star Award during a Nov. 14 event at the Maine Hospital Association.
The 10th annual Tobacco-Free Hospital Gold Star Standards of Excellence Awards Celebration was hosted by the MaineHealth Center for Tobacco Independence's Breathe Easy Initiative. The event, attended by hospital and public health stakeholders from across the state, recognized efforts by Maine Hospitals to address tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure.
AR Gould Hospital was one of 33 highlighted for their achievements in advancing their organization's smoke and tobacco-free policies as well as promoting tobacco-free lifestyles.
"We are pleased to be recognized for our efforts," said Dawn Roberts, community health specialist at the hospital. "Hospitals should be health and wellness role models in our community, so it's important for us to set an example around reducing tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke."
Since a representative of the hospital was not able to attend the Augusta event, the award was recently presented to Roberts by Aroostook County District Tobacco Prevention Partners Jo-Ellen Kelley and Kara Barns.
Northern Light AR Gould Hospital has consistently earned Gold Star status in the program. The hospital has been tobacco-free for 18 years.

Texto completo: CARIBOU, Maine -- Northern Maine Development Commission recently announced it has been awarded $500,000 in financial assistance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.
Altogether, the CDFI fund awarded $188.7 million in financial assistance awards to 284 institutions. In Maine, funds went to only three organizations, with nearly a quarter of the total award to NMDC. The awards will enable organizations to increase lending and investment activity in low-income and economically distressed communities across the nation.
"The CDFI program creates opportunities by providing access to affordable financial products and services for small businesses," said NMDC Executive Director Robert Clark. "We are grateful to receive this award which will give us greater ability to provide financial assistance to small businesses, an element in NMDC's mission to expand and support economic development."
The awards, based on a competitive application process, have enabled community development financial institutions such as NMDC to increase lending and investment activity in low-income and economically distressed communities of Aroostook, Washington and northern Penobscot and Piscataquis counties.
NMDC became CDFI certified in April of 2018.
NMDC is a nonprofit organization focused on business, community economic development and regional planning programs throughout Aroostook and Washington counties.

Suspect shot by police held without bail
The man shot and injured by police during an early morning altercation at an industrial park Wednesday was ordered held without bail, pending a dangerousness hearing, authorities said. Austin Boga, 25, of Peabody, was grazed in the arm by a bullet fired by police. Two officers were approaching a “suspicious vehicle" around 1:10 a.m. at the Shetland Industrial Park when Boga allegedly tried to run them over with a car. One officer opened fire, grazing the driver's arm, Sergeant Michael Dunn said. The car sped away, but crashed in front of a Wendy's restaurant at Lafayette and Peabody streets. Boga abandoned the car and jumped into the water near the Salem Harbor Walk, Dunn said. He was taken to the hospital for medical treatment. The officers were also injured jumping away from the vehicle and taken to a hospital for treatment. Their names were not released, and their condition was not known. Boga was arraigned at Salem District Court on a variety of charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon pending a dangerousness hearing Monday. Boga's attorney objected, saying details of the case were vague.

University system freezes in-state tuition
The University System of New Hampshire has announced that tuition for in-state students will be frozen in place for the 2020-2021 academic year. The freeze will go into effect for students at the University of New Hampshire, Plymouth State University, Keene State College, and Granite State College. The New Hampshire House recently increased the state's appropriation to the university system by $12 million over two years to freeze tuition. (AP)

Dartmouth to spend $1.4m on microscope
Dartmouth College will have to replace a microscope valued at more than $1.4 million after water from a storm damaged it. A college official said Wednesday that the electron microscope was damaged during a Sept. 24 storm and that Dartmouth was working with its insurer. It is hoping the microscope, which was housed at the Electron Microscope Facility, can be replaced soon. There was construction at the time of the storm. The microscope allows for high-resolution imaging of the surface of a wide variety of samples such as metals, catalysts powders, bacteria, and even ice. The college says students can use a second microscope to complete some of their work and that Harvard University and the University of New Hampshire have offered the use of their facilities. (AP)
Sherman, Maine
National monument signs finally go up
After three long years, motorists are getting some help finding Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument with the installation of highway signs. The first of 22 signs was put in the ground Wednesday in Sherman, Maine, after a long delay that was partly caused by politics. Former Republican governor Paul LePage's administration refused to allow signs for more than a year. A government shutdown contributed to the delay in lining up the contracts to install the signs.

Inmate Voting Rights Discussion Reaches Ward 8

Texto completo: The D.C. Council Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety's most recent hearing about restoring voting rights for incarcerated District residents took place in the heart of Congress Heights, a Southeast neighborhood reeling from the generational effects of mass incarceration.
Nearly two dozen people testified at the RISE Demonstration Center as an audience of returning citizens, elected officials and community leaders listened intently. In their public support of the Restore the Vote Amendment Act, some public witnesses, like Eric Weaver, gave thought to the power of a well-informed, local and national inmate voting bloc.
"You could take your family to the polls from the inside," Weaver, chair of the National Association for the Advancement of Returning Citizens, told Councilmembers Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7), Robert White (D-At large) and Trayon White (D-Ward 8) on Monday night.
"They will keep up with the elections and want information about candidates," Weaver continued. "This will change the mindset of people, where they will feel like they're part [of society]. We're talking about thousands of people who can make change and have a lasting impact on any of the elections."
Weaver counted among a bevy of voices from the Ward 8 community stressing the importance of securing federal inmate voting rights. Others sharing the witness table with him included State Board of Education Vice President Markus Batcehelor and Zachary Hoffman. Later, the Council Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety also heard from Ambrose Lane of the Health Alliance Network, Robin McKinney and Kymone Freeman of We Act Radio, among others.
The public hearing came weeks after the Committee convened an initial hearing which addressed the Restore the Vote Amendment Act. Though that gathering attracted more than 40 public witnesses, Councilmember Robert White, who introduced the bill in June with the full support of his council colleagues, expressed a desire to hear from those unable to make the trek to the Wilson Building during daytime work hours.
If the Restore the Vote Amendment Act passes, the District will join Maine, Vermont and Puerto Rico as states and territories that grant incarcerated people with felonies the right to vote in elections. The legislation counts among a handful introduced within the last year to ease the voting process for D.C. residents.
It also follows previous efforts to keep returning citizens and their incarcerated counterparts connected to the outside world. Those strides have manifested in privileges that the District's marginalized and maligned have come to enjoy.
Last November, 127 D.C. Jail inmates awaiting trial for misdemeanors cast their votes during the midterm elections thanks to a law that allowed them that opportunity. Earlier this year, Councilmember Allen introduced polarizing legislation that secures early release for inmates who have served at least 15 years of a sentence for violent crimes committed as minors.
In speaking about the Restore the Vote Amendment Act, Councilmember Trayon White mentioned a slew of returning citizens in the room who've served their communities in various capacities upon their release from federal custody. He said that incarcerated District residents, along with several others across the U.S. should receive a chance to make a similar impact while serving time.
"This is part of a growing effort to restore voting rights to people across the country. We say the United States is the land of the free, yet we incarcerate more people than any other place in the world," he said.
"[In this room] are a few of the individuals who not only had a misstep in life, but came back and made tremendous accomplishments in our community. I not only support this bill but the movement to restore voting rights across the country."

Texto completo: When week nine of the high school football season presents a meaningful contest for any team, that's good news.
In Bangor High School's case, week nine marks a regular-season finale full of Class A playoff implications.
For survivors in the state's other classes, the playoffs have arrived.
Oxford Hills Vikings (4-4) at Bangor Rams (4-4), 7 p.m. Friday, Cameron Stadium: Bangor and Oxford Hills are tied for fifth place in Class A, both just 3.125 Crabtree points behind No. 4 Sanford.
Sanford (4-4) is an underdog against 7-1 Bonny Eagle of Standish, and if that expectation holds up, the Bangor-Oxford Hills winner would be in line to finish fourth and earn home-field advantage for next week's Class A quarterfinals.
That would be a considerable feat for Bangor, which won only one game in the previous three years combined. But coach Dave Morris' youthful Rams won three straight before last week's loss at Bonny Eagle to move into the middle of the Class A standings.
Oxford Hills looks to rebound from back-to-back losses to No. 1 Thornton Academy of Saco and No. 3 Scarborough.
Class B Quarterfinals
No. 8 Brewer (2-6) at No. 1 Brunswick (8-0), 7 p.m. Friday: These schools of Orange and Black probably have met more than any other football rivals during the last five years. This is their ninth clash since the start of the 2015 season.
Brunswick has won six of the last eight, including the 2015 and 2016 regional finals and a 56-18 decision two weeks ago.
No. 5 Skowhegan (4-4) at No. 4 Windham (4-4), 7 p.m. Friday: Skowhegan won its last three games, including last Friday's 51-34 victory over Mt. Blue of Farmington, to rise to fifth in the standings.
Windham bounced back from consecutive losses to Cony of Augusta, Class A Thornton Academy and Lawrence of Fairfield -- teams with a combined 23-1 record -- to defeat Falmouth-Greely 21-7 last week and earn home-field advantage for this contest.
Class C
No. 8 Medomak Valley (3-5) at No. 1 Winslow (7-1), 1 p.m. Saturday: The Black Raiders have been dominant since a season-opening loss at Wells, averaging 59.6 points per game.

Class D
No. 6 Stearns (3-5) vs. No. 3 Mattanawcook Academy, 7 p.m. Friday, at Lincoln: Mattanawcook beat the Minutemen 33-6 on Oct 4 as part of a five-game winning streak that was halted last Friday in a 21-8 loss to Dexter.
Mattanawcook is the LTC's top rushing team with 2,282 yards, while Stearns of Millinocket is the league's No. 2 passing team with 861 yards.
No. 5 Foxcroft Academy (3-5) at No. 4 Houlton (4-4), 7 p.m. Friday: This is a rematch of an Oct. 4 at the same location won 32-21 by Foxcroft. Since then, the two-time defending Class D North champion Ponies of Dover-Foxcroft have lost consecutive games to the LTC's top three seeds, No. 2 Dexter, No. 3 Mattanawcook Academy and No. 1 Bucksport.
Houlton has won two of its last three outings and the Shiretowners secured their first home playoff game since resuming varsity play in 2014 with a 34-0 victory at Stearns last Friday.
Eight-player
No. 4 Ellsworth (3-5) vs. No. 1 Maranacook (8-0), 6:30 p.m. Friday at Readfield: Ellsworth and Maranacook had a competitive regular-season matchup on Oct. 4 with the Black Bears scoring a 22-12 victory.
Ellsworth has won three of its past five games and clinched a playoff spot last week with a 44-30 victory at Gray-New Gloucester behind senior Connor Crawford, who rushed for 274 yards and four touchdowns and added 96 passing yards.

UMPI vs. SUNY Canton
In set one, with a score of 9-19 UMPI went on a 5-1 run behind kills by Ashlon Stroub (junior, Bakersfield, California), Miranda Washinawatok (junior, Shawano, Wisconsin), and Maddi Thweatt (junior, Middleton, Idaho). Laura Aroz (senior, Tucson, Arizona) also added an ace before Canton eventually took the set 16-25.
Set two saw the Owls on another 5-1 run starting with a kill from Thweatt, followed by another ace serve by Aroz. Later came a kill from Washinawatok and an ace serve from Thweatt this time. The owls could not keep the run going and lost the set 16-25.
In set three, Taylor Miller (junior, Weeki Wachee, Florida) led the way in kills for the owls racking up three on the set while Washinawatok and Thweatt each added another two.
Miller finished the set with five kills on nine attempts and no errors. Aroz led the Owls with five assists while Thweatt led with 10 digs on the match.
UMPI vs. SUNY Delhi
In set one against Delhi, with the score at 7-13, the Owls found a groove and went on a 4-0 run capitalizing on Delhi errors and an ace serve from Washinawatok. Later in the match they found another 3-0 run with a kill from Thweatt and another service ace from Hailey Kell y (freshman, Wells) before the match was lost.
The offense in set two was carried by Washinawatok, who racked up five kills followed by Miller who had three.
Early on in set three, the Wwls went on a 10-4 run which started with a kill and a service ace from Washinawatok. Thweatt and Miller also added two kills each. The Broncos would end the match with a late run.
Aroz led the Owls with 12 assists on the match. Washinawatok finished with 12 kills on 20 attempts and added ten digs. Roni Shaw (junior, Payette, Idaho) and Breanna Epperly (freshman, Reserve, Louisiana) had seven digs apiece.

Texto completo: Trick-or-treaters will miss the worst of a windstorm expected to hit coastal Maine with gusts of up to 60 mph starting after midnight Thursday.
A high wind warning is in effect for Hancock and Washington counties plus Bangor, Old Town and areas as far west as Greenville on Friday from 2 a.m. to 6 p.m., according to Todd Foisy, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Caribou.
https://twitter.com/NWSCaribou/status/1189848687448473601
Temperatures in the mid-60s, a steady, light rain, 15 to 25 mph winds and gusts topping out at 25 mph are expected in those areas until midnight Thursday, Foisy said.
"The good news is that it will be warm [for Halloweeners], but it will be wet," Foisy said. "As long as they avoid the puddles, they should be fine. We're not expecting any thunderstorms."
The high winds after midnight -- 39 to 45 mph, with gusts at 60 mph -- will cause power outages, uproot trees and dislodge boats along coastal Maine, particularly between Penobscot Bay and Eastport, right until it gets dark on Friday, Foisy said. Elsewhere winds will blow as hard as 35 to 45 mph. Seas will run as high as 18 feet, with light rain until 11 a.m. and a chance of showers until 2 p.m.
The strong low-pressure system creating the winds and rain is moving northeast from Lake Erie to the St. Lawrence Seaway.
"It will be a long event," Foisy said. "The main threat is the strong winds."

Mars Hill educator earns financial literacy honor

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- The Maine Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy has awarded two Maine educators for their outstanding work in financial education, including a Mars Hill teacher.
Samantha Drost of Central Aroostook High School, along with Raelene Allen of Madison High School, are "leaders in personal finance education in Maine, and epitomize the true spirit of the award," said coalition officials.
The award, established in 2012, was created to recognize an individual who has distinguished themselves through their efforts to improve the financial capability of the students and families they serve. This year for the first time, the coalition awarded two individuals.
Drost has been teaching at Central Aroostook High School for eight years, and in that time she has transformed the school's personal finance curriculum. When she began she was assigned to teach an economics course, but her class became more focused on personal finance as the lessons included balancing a checkbook, managing a budget and reducing debt.
In her time at Central Aroostook High School, Drost has been aware of the students' needs and she has taken action to fill any gaps she saw. When she noticed that students needed to have earlier access to college and career planning, she created a sophomore level class that focused on this subject.
Drost's passion for financial literacy extends beyond her school, and she has been a leader in bringing financial education to all schools in Maine.
"Samantha has found a new passion for teaching personal finance thanks to the Maine Jump$tart Program," wrote Dr. Kay York, CAHS principal.
Drost serves on The Maine Jump$tart Coalition Board of Directors, where she serves on the Program Committee. Drost was also awarded a scholarship to attend the 2018 National Jump$tart Conference, after which she returned to school "prepared and excited to bring new resources to her students including NGPF lessons, web-based games, Financial Fridays and local speakers," said York.
Drost has continued to further her education in financial literacy by attending various FinCamps in Maine, completing virtual training with NextGen Personal Finance, and is working on earning her senior-level certification through their program.
Drost also served as a co-facilitator during the revision of the Maine Learning Results for Social Studies, which strengthened the personal finance and economics component in the state standards. In April, she will teach a webinar on personal finance for the Maine Department of Education's social studies webinar series. To continue to expand her reach to teachers around the state, this fall Drost is applying for and hopes to be accepted as a state teacher leader for personal finance.
"Samantha's passion has grown into expanding her knowledge to others," writes Dr. York. "She will continue to strive to bring more education not only to her students, but the teachers in Northern Maine and the state."
Drost and Allen will receive an all-expenses-paid trip to the National Jump$tart Educator Conference in Washington, D.C. this November, and will each receive a $500 financial education grant from Machias Savings Bank. They will be formally honored at the 2020 Fostering Financial Education in Maine Schools Conference on May 8 in Augusta Civic Center.

Texto completo: ELLSWORTH, Maine -- Gary Fortier has served the city as a volunteer, emergency medical technician and elected official for almost 50 years. He's also had some serious fun in Ellsworth -- as a Halloween prankster.
Police say that it doesn't happen here any more, but the 65-year-old city councilor recalls an Ellsworth of the 1960s that teemed with practical jokes most every Halloween. Prank wars often erupted between east- and west-siders, with police manning the Union River bridge on Halloween night to interdict guerrilla forces looking to raid enemy territory.
But the pranksters got around the roadblock.
"We would get backpacks full of eggs, walk across the top of the Union River dam, do our bombing runs, and then walk home over the bridge innocently," Fortier said.
[image id="2891635" size="half" pos="right" /]
One Halloween prank is today an Ellsworth legend: Kids rolling pumpkins down Bridge Hill to be smashed by passing vehicles on Bucksport Road. Lots of kids participated, said Fortier, a graduate of the Ellsworth High School Class of 1972.
"It was the whole neighborhood," Fortier said. "We didn't steal stuff, we didn't break stuff. We got cheered by people [when the pranksters rolled pumpkins] because we were doing good, clean fun."
A measure of how the Bridge Hill tomfoolery has become city folklore: Several City Hall clerks mentioned it Wednesday, as did a group of Ellsworth Elementary Middle School students eating at DragonFire Pizza. One student said her grandmother told her about it.
Pumpkin rolling hasn't occurred for many years -- probably not since the early 1990s, Ellsworth police Capt. Troy Bires said. The city is pretty prankless today in general, he said.
Ellsworth Fire Chief Richard Tupper, 54, remembers the pumpkin rolling. He maintained that he never rolled pumpkins himself -- though he smashed one, once. Fortier isn't buying that.
"He was an eastie boy. He was on the losing side," Fortier said. "You really don't admit your failures."
Occasionally the practical jokes went too far. The captain of a now-defunct Ellsworth volunteer fire station drove into what he thought was a harmlessly fleshy gourd one Halloween on Bayside Road in Trenton. It was a large rock, painted orange.
"It took out his oil pan," Fortier said.
That would never happen in Fortier's Chapel Street neighborhood. "Bridge Hill guys," he said, "were non-violent offenders."
Today pranks are too easy to get in trouble for, and nobody has a taste for them, said 13-year-old Noah Torrance, who attends Ellsworth Elementary.
"It's a lot more civilized day and age," Torrance said.
Fortier scoffed at that notion.
"I think the last couple generations are not into good, clean fun as much as we were. They're on Facebook or Bookface or whatever the Hell it's called," Fortier said.
The best time to roll pumpkins, Fortier said, was at about 9:20 p.m. Tractor-trailer trucks hauling goods from Nova Scotia to Boston came from Bar Harbor's ferry terminal at 9 p.m. and hit the pumpkins on Bucksport Road, known then as Court Street, 20 minutes later.
"All these tractor trailers would come by and would squash the Hell out of them," Fortier said.

Van Buren native develops internet-based farming tool

Texto completo: VAN BUREN, Maine -- Nicholas LaJoie has a knack for electronics and innovation -- and he's using that to give back to his Aroostook County roots.
"Growing up on a farm allowed me to develop a natural love for everyday problem solving, so I have always been interested in being an engineer," says LaJoie, who hails from a potato farm in Van Buren and now lives in Portland.
He graduated in 2018 from the University of Maine with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. Since then, he's worked as a computer engineer for the Fitch Company in Gray, an engineering consulting firm that specializes in electrical and control system services for industrial spaces like paper mills and power plants.
Before graduation, LaJoie was making strides in engineering innovation, developing the company IoTato, based on an idea he had in high school.
"My dad, a potato farmer, has multiple storage facilities that keep the crop at optimal temperatures during the winter months," LaJoie said. "To ensure these facilities are operating properly, my dad spends at least an hour of each day driving to each facility to manually check the temperatures. I used to ride around with him and wonder what I could do to save him the time and hassle.
"By my senior year at UMaine I had the technical depth to conceive of a device that my friends and I could design and build that would provide a low-cost, rural-friendly solution for farmers throughout the state of Maine," he said.
And he has brought that design to life. He pitched the idea for IoTato at the UMaine Business Challenge in March 2018, and received the $10,000 innovation prize. The company's name combines "IoT," the acronym for "Internet of Things" -- referring to interconnection through computing devices embedded in everyday objects -- and "potato."
"There are several existing products out there that are costly, not user friendly, and/or hard to implement in rural areas. Many storage facilities are not intended to ever need internet access, and are often in locations where using cellular data is either expensive or not yet possible," said LaJoie.
The summer following graduation, LaJoie worked with fellow computer engineering graduates Kent Seneres and Max Geffken to build a prototype of IoTato. By January 2019, they were in testing stages, and since then have worked on improvements and redesign with plans to begin constructing an improved IoTato device in the fall. Isiah Brown, an MBA classmate, helped the team develop a business plan.
While at UMaine, LaJoie interned with MedRhythms, a digital therapeutics company that uses sensors, music and AI to measure and improve walking, and with Portland-based software development company Kepware Technologies. He credited Andy Sheaff, a lecturer in electrical and computer engineering, and Don Hummels, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, with aiding in his academic success.
While at UMaine, LaJoie was a Mitchell Scholar and involved with the Mitchell Institute. He participated in the Entrepreneurship Club as a founding member and club president; went on a mission trip through the Newman Center; planned and promoted for the Maine Day Meal Packout; belonged to the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon, through which he received the J. Edward Zollinger Outstanding Senior Award; and the Sophomore Owls and Senior Skulls Traditions Societies.
Now, LaJoie occupies his free time with marathon training -- he first ran one in 2017 and is training for another in 2020 -- as well as filmmaking.

Texto completo: BELFAST, Maine -- Every Halloween, Mary Jo Abbott, activities director for The Residence at Tall Pines, buys candy to hand out to trick-or-treaters who venture to the Belfast senior living community.
Most years, she doesn't have to get very much. That's because many Belfast-area children swarm to Cedar Street, a residential area that's become known as the go-to place on Halloween, to fill their bags and get their fix of spooky decorations.
But this year, with expected heavy rains, high winds and coastal flooding, Abbott is hoping that more pint-sized goblins and ghouls will find their way to Tall Pines.
"I got twice the candy I usually buy, because of the predicted weather. Now I'm thinking maybe I need to run to Walgreens and buy more," she said, adding that indoor trick-or-treating can be safer and is certainly going to be drier this year. "Our staff dresses up. A lot of our residents dress up. It's nice -- the intergenerational thing. And the residents love the kids and their costumes. It just brightens the day, really."
In Madawaska, the bad weather is forcing Operation No Tricks to the town's multipurpose building.
The annual event is sponsored by Customs and Border Protection along with Madawaska police, fire and ambulance crews and posts first-responders along the town's busiest intersections to hand out candy to trick-or-treaters and keep them safe.
"We love handing out treats in the avenues on Halloween to the trick-or-treaters, but this year's weather has made us change our plans," said Jodie Theriault, an organizer of the event.
Weather is shifting many Halloween plans this evening. If you're looking to stay dry, here are some indoor events going on in the area:

Texto completo: OpEd: Modern high school math should be about data science, not Algebra 2
Talk about brainwashing the masses. Did it ever occur to these professors that learning algebra, calculus and other advanced math skills is more than calculating the second partial derivative of some exponential factor? By learning how to perform these calculations, students learn critical thinking skills to make informed decisions. Of course the liberals want nothing more than to have people Google their answers so they can shape these low educated putty into the mind set that affirms their agenda. Do you think that because I can Google "bake a cake" that I can now do one that is equally as good as someone who graduated from Johnson & Wales cooking school? No, we may not use algebra or calculus, and you may say, "Well, MS Excel can perform many of these functions." Unless you understand how the data is arrived at, how can you interpret the results?
-- Krispy1
Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Common Core Standards, which Maine still claims to implement -- though the proficiency-based graduation movement has largely vanished -- include statistical data analysis. The Algebra II Common Core includes a section on "Inference and Conclusions from Data" which pushed the envelope of the traditional curriculum a good bit. U.S. students are at a disadvantage, but making space for more extensive use of Excel spreadsheets by not developing the functional modeling of Algebra II that is essential for learning Calculus is not going to restore their status (at present below the OECD average on PISA, behind Canada, Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, most of the EU) in a global, technical economy. The math curriculum in the U.S. was not invented by the Eisenhower administration, but it was during WWII that the inability of soldiers to analyze inventory or aim a cannon was recognized. The fraction of students taking algebra and geometry had fallen so that the military had to provide training. Standards have risen since the Bush era when there was a push for a national math curriculum but scores have not. Today the military's remediation program is called DANTES.
-- John_Eggebrecht
It is to bad they don't teach students home economic, and industrial arts. Students need to have life skills.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- Presque Isle High School students will have a unique Christmas surprise to look forward to this holiday season.
The high school has been selected to design and donate 24 different one-of-a-kind ornaments that represent the state of Maine for the National Christmas Tree celebration in Washington, D.C., this year.
Through a partnership with the National Park Service, the U.S. Department of Education worked with state art and education agencies to identify elementary, middle and high schools whose students would create a variety of ornaments for the display.
A total of 56 schools and 1,500 students were chosen to participate in this year's "America Celebrates" project, according to the National Park Service.
The project will feature 56 trees that will be displayed in President's Park, each one decorated with 24 different ornaments representing all the states, districts and territories that make up the nation.
All of the ornaments will be open to the public between Dec. 9, 2019 through Jan. 1, 2020, in conjunction with the 97th annual National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony, according to the park service.
The National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony began in 1923 when the District of Columbia Public Schools sent a letter to the White House proposing that a decorated Christmas tree be placed on the South Lawn of the White House.
That year on Christmas Eve, President Calvin Coolidge lit the first National Christmas Tree -- a 48-foot fir donated by Middlebury College in Vermont.
PIHS was the only school in Maine selected to design more than two dozen unique ornaments for the national project this year.
Ellyn Whitten-Smith, the art teacher at PIHS, said that this is the first year the school was chosen for the project.
Smith said that last year, her sister who teaches at Lawrence High School, organized the state ornament project to be displayed in the national celebration. She said the Department of Education asked her sister if the school wanted to do the project again this year but she said no.
"My sister in Presque Isle would kill me if I did this two years in a row," Smith recalled her sister said after turning down the opportunity.
In September, Smith began planning to do the project with her sophomore art sculpture class. But time conflicts posed a challenge. The students were already working on another project at the time, Smith said and shortly after, they went on break for the annual harvest season.
This gave Smith and her students just two weeks to grind out 24 unique ornaments representing some part of the state.
She decided to take the project a step beyond the traditional depictions of coastal lighthouses, lobsters, buckets of blueberries or other things people would normally associate with Maine.
Encouraging them to use their own creative license, Smith told her students to create a design of what the state meant to them.
"Maine offers so much more than just the traditional -- what people see in a postcard," she said.
Students designed depictions of some of Maine's well-known treasures including the puffin, blueberries, potatoes and fiddleheads, too.
"The students could do whatever they wanted," Smith said, describing the students' creations which vary from the iconic L.L. Bean Boot to whoopie pies and hot air balloons.
Stephen King will also be represented in one ornament in a vignette-style design of "IT".
"You get to see how young people view their home and how they view it from different regions," she said.

"The Nordic Heritage, Quoggy Jo, and Presque Isle Youth Hockey all provide exceptional experiences, especially for our local youth, and the funds raised are going to help them continue to do that. And focusing on our Scholarship Fund will allow our club to continue its long tradition of supporting local high school graduates in their college goals."
A kick-off to the auction took place Oct. 12 at the second annual Kiwanis Gala and Auction, featuring an auction hosted by the PI Rotary which raised over $3,000 towards their partner organizations.
Kiwanis and Rotary Club have joined forces for a third year to jointly raise funds for a worthy community cause. This year, the organizations have rallied to support the Going Places Network PI Loop for their community project. Presque Isle native Mary Smith donated $270,000 towards the project and challenged the two organizations to raise a $50,000 match. The $50,000 will be used to construct bus shelters at each of the bus stops to shelter riders from the elements.
"Building these structures to support our bus service will be an asset for our City and the many people that need transportation," PI Rotary Club President Clint Deschene said. "I am so excited that two organizations like Kiwanis and Rotary can see the value and combine our efforts to improve our community."
The fixed bus loop launched last week and is quickly gaining momentum. The community as a whole recognizes how vital this program is in meeting the increasing need for public transportation services. Donations are coming in, both big and small, to support the effort.
"Our community has always stepped up when there is a need to be filled. We are so thankful for the generosity that has been shown over the past 72 years," said auction co-chair Sarah Ennis. "These businesses have already stepped up to lead the way to make sure the citizens of this great community are being cared for. We are still asking that businesses and individuals consider donating to this important project to help fill the incredible need for public transportation here in Presque Isle."
Anyone who wishes to donate may call the special donation phone number at 207-768-1610.
The Presque Isle Rotary Club maintains a membership of approximately 90 individuals and is part of a world-wide organization of community volunteers. The slogan of Rotary is "Service Above Self" and the club seeks to live up to this ideal to support a variety of causes for the betterment of the community.

Texto completo: Sometimes a company has an employee who is quietly working but constant. So much so, they become part of the very fabric of that company.
In 1986 Susan Arena arrived in Maine and was hired to work at the Advertiser Democrat. However, on her very first day it was decided she was needed at the company’s Skowhegan paper so off she went to be their General Manager/Editor. A year later, she was back in Norway at the AD as its editor. Between then and 2010 when she retired from the paper, she also filled in as editor at other company papers including The Berlin Reporter and The 302 Times in Windham.
Although Susan retired as editor from the Advertiser, she continued to write her very popular column – Yesterdays – for the next nine years … until now.
This week her last column is being published as she is not only leaving the area, but the state. Moving to be near her daughter in North Carolina, Susan contemplated continuing the column from afar. Unfortunately, the logistics of getting and returning material would have been cumbersome so she decided against it. However, she made sure it was in good hands, getting long-time friend and journalist E.C. Shanor to take it over.
Nevertheless, losing Susan leaves a hole in the fabric of the Advertiser Democrat. The hole can be mended but the fabric will never be quite the same.
We will miss you Susan. Farewell and thank you for 33 years of service to this newspaper and the community.

Norway hunting camp joins register of historic places

Texto completo: <img class="wp-image-11500951 size-large" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/D571FA34-2301-4BA9-BE6B-63F6F55291B2-1024x767.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="767" />
NORWAY — Thomas McGinnis and Spencer Gober are hooked on Maine. For years they have come up from Boston to spend a week in picturesque Port Clyde. Eventually they decided they wanted a getaway of their own, but with a different experience than the mid coast bustle. They looked toward the lakes and mountains region, and their goal – to limit their drive north to less than three hours from home – put Norway in their sights.
McGinnis and Gober spent about a year looking at properties online and then a rustic hunting camp was listed for sale by the Western Foothills Land Trust. Located about seven miles outside of Norway, Camp Cinnamon came with a well-documented history: it, along with another camp located on a Lake Pennesseewassee island, was a gathering place for locals to hunt and fish.
“Camp Cinnamon was the first and only property I felt compelled to actually see in person,” said Gober. “Ironically, my cousin saw a different listing for it on Instagram and told me she had found the perfect place for me. Little did she know I’d already made arrangements to see it!”
Camp Cinnamon first appears in Norway deed records in 1876. It was purchased in 1895 by members of the local Cummings family. Since boyhood the brothers belonged of a local fraternal group that casually labeled itself the Cobblers Club and gathered for youth sports activities like boxing and wrestling.
According to Camp Cinnamon’s Statement of Significance, researched and written by the Maine Historic Preservation Commission, as the young men grew up and had increasing means their pastimes expanded to hunting and fishing. Mirroring the rise of outdoor recreation and tourism industries during the late 19th century, Camp Cinnamon and its sister camp, the Bass Island Club at Lake Pennesseewassee, provided homegrown opportunities for the Cobblers Club to participate in growing pastimes.
The two clubs gained such a following that in 1906 Lewiston Evening Journal featured them in a news article, including the anecdotal story from 1864 of how members were first dubbed as the Cobblers Club. Several of them, now all adults, were named in the piece and included local businessman C.M. Smith and onetime Advertiser Democrat owner Fred Sanborne.
<img class="size-full wp-image-11523187" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/Camp-Cinnamon.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="1000" />
At the time the Lewiston Evening Journal published the article Camp Cinnamon consisted of a sprawling 14- by 18-foot, two-story camp with additions jutting to the east and west and a nearby stable. Another addition was added on the north side by 1940. The Historic Preservation summary notes that in 2019 the camp maintains its original features and integrity: no insulation or plumbing, minimal electricity, and a mostly unfinished interior. Second-hand materials were been used in various construction phases, as throughout are mismatched, second-hand features like doors and windows.
“Not many camps are included on the National Register of Historic Places,” said Michael Goebel-Bain, the Historic Preservation Commission representative who reviewed and McGinnis’ and Gober’s application and researched the property. “But Camp Cinnamon is a significant example of an early Maine camp. It has a high level of maintained integrity.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-11523955" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/Capture-9-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />
McGinnis and Gobel see themselves as stewards of the property rather than owners. That’s why they decided to take the time to have Camp Cinnamon added to the national historic register.
“In general, we believe that it is important to preserve buildings and places that link us to our collective past, and one tool for that is the national register,” explained Gober. “The original members and their descendants cared for the camp for more than 100 years. We feel that we aren’t just the new owners of the Camp Cinnamon. It is our responsibility to ensure that its connection to the people of Norway and to Maine’s past continues for the years to come.”
The two plan to enjoy Camp Cinnamon as it sits – perhaps running water is in its future but no other major changes will be made. While neither hunts, Gober’s father does, and he has belonged to hunting clubs himself.
“My father has already started looking into get a hunting license in Maine,” said Gober. “I don’t know which one of us is more excited/intrigued by the hunting history of Camp Cinnamon more – me or my dad!”

Legion signs 250th Anniversary Commemoration of America’s March to Freedom

Texto completo: BUCKFIELD — At Buckfield Post 58, on October 15, the American Legion Department of Maine, Oxford County District 5 posts approved and signed a Resolution calling for March 5, 2020, on which day in 1770 the Boston Massacre occurred, to be recognized as the true beginning of the commemoration of 250th Anniversary of the March to Freedom of the United States.
Many of the other States of the original 13 British Colonies plan on observing their 250th remembrances on April 19, 2025, the day on which the Battles of Lexington and Concord took place in 1775. The difference is that two full National election cycles will have elapsed before any mention of how the nation came to be founded, and why it fought eight long bitter years to choose a government elected by the people under a Constitution, rather than a Monarchs’ whim, cementing the individual inviolable rights that all citizens yet enjoy. It should also be recalled, that though the Boston Massacre occurred in Massachusetts, Maine was at that time and through the first National election in 1789, and for 30 additional years, a Province of Massachusetts.
Following the Glorious Revolution, every hamlet, village, town, and city in Maine was peopled by a substantial number of the soldiers who fought in the Revolution, in which places their descendants abide to the present day. It is, therefore, our right to choose on what date we begin the 250th Anniversary of our ancestors’ struggle to fight for and found the greatest nation in human history.

There is no doubt about it. Bugsy is beautiful. She has that long hair, Maine Coon thing going on for her. But, appearance isn’t everything. It’s what’s on the inside that counts.
Five-year-old Bugsy has a personality that matches her beauty. She is a very loving cat. She reaches out to people when they walk into the room. She accepts a gentle touch while she calmly sits and listens to a story.
If you are looking for a cat that will warm your heart as well as warm your lap on a cold evening, Bugsy could be the beauty that you have been searching for.
Responsible Pet Care of Oxford Hills is a no-kill, non-profit shelter and adoption center for cats and dogs, and the holding area for stray dogs for 12 towns in Oxford County. The shelter is located at 9 Swallow Road in Paris.

Texto completo: WEST PARIS — November can be bleak, but it can also signify transitions and new beginnings as we move into the winter season. What better time to explore our spirituality, perhaps a new beginning? Join in at the First Universalist Church of West Paris, where explorations occur every Sunday. Worship services begin at 9:00 a.m. with refreshments afterward. All are welcome to attend.
November 3, “The Timeless Promise” led by The Reverend Fayre Stephenson. We Unitarian Universalists gather together through covenant, a timeless promise, rather than creed. Join us as we explore the hallowed covenant that binds us together and what makes it sacred.
November 10, “Living with an Attitude of Gratitude” led by The Reverend Laura Knittweis, who is an interfaith minister, ordained in 2011 through the Chaplaincy Institute of Maine. Her primary ministry is end of life support which she does through her business, Heartsong Caregiving and Ministry Services. She has served as minister of the week at Ferry Beach.
November 17, “Indiscriminate Taste” led by The Reverend Fayre Stephenson. Writer Kat Liu wrote, “I’ve been trying to cultivate appreciation, to see the merits of what’s in front of me instead of the flaws, even if they’re not my taste. I still catch myself in critique mode—it’s hard to unlearn—but overall, I’m a happier person with indiscriminate tastes.” Knowing that many of us suffer from judging and being judged, at this service we will consider non-judgmental living. November 24, “Grace Beyond Knowing, I Kings 17:8-16 and Luke 7:11-17, led by The Reverend William “Scott” Campbell. Reverend Campbell is a retired United Methodist pastor living on Paris Hill with his wife, Lin, and two grandsons. He served churches in Paris, France; Brussels, Belgium, and Harvard Square, in Cambridge, MA. He was an adjunct faculty member at Harvard Divinity School for twenty years. His Maine roots go back to the early 1960’s when his parents bought a home in Winthrop. He regularly attends the First Congregational Church in South Paris.
For more information about the church and services, please contact Marta Clements, 674-2143, mclements96894@ roadrunner.com, or Bob Clifford at 674-3442, bobarlen@megalink.net. To learn more about the Unitarian-Universalist Association, visit http://www.uua.org/.

Beigette Gill finds her Dream Life at Fernwood Cove

Beigette Gill has owned and run Fernwood Cove in Harrison with her husband Jim since 2004. They live at the camp on the edge of Island Pond along with their son, who is 9, and their daughter, who is 11. Gill’s parents and her younger brother live in Australia. Jim’s parents have a home nearby.
****
I grew up in a small country town of about 800 people called Baradine. It is in New South Wales, Australia, five hours from Sidney, and at the edge of the Outback. My grandparents on both sides were farmers there. My mom’s family had 5000 acres for livestock and wheat. My dad’s had 1000 for sheep.
I swam a lot at the local pool. I was also into horseback riding. Though we lived in town, we’d ride into the creeks, mustering cattle and working with horses.
When I was in the 9th grade, I went to Loreto Normanhurst, an all-girls boarding school in Sydney. I swam on the swim team for a few years and also played field hockey. I enjoyed the camaraderie and the girls who are still my friends.
I went to the University of Sydney. I lived on campus for the first year and then moved out with friends. I worked as a barmaid and also volunteered at a summer camp program on the coast of Australia. That’s where I met Matt.
I’d been intrigued by the idea of working at a summer camp for a while. Matt had worked at Camp Fernwood In Poland, Maine. He made me remember what I really wanted to do.
I graduated with a BA in Nursing and then went back to Baradine for a year where I worked at four different hospitals. When I was done, I called Matt. He connected me with Camp Fernwood which hired me as a swim instructor.
My first night at camp I met Jim. Though I was attracted to him, I told him I had a relationship in Australia. By the end of the summer, that relationship wasn’t going anywhere. If there was anyone at the camp who I wanted to kiss it was Jim. That’s how our relationship started.
After camp was over, Jim and I and some other camp friends traveled for a week. Then I went back to Australia. Jim and I kept in touch. In January of that next year, he came over. We traveled around for a month. It was a way to see if this was going to work. It worked well. Our relationship continued.
I came back to Camp Fernwood in 2003. Jim worked there as well. One day I told him, “If we are going to stay together, we need to get married.”
We decided to marry on July 18th. That morning Jim proposed to me at the assembly right in front of the campers. I said yes and he kissed me. The girls were ecstatic.
We went to the town office to get married, but the lady there said, “I don’t like to mix marriage and work. Is there anywhere else you can have your ceremony?”
Jim asked Fritz, the camp director, “Can we be married here today?” Fritz said, “We can do it at 4.”
When we came back, there was an altar, a bouquet, a pianist to play Pachelbel’s Canon, a violinist to accompany, a person to take photos and a four-tiered wedding cake. The chef had actually made it for someone else, but he gave to us instead.
A staff person lent me a dress she had brought for the camp banquet, which was always an all-white occasion. It was a beautiful simple strapless dress. It fit perfectly.
We had an instant wedding for 300 guests. It was magical. I could not have dreamt up a better one.
We finished the camp season. Then we moved to Dutch Harbor, Alaska where Jim was contracted for eight-months on the Aleutian Islands to be a supervisor for National Marine Fisheries.
Sometime that winter, Fritz called Jim to tell him that Fernwood Cove was for sale. Fritz said we should buy it. I said we should. Originally a boys camp called Camp Chickawah, it started in the early 1900s and went out of business in the 80s. The owners of Camp Fernwood bought Camp Chickawah in 1998 and renamed it Fernwood Cove. It became the first half-season girls camp in Maine.
We worked at Fernwood the summer of 2004 and then bought it that November. We have been here since then.
On Labor Day Weekend of 2011, Jim was getting ready to go for a mountain bike ride on a trail in New Hampshire. I was planning on making tomato soup. It was so gorgeous, I decided to come.
We got out of the truck, put the kids in a chariot behind Jim, and started down the trail which was a tote road. I rode behind them in one of the wheel tracks. When I decided to cross the median, which was all grass, my front tire went into a hole. I went over my handlebars and landed on my neck.
Jim called 911 on our old Verizon cell phone. Within 30 minutes, a response team was taking me out on a backboard and putting me into the back of a pickup. A half-hour later, I was at a small local hospital, where they did a cat scan. It confirmed that I had fractured my C6 and C7 vertebrae and done instant spinal cord damage. Because of my nurse training, I knew this already.
The incident happened at 11 in the morning. At 10 at night I had surgery at Maine Med in Portland. Though a spinal cord injury cannot be fixed, they put donor bone in my neck to stabilize my spine.
I spent the next seven months at Shepherd Center, which is a premium rehab center for brain and spinal injuries in Atlanta, Georgia. The people at Shepard helped me learn things, like how to sit up, shower myself and use a power chair. Because I have sensation and limited movement below my injury, they were able to help me regain any function I could.
I have tough moments, but it’s been amazing to be able to live here and raise my family. I’ve got the best job in the world.

Occupation : Office manager, Global Home Health Care Agency Inc.
Education : High school diploma from Soldotna High School, Soldotna Alaska; associate degree of applied sciences in electromechanical technology from Central Maine Community College.

Family : Mother and stepfather, Cindy and Eric Fine of Soldotna, Alaska; sister and brother-in-law, Aurora and Roger Rogers of Soldotna, Alaska; father and stepmother, Corby and Merry Hawkins of Spokane, Washington; sons Johnathon Allred of Gravois Mills, Missouri, Diego Arriaga Jr. of Lewiston and Logan McEwen of Newport.
Political experience : Maine People’s Alliance board member 2015 to present; Healthy Neighborhoods Planning Board member 2018 to present.
Why are you running for school committee? If elected, what will be your priorities?
I am running for school committee in Ward 5 because I want to be a voice for myself and other parents like me in the downtown. I want to form a coalition with other underfunded school districts and go to Augusta to request the funding our state voted into law. I want to see a closet in every school where children in need can get free food and clothing, and a tool kit and training provided for every teacher to help them address student needs as they identify them. I want to see our school system build and enforce a real anti-bullying policy combined with community outreach to begin addressing the issues that our students face every day.
What do you like and what don’t you like about the school budget that passed in the spring?
I thoroughly support the plan to expand Lewiston High School. In my opinion, the schools need more funding, not half measures. I was thoroughly disheartened to hear the way students were spoken of at City Council meetings when the proposed budget was discussed. These children who were spoken of as burdens are in fact the future of our city and state. Providing for their education and upbringing should be seen as a gift not a burden.
Lewiston has one of the lowest graduation rates in the state. What can be done to address that problem?
We need to make our schools comfortable, welcoming places to learn. This begins with making sure students are prepared to learn. It’s proven that well-rested, -fed and -treated students learn better. We need to make sure every student has a counselor they can connect with (during school hours). And we need to ensure that those counselors are prepared to offer students all the options available to them. Our community has many alternative options to standard public education. We need to ensure that not just students, but parents as well are aware of them.

Family : Our family has been involved with youth since the beginning. My wife and I were youth pastors before our five children were born. We have been super involved in the Lewiston school system for 15 years since we moved here from Woolwich. We are very proud of all five children, from our youngest at McMahon elementary to our three oldest, who all received amazing scholarships to Clark and Colgate universities.
Political experience: I do not nor do my friends consider me to be political. I am a no-holds-barred, straight to the point person that loves his city and wants to see the best for all those who live here, especially the children.
Why are you running for school committee? If elected, what will be your priorities?
I’m running to offer my experience of raising children in the system in order to better the system. My priorities are a safe place to grow and learn for every child. A forward thinking leadership for all the challenges of a modern world, including the scary things that have happened to us and the amazing possibilities that I know lie ahead. I will prioritize hearing from every person that wants to bring their opinion to the table and add to the collective wisdom that our city holds.
What do you like and what don’t you like about the school budget that passed in the spring?
I like the fact that our budget reflects a serious commitment to our kids, but feel that we could prioritize the people on the ground more than we do. I once took a group of music students on an expensive field trip as a chaperone. I asked every student that went if they would have given up their trip and spent the money differently if it meant they could have a full-time one-on-one music mentor at the school. They all said they would forego the trip to further their access.
Lewiston has one of the lowest graduation rates in the state. What can be done to address that problem?
I believe our graduation rates are a direct reflection of years of misguided focus on systems and gadgets instead of relationships and education. I believe it’s a new day in our school system that looks positive for educators to teach from a place of relationship unencumbered by reports and unnecessary meetings in collaboration with staff that is excited about our kids, our city, and its future. We are the second largest city in Maine and its influence should not be underestimated.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
On behalf of our 230,000 members, AARP Maine thanks Congressman Jared Golden for participating in our recent tele-town hall on prescription drug costs. Nearly 3,500 Mainers participated in the forum and many asked questions of Congressman Golden live during the call.
Much of the discussion focused on the latest news from Washington, including two bills which will likely be voted on soon.
Currently under consideration in the House of Representatives is HR 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019 . Under HR 3, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would negotiate prices for at least 25 of the most expensive brand-name medicines. The bill would also cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries at $2,000 per year. In addition AARP is pushing for other improvements to Medicare such as coverage for dental, vision and hearing care.
In the Senate, we urge Senate leadership to bring the bipartisan Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019 to a floor vote this year. The bill would cap out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries and require drug manufacturers to provide a rebate to Medicare if the prices of their products increase faster than inflation.
AARP Maine is committed to working with our federal lawmakers to lower prescription drug costs. Too many Mainers of all ages struggle to afford the medications they need to stay healthy, and to even stay alive. It shouldn’t be that way. We cannot wait any longer for this to change, and urge our elected leaders to pass these bills.

BETHEL — David Murphy said it’s a “humbling experience” to be named Maine’s Superintendent of the Year.
The chief administrator of School Administrative District 44 was presented the award at the annual fall conference of superintendents in Augusta on Oct. 24 and 25.
Murphy, of Bethel, is in his 18th year as the district’s superintendent. Before that, was a principal in SAD 44 schools for 18 years.
“Dr. Murphy exemplifies the best qualities in a school superintendent,” Eileen King, deputy executive director of the Maine School Management Association, said. “He has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the students and staff he serves, and is an active member of the community, creating community relationships that directly benefit his students.
“Dave is constantly thinking about the 21st century needs of his students and is diligent in ensuring that they have the supports and the programs they need to be successful citizens,” she said. Dave is a caring and thoughtful leader who turns challenges into opportunities for his staff and students.”
Bonnie Largess, chairwoman of the SAD 44 Board of Directors who has worked with Murphy the past 13 years, said, “Dr. Murphy has been a tireless advocate for the students and staff of our district, creating many valuable educational opportunities.”

Murphy, responding to his selection, said, “It’s a humbling experience. I look at it more along the lines that I’ve been chosen to represent what is going on in schools. I am representing all the other superintendents in Maine and the great things that are happening in Maine schools.”
His job has come with many ups and downs over the nearly two decades he’s been superintendent. Some of the challenges include Newry’s withdrawal efforts, the state-mandated school consolidation process and losing $2.5 million in state aid.
With the struggles have come many rewarding experiences also, he said. He thanked the board of directors for playing a role in this.
“I think the overall support that I’ve been able to receive from the school board has been key,” Murphy said. “We have been able to score some impressive opportunities for our kids.”
He cited, as examples, the relationship they recently formed with a school in China, the dual enrollment program with Central Maine Community College in Auburn and the Telstar Freshman Academy.
“I think ultimately, the ability to know our kids and know are families is huge,” Murphy said. “We try to make everything about the kids, everything, every decision. We try to live by that, it’s not always easy, but we just keep looking ahead.”
Murphy, who was recently given a five-year contract by the school board, said as long as he continues enjoying the work and receive the support of the board, he’ll stay around.

LEWISTON-AUBURN — The new LA River History Trail showcasing 30 historical markers straddling both sides of the Androscoggin River will be unveiled in a public ceremony Saturday.
Museum in the Streets is a project of the Grow L+A River Working Group with a mission to be the conduit between Lewiston and Auburn for best use of the river, and to tell the history of the river and the two cities that settled around it.
The working group includes the Androscoggin Historical Society, Museum LA, Androscoggin Land Trust, Healthy Androscoggin, Bates College and the cities of Lewiston and Auburn.
A ribbon cutting will be held at noon Saturday in the center of the trestle bridge connecting Simard-Payne Memorial Park in Lewiston and Bonney Park in Auburn. The community is invited to participate by gathering in each park, and walking across the bridge, meeting in the middle at noon.
Museum in the Streets has been years in the making as working group members researched the cities’ heritage, locating historic artwork for the display signs and writing histories in English and French for each sign. According to a written statement from Grow L+A River Working Group, the decision to write the histories in both languages was done “to not only remind us of our rich Franco history, but to help guide residents and tourists alike to be able to learn more about the two cities’ rich history, all while walking along the river and around the two downtowns.”
While there are 30 markers along the trail, the Great Falls — sometimes referred to as “Our Little Niagara” — is the focal point of the trail in tribute to the Native Americans who lived along its banks and fished its waters, and whose power led the Twin Cities into the Industrial Age, fueling the cities’ mills.
According to the working group, “Auburn’s history is a manifold tale of Native Americans and settlers; entrepreneurs and visionaries; industrializing and the American Dream.”
Illustrated panels will guide visitors along the Riverwalk and through the downtown, where they can read about Auburn’s past at 15 points of interest.
The people of Auburn, including the Anasagunticook tribe that settled along the Little Androscoggin in 1684, “have been intricately tied to the Androscoggin River throughout history, which has helped shape the community, the land and the river itself over time,” according to the Grow L+A written statement. The markers explore the battles over land rights, the foundation of Auburn as the Androscoggin County seat, the fact that Auburn was the first city in Maine to adopt the council-manager form of government, and the shoe manufacturing and other industries that sprouted over time. There is also information about the 1937 labor strike that caused the failure of some of the city’s shoe manufacturers and how that, and foreign imports, “largely ended Auburn’s reign as the ‘shoe capital of the world.'”
On the Lewiston side of the trail, visitors will learn about the rich heritage of Maine’s second largest city, according to the statement, including “Lewiston’s significant residents, entrepreneurs, buildings, and cultural transformations in the founding and building of the community.”
Lewiston and the surrounding area has been inhabited for over 10,000 years, beginning with the Wabanaki people and followed by white settlers in 1770. The 15 historic markers on the Lewiston side of the river explore the migration of people to the area, including a Boston-based land company called The Pejepscot Proprietors, which granted land to Jonathan Bagley and Moses Little of Newbury, Massachusetts, to settle 50 families in Lewiston. The name “Lewiston” honored the late Job Lewis of Boston, a Pejepscot Proprietor, according to Grow L+A.
“Although textile mills would eventually become the foremost employer, the town’s first settlers were mostly farmers of English heritage. Thus, Lewiston had a widely dispersed population. Only in 1823 was a bridge constructed, replacing ferries, to connect Lewiston” with Auburn, according to the group’s statement.
Now that the trail has been completed, according to Grow L+A, other projects it intends to launch include advertising when the Great Falls is running and encourage the public to go to the downtowns to see it. The group also intends to ask Brookfield Renewable of Lewiston, developer of innovative, natural power solutions, for timed releases over the falls, and will explore lighting the falls and the dry granite when the falls are not running.
The group also intends to lobby for legislation to reclassify the Androscoggin River to a Class B river, promote the river for recreational fishing, kayaking and canoeing, to connect the L-A Trails with Riverlands State Park in Turner, and to petition for signs to be installed on the Maine Turnpike pointing to the cities’ shared “Downtown Historic River District.”

Texto completo: Sometimes the simplest tasks are the toughest – like saying goodbye.
Yet that is what this, my final “Yesterdays” column, is all about.
The Advertiser Democrat has been an extremely meaningful part of my life for 30-plus years – and I am grateful for every one of them. (Maybe there were a few days I was quite so appreciative, but overall it has been wonderful.)
I’ve learned, I’ve grown, I’ve hit rough patches and discovered I can lean on friends and co-workers to bounce back – I’m a very lucky person.
Now it is time to say goodbye and tuck all my treasured memories into a very safe place to travel with me.
After all these years in Maine, I’m headed to North Carolina in a few weeks, where I will be closer to my daughter and I very much look forward to spending time with her.
But I will miss the folks I’ve met here over these almost-35-years and I admit that while I type this my eyes are misting over – saying goodbye IS tough.
I do have some good news to pass along, my friend Gene Shanor, with whom I have worked with for years and years, will continue the tradition of the “Yesterdays” column.
So, please keep mailing your comments and photos to Advertiser Democrat, 220 Main Street, Suite 1, Norway, ME 04268 or drop off your information at the Advertiser office (220 Main Street, Suite 1, Norway) between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. I’m sure Gene will be adding additional ways to reach him in the near future.
So, my friends and readers, it’s time for the tough task:
Goodbye. Thanks for being a part of my life and for sharing some of yourself with me. I treasure my time spent with you.

Texto completo: STATE — Yesterday at the Blaine House, Governor Janet Mills, Commissioner Amanda Beal and Maine Forest Service Director Patty Cormier, recognized The Maine Association of Conservation Districts (MACD) with the “Austin Wilkins Forest Stewardship Award.” The award is the foremost recognition for Maine individuals, groups, organizations or companies that stand above their peers to show a continuous commitment or single exemplary contribution to the culture, heritage, and future of the Maine forest. The award was presented to Andrew Reed, MACD President and Carol Weymouth, MACD Executive Director.
“Our forests have always been — and will always be — at the core of Maine’s history and our future,” said Governor Mills. “Congratulations to the Maine Association of Conservation Districts on this well-deserved honor and on behalf of the people of Maine, thank you for all you do for our great state.”
ABOUT WILKINS
Austin Wilkins pioneered the development of the Maine Forest Service and led the fight against the devastating forest fires of 1947. The fires that scorched the landscape in Bar Harbor and southern Maine’s York County prompted Mr. Wilkins to develop policies to reduce the chances that such conflagrations could occur again. He was instrumental in the establishment of a forest fire compact that called for the six New England states, New York, New Brunswick, and Quebec to provide mutual help in battling fires. He joined the Maine Forest Service in 1928 and was appointed commissioner 30 years later by Governor Edmund Muskie. Mr. Wilkins retired in 1972 after serving under 13 governors as a commissioner or a deputy commissioner. Governor John Baldacci called Mr. Wilkins a ”true leader and one of the forestry greats of Maine” and praised ”his quiet and thorough approach and his eloquent speaking.” Mr. Wilkins was the author of ”Ten Million Acres of Timber,” a history of the Maine forestry district, as well as a book about the Civilian Conservation Corps. He remained active in forestry matters well into his 90s. He died in 2005 at the age of 102.
About MACD
MACD represents Maine’s 16 Soil & Water Conservation Districts. Soil & Water Conservation Districts are agencies of the state that provide voluntary technical assistance to landowners on the local level. Conservation Districts were created by Maine and other states as a response to the massive loss of topsoil in the “Dust Bowl” of the 1930’s. Locally-led soil & water conservation programs have been a cost-effective response to soil erosion, non-point source pollution of lakes, rivers, and marine waters, and now, to the vital issue of mitigating climate change through better soil health practices and sustainable forest management. Forest management is a high priority for every Conservation District. Many offer annual tree and shrub sales to encourage property owners to plant more native vegetation. Several Districts provide portable skidder bridges (with assistance from the Maine Forest Service) that allow loggers to cross wet areas without damage. Many Conservation Districts have active or retired foresters on their Boards of Supervisors.
ABOUT MAINE FOREST SERVICE
Established in 1891, the MFS mission is to protect and enhance Maine’s forest resources through forest fire prevention; technical assistance; education and outreach to a wide variety of audiences; and enforcement of the State’s forest protection laws. MFS offices are located throughout the state and provide Maine citizens with a wide range of forest-related services. For more information visit www.maineforestservice. gov.

This week the Buzz bids farewell to Break cafe.
Sadie Blais opened the coffee shop, quickly home to popular vegan doughnuts, in Auburn’s Engine House building in 2018.
In a Facebook post to customers this week, she announced that she’s had to close abruptly for health reasons.
“It’s been a dream come true and I’m proud of myself for making it happen, and proud of all of you for supporting me,” Blais wrote. “I’ve met some amazing people and had a really great time being open. Unfortunately, my pregnancy (3rd baby, yay!) (sic) is complicated and I have to slow down and focus on my health. My family will also benefit from having me around right now, so it just seems right. It was a tough decision but it was made for me.”
She said she’s hoping to sell the shop and contents.
Blais could not be reached for comment Thursday. The shop’s website was already down and the phone rang unanswered.
And in Halloween news . . .
Last year, CandyStore.com announced it had scoured 11 years of sales data to determine the three most popular Halloween candies by state.
For Maine, in order of popularity: Sour Patch Kids, Starburst and M&Ms.
In 2019, CandyStore.com’s done it again, and . . . drum roll . . . it’s Sour Patch Kids, Starburst and M&Ms.
New Hampshire stayed the same, too, with Starburst, M&Ms and Snickers.
The Maine taste bud is unflinching! Hope you stocked up on Sour Patch Kids for Thursday night.

WEST PARIS — State police stopped four New York City residents Wednesday night on the Maine Turnpike and confiscated 382 grams of cocaine and crack cocaine bound for Oxford County, Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland said.
The arrests are connected to an investigation of drug trafficking from a home at 33 Main St. in West Paris. Simultaneous with the turnpike stop, deputies from the Oxford County Sheriff’s Office and officers from Norway and Rumford police departments searched the West Paris home and seized items related to drug trafficking, McCausland’s news release said.

Investigators said the four have been importing and selling drugs from Oxford Hills to the Rumford area and in southern Franklin County in recent months.
Charged with aggravated drug trafficking were Yashim “Scotty” Gomez, 35, Princess Munoz-Cordero 19, Geraldine “GiGi” Rodriguez, 31, and Raymond Taveras-Vasquez, 26, all of Bronx. They were taken into custody in York and booked at the York County Jail in Alfred, McCausland said.
Gomez had bail set at $20,000; the others had bail set at $10,000, the news release said.

The drug trafficking arrests were the second this week for state police patrolling the turnpike. On Tuesday, two New York men and a Bangor woman were arrested after their vehicle was stopped in Kennebunk and cocaine and heroin headed for Bangor was seized, McCausland said.

Huddle Up: Playoff predictions, for entertainment purposes only

Texto completo: Three things I love about high school football playoffs in Maine:
• At least 25 percent of the crowd is wearing blaze orange.
• No pumpkin spice in the sideline Gatorade buckets.
• I get to make fresh predictions that hopefully make everyone forget my, uh, off-target preseason predictions (they’ve been erased from the internet. Don’t even try.)
So here they are, for entertainment purposes only, my 2019 high school football playoff predictions:
Class A
Thornton Academy over Scarborough
Barring any catastrophes in the regular season finale, these two and Bonny Eagle will be the only teams with a reasonable shot of winning Class A (the more things change, et cetera, et cetera). Currently-unbeaten Thornton will likely be the No. 1 seed, and Livermore Falls native Kevin Kezal appears to have his defending champs peaking at the right time again. Perhaps just as important is the Trojans showed earlier this season that they are capable of handling adversity and won’t panic if they get behind. They are balanced and deep, capable of quick strikes in the passing game, led by QB Kobe Gaudette, or grinding out long drives in the running game. I’m taking Scarborough over Bonny Eagle because the Red Storm have unleashed Jarett Flaker after wisely limiting his exposure to wear-and-tear early in the season.
Class B
North: Brunswick over Lawrence
South: Marshwood over Kennebunk
State: Marshwood over Brunswick
Brunswick dominated B North this year with its usual relentless ground game. The Dragons have been held below 47 points once all season, by Windham. Perhaps Cony’s stingy defense can do the same, but Lawrence, which lost to the Dragons 50-21 earlier this season, will bounce the Rams in the semifinals. Marshwood has been even more dominant in the South despite the addition of a number of former Class A programs to the schedule. The Hawks’ only hiccup was a one-point loss to Thornton Academy. Many believed graduation losses would sap some of their offensive firepower, but they’ve been even more prolific behind quarterback Connor Caverly and fullback Justin Bryant. And for all of its speed and big-play ability, Kennebunk’s offense barely managed 200 total yards in a 48-14 loss to Marshwood two weeks ago. The gap between the Hawks and the rest of Class B may be as big as it’s every been. Just move them up to Class A already. Enrollment is a false god.
Class C
North: MCI over Winslow
South: Leavitt over Wells
State: Leavitt over MCI
With the exception of their 18-6 Week 1 loss to Wells, Winslow has barely had to break a sweat in the second half of any of its games. QB Colby Pomeroy and RB Rob Clark lead the state’s highest-scoring offense (52.9 points per game), but the Black Raiders are loaded at the skill positions and, maybe more importantly, at the line of scrimmage. MCI did make the Black Raiders work for most of their Oct. 11 matchup in Pittsfield, leading 19-14 at halftime, but turned the ball over and couldn’t stop Winslow in the second half in what turned out to be a runaway 61-37 win for the Raiders. The Huskies haven’t given up a point in two games since, and they were very banged up for the first meeting. If they are healthy again, I’ll take them in an upset.
Leavitt played much of the second half of the season without injured tailbacks Allen Peabody and Dasean Calder, but their return will give QB Wyatt Hathaway an arsenal that even Winslow can’t match. Some believe Leavitt exposed Wells in its 22-8 win on Oct. 12, and point to last week’s 48-27 loss to York as further proof. The Wildcats earned the No. 2 seed and home field in a possible semifinal rematch with that win, but I refuse to believe that Wells coach Tim Roche pulled out all the stops in that one, and I believe the Warriors will have enough to disrupt York standout QB Teagan Hynes in the semis but not enough to block Hathaway and a hungry senior class from their first trip to the state title game in five years.
Class D
North: Bucksport over Dexter
South: Winthrop/Monmouth/Hall-Dale over Oak Hill
State: WMHD over Bucksport
This may be the final season of Class D as we know it. A number of teams, particularly in the North, could make the move to eight-man football next season. It only seems like Bucksport has been playing 11-on-8 all season, outscoring its opponents 287-27. But the Golden Bucks did win a 21-14 crossover squeaker over Oak Hill, so they should be prepared in the event someone in the North gives them a scare.
WMHD has dominated the South, not quite as convincingly, but with a 37.7 ppg average margin of victory, nevertheless. The Ramblers boast a balanced offense led by QB Keegan Choate and a bevy of weapons on offense, so opposing defenses can’t focus stopping one or two players. The defense has posted three shutouts and allowed only 7.7 ppg since surrendering 38 points to MCI in their opening-night loss. Lisbon, Oak Hill and Spruce Mountain have all taken turns playing the role of the Ramblers’ most likely nemesis during the regular season, but the Raiders always seem to play their best in November, so I’ll take them narrowly over the Greyhounds in the semis.
Eight-man
Large school: Maranacook over Mt. Ararat
Small school: Boothbay over Old Orchard Beach
State: Maranacook over Boothbay
Maranacook and Mt. Ararat have clearly been the two best teams in eight-man football’s inaugural season. It’s a shame that they won’t be playing for the first state title, so hopefully the Maine Principals’ Association can address the playoff format in the next year or two as more schools take the plunge. Overall, though, it’s been a successful season, with a lot more competitive games and all 10 teams having a legitimate shot at the playoffs in Week 8. Long live eight-man football!

PARIS — Fallen Saints MC, Ft. Williams Chapter President Mike Sampson presented a check for $500 this week to Brad Peck, Administrator of Maine Veterans’ Home (MVH) South Paris. More than 30 motorcycles and almost 50 riders had participated in the 2nd annual ride for the Maine Veterans’ Homes – South Paris back on Saturday, September 14, 2019. Members of the club mingled with residents and thanked them for their service to the country prior to leaving the facility and braving the rainy weather. After a ride through the surrounding communities of Oxford Hills, members returned to the MVH South Paris for pizza and salads. Suggested donation was $25 and $5 for lunch. A 50/50 raffle was also held, and Fallen Saints Motorcycle Club gear was for sale during this great cause that benefited the great heroes who reside at the Home! The funds raised by this Benefit Ride are used by the residents for needed items that individuals’ insurance plans do not cover (i.e. winter coats, electric razors, etc.). The Fallen Saints Motorcycle Club, Ft. Williams Chapter members are all veterans and is centered on riding to represent the fallen soldiers who have paid the price for freedom. The club is often involved with similar fundraising rides for veteran related organizations. The men and women in the club come together to raise money for veterans in their communities.

Texto completo: BETHEL — Evan LeConey (Class of 2020) has been chosen to perform in the Maine Jazz All State Music Festival! Evan’s audition process for this group was formidable as he had to improvise (Scat) a melody and stretch his learning beyond his comfort zone. The Jazz All State Choir only accepted 7 other Basses out of their 32 member ensemble, so competition was tight.
He will be performing January 4, 2020, at Bangor High School along with the most talented young Jazz artists in the State of Maine.
Experiences at this level of competition carry with a student wherever they go in life.

FARMINGTON — Town authorities held a news conference at the fire station Thursday to express thanks for the support they have received the past six weeks after a deadly propane explosion.
“As you know we have had firefighters from throughout state coming in and assisting us with coverage 24/7,” acting Fire Chief Tim Hardy said. “Today marks the first day that we are going back to some type of what we call a new normal, and as we work forward we will be adjusting to that new normal.”
About 80 fire departments stepped in to help cover Farmington after the Sept. 16 explosion at LEAP Inc.’s central offices on Farmington Falls Road. Capt. Michael A. Bell, 68, was killed and six other firefighters and LEAP maintenance supervisor Larry Lord, 61, of Jay were critically or seriously injured. The firefighters have been released from medical facilities, while Lord remains in serious condition at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
The investigation continues into what caused some of the 400 gallons of propane in a storage tank to leak from a line under the parking lot into the building and what sparked the explosion, Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety said Thursday.
“I want to say thank you to the overwhelming support that we’ve had not only throughout the area here but throughout the state, and also we received a lot of support across the country,” Hardy said.
Three of the injured firefighters, Deputy Chief S. Clyde Ross, 82, Capt. Tim “TD” Hardy, 40, and firefighter Joseph Hastings, 24, have returned to work at the department. It is Hardy’s and Hastings’ second week back.
Firefighters come in daily to see them, which is a real morale booster, acting Chief Hardy said.
Chief Terry Bell, 63, Capt. Scott Baxter, 37, and his father, firefighter Ted Baxter, 64, are recovering.
There is no time frame for when Bell will return to work, Hardy said, but added that Bell is hoping to return by the end of this year.
As the department goes through the process of recovery, he said, “it will not be complete until we get Larry Lord home.
<img class="wp-image-11654163 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/SJ.FARffrdpresscon6P.110119-300x213.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="213" />
Both Lord and the LEAP family have become part of the department’s family, Hardy said.
Hardy, Town Manager Richard Davis and Deputy Police Chief Shane Cote addressed reporters.
“We are honored to have you here as we have been honored to have the assistance of more than 80 fire departments around the state of Maine as we are getting through this period of recovery,” Davis said. “I cannot express enough my gratitude for all the assistance and support we have received from these departments, from the residents of Farmington and other surrounding communities around the state of Maine, and businesses who have supported our firefighters with food and words of encouragement and condolences.
“We are extremely grateful and will be forever in the debt of these people and as we move forward we will keep them certainly in mind as well as our recovering firefighters who are doing well,” he said. “We are very supportive of them and we want to keep, also in our thoughts and prayers, Larry Lord and the family of Mr. Lord as he recovers from his grievous injuries caused by this very unfortunate and tragic incident.”
Cote said they are glad to have the firefighters home. The last injured firefighter, Capt. Baxter, returned from a rehabilitation center in Portland on Tuesday.
“We work very closely with all the first responders in Farmington … Hopefully Larry can come home soon,” Cote said.
He thanked all the agencies that have helped the fire department, police department and emergency medical responders who have helped the town in the past six weeks.
Several firefighters, including Capt. Hardy, Ross and Hastings, stood behind acting Chief Hardy as he spoke. Franklin County Deputy Emergency Agency Director Amanda Simoneau, Davis and Cote were also behind him. Hardy referred to them as part of the team.
“We have worked very well in the past and we will continue to do so as we go and continue through this recovery,” Hardy said. “As has been indicated before, our thoughts and prayers are truly with Larry Lord and his family but our thoughts and prayers also continue with Capt. Bell’s wife and her family and assisting her and her family through this process. We are in constant contact with them. They are over here at the station periodically visiting us, which is a big morale booster for all of us.”
Hardy also thanked the media for their professionalism and caring as they covered this story.
“We really appreciate that … especially nowadays as we see what is going on in other parts of the world,” he said.
“This has been a tragic event, and still is, but it has brought a lot of us closer,” he said. “I think a lot closer, and we regained and developed some very good new and close relationships throughout the state of Maine and throughout the country.”
Hardy said, “We have a fantastic mutual aid sytem with our fire departments so as we can continue to recover from this we will be working very closely with them. We will get through this as we stated before. Every day we are making very positive progress.
“I think we have all known over the years the firefighting family or brotherhood, however, you want to call it, has always been there for each other,” he continued. “This is really above and beyond any of my expectations. We’ve worked with a lot of these follks over the years at different functions and trainings and activities throughout the state. As I said, this, at least for me, has really has been fantastic and overwhelming and we greatly appreciate everything that everybody is doing and has done. They have indicated to us if we have any needs as we go through this recovery that they are here to continue to support us.”
It has been amazing the distances the fire departments and firefighters traveled and “left their families and work to come here and support us,” Hardy said.
In closing, he again thanked the people of Farmington and surrounding communities for supporting them.

Texto completo: MAINE — Girl Scouts of Maine (GSME) announces that it will host New Member Sign-Up events for potential members and volunteers at locations throughout the state every month. Below is a list of events in your area.
These events will bring together girls from kindergarten through third grade and their caregivers, and allow them to discover why Girl Scouting is important to the development of girls, how it relates to the success of young women today, and the important role that adults play.
“Girl Scouts helps girls develop their full potential,” says Joanne Crepeau, CEO of Girl Scouts of Maine. “When a girl becomes a Girl Scout, she grows into a young woman who is self-confident, strong and compassionate. She learns how to build and maintain healthy relationships. She becomes more aware of the world around her and uses her skills and talents to make her world a better place.”
These New Member Sign-Up events are just some of the many events that GSME will be holding this year. Here is the event in your area:

Texto completo: PORTLAND — As influenza activity picks up this fall, the American Red Cross is urging healthy donors of all blood types to give blood or platelets to ensure a strong blood supply for patients in need. Blood and platelets can only be given by donors who are feeling well.
Having had the flu shot doesn’t affect blood donation eligibility. One way that we can maintain health is to get a flu vaccine each fall. There is no waiting period to give blood or platelets after receiving a flu shot as long as the donor is symptom-free and fever-free.
For those that have the flu, it is important to wait until they no longer exhibit flu symptoms, have recovered completely and feel well before attempting to donate. Donors must feel healthy and well on the day of donation.
All blood types are needed now! Donors of all blood types, especially platelet donors and those with type O blood, are urged to give now to ensure a stable supply this fall. Stay healthy this flu season and make an appointment to donate blood by downloading the free Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or enabling the Blood Donor Skill on any Alexa Echo device.
Donors living in Southern Maine have the opportunity to give blood or platelets at nearby Red Cross Blood Donation Centers. For hours of operation and to make an appointment, view the Portland and Lewiston Red Cross Blood Donation Center information on RedCrossBlood.org.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Police arrested a local man Thursday and charged him in a hit-and-run incident on Lisbon Street early Sunday morning that critically injured a pedestrian.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-11657219" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/Brad-Johnson-300x146.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="146" />
Brad Johnson, 40, was charged with leaving the scene of an accident involving serious bodily injury or death, a Class C felony punishable by up to five years in prison. An additional charge of falsifying physical evidence is a Class D misdemeanor that carries a maximum 364-day jail sentence.
Police said the incident happened at about 1:49 a.m. Sunday in the southbound lane of Lisbon Street or Route 196. Police received a call Sunday reporting a man with “significant” injuries clearly caused by being struck by a vehicle that had fled the scene.
Jason Stratton, 31, of Lewiston was rushed to Central Maine Medical Center by ambulance where he underwent emergency surgery. He has remained there with serious injuries, police said.
According to his sister, Sarah Stutler, of Lewiston, Stratton was in a medically induced coma in serious condition Thursday.
Lt. David St. Pierre said several detectives and officers “worked tirelessly since the accident, investigating and following up on several leads and searching for any and all potential evidence.”

Police arrested Johnson shortly after 3 p.m. Thursday at his business, Brad’s Precision Auto Repair, at 144 Riverside Drive in Auburn. He was taken to Androscoggin County Jail in Auburn.
Johnson’s gray Toyota Tundra pickup truck was found and seized as part of an ongoing investigation.

Backyard Reflections / Beaked Hazelnut

Texto completo: Walking in the woods is my favorite activity during these cool fall days. I love watching the maples starting to turn and the spikes of the pin oak against a deep blue sky. This time of the year I am also feasting my eyes on all the wild berries. Hobble bush has lush clusters of red fruit, as do the wild cherries. The wild Elderberry stems are drooping with clusters of purplish blue – black berries. Around the brook the witch hazel has formed tight budded clusters that will soon bear delicate yellow threaded flowers.
I have a particular fondness for understory trees after living in New Mexico where the understory is cut away to prevent forest fires. The beaked hazelnut is one of my favorite bush –like trees. And this year these trees are full of ripening nuts that will feed many forest creatures. The nut capsules I see are fuzzy and found in clumps of two (if you pick them they can irritate your skin). They are rich in protein and fat and favorites of red squirrels and chipmunks. They are also a preferred food source of ruffed grouse, ring-necked pheasant, hairy woodpecker and blue jay. The buds in winter and catkins in spring are a valuable protein source for ruffed grouse, snowshoe hare and American woodcock. Snowshoe hare heavily browse young shoots during the winter. Hazelnuts are also one of the most important and preferred bear foods in northeastern Minnesota. Across North America, availability of nuts and acorns (hard mast) is a major predictor of Black bear growth and reproductive success. Although adult trees produce nuts on a yearly basis, the crops are not always abundant. During years when they are black bears gain extra weight, nuisance activity is infrequent, fewer bears go to hunters’ baits, and pregnant females go on to produce healthy surviving cubs. Countless scientific studies have shown that Black bears prefer the diversity of wild foods as long as they are available.
This tree grows in woodlands and forest edges and supposedly can reach a height of 26 feet although the ones I see are smaller seeming to prefer some shade. The stems have smooth gray bark and the leaves are green, coarsely toothed and oval shaped with hairy undersides. The male flowers are distinctive catkins that form in the fall and pollinate tiny red female flowers the following spring. The fruits mature over the summer into nuts that are enclosed in a husk with a tubular extension that some say looks like a beak. This hazel is the hardiest of all the hazelnut species tolerating temperatures of minus 50 degrees in northernmost areas.
Because I have so few of these trees on my property, I am collecting ripening nuts to plant here, although I understand that germination rate is low. Beaked hazelnuts prefer a rich sandy-clay loam but will sprout in less desirable soil. I see these understory trees growing under maples, birch and other hardwoods along the roadsides but they need light to produce nuts so an open canopy is desirable. Like many shrubs, hazelnut plays an important role in nutrient cycling within a forest. Its leaves are rich in calcium and manganese and help fertilize nearby trees and other plants. The tree is useful for plantings in areas where some shade and protection are available. The nuts are tasty and in the past were much more commonly eaten by people especially in Northern Maine. Since the shrub does not tolerate much wind, hazelnut grows poorly in open windbreaks, but can be used along stream -banks.

Texto completo: REGION — Election Day, Nov. 5, offers several issues for Bethel-area voters to consider, depending on the town in which they reside.
There will be a district-wide referendum vote on a proposed $2.4 million new SAD 44 bus garage.
Area polling hours for Nov. 5
Town Location Hours
Albany Town House 10 a.m.- 8 p.m.
Andover Town Hall 8 a.m. – 8 p.m.
Bethel CPS gym 8 a.m. – 8 p.m.
Gilead Town Hall 10 a.m. – 8 p.m.
Greenwood Legion Hall 8 a.m. – 8 p.m.
Hanover Town Office 10 a.m. – 8 p.m.
Newry Town Office 8 a.m. – 8 p.m.
Woodstock Town Office 8 a.m. – 8 p.m.
The School Board voted narrowly 8-6 in August in favor of holding a referendum, and the proposal has been the subject of controversy since.
The proposal favored by the board would build a garage on district land next to the Telstar Regional High School complex on Route 26. It would have two bus bays that measure 9,500 square feet.
The current garage is 7,350 square feet and was built in the 1920s, and a recent report by a structural engineer revealed it has failing masonry and that the roof needs shoring up. Any snowfall this winter exceeding a foot would have to be removed immediately, according to the report.
Those in favor have spoken on the worsening conditions of the current facility and noted that the new garage would also have a bus lift, which would make work more efficient and safer. Workers are currently lifting 150-pound bus parts from an awkward position on the garage floor.
People opposed to the project said they were concerned about the overall cost. Some thought the board should have considered renovating the former Chadbourne Tree Farms garage on Route 26 in Bethel, an option estimated to also cost about $2.4 million. The Chadbourne renovation would provide two bays, 9,200 square feet of renovated space and 1,800 feet of new construction.
SAD 44 Building and Grounds Director Ron Deegan noted that numerous codes are not up to date at the Chadbourne garage and that it does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
But some opponents favor defeating the Telstar plan and instead forming an independent citizen committee to study other options.
Marijuana
A vote on proposed medical and recreational marijuana ordinances will take place in Newry on Nov. 5.
There have been two public hearings on the proposed ordinances. There was a second hearing last week because the selectboard made changes to the proposal after the first hearing in August.
Newry’s proposed ordinances are for retail facilities only, not for growing or other activities.
Copies of the ordinances can be viewed at the Newry Town Office.
Referendum
All voters will consider the following statewide referendum questions:
Question 1: Bond Issue
An Act To Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue To Improve Highways, Bridges and Multimodal Facilities
Do you favor a $105,000,000 bond issue to build or improve roads, bridges, railroads, airports, transit and ports and make other transportation investments, to be used to match an estimated $137,000,000 in federal and other funds?
Question 2: Constitutional Amendment
RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine Concerning Alternative Signatures Made by Persons with Disabilities
Do you favor amending the Constitution of Maine to allow persons with disabilities to sign petitions in an alternative manner as authorized by the Legislature?

Texto completo: <img class="size-medium wp-image-11493591" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/IMG_1078-300x253.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="253" />
WOODSTOCK — There are three types of horses that require rescue, according to Sarah Page. The first are owner surrenders: due to family loss, changes in personal or economic circumstances, the animal needs to be removed/re-homed. The second type is the horse that has already been sold or re-homed but ends up shipped to a feedlot or auction lot. And the third type is the horse that has been seized, usually from circumstances of neglect or abuse, and is in poor–or worse–health.
Any type of horse will find a welcoming haven at the Whole Horse Experience & Educational Equine Sanctuary, the rescue that Page and her partner Gary Clegg started five years ago. Twenty-three horses currently call the sanctuary home; close to half of them are long-term to permanent residents.
“We take in what could be termed problem kids, the ones that find themselves unwanted,” Page said. “Everyone loves the idea of rehabbing and adopting, but not everyone can take on projects that are economically challenging.”
Some of the horses have chronic health issues that require time and money. Others have challenging personalities. Still others are working breeds like drafts or Thoroughbreds that tend to be less popular among horse hobbyists.
“We took in a retired carriage horse from New York after he retired in 2014,” Page said. “He has bladder issues, benign tumors that require $300 a month in medications. Beyond that, I regularly tend to his legs so that he doesn’t get infections from urine scald, and then he needs additional procedures every six months or so to remove sediment from his bladder.”
<img class="wp-image-11492331 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/IMG_1080.jpg" alt="" width="953" height="1000" />
Then there is Smoky, a gelding who reportedly couldn’t be handled.
“His owner had died and her husband decided to surrender him,” Page explained. “Yes, he was temperamental, he had lost his person.”
But Page and Clegg accepted Smoky and he has come a long way. They worked with him on his behavior issues and put him in an environment where his own peers keep him in check.
“He can be a bit of bully with other horses. So he lives with the larger draft horses, they put him in his place when he needs it.”
Page grew up in Bethel and her love of horses led her to work in various stable capacities around New England. When she returned to Maine in 2012 the intent was to start a riding stable of her own, not a rescue and sanctuary.
“In 2014 we began looking for horses to acquire for lessons and trail riding,” Page said. “And what we found were animals at auctions, bound for meat markets. They were being purchased as short sales and then flipped.”
Over 100,000 U.S. horses end up in markets for human consumption in both Canada and Mexico. Europe, too, is a primary export market. And according to Page, Japan is perhaps the most notorious buyer of exported auction horses.
“In Japan, fresh horse meat is a delicacy. So several horses are jammed into wooden crates, and shipped live across the Pacific. They can go up to 36 hours without light, food or water.”
The realization made the pair change their plans. Rather than purchasing a few animals to promote recreation to horse lovers, Page and Clegg resolved to rescue horses for either shorter-term respite before being adopted to new homes, or permanent sanctuary with them.
“We take in local surrenders,” Page said. “Last fall I think we had 12 calls from locals. So far this fall, I’ve had at least 10. But we’ve hauled horses at auction in from as far away as Pennsylvania, New Jersey. And they are in all states of health.”
Page laments that the need for equine rescue far outnumbers active rescuers. She has accepted horses that other rescues have denied because they would be hard to rehab or adopt out, and taken horses off struggling rescues’ hands that arrived in compromised conditions. On the other end of the spectrum, there are marketing-savvy rescue organizations that succeed in fundraising but have such narrow selection practices that many horses are left on the outside looking in.
“I’ve heard of one rescue talking about rehabbing and adopting out 11 horses in a year,” said Page. “Yet it’s a multi-million dollar facility with four dozen stalls. All those resources and only 11 horses?”
The Whole Horse Experience & Educational Equine Sanctuary sits on 150 acres, with about 30 of that being pastureland. Page had her eye on the property with its circa 1786 farmhouse for a few years before she and Clegg were able to buy it.
“For six years it just sat vacant. We inquired but it wasn’t available,” Page said. When the property was finally listed in 2017 their real estate agent let them know and they immediately made an offer. But it had been vacant so long that it wasn’t inhabitable.
“The plumbing was gone, thieves stripped all the copper,” said Page. “The heating system had frozen and cracked. All the lines to the septic system were destroyed. The electrical, it was all 110 power. And it had been a hoarder’s house. It was full, even the dishwasher still had dirty dishes in it.”
It took the pair a year to make the house liveable. Clegg, a building contractor, had to completely rehab and renovate it. But the land was enough to at least give the horses they’d already started rescuing an immediate place to call home. As time and funds permit, pastures continue to expand across the open fields.
By day Clegg and Page work the farm and care for their charges. A visit to the sanctuary’s Facebook page shows before and after images of how rescued horses’ quality of life improves. Many arrive thin and needy. Some require immediate veterinary care while others must receive long-term medical treatments. Page tells each horse’s individual story on her Facebook/WholeHorseSanctuary/ page.
<img class="wp-image-11492647 size-large" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/IMG_1086-1024x651.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="651" />
Typically, the urgent (such as veterinary care) supersedes the important (fundraising). The cost for round-bale hay alone runs more than $20,000 a year. The vet bills never cease. Page noted that she has an anonymous donor offering a $1,000 pledge to match donations up to that amount during the month of November. She has collected about a third of the necessary funds to get the match.
Currently Page and Clegg have two volunteers that come one day a week. They have had as many as five extra set of hands to help, but the work can be hard. The couple goes it alone most days. Clegg also works as a property manager for a condominium group and Page works at a pub in Bethel 4-5 nights a week.
Page has no specific veterinarian to rely on day-to-day. Her favorite vet is the one most readily available and sometimes that means an ailing horse has to be loaded up and hauled up to two hours to get the care it needs. If something as serious as surgery is called for, expense is also a factor.
“Some procedures, we go to a clinic in Rochester, New Hampshire,” Page said. “They might charge $300 for something that would cost $800 locally.”
<img class="wp-image-11492559 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/IMG_1092-290x300.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="300" />
The most recent vet emergency involved Maisie, a 17.2 hand retired Thoroughbred. He smacked his head Thursday night and required stitches. By Friday he was recovering nicely, sporting a series of purple butterfly bandages on his forehead.
“Now Maisie would make someone a great horse,” Page said, noting that his size and breed reputation are strikes against him. “He had a successful career, winning about $360,000 in prize money. He is a Storm Cat grandson. But it’s hard to find a good home for a Thoroughbred.”
After being retired, Maisie ended up as a summer camp lesson horse and was in danger of going to auction. One of the directors at the camp stepped in and paid off his lease. And so for now and maybe forever, Maisie can count himself as one of the lucky horses who calls Whole Horse Experience & Educational Equine Sanctuary home.

Clark County automotive businesses slowly recuperating after GM strike

Texto completo: Businesses in Clark County that rely on parts from General Motors are slowly recuperating following the end of a six-week strike called against the automotive company.
Workers returned to GM facilities across the country this week after members of the United Auto Workers union voted to approve a new deal with GM.
The strike affected the distribution of vehicle parts to Clark County dealerships that sell GM brands, automotive shops that work on those vehicles and companies such as Navistar that make GM trucks and vans in Springfield.
However, production at Navistar’s Springfield plant is scheduled to resume Monday, said Chris Blizard, the president of UAW Local 402. His union represents assembly workers and those in skilled trades that work at the plant.
Workers at several GM facilities that supply those parts participated in the strike called amid contract negotiations between their union and the company. For Navistar it meant shutting down production last month at its local assembly plant after parts needed to build truck cabs become scarce.
The move to stop production at the plant caused about 1,400 Navistar assembly workers in Springfield to be temporarily out of work. Now, those workers are expected to return to the facility on Monday.
The company resumed production on its main line on Oct. 7 to focus on its international medium-duty commercial trucks but only operated for a week before shutting down again.
Blizard estimated that 300 workers from Navistar’s paint department and cab line will be called back this week to prepare the assembly lines for production. He said representatives of Navistar expect the Springfield plant to receive parts for trucks and vans throughout this week.
Navistar builds medium-duty commercial trucks, including those for GM, on its main line there and GM cutaway vans on its line two. A facility in Missouri that makes cabs for those vans participated in the strike, Blizard said.
“It will be great to have all our people back working full time again,” Blizard said.
However, representatives of Navistar’s Truck Specialty Center in Springfield announced last week that about 40 people will be temporarily out of work this week. Those workers modify Navistar trucks for customers.
With trucks about to be built again at the assembly plant, it is unclear how soon those workers will return. Representatives of the specialty center previously estimated that those workers would be out for two to three weeks.
Blizard said those workers could return sooner depending on how many trucks will be ready for them once the assembly lines resume production.
Area dealerships and automotive shops have also started to receive needed parts from GM suppliers.
Scott Hennigan, who co-owns Maine’s Collision Repair & Body Shop in Springfield, said though some parts have trickled in this week, it could take up to two weeks before parts become readily available.
Hennigan said his shop receives parts for GM vehicles from the Dayton-based dealership Reichard Buick GMC. During the strike, the shortage in parts left his employees unable to repair vehicles that required GM parts.
Though the shop was able to complete some of those repairs this week, he estimates that there are still four to five vehicles at the shop that cannot be driven until more parts come in.
He added that there are also 10 to 15 more vehicles that are currently drivable, but cannot be repaired due to the lack of certain parts.
“We did not lose that work. We just could not get to it until we got the parts. That work did not go away, instead it was delayed,” Hennigan said.
Karen Thokey, the parts director for Jeff Wyler Springfield Chevrolet, said they received a large shipment of specialty and stock parts this week. During the strike, she said common stock parts were becoming hard to find and shipments were unpredictable.
“Things are starting to go back to normal,” she said, noting that shipments are now more frequent and depleted inventory stocks are slowing being built back up again.

Meet the two Democrats who broke with their party on impeachment

Two Democrats in competitive districts broke with their party on Thursday’s impeachment resolution in the House — a reminder of how complicated the politics of impeachment may be in seats in conservative parts of the country that Democrats want to hold in 2020.
Minnesota’s Collin C. Peterson and New Jersey’s Jeff Van Drew were the only two House Democrats to vote against the resolution, which lays out procedures that will govern the public portion of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. It was adopted 232-196 without any Republican support.
“Collin would always say, ‘It’s just going to be you and me,’ and I said, ‘Nah, there might be more people.’ But it was just him and me,” Van Drew told reporters after the vote.
Republicans used the two Democratic members to argue that the vote against the impeachment resolution was bipartisan and called on Democrats to turn over all the transcripts of closed-door interviews led by the Intelligence Committee.
“In a way, you can say congratulations to Nancy Pelosi. She wanted a bipartisan vote on her impeachment inquiry resolution. She got it,” New York Rep. Lee Zeldin said at a GOP press conference after the vote.
In some ways, Peterson and Van Drew, who are both members of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, couldn’t be more different. Peterson is from Minnesota farm country and has been in the House since 1991. Van Drew, a dapper dentist from Cape May, is a freshman.
Both are trying to defend seats that Trump carried in 2016, although Peterson’s terrain is much more sympathetic to the president than Van Drew’s.
Peterson has voted with Trump nearly 24 percent of the time this year — more than any other Democrat in the House, according to CQ’s Vote Watch. Van Drew has sided with the president on legislation just 4 percent of the time.
A handful of Van Drew’s fellow freshmen from Trump districts had long held out on supporting an impeachment inquiry, but all of them voted for Thursday’s resolution.
Van Drew and Peterson weren’t moved.
“Without support from Senate Republicans, going down this path is a mistake,” Peterson said in a statement after the vote.
He criticized the way his party is running the impeachment inquiry.
“I have some serious concerns with the way the closed-door depositions were run, and am skeptical that we will have a process that is open, transparent and fair,” Peterson said.
But he also took a shot at Republicans for trying to conflate Thursday’s vote with a vote for impeachment itself.
Van Drew acknowledges that Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden was inappropriate. But speaking to reporters after the vote, he said that because there was no investigation of Biden and the U.S. did eventually send the congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine, it doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment. But Van Drew is leaving the door open to supporting impeachment if he sees something that is “really treasonous or truly a high crime.”
“Do you know who the good impeachers are?” Van Drew asked reporters. “The voters.”
The former New Jersey state senator said he isn’t hearing much from voters about impeachment, one way or the other.
“I hear from people who want to talk about everything but,” he said. Minutes after the vote, Van Drew’s campaign sent out a fundraising email about health care.
Having won a four-way primary in 2018, Van Drew said he isn’t worried about his vote opening him up to a primary challenge from the left.
Republicans are targeting both Democrats in 2020.
Trump carried Van Drew’s southern New Jersey district by just shy of 5 points in 2016, though Democrat Barack Obama carried it in both 2008 and 2012. Republican Rep. Frank A. LoBiondo decided not to seek reelection in 2018, and Van Drew won the open 2nd District seat by nearly 8 points. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates his reelection Tilts Democratic.
Trump carried Peterson’s district by a much bigger margin — 31 points. Peterson, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, has a strong brand in the rural 7th District. As one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, who didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016, he’s widely regarded as the last person from his party who can hold the seat. He hasn’t yet announced whether he’s running for a 16th term.
If he does run, he may not be able to outrun the shifting partisan dynamics of his district. He only narrowly defeated an underfunded GOP challenger who ran the past two cycles. Next year, he’s likely facing a more formidable opponent in former Minnesota Lt. Gov. Michelle Fischbach. Inside Elections rates his race Leans Democratic.
GOP goes on offense
Van Drew and Peterson’s votes did shield them from a fresh round of digital ads slamming Democrats for the impeachment inquiry vote.
The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House GOP leadership, launched digital ads in 29 Democratic districts, with the text, “Your member of Congress just voted for impeachment!” The ads direct viewers to a website encouraging them to sign a petition to stop the impeachment inquiry.
All 29 are seats that Trump won in 2016. Van Drew and Peterson were the only two Democrats from Trump districts who were not targeted by the ads.
The ads underscored the complicated messaging for vulnerable Democrats when it comes to impeachment. The vote Thursday involved the process for opening the impeachment inquiry, not whether Trump should ultimately be impeached.
Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden highlighted the distinction in a Wednesday statement ahead of the vote, saying that his support for the resolution “does not indicate that I am in favor of impeaching the president.”
“As I’ve said from the beginning, I will continue to treat these allegations with the gravity they deserve, and I refuse to prejudge the outcome,“ Golden said.
But that clarification hasn’t stopped Republicans from attacking Democrats like Golden who flipped House seats last fall and face competitive races in 2020. Trump carried Maine’s 2nd District by nearly 11 points in 2016 and Inside Elections rates the race Tilts Democratic.
Republicans cheered the vote Thursday as a sign that they are going to win back the House in 2020.
“The impeachment-obsessed Democrats just flushed their majority down the toilet,” National Republican Congressional Campaign spokesman Michael McAdams said.
But vulnerable Republicans could also face Democratic criticism for not breaking with their party on the vote. No Republicans voted to support opening the impeachment inquiry.
“Every Republican in Washington has to pick a side and state clearly whether they support getting the facts through a transparent process, or sweeping the truth under the rug,” a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman said ahead of Thursday’s vote.
Lindsey McPherson and Todd Ruger contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Delaware has no shortage of ghosts and haunts to explore and ruminate on, as spooky season reaches its apex. From a tomb constantly ticking to a headless horseman, the stories, told hundreds of times through the years, don't lack creativity. Here is a list of some of the most notable Delaware tales.
Cape May-Lewes Ferry Terminal There have been at least a half dozen ghost sightings by the parking lot for the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, Delaware folklore expert Ed Okonowicz told The News Journal in 2015.
The parking lot is paved over a graveyard with more than 500 colonial-era sailors.
Sailors who died on ships journeying between Maine and Georgia would be tossed overboard and wash up on the beach, or so the tale goes.
The Welsh Tract Church in Newark A headless horseman from the Revolutionary War haunts a church on Welsh Tract Road in Newark, according to Okonowicz.
During the only Revolutionary War battle fought in Delaware at Cooch's Bridge, a cannonball took off the head of an American soldier named Charlie Miller as he was riding through the cemetery next to the church.
The cannonball supposedly knocked a hole in the wall of the church. An outline of where the church was repaired is visible to this day and Miller is said to still ride his horse along Welsh Tract Road at night.
Rockwood Mansion A ghost named Mary is among many believed to haunt the Rockwood Mansion. Mary lived at Rockwood until she was 100 and died in the mansion.
In 2006, Rockwood's museum director Philip Nord told The News Journal visitors often smell perfume and see a woman in what was Mary's room. Nord said he was once spooked when, while at an evening Rockwood program, he felt like he was hit by a cold and wet cloud.
The Ticking Tomb at the London Tract Church in Landenberg, Pennsylvania If you put your head against a certain tombstone at the London Tract Church in the middle of White Clay Creek State Park, you can allegedly hear eerie ticking sounds.
While Charles Mason was in Delaware working on his famous line with Jeremiah Dixon, he finished building a chronometer (a time-keeping device).
When Dixon and Mason went to the fish market, leaving the device in their tent "a fatty little kid" ate everything in the tent, including the chronometer, according to a 2006 News Journal story.
The fat kid grew up to be a clockmaker, the story goes, and was buried in the graveyard at the London Tract Church.
With your head against his tombstone, you can hear the ticking of Mason's chronometer.
Others claim the ticking sound is the heart of a local settler yearning for a long-lost Indian lover or simply constant dripping water, according to a 2004 News Journal story.
The Addy Sea Inn in Bethany Beach The Addy Sea, a small Bethany Beach inn, is listed in "The National Directory of Haunted Places," a book by Dennis William Hauck published in 1994.
The most notable haunt is a copper bathtub in Room 1 that sometimes shakes violently.
"Ghostly organ music" can be heard from Room 6.
"I'm not afraid of ghosts," Frances Gravatte, an innkeeper at Addy Sea, told The News Journal in 1994.
"I'm more afraid of human beings, of people breaking in. Ghosts are friendly."
Central Hotel on Clinton Street in Delaware City A TV show called "Psychic Detectives" visited the former hotel in 2006 and said a ghost, who had been a maid at the hotel in the early 1800s is haunting it, according to a 2007 News Journal story.
In 2012, a pair of investors bought the four-story red brick building for about $465,000. Built in 1830, it now serves as the American Birding Association's headquarters.
The Governor's Mansion in Dover The governor's mansion in Dover, also known as the Woodburn Mansion, is home to four ghosts, according to a 2006 News Journal story.
Among the many tales: If you leave wine out, a little girl in a gingham dress will empty the glass overnight.
Fort Delaware Haunted Rooms America, a website that ranks haunted places nationwide, says Fort Delaware is the most haunted site in Delaware.
Fort Delaware was built in 1848 on Pea Patch Island near Delaware City. It was decommissioned in 1943.
At one point there were more than 16,000 people and prisoners on the island.
Now, the only beings that remain are ghosts, or so the tale goes.
George Constant, the historical manager of Fort Delaware, told The News Journal in 2006 that once historical interpreters saw a woman in work clothes walk straight through a wall from kitchen to pantry.

Former players surprise Miranda

Texto completo: It was a surprise party four decades in the making.
As Brandywine High's field hockey team warmed up for its regular-season finale last Friday afternoon against visiting Laurel, a larger-than-usual crowd of fans began to arrive. By halftime, it numbered several hundred.
When the teams completed first-half play, Brandywine athletic director Rick Shea walked to the center of the field, where a portable speaker and microphone had been carted.
Willy Miranda, who certainly would have preferred to be discussing second-half strategy with his Bulldogs, was summoned there for a brief ceremony.
Bonnie Wilson, one of Miranda's former players and assistant coaches who had joined Shea, was handed the microphone.
"The deal is," she told Miranda, "we're all here for you."
Soon after, about 75 of Miranda's former players stepped forward onto the field.
It almost looked like the 1919 White Sox emerging from the Iowa corn in "Field of Dreams."
As they emerged en masse, including some who'd traveled from as far as Maine and California, the usually stoic Miranda put his hands to his face. The emotion of the moment overcame him and it was easy to see why.
"When they asked all the players who played for me to step on the field, I was really touched," Miranda said after the game. "You know me. I've done this for a long time. I don't really know how many wins I have or how many titles I won. I don't care about that.
"What I care about are the kids. They've kept me in this."
Miranda, 72, had decided this, his 38th season as Brandywine's field hockey coach, would be his last.
While the Bulldogs, 11-3-1 and Blue Hen Conference Flight B champions, lost Friday to Laurel 2-0, their season will continue in the Division II state tournament next week. The bracket will be announced Friday.
"I'm not surprised about the number of people who are here right now," Wilson, a 1995 Brandywine graduate who played field hockey at Salisbury University, said later, "because Willy Miranda has devoted his life to field hockey. He's given everything that he has. He is field hockey. He is Brandywine High School field hockey. That is Willy Miranda."
Having learned of Miranda's decision, former players – through Facebook and a barrage of text messages and emails – arranged to attend his final regular-season game. They wanted to give their former coach the send-off they felt he deserved.
A postgame gathering followed in the Brandywine gym.
"We all felt he never got the recognition that he deserved in the state," said Val Cohen, who graduated from Brandywine in 1999 and then played field hockey at James Madison University.
"A lot of it had to do with being a male coach. He had a rough time. People didn't always want to celebrate his successes. I think this was our way of saying 'Thank you for what you did for us. Thank you for what you did for field hockey.'"
Miranda, who also coached Wilmington High field hockey for four years before moving over to Brandywine in 1982, guided his teams to more than 450 wins over those 42 seasons. Brandywine reached four state championship games, winning the 1987 final and losing the 1983, 2007 and 2008 title games, all against Independent Conference schools.
When Miranda became Brandywine field hockey coach, Dickinson also had a male coach – Fred Dannaway.
This year he is one of seven male high school field hockey head coaches in Delaware.
"I remember going back to my first year of coaching and I didn't know anything about field hockey and the players taught me the game and I taught myself the game by going to Delaware," Miranda said, referring to the University of Delaware and its long-established program.
Miranda confirmed there was resentment in Delaware's rather insular high school field hockey world when he first took over and had success.
One of his main sources of information and inspiration was Karen Kohn, the Delaware Sports Hall of Famer who coached A.I. du Pont to 202 wins, eight conference titles and two state field hockey championships from 1966-1990.
"He expected a lot from us and we didn't want to let him down in a way you don't want to let your dad down," Cohen said. "We always knew he was behind us."
"He cares about his players tremendously," Wilson said. "I would call him my adopted dad actually because he's such an amazing role model and he's taught me everything I know about field hockey."
Miranda's late father, Willy Miranda Jr., was a slick-fielding shortstop from Cuba who played nine Major League Baseball seasons (1951-59). His son was born in Cuba before the family settled in Baltimore, where Miranda Jr. played his final five seasons with the Orioles. Son Willy was on the University of Delaware's 1970 baseball team that reached the College World Series.
After beginning his career as a teacher of various foreign languages in the early 1970s, Miranda also began coaching. Over the years, he has coached baseball, softball, girls basketball, swimming and girl lacrosse, with stops at many high schools including starting Brandywine's girls lacrosse team in 1994.
But field hockey has long been the sport with which Miranda has been most closely associated in Delaware.
"He really just dedicated his life to this," Cohen said. "We all knew that and saw his passion and he just made all of us want to play that much harder. He just really cared about us and the team and the sport, which is awesome for someone who had no experience in it."
Among Miranda's efforts on behalf of field hockey was creating the Turf Bowl in 1999. It annually brings high school teams from around the state to the University of Delaware's Rullo Stadium.
"I've been around for a while and I'm not gonna go away," said Miranda, who looks forward to more time with wife Stacey, daughter Alexis and his grandchildren. "I'm gonna support other programs and watch some hockey but I'm done. I'm done coaching."

Texto completo: Playoff football is upon us in Section 4.
Have a look at how the semifinals shape up.
Class AA Binghamton (4-4) at Corning (7-1), 7 p.m. Fri.: On the surface, it would appear quite the task for Binghamton to flip the script from the regular season. The Hawks visited Binghamton in Week 3 and dealt the Patriots a 48-21 setback.
However, Pats coach Mike Ramil vowed a different-looking team come Friday.
"We'll be all-on-board on defense, everybody," he said. "We're not looking to play 11 guys on offense, 11 guys on defense. Our best 11 will play defense and our best 11 will play offense. We're just doing it. We're going to do what we've got to do."
Said Ty Wooden, Patriots senior linebacker: "We're going to go in and compete. It'll be a hard, physical game but we're ready for it."
Horseheads (6-2) at Elmira (6-2), 1:30 Sat.: The Express had a six-game win streak end with last week's 8-0 loss to Corning. When the two first met, Elmira was a 34-38 winner Week 3 at Horseheads.
Final: Nov. 8 or 9 at higher seed.
Class A Section 4's lone Class A representatives, Vestal (1-7) and Union-Endicott (1-7) will play for the championship 7 p.m. Nov. 8 at U-E's Ty Cobb Stadium.
Class B Maine-Endwell (5-3) at Owego (6-2), 7 p.m. Friday: It'll be the second meeting between the two at Christy J. Valvo Stadium in three weeks. The Indians won the first, 37-20.
The Indians are unbeaten at home this season.
In the teams' first meeting, Owego's Ben Miller scored on two long pass plays — one to finish a hook-and-lateral — and as part of a sound defensive effort recovered a fumble to end M-E's first possession and begin the Indians' first scoring drive. Teammate Nick Wasyln passed for 137 yards and three scores, and rushed for 97 and two TDs.
Maine-Endwell's Ryan Brozovic rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown.
That came a week after the Indians had a four-game win streak halted with a 21-14 loss at Chenango Valley.
Maine-Endwell's other losses were dealt by Chenango Forks, ranked second in Class B, and Carthage, fifth in Class A.
Norwich (4-4) at Chenango Forks (8-0), 7 p.m. Friday: The Blue Devils have had two close calls this season. The first was a 28-21 getaway Week 3 at Norwich, where the Blue Devils trailed into the fourth quarter. The second came a week later, a 7-6 squeeze past Maine-Endwell.
Norwich quarterback Griffin Mills has rushed for 870 yards and 13 touchdowns, and passed for 882 and nine scores.
The Blue Devils, winners of 22 in a row at home, are 5-0 against Norwich from 2016 to the present. This season's outcome ended a string of three 49-point outings by Forks against the Purple Tornado.
Chenango Forks is three-time defending Class B champion, those titles following four in succession as a Class C member.
Final: 6 p.m. Nov. 9 at Johnson City.
Class C Windsor (6-2) at Newark Valley (5-3), 1:30 Sat.: That three-game Newark Valley skid to begin the season seems like a distant memory. The Cardinals' five successive victories include the last two away from home, at Fulton and at Groton.
A banged-up Newark Valley bunch allowed 126 points in those early losses. However, those opponents? In order, Windsor, Tioga and Susquehanna Valley, all playoff participants and the latter two top-ranked and unbeaten.
When the Black Knights and Cardinals met to open the season, Ethan Reed, a junior making his first varsity start, rushed for 216 yards and passed for 170 in Windsor's 44-29 win at NV. The Cardinals played without senior captain Caden Bennett, who was recovering from a leg injury. He leads the team with 735 rushing yards and five interceptions.
"(Bennett) is one of the best runners I've seen. That's huge for them," said Windsor coach Tim Hogan. "We have moved the ball well against them, but they moved the ball well against us. I don't like getting into shootouts like that. They've improved week by week, that's what I tell the kids. They have great coaches out there, Ted's a great coach, Brian's a great coach. They're three years removed from a state title, that didn't happen by chance."
Watkins Glen/O-M (4-4) at Susquehanna Valley (8-0), 3:30 Sat.: It'll be the Seneca Indians' second visit to SV this season, and they're hoping for something far more pleasurable than the first.
It was Sept. 6 when two interceptions and two fumble recoveries helped the Sabers to a 40-0 win_ the first of four shutouts this year. Logan Haskell passed for 141 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 73 yards and two more.
The Sabers have allowed 42 points this season. WG/O-M has allowed 40 or more in two games, though has surrendered six over the last three weekends.
Final: 3 p.m. Nov. 9 at Johnson City.
Class D Saturday at Johnson City
Greene (5-3) vs. Walton (7-1), noon: The teams met in Week 2 and Walton climbed out of a 14-point first-quarter deficit to win, 38-14. Walton quarterback Dylan Jacob had a touchdown run and a touchdown pass in that victory. ... Walton will bring a seven-game winning streak into this one as it attempts to reach a sectional final for the first time since falling, 19-18 to Tioga in 2011. The Warriors' last sectional title came in 2010 ... Jacob has thrown for 912 yards and 11 touchdowns and run for 372 and six TDs. Skylar Peasout has a team-best 460 rushing yards and Kaylieb Stanton leads the team with 12 rushing TDs. ... Greene is looking to advance to the sectional final for a second straight year. The Trojans lost, 36-7 to Tioga in last year's final. ... Greene clinched its playoff spot with a 26-8 victory over Moravia on Friday. Eighth-grader Drew Erickson completed 11 passes for 178 yards and two touchdowns. The elder Erickson, senior Nate, threw for 66 yards and a touchdown, rushed for 158 yards and a touchdown and caught two passes for 34 yards and a touchdown.
Delhi (6-2) vs. Tioga (8-0), 3 p.m.: The Tigers are in search of their eighth sectional title in nine years, a stretch that includes the 2015 Class D state title. ... Senior quarterback Brady Worthing and sophomore running back Emmett Wood will be the focal points for Delhi's defense. Tioga has scored at least 42 points in its last six games. ... Both teams have played Walton this season, Tioga was a 23-20 winner in Week 1 and Delhi a 38-35 loser in Week 4. ... Running back Warren Pardee and quarterback Mike Griswold lead the Bulldogs.
Final: 7 p.m. Nov. 8 at Johnson City

Senior quarterback Brady Worthing and sophomore running back Emmett Wood will be the focal points for Delhi's defense. Tioga has scored at least 42 points in its last six games. ... Both teams have played Walton this season, Tioga was a 23-20 winner in Week 1 and Delhi a 38-35 loser in Week 4. ... Running back Warren Pardee and quarterback Mike Griswold lead the Bulldogs.

Texto completo: Playoff football is upon us in Section 4.
Have a look at how the semifinals shape up.
Class AA Binghamton (4-4) at Corning (7-1), 7 p.m. Fri.: On the surface, it would appear quite the task for Binghamton to flip the script from the regular season. The Hawks visited Binghamton in Week 3 and dealt the Patriots a 48-21 setback.
However, Pats coach Mike Ramil vowed a different-looking team come Friday.
"We'll be all-on-board on defense, everybody," he said. "We're not looking to play 11 guys on offense, 11 guys on defense. Our best 11 will play defense and our best 11 will play offense. We're just doing it. We're going to do what we've got to do."
Said Ty Wooden, Patriots senior linebacker: "We're going to go in and compete. It'll be a hard, physical game but we're ready for it."
Horseheads (6-2) at Elmira (6-2), 1:30 Sat.: The Express had a six-game win streak end with last week's 8-0 loss to Corning. When the two first met, Elmira was a 34-38 winner Week 3 at Horseheads.
Final: Nov. 8 or 9 at higher seed.
Class A Section 4's lone Class A representatives, Vestal (1-7) and Union-Endicott (1-7) will play for the championship 7 p.m. Nov. 8 at U-E's Ty Cobb Stadium.
Class B Maine-Endwell (5-3) at Owego (6-2), 7 p.m. Friday: It'll be the second meeting between the two at Christy J. Valvo Stadium in three weeks. The Indians won the first, 37-20.
The Indians are unbeaten at home this season.
In the teams' first meeting, Owego's Ben Miller scored on two long pass plays — one to finish a hook-and-lateral — and as part of a sound defensive effort recovered a fumble to end M-E's first possession and begin the Indians' first scoring drive. Teammate Nick Wasyln passed for 137 yards and three scores, and rushed for 97 and two TDs.
Maine-Endwell's Ryan Brozovic rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown.
That came a week after the Indians had a four-game win streak halted with a 21-14 loss at Chenango Valley.
Maine-Endwell's other losses were dealt by Chenango Forks, ranked second in Class B, and Carthage, fifth in Class A.
Norwich (4-4) at Chenango Forks (8-0), 7 p.m. Friday: The Blue Devils have had two close calls this season. The first was a 28-21 getaway Week 3 at Norwich, where the Blue Devils trailed into the fourth quarter. The second came a week later, a 7-6 squeeze past Maine-Endwell.
Norwich quarterback Griffin Mills has rushed for 870 yards and 13 touchdowns, and passed for 882 and nine scores.
The Blue Devils, winners of 22 in a row at home, are 5-0 against Norwich from 2016 to the present. This season's outcome ended a string of three 49-point outings by Forks against the Purple Tornado.
Chenango Forks is three-time defending Class B champion, those titles following four in succession as a Class C member.
Final: 6 p.m. Nov. 9 at Johnson City.
Class C Windsor (6-2) at Newark Valley (5-3), 1:30 Sat.: That three-game Newark Valley skid to begin the season seems like a distant memory. The Cardinals' five successive victories include the last two away from home, at Fulton and at Groton.
A banged-up Newark Valley bunch allowed 126 points in those early losses. However, those opponents? In order, Windsor, Tioga and Susquehanna Valley, all playoff participants and the latter two top-ranked and unbeaten.
When the Black Knights and Cardinals met to open the season, Ethan Reed, a junior making his first varsity start, rushed for 216 yards and passed for 170 in Windsor's 44-29 win at NV. The Cardinals played without senior captain Caden Bennett, who was recovering from a leg injury. He leads the team with 735 rushing yards and five interceptions.
"(Bennett) is one of the best runners I've seen. That's huge for them," said Windsor coach Tim Hogan. "We have moved the ball well against them, but they moved the ball well against us. I don't like getting into shootouts like that. They've improved week by week, that's what I tell the kids. They have great coaches out there, Ted's a great coach, Brian's a great coach. They're three years removed from a state title, that didn't happen by chance."
Watkins Glen/O-M (4-4) at Susquehanna Valley (8-0), 3:30 Sat.: It'll be the Seneca Indians' second visit to SV this season, and they're hoping for something far more pleasurable than the first.
It was Sept. 6 when two interceptions and two fumble recoveries helped the Sabers to a 40-0 win_ the first of four shutouts this year. Logan Haskell passed for 141 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 73 yards and two more.
The Sabers have allowed 42 points this season. WG/O-M has allowed 40 or more in two games, though has surrendered six over the last three weekends.
Final: 3 p.m. Nov. 9 at Johnson City.
Class D Saturday at Johnson City
Greene (5-3) vs. Walton (7-1), noon: The teams met in Week 2 and Walton climbed out of a 14-point first-quarter deficit to win, 38-14. Walton quarterback Dylan Jacob had a touchdown run and a touchdown pass in that victory. ... Walton will bring a seven-game winning streak into this one as it attempts to reach a sectional final for the first time since falling, 19-18 to Tioga in 2011. The Warriors' last sectional title came in 2010 ... Jacob has thrown for 912 yards and 11 touchdowns and run for 372 and six TDs.

Delhi (6-2) vs. Tioga (8-0), 3 p.m.: The Tigers are in search of their eighth sectional title in nine years, a stretch that includes the 2015 Class D state title. ... Senior quarterback Brady Worthing and sophomore running back Emmett Wood will be the focal points for Delhi's defense. Tioga has scored at least 42 points in its last six games. ... Both teams have played Walton this season, Tioga was a 23-20 winner in Week 1 and Delhi a 38-35 loser in Week 4. ... Running back Warren Pardee and quarterback Mike Griswold lead the Bulldogs.

Senate upholds short-term health insurance

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Senate defeated a resolution Wednesday that would have overturned a Trump administration rule that lets states extend short-term health insurance policies for up to three years as a substitute for traditional coverage.
The short-term policies do not cover pre-existing conditions and require no minimal protections and place no limits on deductibles or copays.
Fifty-two senators, all Republicans, voted to leave the rule in place after a debate over how it would affect Americans. Only Maine Sen. Susan Collins broke ranks with her party.
Forty-three Senate Democrats, including Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota, voted to overturn the short-term extension rule. Five Democrats did not vote. Ironically, the five -- Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Michael Bennet -- are all running for the Democratic presidential nomination, where health care is a major issue.
Those who wanted to overturn the short-term extension rule said it left unsuspecting citizens open to financial ruin and was an attempt by the White House to undermine the individual insurance market set up by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Those who voted to uphold states' rights to short-term policy extensions said they provided an affordable alternative to more expensive ACA policies, which guarantee insurance coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions, as well as basic benefits.
The resolution to overturn the policy fell short, as did a similar measure last year that failed on a 50-50 vote.
Republicans picked up seats in the 2020 midterm elections that added to their majority in the Senate in the current vote.
The debate before Wednesday's vote was one of dual narratives.
Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said the resolution's supporters exaggerated the dangers of short-term policy extensions.
Overturning the extension rule would "take away a lower-cost option from 1.7 million" Americans, he said. Alexander credited the policy extensions with leading to reduced premiums, including a 20% reduction in rates in Minnesota.
Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, who forced the vote through a parliamentary maneuver, told the story of a constituent who bought a short-term policy as a cheaper alternative to ACA-approved policies. Warner said the man ended up with a $231,000 bill for back surgery because he was determined to have a pre-existing condition that did not qualify for benefits.
Fearing similar situations, many states, including Minnesota, have set time limits on short-term policies. In Minnesota, the stopgap policies can run no longer than six months with a single six-month renewal within two years.
Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare sells short-term limited duration policies. A company spokesman pointed to a Congressional Budget Office study that showed half a million people could end up uninsured if states are not allowed to extend short-term policies. But he also said short-term health insurance policies are supposed to bridge a gap in conventional health insurance and "are not intended to replace ACA coverage."
UnitedHealthcare, the spokesman said, encourages customers to understand the limits.
"The plans generally do not cover pregnancy, treatment of mental disorders or substance abuse," he said. "They are medically underwritten and can contain certain exclusions or limitations, including pre-existing condition limitations, that may not make them an appropriate choice."

For those inclined to spend part of their Halloween in front of the screen, there are plenty of treats to choose from.
• I don't want to be scared!: "Live With Kelly and Ryan" spoofs great viral moments in their annual costume party, with drop-ins from celebrity guests. (9 a.m., KSTP, Ch. 5)
• I want something for my kids that won't give them nightmares: Try 2015's "Goosebumps," a smart adaptation of the R.L. Stine books starring Jack Black. (6 p.m., FXM)
• I want a horror movie that will also make me think: It's rare that the genre gets award recognition, but 2017's "Get Out" broke out of the box thanks to its not-so-subtle social commentary. (6:30 p.m., FX)
• Give me some classic chills: 1935's "Bride of Frankenstein" is the perfect marriage between gothic horror and ill-fated romance with Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester doing the ultimate monster mash. (7 p.m., TCM)
• I need to spend the evening with Stephen King: Just when you thought it was safe to send in the clowns came the latest -- and most successful -- adaptation of "It," with Pennywise terrorizing small-town Maine. (7 p.m., TBS)
• Just scare me. Period: OK, OK. Calm down. You've got two no-frills choices: "Halloween" (6 p.m., AMC) or "Friday the 13th" (6 p.m., IFC). It's your funeral.

Texto completo: RETAIL
Closing sales for Olympia Sports stores start Friday Going-out-of-business sales are starting at 76 Olympia Sports stores on Friday, following a decision by apparel retailer JackRabbit to buy only roughly half of the Maine-based chain's outlets. Denver-based JackRabbit, owned by investment firm CriticalPoint Capital, acquired Westbrook, Maine-based Olympia from the Manganello family a few weeks ago. But JackRabbit only decided to take 75 stores, which it will continue to run under the Olympia banner. Liquidation agency SB360 Capital Partners LLC is orchestrating going-out-of-business sales at the rest of the stores, to sell off roughly $44 million worth of inventory, with discounts of up to 40 percent. The list of store closings includes 22 stores in Massachusetts, making it the state with the most shutdowns. It was unclear how many jobs would be affected by the closures. — JON CHESTO
COFFEE
Starbucks manager fired for calling police on two black men sues A regional Starbucks manager fired after the high-profile arrests of two black men at one of the coffee shops in Philadelphia has filed a wrongful termination suit against the company. Shannon Phillips accuses Starbucks of unfairly punishing white employees like her in response to the widely publicized arrests last year. Phillips said she lost her job after objecting to the company putting another white manager on leave. Starbucks denies Phillips's claims and said it will defend the suit, filed Monday in federal court in New Jersey. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested minutes after a manager called police to say they hadn't bought anything and were refusing to leave. The arrest prompted Starbucks officials to close stores nationwide to conduct racial bias training. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
FAST FOOD
Burger King chooses Impossible Burger The war for meatless hamburgers has a new casualty. Burger King is getting rid of its Morningstar Farms veggie burgers, which are supplied by Kellogg Co., after the US rollout of plant-based patties from Impossible Foods Inc. earlier this year. The Impossible Whopper helped the fast-food chain lure customers and boost sales in its latest quarter. Morningstar has lost market share as newer, trendier vegan options gain steam across the United States. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
RETAIL
Barneys assets to be sold to licensing company Barneys New York, the iconic luxury chain, said a bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of its assets to fashion licensing company Authentic Brands Group. The New York-based retailer said Thursday there's still a chance that rival bidders could come forward before the sale closes on Friday. Under the deal with Authentic Brands, Barneys New York will likely close most of its seven stores. Authentic Brands plans to license the Barneys name to Saks Fifth Avenue. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MORTGAGE
Rates rise for a third week Long-term mortgage rates rose this week for the third straight week, while remaining historically low and far below their levels of a year ago. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 3.78 percent from 3.75 percent last week. By contrast, the key average rate stood at 4.83 percent a year ago. The average rate on a 15-year mortgage ticked up to 3.19 percent from 3.18 percent last week. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
SPACE TOURISM
Virgin Galactic off to a far-from-soaring start Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. is getting off to a rocky start as the first publicly traded space-tourism company. The shares have yet to post a daily gain since adopting the SPCE ticker on Oct. 28, following a merger with a shell investment company that was already trading. Virgin Galactic tumbled 11 percent to $9.41, bringing this week's decline to 20 percent. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
INVESTMENTS
Florida health system latest to pull investments from Ken Fisher Ken Fisher saw Broward Health system in South Florida pull $93 million it had invested with his firm in response to lewd comments he made earlier this month. The board voted unanimously Wednesday evening to terminate its association with Fisher Investments and seek a new partner for its pension and investment assets. An array of pensions and firms have disclosed divesting almost $3.3 billion in the wake of Fisher's remarks at an industry conference. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
SOCIAL MEDIA
Facebook sued over advertising for financial services jobs Facebook Inc. was sued over claims that tailored advertising for financial services on the social media network discriminates against its older and female users who might be interested in products such as mortgages, personal loans, and insurance. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in San Francisco federal court, alleges Facebook helped financial services companies target users based on age and gender, resulting in younger people and men getting a disproportionate number of services and opportunities. Separately, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleges several Facebook advertisers broke the law by restricting job postings on the social network to people of certain ages or genders. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
AVIATION
Airbus continues to make gains as Boeing 737 Max groundings continue Airbus SE won an order from VietJet Aviation JSC for 20 of its latest A320neo narrow-body jets as the Asian carrier waits on deliveries of Boeing Co.'s grounded 737 Max. The deal is for the new A321XLR extra-long-range version of Airbus's workhorse plane, VietJet said in a statement Thursday, adding that it will become one of the first airlines in the world to receive a model unveiled at the Paris Air Show in June once deliveries start in 2023. VietJet's order, which is worth $2.8 billion at list prices, comes as Boeing struggles to get the rival Max flying again after the upgraded 737 was grounded following two deadly crashes in five months. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
FARMING
World's first industrial-scale maggot farm to expand to Calif. The company behind the world's first industrial-scale maggot farm based on organic waste plans to kick off its international expansion with a plant in California next year, taking advantage of two global problems: a shortage of protein and an abundance of trash. The plant in Jurupa Valley will be followed by operations in the Netherlands and Belgium, and is part of a drive by AgriProtein and a handful of competitors worldwide to tap into demand for high-grade protein for fish and poultry feed and offer a solution for the unwanted organic waste that cities and farms produce. The California operation will be modeled on the facility in Cape Town, which rears black soldier flies on about 250 metric tons of organic waste daily. The flies' larvae are then harvested to produce 4,000 metric tons of protein meal a year. At any one time, including eggs, there are 8.4 billion flies in the factory. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
HOTELS
London's iconic Ritz up for sale The billionaire Barclay brothers have kicked off the sale process of London's landmark Ritz hotel, giving the world's super wealthy a rare chance to reshape one of the UK capital's most storied properties. Though no guide price has yet been set, according to the people familiar with the sale, the Times of London newspaper has reported that the deal could fetch as much as 800 million pounds ($1 billion). — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Texto completo: This season had the makings of a down year for Providence before the team took the ice. After reaching the Frozen Four last season, the Friars not only lost their senior class to graduation, but also had several early departures for the pros.
One player who did return is sophomore Jack Dugan . After registering 10 goals and 29 assists in his freshman season, the Rochester, N.Y., native is leading the nation in points with four goals and 10 assists. Classmate Tyce Thompson is tied for second with five goals and six assists.
“Jack is a creative player. We love his creativity," said Providence coach Nate Leaman . “He just puts up points everywhere he's been. He's got a great knack for that."
Dugan was named Hockey East Player of the Week after scoring one goal and four assists in two games.
Among the seniors Providence lost was goalie Hayden Hawkey , who posted a 1.88 goals-against average and a .921 save precentage in 41 games last season, and played in 125 games in his four years with the Friars.
Filling that void has been Michael Lackey , a graduate transfer from Harvard. After spending the first three years with the Crimson backing up Merrick Madsen , Lackey got his opportunity last season, posting a .918 save percentage in 26 games as Harvard reached the NCAA Tournament.
“We're getting great goaltending. Top five in the country in goaltending, without a doubt," said Leaman. “For the amount of turnovers we've had, he's covered up a lot of them. He covers up a lot of mistakes. Michael has come in, he's poised, composed. He has the team's confidence. With a young team that's growing, that's what we're going to need to have a chance to be successful."
Providence is hoping to reach the NCAA Tournament for a seventh straight year, and is ranked No. 8 in the USCHO poll and No. 7 in USA Today's poll. The Friars (4-2) are coming off an overtime loss at home to UMass Lowell. That came one night after an impressive 6-2 win at Boston College. They will be home again this weekend, hosting Colgate on Friday before facing BC in a rematch on Saturday.
A lift for Lowell It was a good weekend for UMass Lowell. In addition to the win at Providence, the River Hawks rallied from a 3-0 deficit against Boston University the night before, and finished with a 3-3 tie to give them three league points on the weekend.
Goalie Tyler Wall stopped 73 of 78 shots to be named the conference's defensive player of the week. Next up is a trip to Vermont to face the Catamounts for a pair of games this weekend.
Familiar foe No. 10 Northeastern and No. 3 UMass are set for a home-and-home this weekend, by the end of which the teams will have faced each other three times already this season. The Huskies took the first matchup, 3-1, on Oct. 15 at Matthews Arena, the only blemish for the Minutemen.
Northeastern (4-1-1) is coming off of its first loss of the season, a 2-1 setback at St. Cloud State to end the weekend with a split. NU won the previous night, 4-1, with TJ Walsh registering a pair of assists. The freshman from Shrewsbury was named the conference's rookie of the week.
UMass enters the weekend 4-1, coming off a 4-1 win over AIC. After this weekend, the only way the two teams would face each other again would be in the postseason.
Top-10 battle There will be a top-10 battle on the women's side when No. 9 Boston University and No. 4 Northeastern meet in a home-and-home series this weekend, beginning Friday night at BU before shifting to Matthews Arena Saturday afternoon.
The Terriers (5-1-1) own a four-game winning streak after going on the road and sweeping Penn State last weekend. The Huskies (5-1) are coming off their first loss of the season, a 1-0 shutout on the road at the hands of Providence. Senior Clare Minnerath made a career-high 33 saves for the Friars (3-3-2) against a Northeastern squad that was averaging 4.6 goals a game.
Minnerath has allowed two or fewer goals in six of her eight starts, and she was named the conference's defensive player of the week for her efforts against NU.
Boston College freshman Hannah Bilka continued her torrid pace, scoring three goals last weekend, including the game-winner against Holy Cross. The other two scores were in a 3-3 tie against Maine, the last of which was the equalizer with less than two minutes remaining to give the No. 7 Eagles (7-0-1) a tie.
Bilka, who enters weekend games against UNH and Providence with 10 goals and four assists, was named the conference's rookie of the week.

Texto completo: BUCKSPORT, Maine -- With its iconic smokestack razed, the site of the former Verso Paper mill is about 95 percent ready for the development expected there over the next few years.
In addition to razing the mill's 360-foot smokestack Tuesday morning, mill site owner American Iron and Metal has removed more than 1 million square feet of building area since it began the demolition work in mid-2015, said Jeff McGlin, vice president of AIM Development USA.
AIM is still working on demolishing the last 250,000 square feet of building space it plans to take down, McGlin said.
[image id="2891435" size="full" pos="center" /]
What remains before the site is ready for two new tenants also includes cleaning up the debris from the mill's 350-foot smokestack and using rollers to compact gravel, he said.
The cleanup will make way for a $180 million Atlantic Salmon farm being built by the Portland company Whole Oceans and a training annex where Maine Maritime Academy annually expects to train 2,400 students and professional mariners. Both of those projects are shaping up to be part of Bucksport's rebound from the paper mill closure and loss of 570 jobs in 2014. Whole Oceans has said the salmon farm could eventually employ 200 people.
McGlin said he was confident that AIM's sitework would be finished by the end of November.
[bdnvideo id="2890105"]
Whole Oceans awaits its final permit from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection before it can start preparing its portion of the mill site. It plans to start construction on two buildings next year, according to its Bucksport building permit application -- a 90,000-square-foot building that will house salmon eggs and fish up to 10 months old -- and a 350,000-square-foot structure where the company will raise salmon to a size suitable for sale, 10 to 12 pounds.
The company has said it expects to break ground in the spring.
Maine Maritime Academy has already started installing internet wiring in a former Verso training building that will house Maine Maritime classrooms, McGlin said.
Maine Maritime will also build an adjacent building on its four-acre parcel where firefighters will train in spaces designed to look like cargo vessels. The academy is expected to start training activities on the Verso site before the firefighter training facility is completed.
[image id="2891283" size="full" pos="center" /]
Another development at the mill site is a pending change in ownership of the on-site power plant.
AIM is planning to sell the site's 161-megawatt natural gas- and oil-fired generator to a New York-based firm, Stonepeak Kestrel Holdings III. Stonepeak has applied for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval of its plans, which are under review.
The sale is supposed to close by Friday.
At a special meeting Tuesday night, the Bucksport Planning Board voted 7-0 on several motions to shift a boundary line so that voltage lines that run between a Central Maine Power substation and the site's power plant will be on plant-owned land.

The Dexter boys cross country team surprised itself when it qualified for the Class C state meet

Texto completo: Much like a 16th seed in the NCAA basketball tournament, the Dexter boys cross country team is savoring the chance this week to join Maine's top interscholastic runners at Saturday's state championship meet.
The Tigers aren't likely to win the Class C state crown after being the sixth of seven teams to qualify at last weekend's North regional.
But getting this far wasn't expected when preseason practices started in August -- at least if the reaction to their fourth-place finish at the Penobscot Valley Conference championships is any indication.
"It was a complete shock," Dexter coach Marcy King said. "We were sitting there half-listening as they were reading down the team points, and all of a sudden someone said, 'We got fourth!' I said, 'We did not,' and they said,'Yes we did!'
"Sure enough we got the results and there we were."
Dexter has fielded cross country teams off and on -- mostly off -- during the past few decades. Only last year was the program reinstated because the sport was growing at the nearby middle school, Ridge View Community School.
King, a 1990 Dexter graduate, anticipated the need for a high school team given the sport's development at Ridge View, so she volunteered to serve as that team's coach last year.
"My daughter had started running cross country at Ridge View, and it was popular there," she said. "I knew the kids from the middle school were coming up, and if there's no program, you're going to lose those kids so there was a need and a need that had to be filled pretty quickly."
Dexter's 2018 high school squad included only four participants, but prospects seemed brighter last spring when 20 runners signed up for this year's team.
That number gradually dwindled but still had enough for a full-scoring boys team as well as four girls on the final roster.
The Tigers hosted a regular-season meet for the first time in years at Ridge View.
Then came the PVCs, and the realization that the boys squad had postseason potential. Freshman Payson Rienhardt led the way with his sixth-place finish.
Saturday's regional at Troy Howard Middle School in Belfast was approached with modest expectations, but with Rienhardt (13th), junior Michael Gadwah (33rd) and sophomore Nickolas Gallighan (39th) leading the way, the Tigers made their breakthrough.
"I went back to school on Monday after the PVCs and told them we finished fourth and now we've got the chance to make it to states," King said. "My AD said, 'Regionals are pretty big.'
"But lo and behold, here we are."
Other boys on the team are senior Augustus Irwin, sophomore Miles Gadwah and freshmen David Race and Christian Gallant.
Two freshmen, Annika King (35th) and Emma Alexander (36th), raced for Dexter in the girls regional, while other girls on the postseason roster were sophomore Caroline Lambert and freshman Breanna Thompson.
With close to 30 runners competing at Ridge View this fall under coach Brian Rienhardt, a former All-American in cross country at SUNY Cobleskill, the future looks bright for a more stable high school program.
"We're a young team and there's a lot of growth potential," King said. "So many of our runners have cut so much time off their pace this year, it's just been an incredible season."

Texto completo: An Eddington man was arrested Thursday on sexual assault charges allegedly involving a child.
Corbin Guy Dunkel, 18, was indicted Wednesday by the Penobscot County grand jury on one count each of gross sexual assault on a child under the age of 12, a Class A crime; two counts of unlawful sexual contact with a child under the age of 12, one a Class A crime and the other a Class B crime; and one count of sexual misconduct, a Class C crime.
In July, Dunkel allegedly showed a pornographic video to a female relative who had not yet turned 12, and sexually assaulted her, Devon DeMarco, deputy district attorney for Penobscot County, said Thursday.
Dunkel is being held at the Penobscot County Jail in Bangor.
He is scheduled to appear before a judge at 1 p.m. Friday at the Penobscot Judicial Center.
Dunkel's indictment was sealed until his arrest, the prosecutor said.
If convicted, he faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000 on the Class A crimes; 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $20,000 on the Class B crime; and up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000 on the Class C crime.
If you or someone you know needs resources or support related to sexual violence, contact the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault's 24/7 hotline at 800-871-7741.

Maine's community colleges see enrollment grow for the first time in 5 years

Texto completo: Maine's community colleges have seen their enrollment grow this fall, marking the first increase in the number of students at the state's two-year colleges since 2014.
The total number of students enrolled at Maine's seven community colleges grew 4 percent this fall over last fall's enrollment, an increase of 705 students, according to Maine Community College System figures. Some 17,327 students are enrolled at community colleges this fall, up from 16,662 a year ago.
The number of students includes both full- and part-time students and includes those seeking degrees, those enrolled but not seeking degrees and high school students taking community college courses.
The increase followed four straight years of enrollment declines at the community colleges, which offer associate's degrees and professional certificates. Those enrollment declines came after a time of generally steep growth for the community college system since it formed in 2002.
Maine's community colleges saw a decade of steady enrollment increases from 2002 to 2011, which is when the number of students across the system began to decline. In the fall of 2014, enrollment increased by about 100 students, or 0.4 percent, over the previous fall. Afterward, however, the decline continued until this fall.
[iframe url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS7tS2_T8r5N0pKIBcMxNRhoK5INi-5skniHGbWP9GcU-EOUaR_aJw2TlVCVSC5zJ9S7zeL36n8AgJO/pubchart?oid=1558319603&format=interactive" width="600" height="450"]
"This growth stands in contrast to declining enrollments at two-year colleges across the country in recent years," said Helen Pelletier, vice president and chief communications and strategic planning officer for the Maine Community College System.
In recent years, the community college system had traded places with the University of Maine System when it came to enrollment trends. The state's public universities saw overall enrollment start to increase in 2016, ending a 13-year enrollment decline, while community college enrollment slid.
This fall, the largest enrollment increase has happened at Southern Maine Community College in South Portland, where 6,384 students are enrolled this year compared with 5,862 last year, according to system figures.
Two of the seven community colleges -- Kennebec Valley and York County community colleges -- saw decreases in the number of students compared with fall 2018. Kennebec Valley Community College enrollment dropped by 67 students, while York County Community College's enrollment slid by just two students.
In addition to the rise in the number of degree-seeking students, the number of trainees who completed short-term job training sessions community college offer has almost doubled in the past year, to 1,602 from 897.
Community college enrollment has been linked to the economy, according to Pelletier. More students enroll when unemployment increases. Maine is still seeing record low unemployment, which makes the increased community college enrollment this fall noteworthy.
The system attributed the increase in the 2019 enrollment numbers to initiatives it launched across the state in the past year, including more visits to high schools, reaching prospective students through text instead of email and adding in-demand programs, such as plumbing.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- Maine dentists, dental specialists, hygienists and office staff members will volunteer their time this Friday, November 1, to provide free care during the 11th annual Dentists Who Care for ME.
The St. Apollonia Dental Clinic in Presque Isle will be one of the participating practices, and will open its doors from 8 am to noon. The clinic is located at 122 Academy Street.
The program offers basic oral care services (cleanings, fillings or extractions) for adults who have no other access to dental care, as well as referrals to specialists.
People wishing to receive treatment are encouraged to arrive early at the participating dental offices to secure an appointment, as slots fill very quickly. Appointments will not be taken prior to Nov. 1, and appointments are on a first-come, first-served basis.
Vouchers for free services by dental specialists will be distributed by the referring dentist to patients who need more comprehensive procedures.
The annual day of free care has examined and treated more than 4,000 patients and provided services valued at nearly $1.3 million since its inception.
The Maine Dental Association is again offering its help to organize Dentists Who Care for ME.
"The MDA is pleased to continue its support of this important program," said Executive Director Angela Cole Westhoff. "It is just one of many ways that dentists give back to their communities all year round."
The University of New England College of Dental Medicine, which will be opening their Oral Health Center, and practices throughout the state are seeing patients during this year's Dentists Who Care for ME.
For a full list of practices that are participating, go to www.medental.org, click on Dentists Who Care for ME, and click on Locations.

Rural Mainers will now get cardiac care without having to make a road trip

Texto completo: Central Maine Healthcare will begin sending cardiac physicians to rural Maine next month to treat patients at their own doctors' offices.
The Lewiston-based hospital group said cardiologists from its Central Maine Heart and Vascular Institute will make the half-hour drive to the DFD Russell Medical Center in Leeds to save patients travel time. It should also ease worry from patients about driving to a much larger city and the higher cost of procedures in a hospital.
Central Maine Healthcare and DFD Russell announced the arrangement on Tuesday.
"In our rural state, with our aging population, it makes sense to bring that care closer to Mainers," said Dr. Andrew Eisenhauer, medical director of the heart and vascular institute.
Laurie Kane-Lewis, CEO of DFD Russell, said about 80 percent of the patients who travel from Leeds to Lewiston for cardiac testing, or some 500 patients per year, can now be seen in Leeds.
About half of those are low-income patients who qualify for reduced costs.
Diagnostic services initially will include electrocardiograms, echocardiograms and stress tests. The doctors initially will see patients once a month, but later expand the schedule as needed. Patients needing more complex care will be transferred to Central Maine Heart and Vascular Institute.
All appointments and billing will be handled directly through DFD Russell, allowing patients to schedule and manage their cardiovascular services where they receive their primary care, Kane-Lewis said.
About 4.7 percent of adult Mainers have reported that a health professional told them they have chest pain or coronary artery disease, according to America's Health Rankings, a health data company. That compares to 3.9 percent nationally.
The alliance is part of Central Maine Healthcare's strategy to expand in rural Maine. The hospital system also has plans to upgrade two of its more rural hospitals over the next several years with an update to the Rumford Hospital emergency room and a possible new medical office building at Bridgton Hospital.
Central Maine Healthcare also oversees Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, where it has been upgrading equipment and buildings for the past several years. It also plans to open an urgent care facility in Lewiston in early 2020.
DFD Russell was formed In 1975 by concerned residents of Leeds and the six surrounding towns following the death of the area's only physician, Dr. Daniel Davis Russell. It opened in 1979 and is a nonprofit, federally qualified health center.

Texto completo: You've been busy, and haven't had the chance to spend any time in the woods. Now, here we are a few days before the beginning of deer season, and you realize exactly how far behind the eight ball you are. You haven't scouted. You don't have any stands up. You don't have a plan for Saturday's residents-only deer season opener.
Luckily, a lack of advance preparation needn't spoil your whole season. In fact, there are a few tactics you might consider to tip the balance in your favor.
"Deer hunting is all about habitat," said Lee Kantar, an avid deer hunter and former deer biologist who now serves as the state's top moose biologist. "That's what you've got to key in on. What's deer habitat this time of year, and where are they going to be?"
Kantar explained that deer are known as "edge" species, in that they tend to flourish in the transition spaces between, say, a forest and a field. This year, with so much natural food in the woods, deer might not be so apt to wander into those fields, and might be targeting acorns instead.
"Maybe these deer are on those hardwood ridges and places where the food is a little bit more [abundant] than they've been in the past because it's such a big year for acorns," he said.
Nathan Bieber, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife's deer biologist, said one crucial first step should precede any hunting.
"If a hunter is eyeing up a spot and they haven't contacted that landowner, that's something they should do," Bieber said. "Better late than never, and developing that kind of cooperative relationship with a landowner makes it more likely that their land will be available to hunt in the future."
Among Bieber's other tips:
Practice, practice, practice.
"Spend some time at the shooting range," he said. "Knowing where the deer are isn't that helpful if you can't make a good shot."
Don't be too proud to ask for help.
"If you have permission to hunt an area but haven't scouted it much, ask the landowner what they're seeing and what areas they might recommend," Bieber said.
Get back to the basics.
"'Still hunting' can be an effective way to kind of scout and hunt at the same time. Still hunting just involves slowly stalking through an area stopping now and then to watch and wait," Bieber said. "You might just quietly walk 100 yards, stand up against a tree for 15 minutes, creep along another 100 yards and wait again. This way you're hunting in a way that isn't disturbing everything around and scouting what's in the area."
Other tips that could pay off, according to Kantar:
It's never too late to start learning about the land you're hunting.
"Depending on how much time you have to go out, have the mindset that you're actually going to scout while you're deer hunting," Kantar said.
Take advantage of technology.
"These days with Google Earth and all that type of stuff people can do a lot of homework in one evening [at their computer]," Kantar said. "You could Google 'Northeast hunting' and start looking at Google Earth and pick out some places right there."
Among the resources one might find online: Areas where the public is welcome to hunt due to conservation easements and agreements.
Concentrate on food sources that you find.
"Obviously, this year is a big food year. We have acorns and we have beechnuts. We have apples," Kantar said. "[Focusing on those areas is] obviously something that would kind of be a first step."
And one more tip:
Finally, a piece of advice from a guy (me) who has never filled his tag, but who knows plenty of people who have.
Just get out there.
Unless you're like a co-worker of mine who accidentally "harvests" a deer or three each year while he's driving his truck back and forth between Bangor and Belfast, you're not going to have any luck putting venison in the freezer unless you actually get into the woods.
And the more often you head out, the better your odds will get.
You can take that advice to the bank.

Texto completo: Difficulty: Moderate to strenuous, depending on how much of the trail network you hike. Altogether, the trails on and around Turtle Ridge total 9.3 miles; however, it's easy to map out shorter hikes -- including loop hikes -- in that network. For example, from the west trailhead, it's just a 3-mile out-and-back hike to the viewpoints on Turtle Ridge. The trails feature plenty of roots and rocks. Near the ponds, the trails are fairly flat, while on the ridge, the slope is gradual with only a few steep sections.
Information: One of the most distinctive landmarks in Nahmakanta Public Lands, Turtle Ridge rises above Sing Sing Pond, its dramatic cliffs serving as a beautiful backdrop to the water. The ridge tops off around 1,600 feet above sea level and features several overlooks.
[image id="2891579" size="full" pos="center" /]
A well-maintained trail network explores the Turtle Ridge and visits the nearby Sing Sing, Henderson, Long, Rabbit and Hedgehog ponds. Altogether, these intersecting trails total 8.4 miles, not counting the 0.9-mile trail that branches off to visit staircase falls on a nearby stream.
Marked with blue blazes, the trails form a figure eight, with signs at each intersection directing you to key landmarks. Throughout the network, the scenery changes several times. Some highlights include mossy stands of tall evergreens, vast beds of pale lichen atop the ridge and areas filled with giant boulders left behind by a glacier thousands of years ago.
The trails also pass along interesting rock formations, including long rock walls that are so uniform they look almost man-made. On the east side of Turtle Ridge, the trail travels along the base of some cliffs, where a small cave can be found. And just beyond that, the trail travels along an esker (a long ridge of sediment) between two small ponds.
[image id="2891580" size="full" pos="center" /]
Atop Turtle Ridge, overlooks offer views of Sing Sing Pond and distant mountains to the south. In addition, a smaller ridge to the east features an open view of Katahdin and other mountains of Baxter State Park. This overlook is reached by hiking the section of the trail network that visits Henderson Pond.
Some man-made features of the hike include a scenic wooden bridge over a bubbling brook, a series of narrow bog bridges, a few stone staircases, large rock piles called cairns marking the trail in some places on the ridge and a rock border to the trail near the viewpoint of Katahdin.
The name Turtle Ridge begs for some explanation. To learn more, I searched the pages of Steve Pinkham's book "Mountains of Maine: Intriguing Stories Behind Their Names." In the book, Pinkham reports that the ridge may be named after its turtle-like shape or in honor of the turtles living in nearby ponds.
Pinkham also came across local lore that states that Sing Sing Pond was named after Sing Sing Correctional Facility, a famous maximum security prison in New York, and that the pond's dark water may have reminded early lumbermen of the dark confines of the prison.

Nahmakanta Public Lands is a state-owned chunk of conservation land deep in the woods, about halfway between Moosehead Lake and Millinocket. The unit encompasses 43,000 acres and features small mountains, 24 "great ponds" (10 or more acres in size), 22 campsites and about 35 miles of hiking trails, in addition to 9 miles of the famous Appalachian Trail.
Aside from the fees paid at the Jo-Mary Checkpoint, access is free. Camping on the property is first come, first serve. Dogs are permitted if under control at all times. Hunting and trapping is permitted, in accordance with state laws. For more information about Nahmakanta Public Lands, call 207-941-4412 or visit maine.gov/nahmakanta.

Personal note: Nahmakanta is an outdoor destination that has long been on my radar, but for whatever reason, it took me years to check it off my list. You know those places that just seem to elude you? Well, I finally made the trip, thanks to the planning of three friends: Kris Reid, Betty Jamison and Wanda Greatorex.
Last Thursday, I woke up before dawn, met my three companions and headed into the woods, leaving civilization and cellphone reception behind. After getting settled at Kris's nearby camp, we packed lunch and hiked Turtle Ridge, a place that holds many memories for Kris and her family.
We parked a car at both trailheads so we could hike from one end to the other, traveling over Turtle Ridge and then to the viewpoint of Katahdin near Henderson Pond. Throughout the 5.5-mile hike, we passed through some truly wondrous scenery. One of my favorite areas was the boulder-filled forest just east of Turtle Ridge. I also enjoyed the large white birch trees near the west trailhead, and the stand of tall spruce trees near Sing Sing Pond. It seemed that every few minutes, a new natural wonder would pop into view.
I could write pages about our hike, about the chickadees that serenaded me as I walked along the esker and many colorful mushrooms we spotted along the trail. But I'm short on space, so I'll just say this: It was worth the long drive. Nahmakanta is a beautiful place, and while it's now checked off my list, I plan to visit again soon.
[image id="2891588" size="full" pos="center" /]
How to get there: From the center of Milo (where routes 11, 6 and 16 intersect) drive north on Route 11 for 23.4 miles, then turn left at the Jo-Mary Lake Campground sign onto the gravel Jo-Mary Road. This is a well-maintained logging road. Drive slowly and yield to logging trucks.
Reset your odometer. In about 0.2 mile, you'll come to Jo-Mary Road Checkpoint. Pull over to the right and enter the gatehouse to register and pay a road use fee of $10 for Maine residents (per day), and $15 for non-residents, cash or check only. The checkpoint is open from 6 a.m to 9 p.m. daily, May through the middle of October, with the hours extending to 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Off season, the public does not need to register or pay a fee to use the road, however, many of the roads are not plowed, and some are used by snowmobiles.
After registering, continue on Jo-Mary Road for about 14.5 miles to Henderson Brook Checkpoint, which is an unmanned, electronic checkpoint manned by Jo-Mary staff. Along the way, several roads branch off Jo-Mary Road. I suggest carrying Delorme's The Maine Atlas and Gazetteer to trace your route as you drive. Also, at some intersections, you can follow signs that read NLC (Nahmakanta Lake Camps) and DLWC (Debsconeag Lake Wilderness Camps). The biggest intersection is at about 6 miles, where you'll veer right.
Just beyond the Henderson Brook Checkpoint, you'll enter Nahmakanta Public Lands. About 1.7 miles past the checkpoint, the parking area for the east trailhead for Turtle Ridge is on your left. After parking, walk back along the road a short distance to find the trailhead, which is on the same side of the road as the parking.
To reach the west trailhead to Turtle Ridge, continue on Jo-Mary Road to about 5.7 miles past the Henderson Brook Checkpoint, then turn left onto Nahmakanta Road. Drive about 1.3 mile, then turn left onto Long Pond Road. Drive 1 mile and the trailhead parking area is on your right. Park and continue down the road on foot. Cross a bridge and the trailhead will be on your left.

Ellsworth voters to elect at least two new city councilors on Nov. 5

Texto completo: There will be at least two newcomers on the Ellsworth City Council next month -- and possibly three -- after the Nov. 5 election.
Marc Blanchette, the current council chairman, is running for another three-year term on the seven-seat board, but two other incumbent councilors -- Gary Fortier and Dawn Ihle Hudson -- have opted not to seek re-election. Fortier has served on the council for 25 of the past 28 years, while Hudson is finishing up one term on the board after first being elected in 2016.
Gene Lyons, who ran unsuccessfully for the council in 2017 and again in 2018, is running this year while three other candidates are making their first attempt: Edward "Mathias" Kamin III, Michelle R. Kaplan and Robert P. "Bob" Miller. In all, there are five candidates running for three available seats. Aside from Blanchette, none has held prior public elective office.
All five candidates told the Bangor Daily News that they support continuing development in Ellsworth, which is a regional service center for communities throughout Hancock County and parts of Washington County, but they differ slightly on how the city could support economic growth.
[image id="2891567" size="full" pos="center" /]
Each said the city needs more housing to keep pace with the city's business growth, which has been dominated over the past 20 years by retail development but more recently includes the opening of a Jackson Laboratory mouse reproduction facility, where more than 300 people are expected to work by the end of the year. All but Kamin cited the local school system as an important piece of the city's overall economic health, and three candidates -- Blanchette, Kaplan and Miller -- said the city should consider expanding vocational education programs at Hancock County Technical Center to help support local business growth.
"I believe we are beginning to see what will become a growth rate of seismic proportions," Blanchette said.
Kamin, Kaplan, Lyons and Miller all cited the need to keep property taxes in check, though Blanchette -- like the four other candidates -- said he supports the proposed solar power facility on city property as a way to reduce the city's electrical costs. Lyons, however, expressed doubt over the long-term prospects of solar development.
"What happens when [the] solar fad is done?" Lyons said. "Who cleans up the solar panels?"
All five candidates say they favor building or expanding more recreational and walking trails in the city, while Kamin and Miller specifically said the riverfront along Water Street should be improved and made more accessible to the public.
"Our waterfront could be a great draw for tourism," Miller said.
Kaplan, Lyons and Miller each said the city should focus more on improving infrastructure such as roads and sewer and water lines. Blanchette and Kaplan said that the city should do more to help improve vehicular traffic flow through the city's urban center.
"The traffic patterns have changed since the closing of the Bucksport mill and there are more people coming from that direction" into downtown on Route 1, Kaplan said. "Additionally, the lack of a [traffic signal] at the end of Route 179 will ultimately end up in a major accident."
Lyons, an Army veteran and concrete plant manager, and Blanchette, a former Bangor Daily News photographer and retired local furniture business owner, each spent most or all of their formative years in Ellsworth, while Kamin, Kaplan and Miller are relatively new to the city. Kamin, who works at a local brewery, moved to Maine from upstate New York two years ago. Kaplan, a physician's assistant, has lived in Ellsworth since 2012 while Miller, an Air Force veteran and pharmacist, has lived in Ellsworth since 2004.
Kamin, 32, is the youngest candidate in the field and Blanchette, at 62, is the oldest. Kaplan, Lyons and Miller are each in their early 50s. Lyons and Miller each live off Route 179 on Graham Lake, while Blanchette, Kamin and Kaplan all live in the city's more developed urban center, within walking distance of Main Street downtown.
Kamin is the only candidate in the field not registered with a political party. The other four all are Republicans including Kaplan and Miller who describe themselves as having moderate or centrist views. Kaplan said she has previously registered as a Democrat.
More than one candidate pointed out that the City Council is a nonpartisan body in which party affiliation plays no role in how the council functions, unlike with Congress or the state Legislature, where members of a political party caucus together to strategize, or chair committees depending on which party holds a majority.
Kamin went a little further, however, saying the de facto two-party system, dominated by the Democratic and Republican parties, is "undemocratic."
"I deeply believe neither of the two major parties represent my views," Kamin told the BDN.

Republican Bill Cohen says Trump sounds like a 'dictator'

Texto completo: Bill Cohen, a Maine Republican who voted to impeach President Richard Nixon as a freshman lawmaker in 1974, said Wednesday that President Donald Trump sounds like a "dictator" who has no regard for the rule of law.
Cohen told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Trump's behavior in office undermines the rule of law and norms and institutions that have sustained U.S. democratic institutions.
"He feels that he alone can take action without regard to any other institutions which are there to make sure the rules of law stays intact. And so, that only I can do this, and that has the sound of, you know, a dictator or a dictatorship where only I can solve this problem," Cohen said.
"Now, if the president can do that in first term, what would we expect if he has a second term and which has no need to go before the electorate again, there's no need to go to Congress to say, gee, I am sorry. I broke this rule. There will be no rules that would go unbroken," Cohen said.
His remarks came as House Democrats prepared to hold a vote Thursday to authorize the public phase of the impeachment inquiry against Trump that has so far been conducted behind closed doors as House committees interview Trump administration officials. It also directs the intelligence panel to draft a report making recommendations on impeachment.
That resolution passed Thursday in a party-line vote, with all Republicans and two Democrats opposed.
The inquiry centers around the president's July 25 phone call during which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his potential 2020 rival Democrat Joe Biden.
[iframe url="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6534375-BILLS-116-HRes660.html" responsive=true height="550" width="400"]
Cohen was one of seven Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee who voted to impeach Nixon during the Watergate scandal in 1974. He has been a consistent Republican critic of the president, telling the BDN last month that Trump using his office to "solicit interference from a foreign country" constituted an "impeachable offense."
In December, Cohen, who spent 18 years in the Senate after serving three terms in the House, joined 43 former senators in signing a bipartisan letter that called on the Senate to uphold the rule of law and ensure that "partisanship or self-interest not replace national interest."
"I want to see the president as a shining example of what the rule of law is supposed to look like in America, and why we treasure that rule of law, because if you don't have the rule of law, you have the law of rule, and that's something the president seems really more akin to. He likes President Putin, he likes Kim Jong Un, he likes President Xi Jinping, he likes President Erdogan. He doesn't much like our allies in terms of paying the same kind of tribute to them that he does to those who have the kind of one-man rule," Cohen said Wednesday.
[Angus King says Trump acting like Louis XIV by accusing whistleblower of treason]
Cohen said that many of his fellow Republicans likewise are worried about where the country is heading, evoking George Orwell's dystopian novel "1984."
Asked whether he was concerned that impeachment would tear apart the nation, Cohen said that similar arguments were made against impeaching Nixon in 1974. He said his committee received bomb threats and that he even had to get special protection for his family. But he believes that impeaching a president for acting in a manner antithetical to U.S. values "will not result in tearing the country apart."
"What will tear the country apart is if we watch the slow unraveling of the rule of law in the name of power of the president. And when you confuse the office of the president with the individual president, then his undoing becomes our undoing. The president is there as temporary occupant but we have our allegiance to -- it's the office of the president and to the Constitution and to the country."
He said that some Republicans may fear speaking out against Trump because it could cost them their seats in Congress as he is popular on the right. But Cohen said it is more important to sacrifice that position if it means upholding the Constitution.
"If you are unwilling to do that, you shouldn't be there in the first place," Cohen said.

A former Republican who's now running for U.S. Senate as a Democrat in Kansas earned heavyweight endorsements on Thursday from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Emily's List, support that typically comes in the form of big investments to help candidates with advertising, fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts.
Barbara Bollier, a state senator and a retired anesthesiologist who switched parties last year, is running for a Senate seat being vacated by GOP Sen. Pat Roberts, who is retiring. As multiple Republicans battle it out in a crowded primary to succeed him—overshadowed by the possibility that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo might eventually jump into the race—Democrats in Kansas have consolidated around Mrs. Bollier as their top candidate.
Soon after she announced her intention to run earlier this month, former U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom bowed out of the Democratic primary and threw his support to her. Former Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, who served as President Obama's Health and Human Services secretary, endorsed Mrs. Bollier recently, as did the state's current governor, Democrat Laura Kelly.
The DSCC has endorsed candidates in six races so far this year: Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Iowa, New Mexico, and South Carolina. Its early announcement of support for Mrs. Bollier shows that Democrats are hoping their map of competitive races could expand to ruby red Kansas.
The state has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932. If Democrats win the White House next year, they must gain three seats to take control of the Senate, or four if Mr. Trump gets re-elected.
Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, chair of the DSCC, the campaign arm of Senate Democrats, praised Mrs. Bollier's background and stressed her independence. "Barbara Bollier has committed her life to helping people and this is the same approach she'll bring to the U.S. Senate to work for all Kansans," she said.
Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List, a national group that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights, said Mrs. Bollier will fight to protect Kansans' access to quality, affordable health care when elected. She cited Mrs. Bollier's record opposing the controversial tax plan of former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback.
Mrs. Bollier, a moderate who represented suburban Kansas City, left the GOP last year. Republicans had stripped her of her committee assignments after she endorsed Democrat Laura Kelly for governor over then-Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican. Mrs. Bollier said at the time that she was frustrated by her party's stance on gay and transgender rights and unhappy with President Trump. Her pro-abortion rights stance is notable in a state that has served as ground zero in many battles over abortion.
A resurgence by the Democratic Party in Kansas in the last election cycle has been driven largely by women: In addition to Ms. Kelly retaking the governorship, now-Rep. Sharice Davids, the first gay Native American woman elected to Congress, flipped a suburban congressional seat. Mrs. Sebelius campaigned alongside both female candidates and is expected to hit the campaign trail again in 2020.
Some national Republicans are nervous about Mrs. Bollier's candidacy, but Kansas Republicans are bullish on their chances of keeping the seat. The same things that make Mrs. Bollier an attractive recruit for Democrats will cause Kansans to reject her, said Eric Pahls, campaign manager for Rep. Roger Marshall, one of the Republicans running for the Senate seat.
"Barbara Bollier was hand-picked by Chuck Schumer because of her long history as a tax-and-spend, pro-abortion, anti-2nd Amendment liberal," Mr. Pahls said. "For her entire political career, she's pretended to be someone she isn't."

Texto completo: IT'S EASY TO GET gun-shy these days about booking a New England ski vacation. I not so fondly recall a recent winter when my family and I spent Christmas week in Maine braving temperatures that bottomed out at about minus 25; two months later, over February school break, we waded our way through an unseasonably spring-like, slushy five days in central Vermont. After that, I swore I would never again plan ski trips more than a few weeks in advance. The weather has just become too unpredictable, more often than not in the extreme. Spend any time talking to ski resort operators and they'll tell you: Climate change is real.
I'm hardly alone in my hesitation. In recent years, ski resort operators across the country have been forced to contend with industry-wide decline, largely related to often inconsistent conditions. Low-snow years cost the industry more than $1 billion between 2001 and 2016, according to a study commissioned by the nonprofit group Protect Our Winters. Making snow requires specialized equipment, and the electricity to run it, which is why one report predicted that only about half of Northeast ski resorts will be economically viable by 2039. So here in New England, resorts are working hard to not only attract new skiers but also to retain the ones they've got. It's no longer enough to offer great skiing and riding. These days, what happens before and aprés ski is just as important.
There's not a ski resort around that's not talking about “weatherproofing," which comes in the form of more powerful, more responsive snow making and more off-mountain fun. At Vermont's Jay Peak (jaypeakresort.com, 802-988-2611), operators started noticing shifting weather patterns about a decade ago and realized they'd better do something to make it easier for families to commit to a big-investment stay in advance. “For a family booking a four-kid, six-night ski vacation, there's a certain amount of risk in New England," says resort spokesperson J.J. Toland. “We wanted to minimize that risk." Since the resort introduced its Pump House indoor water park in 2011 — “the year winter didn't arrive until a week before Martin Luther King Day and ended around March 10," Toland says — it has significantly increased advance bookings, often selling out the more popular weeks months ahead of time. He says the water park has even started to attract many non-skiers, who might decide to give the sport a try thanks to vacation packages that often include a free or discounted lesson.
Some resorts are putting their money where their mouth is by emphasizing better food and night life. Recent restaurant additions at Sugarloaf (sugarloaf.com, 800-843-5623) in Maine include Hunker Down, a classic gastropub serving elevated comfort food (hdsugarloaf.com, 207-235-6095), opened by Portland restaurateurs Jason Loring and Michael Fraser; The Eighty 8 Donut Café, which sells artisanal doughnuts (sugarloaf.com/dining, 207-747-8823); and, last year, wine bar Alice & Lulus (aliceandlulus.com, 207-235-6111). This year, the base lodge watering hole, Widowmaker (sugarloaf.com/dining, 207-237-6845), got a total overhaul, including a new outdoor deck with views of the peak and a bigger stage for live music.
In Vermont, Sugarbush Resort (sugarbush.com, 802-583-6300) has become known as much for its culinary scene as its low-key vibe and northerly winds. There's locavore-leaning Rumble's Kitchen (sugarbush.com/dining, 802-583-6800), which this year welcomes new chef Vanessa Davis; legendary aprés hot spot Wünderbar (sugarbush.com/dining); authentic Thai food from Fit to be Thai'd (fit2bethaied.com, 802-496-3008); and partnerships with area favorites like The Skinny Pancake (skinnypancake.com), which serves up sweet and savory crepes out of The Farmhouse at Lincoln Peak.
New Hampshire's Loon Mountain Resort (loonmtn.com, 800-229-5666), meanwhile, gets creative with moonlight snowshoe tours featuring an optional on-mountain cocktail pit stop.
Still other mountains have taken the idea of weatherproofing literally and invested big time to improve snow making. At Sunday River (sundayriver.com, 800-543-2754) in Maine, the resort installed 2 miles of water pipes last year in an ongoing project to double its snow-making capacity. This year, snow-making efforts are also getting a boost at New Hampshire mountains including Loon, which installed 50 new snow-making hydrants; Gunstock Mountain Resort (gunstock.com, 603-293-4341), which made $1 million in upgrades throughout the property; and Waterville Valley Resort (waterville.com, 800-468-2553), where a new, resort-wide filtration system will help the 500 high-efficiency snow guns installed last season to deliver better-quality powder.
Over the past few years, Vermont's Mount Snow (mountsnow.com, 800-245-7669) has made more than $30 million worth of upgrades, doubling the power and size of its snow-making capabilities to ensure even the mildest days are satisfying ones. “Every year, snow making is more and more important, especially here in Southern Vermont," says Jamie Storrs, a spokesperson for Mount Snow. “Thanks to our improvements, we've had instances where it's rained on Thursday, freezing Thursday night, a sheet of ice on Friday  .  .  .  [but] by the time people show up Saturday, it's like it never happened."
THE HOTTEST NEW HANGOUTS > Waterville Valley Resort, New Hampshire
The new, three-level slope-side Freestyle Lounge at Waterville Valley opens this winter in homage to the mountain's competitive heritage with a locally driven food and drink menu that includes brews from Londonderry's 603 Brewery (an optional $55 Mug Club gives regulars 20 ounces of beer for $4). The décor features freestyle skiing memorabilia and funky furnishings, such as high-top tables made from repurposed cable spools.
> Sunday River, Maine
This month, nearby Bethel welcomes River Lanes (riverlanesbethel.com, 207-705-9500), a highly anticipated new hangout featuring a 10-lane bowling alley, darts, billiards, cornhole, and an arcade. On the mountain, the Shipyard Brew Haus at White Cap Lodge and the Mountain Room in the mid-mountain Peak Lodge each got an overhaul, promising a boost to the aprés scene.
> Wachusett Mountain, Massachusetts
In Princeton, the hometown of Wachusett (wachusett.com, 978-464-2300), the owners of the popular Mountainside Market (mountainsidemarket.com, 978-464-5317) opened the new Mountainside Bakery & Café in a 122-year-old Park Service building. Find craft beer, wine, seasonal cocktails, and comfort food like butternut turkey chili and pressed sandwiches on housemade focaccia in a country lodge setting with multiple fire pits and plenty of roomy Adirondack chairs.
> Stowe Mountain Resort, Vermont
This year, Stowe's Lodge at Spruce Peak (sprucepeak.com, 888-478-6938) launches a winter version of its popular Farm Table Friday summer dinner series, a multi-course, guest chef-created dinner with beer or wine pairings that use ingredients from local farms. Play your cards right and you may be able to grab a nightcap afterward at the Lodge's invitation-only speak-easy, the velvet-and-natural wood Linehouse (your only way in is through an invite from a Spruce Peak resident or staffer), where bartenders work off your preferences to mix cocktails served in glassware sourced from local antiques stores.
MUSIC ON THE MOUNTAINS This year, the Jay Peak Music Series (jaypeakresort.com/summer/music-series), which runs throughout the ski season, includes a '90s-themed New Year's Eve celebration, a rock 'n' roll show for kids, and performances by Van Morrison and Allman Brothers tribute bands. Last year, Stratton (stratton.com, 800-787-2886) debuted the WinterWonderGrass bluegrass festival (winterwondergrass.com), a three-day weekend of live music, food trucks, and local beer; this year, headliners for the April event include The Infamous Stringdusters and Molly Tuttle. Sugarloaf will host Fire on the Mountain, a Grateful Dead tribute weekend, in February and, in April, welcome the return of its popular, if notoriously slushy, Reggae Fest, while Sunday River closes out the season with the Great Tailgate, a parking lot celebration of live music, local beer, and — perhaps best of all, depending on how you look at it — the impending return of spring.
LUXE NEW SPOTS TO HANG YOUR POLES > The Williams Inn, Williamstown, Massachusetts
The 64-room inn (williamsinn.com, 413-458-9371) in the northern Berkshires, which opened this summer, is just 20 minutes from family favorite Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort (jiminypeak.com, 413-738-5500), the largest ski and snowboard resort in Massachusetts. Cambridge-based architecture and design firm CambridgeSeven designed the inn to be reminiscent of a classic American farmhouse using locally sourced antiques and furniture from area artisans, while an in-house restaurant called The Barn fits in with a farm-to-table ethos, craft bar, and cozy atmosphere. Rates start at $169 per night.
> The Lodge at Spruce Peak, Stowe, Vermont
Following a multimillion-dollar renovation, Stowe's recently rebranded ski-in/ski-out Lodge at Spruce Peak offers classic ski town luxury, with oversized leather chairs and fireplaces, custom-made furniture crafted from Vermont elm and walnut, and penthouse options that come with their own concierge and breathtaking views of Mount Mansfield. But it's what happens after the lifts stop running that makes The Lodge special. Start with live music and craft beer and wine at the WhistlePig Pavilion, where chefs serve cheese raclettes right from the open bonfire. Meanwhile, a spa offers post-ski healing in the form of cryotherapy to soothe muscles, outdoor hot tubs, and a menu of just-for-fun services designed especially for kids, including “mini-me" manicures and “chillax sessions," designed to help kids combat stress (if you can get them to ditch their phones for that long). Rates start at $215 per night.
> The Glen House, Gorham, New Hampshire
The 68-room hotel (theglenhouse.com, 603-466-3420) at the base of Mount Washington — and a short drive from Wildcat Mountain (skiwildcat.com, 603-466-3326) — is entirely modern, but pays respect to the past. It features touches like lumber salvaged from an old barn on the property and vintage photography of the road to Mount Washington. Outdoorsy non-skiers can traverse groomed trails via cross country ski, snowshoe, or fat bike, then warm up with the hotel's private label vodka at in-house restaurant The Notch Grille. A ride on the Mount Washington SnowCoach, which takes passengers two-thirds of the way to the snowy summit in comfort. Rates start at $80 per night.
LEARN TO SKI THE EASY WAY As part of a push to get skiers and riders started earlier and visiting longer, as well as to entice older first-timers, many mountains across New England have adopted terrain-based learning. The idea is to make learning to ski or snowboard easier by using shaped snow features to help control speeds and body positioning. “The method basically takes the fear out of the learning process and makes it more fun and more efficient," says Matt Erickson, the SnowSports School director at Sunday River, which this year installed three new lifts in its terrain-based learning area.
In Vermont, Stratton Mountain Resort has added a 1-acre terrain-based teaching area and its own Burton Riglet Park, a snow playground of sorts for snowboarders ages 3 to 6. Bretton Woods (brettonwoods.com, 603-278-3320) and Cranmore Mountain Resort (cranmore.com, 603-356-5543) in New Hampshire have also introduced terrain-based learning for kids and adults. Bretton Woods makes it especially family- and wallet-friendly with an interchangeable family ticket that allows parents to take turns with their new skier or snowboarder while the other relaxes in the lodge.
After the mountain brought in terrain-based learning, Jay Peak saw a 28 percent rise in afternoon lessons — typically the quietest time of day. Last year, the resort also tested two new programs it will implement in full this season. Vennedag —  Norwegian for “friends day" — lets families or groups learn together, regardless of skill level. Its guided discovery program, meanwhile, stations ski and snowboard instructors at the beginner-level moving carpet area to offer free lunch-hour instructions. If guests return their rental gear by 1 p.m., there's no charge to rent, and if they decide to continue through the day, they can get a discount on a lesson or lift ticket.

Neuhaus, 80, of Windsor Locks, CT went to be with her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on Saturday October 26, 2019, at St. Francis Hospital, Hartford, CT, surrounded by family and friends. Phyllis was born June 22, 1939 on a dairy farm in Nashua, New Hampshire, the daughter of Clayton and Hazel Northrup. After graduating high school in Nashua, she attended the former Northeast Bible Institute in Pennsylvania, where she made many lifelong friends. Phyllis worked many jobs over the years including assembly, hospital aide, deli clerk, church worker and her last job of 15 years as clerk at Suffield Cleaners where she met and kept three wonderful friends, Pat, Viola and Lidia. While working at and attending the Bethany Assembly of God in Agawam, MA she met her future husband Henry Neuhaus. Phyllis and Henry were happily married for over 38 years and resided in Windsor Locks with Henry's two daughters, Beverly and Bonnie. Phyllis was very active in the New Life Church and spent many years teaching Sunday school, loving the Lord and serving Him always. Phyllis loved gardening, her flower beds were gorgeous and she enjoyed feeding the wild birds of the neighborhood. Phyllis and Henry travelled extensively over the years, visiting Europe, Hawaii, Mexico, and many US destinations. They supported several third-world children in foreign lands though Christian charities. After losing Henry in 2016, Phyllis was supported and loved by many dear friends, kind neighbors and church family. Though she became physically weak, her faith was strong, and she began looking forward to being with Henry again in Heaven.

Installing concrete deck piers to last [Corrected 11/01/2019]

Texto completo: Q: I'm concerned about the concrete deck base that's fully above ground at my new home. The other decks in our development have the concrete piers below ground. Shouldn't the concrete be completely buried to protect against freezing and cracking in the winter months? What do you feel are the best concrete deck foundation details?
A: I love questions like this. I can understand the concern, based on the data sample you're considering. It's not far-fetched to worry that your deck foundation piers are wrong when they are the only ones that look like it in the neighborhood.
But think about this: Is it possible that your carpenter was the only good one in the development, and the other ones are ill-informed and lack critical thinking skills? You bet it's possible. I see it every day in the photos and emails I get on my website.
The photos sent show me that the builder or carpenter got everything right as far as what's supposed to happen above ground. It would take less than an hour with a round point shovel to determine if the deck pier extends below the frost level and has a wider concrete footing that the circular deck pier rests on.
Let's discuss deterioration concerns first. Concrete is an artificial man-made rock. If it's mixed and installed properly for the local weather conditions, it can last for hundreds of years. If you want proof, visit a few railroad bridges in your area that have poured concrete abutments that support the bridge structure. I've seen concrete bridgework that was installed in the early 1900s that looks in excellent shape.
You can also look around for above-ground poured concrete house foundations that might be 80 or more years old. It's all about adding enough Portland cement to the mix and making sure you don't add too much water or use water to finish the concrete. Curing the concrete to slow the release of the mix water is also very important.
Frost heave is another factor to be concerned about. Soils that contain water in freezing climates can expand, and they go up in almost all cases. Where I live in central New Hampshire, the soil around my house goes up at least 3 inches each winter. It can go up even more if there's an active spring under the soil. Ice lenses grow and grow, pushing the soil above them higher as the bitter weather drives the frost deeper in the soil.
Builders, engineers, architects and building inspectors are all aware of the frost depth in a local area. I've got a drawing on my AsktheBuilder.com website showing the frost depth across many areas of the U.S. If you live in the farthest northern reaches of Minnesota or Maine, you might have to dig down 6 feet or more to get a foundation footing below the depth that frost penetrates.
You want your deck piers to be below the frost level so the deck doesn't lift up. This kind of unwanted force can cause severe structural damage to the deck.
I've worked with many architects and engineers in my building career. Most of their plans agree: It's important to spread out the concentrated load of the deck posts across as much soil as you can. Usually, a 6- or 8-inch thick, 2-foot diameter poured concrete pad below the frost depth is sufficient to distribute the weight of the deck.
There are all sorts of ways to install a deck foundation base or pier. The most ingenious method I've seen to date -- and I used this on my own deck and for shed foundation piers I built four years ago -- is a plastic deck pier form you snap together on the job site. It even comes with all the required pre-bent and pre-cut reinforcing steel rods. I've got several videos of this marvelous deck pier system on my website.
This deck pier form is designed such that its base is flared out at the bottom so it spreads out the concentrated load. You just dig the hole to the correct depth, make sure the soil is compacted, set the form in place and then immediately backfill around the form with the soil you just dug out of the hole. Add this soil slowly to make sure the form doesn't move. You should then fill the form with concrete, place the anchor bolt for the post base and wait one day to start building the deck.
I prefer to have the top of my concrete deck piers at least 4 inches above the final grade around the piers. I don't want my treated lumber posts buried in the soil, as I've seen them rot and be a food source for termites. I always use a galvanized steel post base that keeps the bottom of the wood post up and off the poured concrete. This allows water to drain away from the wood.

Texto completo: Florida's favorite horror or Halloween movie just happens to be "Sleep Tight," according to the folks at the research website Comparitech.
If you don't know "Sleep Tight," you're not alone. It's a 2011 Spanish thriller about a Barcelona doorman who taunts tenants at an apartment building and tries to make a young woman break down.
Other states go for more familiar titles. Texas prizes "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," and Louisiana prefers "Interview With the Vampire."
Pennsylvania has a thing for the original 1968 "Night of the Living Dead" while Tennessee favors the 1990 remake.
Iowa and New Mexico like "Alien," but Arizona goes for "Aliens." Colorado touts "The Shining," and Utah raves over "Get Out."
Alfred Hitchcock plays well in several states. Maine is for "The Birds," and Delaware likes the original "Psycho."
Washington, D.C., gets the most chills from "The Exorcist," the 1973 classic that is set in the nation's capital.
Check out the full list at comparitech.com.

Texto completo: VIRGINIA BEACH - A decomposed juvenile humpback whale washed ashore at the North End early Tuesday morning. It may have been the same animal a resident spotted the day before floating near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.
Just before 7 a.m., someone called the Virginia Aquarium's stranding hotline to report a whale in the surf near 57th Street, according to Alexander Costidis, stranding response coordinator.
Using equipment from Virginia Beach Public Works, the whale was lifted onto the sand for examination.
"It was a really small animal, and it was pretty decomposed," Costidis said.
After being tossed around in the waves, there wasn't much left inside of the animal to test for a cause of death. But a vessel strike has been ruled out.
"It seems unlikely based on what we saw," said Costidis.
The mostly black mammal with a white patch on its throat was probably between 1 and 3 years old. It was about 26 feet long and likely would have weighed around 8 tons when it was alive.
Humpback whales migrate south beginning around November. The Chesapeake Bay is along their route and offers fuel for their long journey.
"You could think of it as a truck stop," Costidis said. "We have some really nice populations of menhaden and other school fish that they seem to really enjoy."
But it's not without challenges given the vessel traffic and fishing gear in the area, he said.
While humpback whales are not endangered, there's been a rash of more than 100 strandings since 2016 along the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries.
New York has had the most this year at 21, followed by Virginia at 20. The whale found Tuesday was the area's first this migration season.
It was buried Tuesday in a deep pit north of 57th Street.

Texto completo: Foster's Daily Democrat
Public safety officials used a drone and infrared imaging to rescue a missing man in the woods on a cold and rainy Sunday morning, using the technology to locate the man in 17 minutes after 7½ hours of unsuccessful traditional searching.
The multi-agency rescue, which occurred off Route 108 near The Works Family Health and Fitness Center in Somersworth, is one of the exact scenarios the Strafford County Sheriff's Office envisioned when it purchased its first drone in 2018.
“It's probably a perfect example of how that technology can be applied in law enforcement and in a rescue,” said Somersworth police Capt. Russ Timmons. “It's just the best of examples. The ground search would've been difficult because we were experiencing some rain and the overall terrain. Having that drone in the air couldn't have helped more.”
Timmons said Somersworth police and fire personnel, sheriff's office employees and Stewart's Ambulance Service rescued the missing 36-year-old man, who was wet and cold but otherwise okay, around 9 a.m. Sunday.
The man used his cell phone to call 911 to request assistance around 1:30 a.m. Sunday after he got “disoriented” and lost the trail he had started walking behind The Works around 12:30 a.m., according to Timmons.
Officers responded and began their search after the man's 911 call. Timmons said that call ultimately was the only one authorities had with the man because communication difficulties prevented police from being able to call his number back.
That elongated the search, as did the fact that cell towers couldn't narrow the search area past a large, half-mile-long tract of woods between The Works and Velcro USA.
“The midnight shift guys managed to check the area ... with our (police dog) Bravo,” said Timmons. “Hampered by some of the weather conditions, they were unable to locate him.”
Police requested Somersworth Fire's help around daybreak, which eventually led the departments and the sheriff's office to establish a command area behind The Works. First responders from Dover and from the Maine communities of Berwick and Lebanon provided mutual aid.
Timmons said a mere 17 minutes after the drone was deployed, the drone's operator located the man on infrared imaging as the man waited for assistance and signaled for help. Officials rescued the man, who was shoeless at the time, approximately 1,500 feet from the command area in The Works' parking lot and roughly 300 feet off of the closest section of the trail.
Strafford County Sheriff Dave Dubois said he's pleased they could help Somersworth first responders secure a positive outcome Sunday.
“With the support of the Strafford County commissioners and delegation we are able to deploy this equipment throughout Strafford County on request,” Dubois wrote in a text.
Strafford County Commissioner George Maglaras voiced similar remarks in a Facebook post about the rescue, calling it “Money well spent for the benefit of all.”

Report: Structural hurdles still plague DCYF

Texto completo: Monitor staff
Officials at New Hampshire's Division for Children, Youth and Families are aiming to make structural improvements to the agency after years of struggles, they said Wednesday – even as a new watchdog report suggests there's a long way to go.
In an interview in response to a sweeping 39-page report from the Office of the Child Advocate, DCYF Director Joe Ribsam and Associate Commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services Chris Tappan acknowledged the concerns and said they hope an expected staffing boost can help kick off broader reforms.
That report, released after a months-long review of child fatalities involving families known to the agency, identified a wide swathe of problem areas within the agency, from its antiquated electronic filing system to inefficient interactions with other agencies, to patterns of internal biases among staff members.
The concerns came from about a dozen sitting DCYF staff members and administrators through a series of review sessions.
Department officials are aware of each of the concerns raised, Ribsam and Tappan said.
“To me it's not about acceptance, it's about acknowledgment – that we're saying that these are things that we've got to continue to work on,” Tappan said.
The agency recently received funding for a surge of new positions – 91 over the next two years – after appropriations by the Legislature in the budget and a separate bill.
DCYF already formulated a plan for how to reshape the agency in anticipation of finally receiving the new positions earlier this year, Tappan and Ribsam said.
And now that the creation of the positions has been confirmed, state officials are looking to improve services as a whole – starting with a request for information to allow providers and others to suggest improvements, issued earlier this month.
Responses to that request will be considered in addition to the OCA watchdog report, Tappan and Ribsam said.
The report pointed to structural problems such as poor coordination between staff members and law enforcement, health care providers and local agencies like animal control, all of which led to missed signs ahead of a child's death.
And it highlighted certain biases that have been shown to play out: staff members referring to certain families as “frequent fliers” in the system, or prioritizing immediate danger to children at the expense of long-term danger, which can create rushed conclusions that mean assessments are closed prematurely.
Agency officials acknowledged that concern.
“Unfortunately there are frames like ‘frequent fliers' which in some ways – it is a very biased and sort of a value-laden statement,” Tappen said. “What it is is some frustration to understand what it is to bring a family back over and over again.”
But she said the department is attempting to utilize cognitive science and psychology to help staff members connect better with families in difficult situations.”
“Understanding the impact on that parent's decision to make good decisions ... is difficult. It's impaired. And so some of what we need to do is work with our staff to have that empathy and understanding. But those kinds of labels come when people are frustrated, they're fearful, they're concerned.”
Meanwhile, the agency says it's managed to make hires for many of the new positions, filling 38 child protection social worker spots as of July 1, largely through a series of monthly job fairs. It also said it had revamped its hiring practices to bring down the average per-employee hiring timeline from 100 days to 40 days.
Still, the OCA report suggested that more workers may be needed at the agency in the longterm, and that filling the vacancies that exist now appears to be hampered by higher salaries for social workers in Maine and Massachusetts.
Tappan acknowledged salary differences account for a portion of cases where applicants refuse offers to the agency, according to agency exit interviews. But she said the department is not clamoring for new positions until the existing ones are filled.
“We need to allow for the positions we've gotten to play out to some extent,” she said. But, she added: “Certainly, there's probably some consideration for whether the salaries need to be reconsidered. We need to watch that data.”
And Tappan stressed that the reforms would have to be made department-wide, and that missteps not be used to assign individual blame.
“What we don't want is for this to come back on staff, and come back on stakeholders, and come back on any one entity,” Tappan said. “Because I do think the Office of the Child Advocate demonstrates that she understands: This is a really complex system. Not any one of us is going to lead us out of this.”

Holiday hits snag

Texto completo: To those hearty souls heading out in search of candy on Oct. 31, Happy Halloween.

And to those hitting the streets on Nov. 2, after some officials had effectively changed the calendar this year on account of rain, I wish you well, too, with a slight variation.
Happy Halloweenie.
I mention weenie because I'm a holiday traditionalist looking to toughen up our youth. And their parents. Since when has it become fashionable to move a special day like this to another slot?
Christmas is on Dec. 25, not the 27th. Thanksgiving falls on the fourth Thursday each November, not the third.
And Halloween is, and forever will be, on Oct. 31.
Rain or shine.
So far, Concord kiddies are not weenies. At least they weren't as of press time. Their trick-or-treating remains on track for the 31st, despite a forecast that calls for wind and rain.
But my cellphone predicts temperatures in the upper 60s. Put on a slicker. Wear your superhero or Gumby or fairy princess outfit on the outside. Maybe add a pair of galoshes.
You'll be fine. Probably.
Figuring out who's in control of these kinds of decisions was hard to pinpoint. At times, the police told me to call the town. Then the town told me to call the police.
Meanwhile, Sue Stevens, the city of Concord's executive assistant, told me that Halloween is bigger than one person. She spoke about the calendar, about a higher power.
“The city council has determined that the city does not set the dates for Halloween and trick-or-treating,” Stevens told me. “It's always just based on tradition. It's just what happens every year. It's not something the city sets. It just happens.”
Not in some parts of the state. News broke this week that a bunch of towns had switched to Halloweenie mode, changing the holiday to Nov. 2, a Saturday. This group includes Nashua, Enfield, Salem and Hudson.
“All departments decide,” said a woman at the Hudson Town Hall. “The board, administrators, police, fire, public works and the electric company put out a warning. They all had to agree. It's not an individual who made this decision.”
Kerry Miller, the media contact for Nashua police, sent me a press release that stated, “The Nashua Police Department and city leaders cited safety concerns due to an inclement weather forecast on Halloween night.”
Even Lincoln, a town one hour north of here, known for its rugged mountains, 300-pound bears and classic, sturdy steam-powered trains changed their date, moving it to Friday.
Weenies? In Lincoln?
The chief there, Chad Morris, made that decision, I was told, after conferring with other officials in town.
In Salem, Town Manager Chris Dillon wrote in an email that the “chief of the police department makes a recommendation to the board of selectmen and the board has always adopted that recommendation (to my knowledge).”
“I understand that many people have different feelings on the subject,” added Dillon. “I looked at the matter from the standpoint that Halloween is on October 31st. (Neither) the chief, board of selectmen nor the town can or will change that.”
But celebrating Halloweenie, does, in fact, change that. Lt. Robert Giggi of the Nashua Police Department speculated that parents these days worry more than they used to, telling me, “It seems like the weather did not figure into it at that time and nowadays it does. That is what we go by. People are more cautious and aware of safety for their kids.”
Yes, things have changed. Parents oftentimes drive their kids around a neighborhood. Or they walk with them. There are set hours. Fill a little plastic pumpkin to the top with candy and you were done.
Me? We hit the streets right after grade school let out. No parents. No car. No set hours. And certainly no puny pumpkin. We used shopping bags, and when one filled up, we took it home, grabbed another and set out in search of more candy.
Once, my bag was so heavy that I dragged it along the street to get it home, before the bottom ripped open from the friction.
And, of course, this all happened on Halloween, Oct. 31, no matter the conditions outside.
Not on Halloweenie, Nov. 2.
But safety and comfort are the goals these days. Ryan Aylesworth, the town manager in Enfield, grew up in the western mountains of Maine, so he understood my point.
To an extent.
“It was not uncommon for it to snow on Halloween where I came from,” Aylesworth told me. “And if we were looking at snow here, there would have been no changes, but it's one thing to have dry snow, and it's another thing to have a driving rainstorm like we had over the weekend.”
One problem that might surface in towns that will celebrate Halloweenie is this: what happens to the kids who didn't hear that Nov. 2 was their day to trick-or-treat? What happens if those kids celebrate Halloween, as they should, but households they visit have prepared for Halloweenie?
“I do believe that is a possibility,” Dillon wrote in an email. “We notified schools, have it up on social media, the town's website, signs are going up everywhere. It is up to the people that live in the homes as to what they want to do if someone does approach their door (Thursday) night.”
And this from Aylesworth: “I am a father of kids 5 and 3 years old, and I know it would be heartbreaking if they got all dressed up and they show up on someone's doorstep and they come up empty.
“People​​​ preparing for trick-or-treaters on Saturday will already have a supply on hand, so the kids might get an early treat. That would be the nice, neighborly thing to do, if at all possible.”
Penacook was supplied and ready to go on Oct. 30. Penacook is always ready to go the day before Halloween, declared by its officials to help police monitor that area before shifting their focus to Concord the next day.
Kerri Broas, 40, grew up in Penacook and graduated from Merrimack Valley High School. I found her Wednesday on Abbott Street, wearing cat ears and fully prepared with a wagon, glow sticks, socks, jackets, umbrellas, flashlights and juice boxes.
Her son, 8-year-old Ethan Broas, had a combo costume, mixing the Joker and Pennywise. His face was powder white, his hair clown red.
Kerri, a nurse, took the day off to walk with her son and his friends during their version of Halloween. She's working on Oct. 31 so other parents can take their children out on the day labeled Halloween.
“I'm glad,” Kerri said. “It's going to rain tomorrow.”

Texto completo: The Manchester Lions recently hosted its annual Spirit of America Foundation Awards. David Worthing, vice president of the Maine State Spirit of America and chairman of the Manchester Spirit of America, presented the awards to Jack Schrader, Rebecca Pushard, Erika Shaw and Stella Lauter.
Schrader was recognized as a real hero for 53 years by donating blood. He gives blood as often as he can and has given more than 14 gallons since 1965, when he was motivated to donate blood by his brother serving in Vietnam. When he’s not donating blood, he is a ham radio operator, volunteers at the PALS cat shelter, delivers Meals on Wheels and an active member of the Manchester Historical Society, according to a news release from the lions club.
Pushard is active in the community as well as a business owner of MIKA Fit, which has both after school programs and summer programs for children. She is active at VA Togus helping veterans by fundraising and collecting donations for programs to help veterans. She has been a valuable asset to the Manchester Lions and the Manchester community in different events. She helps coordinates a V2K each year at VA Togus and holds an annual Trunk or Treat at the MIKA Parking Area where families from many communities participate in this event.
Shaw has worked tirelessly fundraising for the families with children in the community for about seven years. Having fundraisers year-round enables her to fund school photos, pay lunch accounts, buy school supplies and Christmas gifts, just to name a few projects she supports. Shopping for the best deal helps make her efforts go further.
Her latest endeavor is becoming a Wish Granter for the Make a Wish Foundation.
Lauter is a student at Maranacook High School. Over the past three years she has been actively volunteering for the Manchester Lions Club. Each meeting she helps prepare, serve and clean up after the suppers that are held for the club members. She also is available to help at Lions events.

Dana Wilde: The ghosts of October

Texto completo: Right at the end of October, when the woods and fields look this bare and lifeless, the ancient Celts saw the end of the year, writes Dana Wilde.
Now the long decline toward winter has ceased being an autumn flourish and started to look inevitable. The world is literally dying.
The fields that turned from May-green to midsummer rust and then to hay are now expanses of stiff, dead grass and gray goldenrod. Milkweed pods have cracked and sent off wispy seed wraiths and are shriveling on the stalks.
The trees look like gray skeletons. Bony limbs and bare trunks stretching up hillsides and into untold miles of woods — you can’t quite believe winter could undo so many so completely. But there they are by the thousands, sapless and naked, empty and deep at the same time, as if keeping something back. The firs and spruces seem clothed for the coming cold, but the maple, birch and ironwood leaves are strewn on the ground ready to return to dirt.
The leaves die by a process called senescence — which means growing old — brought on by declines in daylight and warmth. With less light, the tree manufactures less chlorophyll, which in summer makes the leaves green. Other chemicals also slow production, and cells between the base of the leaf and twig start to die. The dead cells thicken until they’re brittle, and the leaf breaks off. A large maple tree can lose a quarter million leaves. When they’re gone just the skeleton of limbs and branches remains, except for some whose marcescent leaves, like on oaks and beeches, cling to the twigs well into winter. No less lifeless, though. Leaf ghosts.
The effect of this on your eye is a premonition of winter that turns into a chill in your spine. Winter bears an uncanny resemblance to death, or an idea we have of death, none of us having experienced it yet. That we remember, anyway. Or maybe we do. Right at the end of October, when the woods and fields look this bare and lifeless, the ancient Celts saw the end of the year. The next
day began their new year and in Christianity became All Saints Day. And that night before became “All Hallow’s Eve,” which we shorten to Halloween.
The Celts called it Samhain, and held a festival of the dead. It was thought that in the transition from the death of the old year to the birth of the new, the boundary between the otherworld, where the departed spirits dwell, and the natural world, where we live, thinned to brittle and broke. The spirits of the dead could cross over to the world of the living, and vice versa, in that weird moment. To stave off whisperings that could harrow up your soul or freeze young blood, people in places like Scotland and Ireland impersonated the departed with masks and odd clothing. Large turnips were carved with faces as sentinels to scare off spirits. Later in North America, pumpkins worked even better.
Here in the 21st century world of commerce and relaxed religion, All Hallows’ Eve has shriveled into a lark for children. But still, the natural ghosts of goldenrod and naked maples lurk all around like departed spirits. There are times when you could almost think that just unseen in the woods there toward the cemetery, or trapped in the attic making rustling sounds, an apparition in the shape of a skeleton like a pile of dishes or a chandelier, with tongues of fire licking along its upper teeth and smoke rolling in its eye sockets, had crossed to where it shouldn’t be.
Or shouldn’t it? Can’t we know what the dead are keeping back? Yes, the dead are keeping something back. It happens every year, it’s inevitable and all around us. You can see it there in the woods.

Texto completo: This week, Lucky interviews Debra Susi, who has worked at the Waterville Opera House for 18 years and is presenting the musical "Newsies".
As I was checking the website of the Waterville Opera House, I noticed that they were presenting one of my favorite musicals: Disney’s “Newsies,” so a plan to interview the director was hatched. In searching out information on the production, I saw what seemed to be a very familiar name: Debra Susi. A phone interview was arranged, and the first question was based on my life 20 years ago, when I lived in Pittsfield and taught art at Warsaw Middle School.
Q: Now, we did teach together, right?
Susi: Yes, we certainly did.
Q: How long were you at Warsaw after I retired?
Susi: Oh, gosh, I left Warsaw five years ago. So I was there for a while and I am now teaching at the high school, at Maine Central Institute. At Warsaw, I was teaching math and science after they cut the theater program. Then the opportunity came to jump up to the high school when they were looking for a theater teacher. I took it.
Q: So how does all this balance out as far as what you do with the Waterville Opera House and the productions they do there?
Susi: Well, it’s great. We don’t have a theater at MCI, as you know, and haven’t had one for years (we still perform in a gym), so the Opera House has been a learning lab for my students and surrounding students. I get to network my technicians and my actors. In fact, on Tuesday, I’ll be taking two classes, Tech 1 and Tech 2, down to the Waterville Opera House to work on the “Newsies” set. It’s an actual learning lab, and we’ve had this partnership for probably four to five years now and my students get a chance to work side-by-side with professionals in the field in a variety of different areas of production. In fact, my Tech 1 and Tech 2 students are costume-designing “Newsies.”
Q: Cool!
Susi: It’s so cool, watching them research that time period and trying to understand what went on back then. As I’m sure you know, it’s based on a real strike that happened for two weeks in July of 1899. There are real-life characters based in that story, and the students are understanding the correlation and making the big leap between the actual events back then and today. Any time I can get my students to live history by actually researching it and telling a story, I’m happy. It makes me happy.
Q: How long have you been working at the Opera House?
Susi: I’ve been working there for going on 18 years now. I probably view Waterville as much as my hometown because it’s my artistic heart and the opportunities that I’ve had down there in that community. I’ve been creating community and the opportunities that I’ve had for students and for community members to share talent. The talent and the skills we have in the central Maine area just blows my mind, Lucky.
Q: Now, because of the story line of “Newsies”, the use of area high school students is logical, but do you use that age group in all of your productions?
Susi: No, not always.
Q: How many productions do you have planned for the current season?
Susi: We have two musicals and three straight shows that we’ll be producing. That’s pretty standard, but sometimes we extend a little bit beyond that. With all of the movies and concerts and comedians that come into the Waterville Opera House now, compared to when I started 18 years ago, the Opera House and the organization looks very different. We’re now under the Waterville Creates! umbrella and that’s a large, creative organization with a mission and vision to expand arts and the creative arts industry in the central Maine region.
Q: Are those five shows you have planned all you can do in one season?
Susi: About six productions, maximum, is what we can do per year for shows. The stage is just busy, busy, busy!

Texto completo: Four central Maine residents said they spend hundreds of dollars and countless hours decorating their homes to make Halloween special for local children.

As ghosts and ghouls prepare to roam central Maine streets on Halloween, inflatable decorations, mock graveyards and animatronic villains are haunting the lawns of numerous homes.
Four homeowners with lavishly decorated lawns said this week that their decoration collections grow every year and help make Halloween special for area children.
Stefan Johansen, owner of the home at 7 Hathorn St. in Richmond, said it takes 40 to 50 hours to set up all of his decorations. He said he started 15 years ago because he wanted to make Halloween more special for local trick-or-treaters.
Johansen’s set-up has a few more spooky twists that other yards, including a spider that jumps toward people who move toward it, and a man that bounces up and down as if he were being electrocuted. Most of the decorations, he said, came from after-Halloween sales.
He said younger children are a little apprehensive of his home after they walk past the graveyard and the animatronic figures on the porch.
“The ones that have been here now for a few years, they’re getting a little more comfortable,” Johansen said. “The ones that are really little that have never been here, they’ll make it to the steps and they’ll stop. They don’t dare to come up here.”
He said older people also enjoy the decorations. His home is on the same street as Richmond Eldercare, and residents will often walk by his home and ask about the decorations.
“It’s gotten to the point that the older people come down every year and if we haven’t gotten our decorations up … on time they are like: ‘Is something wrong?’” Johansen said.
Across the river in Randolph, Shawn Libby’s lawn at 20 Kinderhook St. is filled with a number of inflatable decorations. He said the inflatables are a little easier to set up, only taking him about three hours to set up a 10-foot tall demon and a 3-foot tall Minion, among others. He moved into the house two years ago and began decorating last year, which he always wanted to do. He said many homes on Kinderhook Street don’t give candy to trick-or-treaters on Halloween, but he still gets about 50 guests each year.
Libby said he’s spent more than $1,000 on the decorations and he has “no regrets.”
“I’m going to make it bigger next year,” he laughed.
Johansen said it was important for him to contribute to the community on Halloween through his decorations, which was a common theme for the other decorators. Till Hoffmann of Hallowell told the Kennebec Journal that the day is centered around making people happy and hasn’t fallen victim to any divides in culture.
“Even as an adult, you can be a kid a little bit,” he said. “One of the things I really like about it is that it hasn’t been politicized.”
Hoffmann, who lives at 14 Middle St. in Hallowell, said his set-up started “very innocently” five years ago with a couple of cardboard cutouts of ghosts. Since then, it has grown to include a number of inflatables, including a shark in the middle of consuming a person, and a group of animatronic zombies that spit smoke out of their mouths. A father of three, he said he even made technological improvements this year, opting to buy wireless plugs so the inflatables can be activated from inside, instead of going outside to individually plug them all in.
“Every other trip to Lowe’s over the years, another big blow-up would come home,” Hoffman said, adding that he feels pressure to add on to the ensemble each year. “It’s probably gotten out-of-hand a little bit, but it’s innocent fun.
“We have three young kids and they get excited about it and it puts a smile on people’s faces when they drive by,” he added. “All the parents from school tell me their kids make them take detours so they drive by the house.”
Across the street from the Chelsea Town Office, at 567 Togus Road, Billie Ellis has created a dragon-centric scene with an inflatable dragon and vulture and two meticulously hand-painted, hand-cut plywood dragons. She said the dragons took about three weeks to complete.
“I love to do arts and crafts,” Ellis said. “It’s so much fun to see the kids’ eyes go crazy (when they see the decorations).”
Another attraction is the graveyard with dozens of funny headstones, like one that references Lizzie Borden, who was accused, then acquitted of two murders in Massachusetts in 1892. A set of headstones “Lizzie Borden’s father lies here,” and others nearby others say “and here.”
Her home is by Chelsea Elementary School and Ellis said school buses usually slow down at her property so children can look at the decorations. She said she puts the decorations up a month in advance of Halloween, adding that it makes the occasion special for more than just one night.
Ellis said some of the items that didn’t make the cut were decorative nooses and a guillotine. She said the theme usually changes each year and it’s a secret until then, but said she always wanted to do something related to “Godzilla.”
“We have a back shed that’s just filled with Halloween things,” she said.

2 killed in wrong-way crash on Route 1 Two people were killed when a wrong-way driver clipped a box truck before slamming head-on into another car on Route 1 early Saturday, according to State Police. Minutes after 3:30 a.m., when troopers received calls about a wrong-way driver heading south on the northbound side of Route 1 in Peabody, a Chevrolet Impala driven by a Lynn man crashed into oncoming traffic and burst into flames near the Army Barracks store, State Police spokesman David Procopio said in a statement. The driver, 29-year-old Luis Gallego, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the statement. An unidentified woman who was a passenger in the car Gallego struck, a 2018 Dodge Journey, was taken to MelroseWakefield Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, Procopio said. The driver of the Dodge SUV, a 51-year-old Peabody man, was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital with serious injuries, Procopio said. The driver of the box truck was not injured, he said.
Everett
Man fatally struck crossing Route 16 A 62-year-old Melrose man who was struck by a car while running across Route 16 Friday night died at CHA Everett Hospital from his injuries, State Police said in a statement. The man and a woman were crossing westbound lanes at the intersection with Vine Street when he was struck by a 2012 Dodge Charger at about 9:30 p.m. The woman was not hit. “Preliminary investigation indicates that the pedestrians were crossing against the pedestrian signals at the intersection," State Police said. The driver, a 24-year-old man from Utah, stayed at the scene and cooperated with police. He had been driving westbound, and traffic had a green light at the intersection, according to the statement. The crash remains under investigation.
Marlboro, Vt.
Lynn man faces drunken driving charge A Lynn man was arrested after allegedly driving drunk and crashing on Route 9 on Friday night, according to Vermont State Police. Ronald Joseph Owens, 58, had veered from the road around 7:47 p.m., State Police said in a statement. Owens was allegedly “consuming intoxicants" and was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, State Police said. He sustained minor injuries in the crash, and his 2011 Cadillac STS had minor damage, according to the statement. Owens was released with a criminal citation and is scheduled to appear in Superior Court in Brattleboro on Sept. 17.
York, Maine
Horse tests positive for EEE The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention says a horse in York County tested positive for the mosquito-borne viral disease Eastern equine encephalitis. The horse, which had not been vaccinated against the disease, was euthanized. It was the first detected case of EEE in a horse in Maine since 2013. EEE, which can also infect humans, is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, says the case of the York County horse shows the virus is present in Maine. Shah says people in Maine should take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites "while enjoying themselves this holiday weekend." The last human case of EEE in Maine was in 2005. (AP)
Bar Harbor, Maine
3 die in car accident at Acadia The National Park Service says three people are dead and a fourth injured following a roll-over crash in Acadia National Park in Maine. The crash on the Park Loop Road in Bar Harbor was reported at about 3 a.m. Saturday. Responders found three occupants of the vehicle deceased. The fourth was transported to Mount Desert Island Hospital. The names of the victims were not released. There is no word on the condition of the survivor of the crash, which is being investigated by the National Park Service, Bar Harbor Police, and the Hancock County Sheriff's department. (AP)

Texto completo: Dear Abby: I have known this man, “Finn,” for years. We grew up together. He was the annoying boy on the playground who turned into my first love when we were in college.
We live in different states now, so we have grown distant, although we still talk on holidays and birthdays.
It’s been quite a while since we were together, but I still can’t get over him. I haven’t tried to find another guy because I know he will be second to Finn, and that’s not fair to him.
Is it weird that I still go to text Finn when something big happens but realize I can’t, or that I dream about us still? How do I get over a guy I love and only broke up with because he didn’t want to move? I will never go back to our hometown. It was an awful place. So what do I do?
Trying Not to Love Him
Dear Trying: Here’s what you do. Accept the fact that Finn is a “married man”: Someone wedded to his hometown, which you have long outgrown. Then stop idealizing a person who didn’t value your relationship enough to consider relocating with you.
And finally, accept the reality that this wasn’t meant to be. Allow yourself the opportunity to meet eligible men and quit comparing them to someone you have placed on such a high pedestal that they cannot compete.
Dear Abby: My 24-year-old son is a good young man and mostly responsible and mature, except in one area. He fails to see the importance of keeping up regular oil changes on his two vehicles that were passed down to him.
I keep track of when he’s had the last oil change, and I start reminding him at the time they are due. I tell him to make an appointment, he says “I will,” but when asked later, he says he hasn’t.
I have tried to tell him how important it is. I’ve even made the appointment and taken the vehicles in myself. What can I do to get him to take care of this responsibility by himself?
Nagging Mother in Wisconsin
Dear Mother: The way for your son to learn that lesson is for you to stop nagging and let him suffer the consequences for his irresponsibility. You may have helped the cars by taking them in, but you did not help your son.
Dear Abby: One of my sisters is visiting our place and staying at our house for four nights. She always brings presents for us when she comes. However, the items are partly used or carry no tags or seals.
My other sisters feel the same as I do about it, but no one ever says anything. I am torn between staying silent or speaking out once and for all in plain English. What should I do?
Tagless in Maine
Dear Tagless: When someone is a houseguest – even a relative – good manners dictate that a small gift is in order.
By small gift, I mean a bouquet of flowers, a bottle of wine, a box of nuts or candy. Your sister is either unaware of the social graces, financially strapped or rude. Accept the “gift” graciously but suggest that next time a bottle of wine or some flowers would be appreciated.

Electric bikes soon to be humming along national park trails

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Motorized electric bicycles may soon be humming along serene trails in national parks and other public lands nationwide. It’s part of a new Trump administration order – hotly opposed by many outdoors groups – that will allow e-bikes on every federal trail where a regular bike can go.
Sales of the bikes, powered by both pedals and battery-driven small motors, are booming, and some aging or less fit people have sought the rule change. It will allow them to whirr up and down biking trails in the country’s roughly 400 national parks and other federally managed backcountry areas.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt signed the order without fanfare Thursday, classifying e-bikes as non-motorized bikes.
The e-bikes “make bicycle travel easier and more efficient, and they provide an option for people who want to ride a bicycle but might not otherwise do so because of physical fitness, age, disability or convenience,” National Park Service Deputy Director P. Daniel Smith said in a statement Friday.
Welcoming the change in Bar Harbor, Maine, on Friday, Gordon Goodwin, 69, said he and his wife look forward to riding the 57 miles (92 kilometers) of carriage paths that meander throughout Acadia National Park.
The paths, offering stunning views of lakes, mountains, forests and the ocean, are popular with bicyclists, but e-bikes have had to stay on the park’s roads instead.
“We’re stoked. We’re really stoked,” Goodwin said. “There’s just too much traffic on the main park roads that you can’t enjoy them. It’ll be great to get in the park and see nature and all that stuff.”
But more than 50 hiking, horse-riding and other outdoor and conservation associations, including the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and Pacific Crest Trail Association, objected in a July letter to the Interior Department. They say the administration is fundamentally changing the nature of national parks with little or no public notice or study.
“If you’re hiking on a trail in Utah and you’re rounding a bend and something’s coming at you at 20 mph, that really changes the experience,” said Kristen Brengel, a vice president of the National Parks Conservation Association, a nonprofit that advocates for the national park system.
“It’s pretty jarring” to those who take to public lands to escape city noise and stress for nature, Brengel said. “You’re adding significant speed and a throttle to those trails.”
E-bikes are the fastest-growing segment of the bicycle industry, with U.S. sales jumping 72% to $144 million last year, according to the NPD Group, which tracks bike sales. The motorized bikes are popular with commuters and aging baby boomers who might not otherwise get out on a bicycle.
The bikes, which can cost $2,000 or more, combine the frame of a regular bike with lightweight batteries and electric motors.
In parks and other public lands as on city streets and sidewalks, people moving on vehicles powered by electric or gasoline engines frequently jostle for the right of way with people on foot or traditional bikes. In the National Park Service, officials over the decades have tried to carefully sort out rules and systems to minimize conflicts.
In their letter, the outdoor groups complained the decision to allow motorized bikes on bike trails breaks with policies dating back to the early 1970s confining cars, dirt bikes, all-terrain vehicles and all other motorized vehicles to roads and designated areas or trails on public lands.
Interior’s order allows motorized bikes that can go up to 28 mph to be classified as regular bikes.
“Parks are already having a shortage of staffs and rangers,” said Randy Rasmussen, whose organization, Back Country Horsemen of America, opposes the rules. “And now what: they’re supposed to be out there with radar guns? It’s unenforceable.”
He suspects riders going faster than permitted will create dangerous encounters with spooked horses.
The Interior statement said riders must use the motor only to boost their pedaling on the trails, and not zip along on motor power alone.
Bernhardt’s order gave agency officials 30 days to come up with public guidance on how the new policy will be carried out by the National Park and National Wildlife Refuge systems, and on land overseen by the Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Reclamation.
The National Park Service said in a statement that public comment would be sought as it works to develop a revised rule on bicycle use.
Ashley Korenblat, an advocate for preserving public lands and CEO of Western Spirit Cycling in Moab, Utah, saw several upsides.
E-bikes could lead to fewer cars at congested national parks, she said. The bikes are quiet, not much faster than regular bikes and allow people who otherwise couldn’t physically ride to go cycling.
“You can bring grandma and a 7-year-old and the whole group will be able to stay together,” said Korenblat.
Adam Gariepy, manager of the Bar Harbor Bicycle Shop, said Friday he’s “tentatively happy” about the new rules. But he has reservations because some e-bikes like his can reach around 28 mph, he said. That speed could be dangerous on trails that have a mix of bicycle riders, horses and carriages, hikers, families and pets.
“It’s a two-edged sword. It’ll be great for older folks who are afraid of the hills and want to continue riding. But there should be some speed limit with them,” he said.
Park Service Deputy Director Smith said the parks “should be responsive to visitors’ interest in using this new technology wherever it is safe and appropriate to do.”
But Brengel, the parks conservation association official, noted the order comes in a season when thousands of volunteers with trail groups have been in the parks all summer improving trails.
“You put a policy out like this, and it’s a slap in the face,” she said.

Texto completo: Dear Abby: I have known this man, "Finn, for years. We grew up together. He was the annoying boy on the playground who turned into my first love when we were in college. We live in different states now, so we have grown distant, although we still talk on holidays and birthdays.
It's been quite a while since we were together, but I still can't get over him. I haven't tried to find another guy because I know he will be second to Finn, and that's not fair to him.
Is it weird that I still go to text Finn when something big happens but realize I can't, or that I dream about us still? How do I get over a guy I love and only broke up with because he didn't want to move? I will never go back to our hometown. It was an awful place. So what do I do? - Trying Not To Love Him
Dear Trying: Here's what you do. Accept the fact that Finn is a "married man - someone wedded to his hometown, which you have long outgrown. Then stop idealizing a person who didn't value your relationship enough to consider relocating with you. And finally, accept the reality that this wasn't meant to be. Allow yourself the opportunity to meet eligible men and quit comparing them to someone you have placed on such a high pedestal that they cannot compete.
Dear Abby: My 24-year-old son is a good young man and mostly responsible and mature, except in one area. He fails to see the importance of keeping up regular oil changes on his two vehicles that were passed down to him.
I keep track of when he's had the last oil change, and I start reminding him at the time they are due. I tell him to make an appointment, he says "I will, but when asked later, he says he hasn't. I have tried to tell him how important it is. I've even made the appointment and taken the vehicles in myself. What can I do to get him to take care of this responsibility by himself? - Nagging Mother in Wisconsin
Dear Mother: The way for your son to learn that lesson is for you to stop nagging and let him suffer the consequences for his irresponsibility. You may have helped the cars by taking them in, but you did not help your son.
Dear Abby: One of my sisters is visiting our place and staying at our house for four nights. She always brings presents for us when she comes. However, the items are partly used or carry no tags or seals.
My other sisters feel the same as I do about it, but no one ever says anything. I am torn between staying silent or speaking out once and for all in plain English. What should I do? - Tagless in Maine
Dear Tagless: When someone is a houseguest - even a relative - good manners dictate that a small gift is in order. By small gift, I mean a bouquet of flowers, a bottle of wine, a box of nuts or candy. Your sister is either unaware of the social graces, financially strapped or rude. Accept the "gift graciously but suggest that next time a bottle of wine or some flowers would be appreciated.

Texto completo: The day West Virginia University football fans have been waiting for since last December is finally here.
Saturday marks the start of the 2019 college football season, which is reason enough to circle the date on your calendar, but this opener is a bit different for the Mountaineers.
Neal Brown, the 39-year-old Kentuckian who first found success as an assistant coach at places like Kentucky and Texas Tech before doing the same as the head coach at Troy University, will make his debut as the WVU head coach when the Mountaineers host Football Championship Subdivision power James Madison at Milan Puskar Stadium (2 p.m., TV: AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh).
Brown was hired in January after Dana Holgorsen, who served as the West Virginia head coach for eight seasons, departed the program to take the same job at the University of Houston following the 2018 campaign. After a brief search, the WVU administration settled on Brown. Since then, the new Mountaineer coach has done nothing short of win the offseason. Brown has spent a lot of his time since January winning over a fan base that felt, at times, neglected by the previous coach.
At Big 12 Media Days last month in Texas, Brown was asked why he thought the WVU fans had taken such a quick liking to him.
"I think it's because we're undefeated," Brown deadpanned.
Jokes aside, now the hard part begins for Brown, and JMU figures to provide a stern test in his debut game for West Virginia. The Dukes, like WVU, are breaking in a new coach. Curt Cignetti, a Morgantown High graduate as well as a former Mountaineer quarterback and son of ex-West Virginia coach Frank Cignetti, took over at JMU this offseason after a successful run as the head coach at Elon.
"I'm sure this is a special game for him for a variety of reasons ," Brown said of Cignetti. "When you look at it offensively, when James Madison has the ball, Coach Cignetti is a guy that has an offensive background. I thought they did a really good job last year at Elon, and then their [offensive coordinator] is Shane Montgomery. He's been a head coach, been an offensive coordinator for a long time. He's had several successful runs as a coordinator.
JMU has been a fixture in the FCS playoffs in recent years, winning two national titles (2004 and 2016) as well as a runner-up finish in 2017. With a wealth of experience back from 2018, expectations are high for James Madison this season.
"Preseason, depending on what magazine or what poll you're looking at, they're either first or second in FCS," Brown said of James Madison. "They return 20 of 22 starters and [are] a veteran football team. Probably as much experience as any team I've lined up and played against as an assistant or a head coach."
Brown said any season opener can be especially challenging to prepare for, but this one against JMU has a few added layers to it.
"The challenges are significant, I think, in any first game because even if you're playing somebody who has been there for a while, everybody changes in the offseason as you study and learn," Brown said. "I think it's a challenge for them just like it's a challenge for us. We're sitting here watching film from where Cignetti was last year at Elon. We're watching film from where the offensive coordinator was at Charlotte. We're watching film from where the defensive coordinator was at Maine. The special teams coordinator was at Mercer. Then, oh by the way, you've got to watch the JMU personnel. So there is a lot going on in your head while you watch it. They're going through he same thing, too."
Brown won't be the only one making his debut for WVU on Saturday. The Mountaineers suffered significant losses due to graduation, early departures for the NFL and transfers this offseason. Oklahoma graduate transfer Austin Kendall, who was the backup for Sooner Heisman Trophy winners Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray each of the last two seasons, came to WVU in January after Brown's arrival and was named West Virginia's starting quarterback last week. The Mountaineers will also need to replace linebacker David Long, the 2018 Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year and current Tennessee Titan, though the staff has indicated they feel pretty good about how sophomore Josh Chandler has stepped into that role. Those are just two examples of many.
"I think what happens in these opening games is you go back to your strengths," Brown said. "Whatever you feel like your players do well, that's what you try to emphasize early on."
So what are West Virginia's strengths? Brown has been a fan of WVU's running backs since the spring and that did not change during preseason camp. The Mountaineer receivers, though in some cases inexperienced, have drawn praise during camp. On the defensive side of things, West Virginia thinks it has a pretty good group of defensive linemen who can help mask some youth and inexperience in the secondary.
"We're going to be a young football team," Brown said at Big 12 Media Days. "I think our fan base understands that and there's going to be some patience."

Par for the Course: Will Kannegieser gets another opportunity, wins Match Play

Texto completo: All that Will Kannegieser wanted was a chance to win the Maine State Golf Match Play Invitational Tournament Aug. 27-29 at Point Sebago.
“I was just hoping to get another opportunity,” he said, referring to his 2016 loss to Matt Hutchins in the Match Play Invitational final. “Today was that opportunity.”
<img class="wp-image-5701628 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Bill-Kennedy_2018-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />
Aug. 29 was “today,” when Kannegieser made a birdie putt on the 22nd hole to capture his first MSGA major adult solo title, after having won the Mixed championship the past two years with his mother, Kristen Kannegieser. He also won Maine junior crowns 2013 and 2014.
To claim the Match Play Invitational, he defeated Caleb Manuel of Brunswick, the reigning Maine State Scholastic Champion out of Mt. Ararat High School, who held a two-hole lead with three to play.
“I stuck to my game plan, even though it looked pretty grim,” Kannegieser, of Minot, said.
That plan called for not gambling on shots along with irons off the tee, and when he sunk a long birdie putt on the 16th hole to cut that lead to just one, he saw some light at the end of the tunnel.
Unfortunately, his mother and father (Marc), were not in the gallery for their son’s greatest Maine moment of triumph. They were in New York City attending the U.S. Tennis Open.
This was the final Maine golf event of the 2019 season for Will Kannegieser, who is a senior at Williams College, where he is a member of the golf and ski teams, sports in which he competed successfully at Gould Academy, from which he graduated in 2015.
With his college graduation upcoming next spring, Kannegieser was asked about his future plans.
“I’m trying to keep my options open,” he said, but playing golf for financial purses is not one of them. “Pro golf, definitely no. I have seen first-hand what it takes and I don’t have it. I am not close to that level of consistency, but I respect people who try.”
Well said, by a clearly grounded young man.
*****
In all, 10 area players were in the Invitational field, but only two made it through the first day, with just one playing for the championship.
Kannegieser had topped Ricky Jones of Samoset Resort, 2&1 in the quarterfinal, before eliminating James Frost Jr. of Val Halla, 3&2, in the semifinal round.
Another Martindale player, Brian J. Bilodeau, suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of Mike Arsenault Jr. of Val Halla in a match which went 20 holes.
In second round matches, Ashley Field of Martindale was ousted by Joe Alvarez of Webhannet, 5&4, after beating Peter Wright of Biddeford-Saco, 3&1, in the opening round. Craig Chapman of Martindale was ousted by Forest, 3&1, after downing Garrett Olson of Brunswick 2-up in the first round.
Jeff Cole of Martindale lost to Bilodeau, 2-up, after he had overcome Mike McNaboe of Falmouth 2-up in the initial round. Andrew Slattery of Martindale lost to Kannegeiser, 1-up, after he had conquered Mike Doran of Brunswick, 6&5, in the opening round.
Four players were eliminated in their first match. Jace Pearson of Martindale lost 2&1 to Alvarez; Sokha Meas of Spring Meadows was eliminated by Tim Desmarais of Riverside, 3&2; Bob Langlois of Fox Ridge was edged by Jones, 1-up; and Timothy Doyle of Turner Highlands was beaten by Joe Hamilton of Biddeford-Saco, 2&1.
*****
Seven Mainers were among 21 qualifiers for the New England Senior Amateur Tournament Aug. 26 at Riverside.
Keith Patterson of Biddeford-Saco (73), Scott Mangiafico of York (74), Mike O’Brien of Biddeford-Saco (75), Zibby Puleio of Old Marsh (75), Cash Wiseman of Falmouth (76), Patrick Keeley of Woodlands (77) and Don Bellemare of Biddeford-Saco (77) will be in the Sept. 18-19 event at Biddeford-Saco.
*****
As we approach fall, the MSGA schedule tapers off in junior play only.
A Senior tour event is Sept. 3 at Purpoodock and the Weekend tour is Sept. 6-7 at Natanis.
On the women’s side, there are gross and net events Sept. 3 at Bath and Bangor Municipal.

During his 1972 presidential race, Maine’s Edmund Muskie faced at least three death threats

Texto completo: Federal Bureau of Investigation records released Friday show that three times in early 1972 federal investigators probed threats to kill U.S. Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine, at the time a leading contender within the Democratic Party for president.
It doesn’t appear from the 1,038 pages of material released to the Sun Journal that the FBI ever tracked down two of the culprits. Federal prosecutors opted not to charge the other, a mentally ill man quickly found by agents.
<img class="wp-image-9074703" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/Muskie-Time.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="326" />
The information, sought via a Freedom of Information request for anything in FBI files related to Muskie, contained little about the former senator himself. Muskie was a former Maine governor, Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1968 and U.S. secretary of state during the final year of President Jimmy Carter’s administration.
One memorandum shows that Carter notified the FBI on April 30, 1980, that he intended to nominate Muskie to replace his current secretary of state, Cyrus Vance. Field offices were told to expedite efforts to probe the Rumford, Maine, native’s background.
Agents quickly fanned out to talk with friends and family members and look at Muskie’s military records from World War II, among other things.
The memo to agents said that Muskie “will be required to make decisions concerning policy and personnel matters; therefore, during interviews, determine if appointee has expressed or manifested any bias or prejudice against any class of citizen, or any religious, racial or ethnic group. Also determine if appointee uses illegal drugs or abuses alcohol.”
Only one negative thing turned up, records show: On Dec. 28, 1965, in the tiny town of Centreville on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, Muskie was issued a criminal summons at Broadwater Farms for “attempting to take migratory water fowl with the aid of bait.”
Muskie paid the $25 fine and $2.50 administrative charge before having a guilty verdict entered on the charge in 1966. It was the only charge against Muskie that investigators unearthed and didn’t have any impact on his appointment.
Muskie was confirmed for the diplomatic post by a vote of 96-2 in the U.S. Senate on May 8, 1980.
Muskie had long been in the public eye by then, especially from the time he ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 1968 through his failed presidential bid in 1972, a period when he pushed through both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
That national attention no doubt played a role in the decision by an unknown letter writer in Bryantown, Maryland, to include him among four prominent Democrats who would allegedly be blown to bits in their Capitol Hill offices on May 4, 1972.
Bomb threats were taken seriously even in those less security-conscious days. A major blast in 1971 in the Capitol had caused serious damage, though no injuries.
Handwritten letters were dropped into a post office box addressed to Muskie and fellow U.S. Sens. George McGovern of South Dakota and Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. The notes to each said they were slated to die along with U.S. House Speaker Carl Albert.
<img class="wp-image-9074807 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/Letter-to-Muskie-re-bomb-1972.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="475" />
The letter to Muskie, opened the morning of May 4 in his office, told him the men would be killed “in your own offices.”
“The bomb is supposed to be dynamite, with a contact fuse,” the writer claimed in the note to Muskie. “It is pre-planned & the bomb is to be placed under chairs.”
“We hope this is not going to happen, but we really hope you will check,” the letter said, claiming it had been dictated by the Ouija Board.
The FBI managed to pull a couple of fingerprints off the envelope but could not match them with anyone. There is no indication in the file that agents ever found who sent the letters, who may have also sent threatening notes months earlier to Kennedy, President Richard Nixon, The New York Times and The Boston Globe.
In January 1972, letters signed by a G.C. Carlton in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, told Muskie, Kennedy and U.S. Sen. Edward Brooks of Massachusetts they should be shot.
In the note to Muskie, the writer said, after offering an uncharitable view of the senator’s wife, that the lawmaker “should be deported to Poland or Rome.”
<img class="wp-image-9074827" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/Muskie-envelope-2.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="141" />
“Somebody should fill you and the bastard harp Kennedy full of lead,” the letter read before it turned even more profane, ending with the insistence that both Kennedy and Muskie should “rot in hell.”
The FBI managed to find a few aliases from the same writer — his language was a dead giveaway — but appears to have had no success in determining his real identity.
The investigation ceased after an assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia ruled on Feb. 24, 1972, that the letter to Muskie “does not constitute a threat within the meaning and intent” of the relevant federal statute.
That same month, a caller who phoned a number of media outlets, including United Press International in the wee hours of the morning, claimed both Muskie and Alabama Gov. George Wallace had been targeted by something called the Black Underground Military for Justice, a group that authorities knew nothing about.
Agents soon tracked him down, discovering he was someone they’d spoken with before who had a mental illness and had provided useless information in other incidents. In person, he admitted he made it all up so the matter was dropped.
Muskie died in 1996 at the age of 81.

Janice Small-LeClair will remember her hourlong motorcycle ride Saturday through Lewiston, Greene, Turner and around Lake Auburn.
For as long as she can.
Small-LeClair, 73, is showing early signs of Alzheimer’s disease and her family has pushed along activities that she might enjoy before her decline in memory progresses.
Last week it was a trip to Bailey Island and this week it was a ride on the back of a Harley-Davidson trike (a motorcycle with three wheels).
<img class="wp-image-9116243 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/9081511_SJ.CIThogRide2P.090119.jpg" alt="" width="1503" height="1000" />
Small-LeClair, of Minot, had friends during her high school days at Edward Little in Auburn who had motorcycles. “I never drove one before, but I rode on the back all the time,” she said.
“It’s all she has been talking about is bikes, bikes, bikes,” said Small-LeClair’s sister, Beverly Small. “She probably figured that she would never get to do it again.”
Small-LeClair’s passion gave her daughter, Lindie LeClair, an idea.
Before reaching out to friends on Facebook, Lindie LeClair approached Lewiston-Auburn Harley Davidson about the possibility of putting her mother on the back of a trike for a ride.
“I immediately said, ‘Yeah, I’m more than happy to make it happen,'” said Frank Welch Jr., a part-time employee at L-A Harley and the director of the Mid-Maine Lewiston HOG (Harley Owners Group) Chapter, a group of dedicated riders.
<img class="wp-image-9116259 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/9081511_SJ.CIThogRide4P.090119.jpg" alt="" width="1503" height="1000" />
Welch said that such requests are not common, but when he mentioned the idea to the rest of the HOG chapter, he quickly had a dozen other riders who wanted to come along. “That’s what HOG is,” Welch said. “Riding and having fun.”
The ride was a complete surprise to Small-LeClair. “I did not know anything about it,” she said. “My boyfriend might be jealous of a nice-looking man like that giving me a ride,” she said of Welch, who also lives in Minot.
The ride lasted about an hour and covered 30 miles through Greene, along Allen Pond, over to Turner, around Lake Auburn and back to L-A Harley in Lewiston.
“She will remember this as long as she can,” Small said of her sister.

Texto completo: Coastal academy adds local bus routes
BRUNSWICK — Harpswell Coastal Academy will add bus routes to Lewiston and Lisbon for the school year.

Gov. Mills at UMF Orientation Day: Educators are important

FARMINGTON — Maine’s governor and her education commissioner had a message Saturday for students entering the University of Maine at Farmington: Education and educators are important.
“Farmington produces many public educators for the state of Maine and we want to welcome them,” said Gov. Janet Mills, a native of Farmington. “UMF is a leader of education, which makes it a critical component for the state’s public school system. When you consider that up to one-third of our public teachers are nearing retirement, it’s clear that we need more students to stay in school and more graduates to stay in Maine.”
Maine is facing a dire shortage of public educators, Education Commissioner Pender Makin said.
“We want these UMF students to know that we appreciate — whether they are majoring in education or not — those who choose to continue their schooling here. And we hope they choose to live and work in Maine once they graduate and start their own careers.
“At times we have seen public education and teachers poorly presented and poorly represented,” Makin said. “That is not the case now. Maine values the role educators play and we are turning the tide against that negative perception.”
Maine has lagged behind other states in teacher salaries. The baseline pay has not changed since 2012. This year the Maine Legislature addressed that issue in its budget by increasing starting salaries from $30,000 to $40,000, starting with the 2020 academic year. The state will help fund the extra costs to local school budgets for the first three years, with state help being incrementally stepped down each year.

Not only new students arrived Saturday. Incoming President Edward Serna and his family were on hand for their first orientation day. Cerna said moving to Farmington from Arkansas was a great decision for the family, citing its welcoming and warm community.
“I like that we can walk wherever we want to go,” said his older daughter, Anna Kate, 9. “I love Gifford’s Ice Cream, and the river, too.”
Serna recognizes UMF’s importance to Maine: 40% of UMF students are education majors. Asked about the challenge of keeping graduating students in Maine for their teaching careers, he said the university already sets the standard.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-9116207" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/IMG_0274-e1567290489584-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />
“Eighty percent of UMF students already live in Maine,” he said. “And our education majors go out and student teach in Maine schools, so we have an established in-state network for them. Our graduates easily find local schools to work in. Four of the last five Maine teachers of the year graduated from UMF. It’s a high bar for the state’s educators and school systems.”
One example of Maine’s overall education networking is freshman Hayden Thomas of Durham. For her Freeport High School senior project she job shadowed in the Windham School Department, which helped her decide to choose to attend UMF and major in elementary education. Hayden’s mother, Carmen Thomas, noted that job shadowing with another teacher gave her daughter the confidence and perspective to choose education as a career.
“I like working with kids, and I like helping them learn,” Hayden Thomas said. “And I really like Farmington. I didn’t want to go too far away, so UMF is perfect for me.”

Henry Fall transitions from an assistant golf pro to head coach at Bates College

Texto completo: <img class="size-large wp-image-9051991" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/HenryFall-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" />
Henry Fall was looking for a career changes and thought now would be a good time to get into coaching.
The timing ended up being perfect for the the 2010 graduate of Mt. Ararat High School and Brunswick resident. The Bates College golf coach job opened up, and the 2014 Elms College graduate decided he should apply. A few weeks later, he was named the new head coach of the Bobcats.
“My former golf coach (Craig Cowles) at Elms College mentioned Bates College was looking for a head coach, and like I said it was perfect timing, as I was between things,” Fall said. “I applied —coaching and instruction has been a passion of mine for the past year or so. I really put more attention to that side of the sport, that side of the industry or business of golf.
“It was a dream scenario.”
Fall’s prior experience includes working at Bath Country Club as an assistant pro for a year and half, and prior to that he had the same role at Sugarloaf.
Bates athletic director Jason Fein believes Fall’s assistant pro experience will help him transition into coaching.
“We are delighted to welcome Henry to Bates,” Fein said in a news release. “His experience as a highly competitive student-athlete as well as his teaching experience make him a superb fit to lead the Bobcats on the golf course.”
Fall takes over for James Upton, who will continue to work with the Bates Nordic ski team, and Nick Glicos, the director of golf at Martindale, where Bates plays their home matches, who acted as an assistant coach.
While the two will no longer have an official capacity with the program, they are two people who Fall will lean on, especially in the near future as the season gets underway Sept. 7.
“Coach Upton, he works with the Nordic ski program, great guy, he has been really helpful with the transition here, with a lot of behind the scenes stuff especially,” Fall said. “(Glicos) has been definitely helpful as well, and I am sure each of them will be involved one way or another here in my first season. I will definitely use all their advice as we go along here.”
Fall has already reached out to his former golf coach and other coaches around the county to guide him as he transitions to the college game.
College golf isn’t something completely new because he played four seasons at Elms and faced a lot of NESCAC schools in his playing days. He was a two-time captain at Elms (in Chicopee, Massachusetts). Elms won New England Collegiate Conference titles in his freshman and senior seasons. In his senior season in 2014, Elms went to the NCAA Division III national tournament.
Fall said his experience playing against NESCAC schools should help.
“That’s one of the things I conveyed to a few of the players, that I have played these courses,” Fall said. “I have been there; we have competed there, and we won at some of these courses.
“Having played these courses and having been successful at these courses, knowing the atmosphere that’s going to be there, I think I can speak to that. I think my experiences there are only going to help them feel comfortable and go out and play the best they can.”
Fall said he has met with five freshmen and some of the captains so far.
While golf is an individual sport, he does want the players to play for each other.
“There some things behind the scenes and on the golf course where if your team is together and there’s a sense of camaraderie, team spirit and support, that can certainly help everybody in playing better, everyone playing for each other,” Fall said. “That’s a sense of team that I want to bring as well.
“Yeah, it’s an individual sport and we are all trying to get better in that sense, whether it’s in the gym, whether it’s mentally or short game, whatever it maybe. But we also want a sense of team, we also want to play for each other, and I think that’s important to bring into any college team.”
Fall has looked up the results of the Bobcats the past few seasons. It was a mixed bag for both the men’s and women’s teams a year ago.
The men’s team won the CBB fall tournament and came in third of 10 teams at the Maine state championships, but also finished ninth of 10 teams at the NESCAC fall qualifier and 22nd of 23 teams at the NEIGA championships.
The women’s team finished third of four teams at the Bowdoin Invitational and the Bates Invitational while finishing last at the NESCAC championships.
Fall said that the Bobcats can improve.
“I think we are going to be competitive, both men and women. I think there’s room to grow. and I am excited about that,” Fall said. “I am excited to see what parts of the game we can work on, but as we get into season here, there’s not going to be a lot of dramatic changes to their game. At the end of the day, it’s having a good strategy and being in the right mental frame of mind.”

Outdoors in Maine: New commissioner Judy Camuso said she’ll stand behind hunters

Texto completo: Maine’s new fish and wildlife boss, Judy Camuso, who has been at the MDIF&W helm since January, shared her views recently as a guest on my Sunday night statewide radio program Maine Outdoors (103.9, 101.3 and 95.1 FM).
Throughout the interview, Camuso’s unbridled enthusiasm for her new job, as well as her resolve to be a leader who listens, came through loud and clear.
<img class="wp-image-2733340 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/reynolds-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" />
“I love this job!” she said.
The former wildlife director for MDIF&W, Camuso believes that she has “the best job in the world” and speaks with pride about the “professionals” who make up the department.
What are her priorities? Aware that hunting in Maine and the decline of non-resident deer hunters needs to be turned around, she hopes to address this through aggressive marketing and sound whitetail management.
“If the anti-bear hunting element from out of state makes another attempt to ban bear trapping and hunting with hounds,” I asked, “will you stand behind our trappers and houndsmen?”
Camuso was unequivocal in her answer. She said that managing growing bear populations makes it imperative to support any type of legal bear harvesting, including trapping and hunting with dogs.
She believes that the essence of her leadership role is putting the right people in the right jobs and standing behind them. Along with this, she emphasized that “good leaders listen” and she plans on making public contact as much as her job will allow.
From one listener who called in on the show, the commissioner did take some heat when it came to a longtime complaint: complicated fishing regulations. She indicated that there is more that can be done to simplify fishing regs, but that careful pond-by-pond management of Maine’s sport fishery has led to improved fishing in the past few years.
Anyone who has ever served as commissioner of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIF&W) will most likely tell you that it’s anything but dull. As a matter of fact, just about anyone who has worked for MDIF&W in the same building within earshot of the commissioner’s top floor office, will attest that there is a burden to bear for those for whom the buck stops at the Augusta fish and wildlife department.
Sportsmen and women and the organizations that represent them, as a rule, tend to know best how to manage deer populations, regulate the state’s sport fishery or control coyotes. And they are not timid about expressing their views to any sitting fish and wildlife commissioner.
Suffice to say that any commissioner worth his or her salt has to walk a tightrope trying to accommodate diverse constituencies while at the same time making hard choices, even when those choices aren’t always popular.
Historically, just about every Maine fish and wildlife commissioner has enjoyed the luxury of a so-called “honeymoon period” when new to the job. The duration of this varies but generally comes to a screeching halt when the first big hunting or fishing controversy rises to the fore.
It looks like Maine’s first female fish and wildlife leader is up to the challenge and formulating her own management style. As she well knows, Maine sportsmen are tuned in, and will be in the months and years ahead.

NORWAY — Main Street Art Gallery, 426 Main St., continues its summer season with a First Friday Reception from 5 to 7 p.m. Sept. 6. The gallery exhibits the work of fine artists and artisans living and working in Western Maine.
September’s featured artist is Jo Northrop Thomas, who works with ripped paper and actual white birch bark. Each collage contains hundreds of pieces of paper and resembles mosaic sculptures.
Her work has been exhibited and has won awards at the University of Wisconsin, University of Vermont and the Southern Adventist University in Collegedale, Tennessee.
Thomas worked as an artist, sculptor and art director for the Civic Arts League Inc. in Chattanooga for 10 years, and was a founding member of an en plein air group called The Outdoor Girls. Her work continues to be featured at several galleries in Tennessee, Georgia, Vermont and Maine.
In 2016, she won first place at the 49th annual Norway Arts Festival for her “rip and tear” art of a collage titled “Nature’s Candy.” In 2018, at the annual festival, she won an honorable mention. Last spring Thomas spent a week of en plein air painting in Monet’s Garden in Giverny, France, with artists from Hawaii, Illinois, Georgia and Tennessee. She is a member of the Western Maine Art Group, Burlington City Arts in Vermont and the Civic Arts League in Chattanooga. She continues to be inspired by friends and family and all the natural beauty that surrounds her.
The Main Street Gallery is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday.
For more information, art classes, demonstrations and special trips sponsored by the WMAG, visit westernmaineartgroup.org and on Facebook under Main Street Gallery. The galleries are free and open to the public.

He came to CMH and Lewiston in September 2016. He is looking forward to advancing CMH in its mission to provide top quality, accessible, lower cost care to Mainers.
Born in Malden, Massachusetts, and a lifelong Red Sox fan, Brickman grew up in a medical family: both his father and grandfather were doctors and one of his earliest memories is of accompanying his grandfather, a family doctor, as he made house calls. Brickman graduated from the University of Connecticut and later earned his master’s degree at Temple University.
He and his wife, Elaine, a registered nurse, live in Freeport.
L-A Rotary meets from noon to 1 p.m. Thursday at the Village Inn. Lunch is available for $14. Guests and visiting Rotarians are welcome.

Texto completo: Around the Big Sky ...
• At Vermillion, S.D., Dalton Sneed threw for a career-high 430 yards and had three passing touchdowns and another rushing to lead 25th-ranked Montana to a 31-17 win over South Dakota. Sneed was 37 of 52 with two interceptions. His 16-yard pass to Samori Toure put the Grizzlies up 7-3 and he followed with a 2-yard run to help build a 17-10 lead at the half. In the third quarter, Sneed connected with Samuel Akem for a 43-yard score and Marcus Knight from 6 yards out. Akem and Toure both had nine receptions, Akem for 158 yards and Toure for 142.
• At Lubbock, Texas, Alan Bowman was 40-for-55 yards passing for 436 yards and two touchdowns as Texas Tech routed No. 14 Montana State 45-10 in the teams' first meeting in 81 years, both decided by 35 points. Armand Shyne carred 11 times for 126 yards and a TD for the Red Raiders. MSU scored on a 31-yard pass from Casey Bauman to Coy Steel in the second quarter to trim the deficit to 14-7, but Texas Tech scored the next 24 points. Casey Bauman was 7-for-19 passing for 120 yards and the TD in his debut as Bobcats quarterback.
• At San Luis Obispo, Calif., three Jalen Hamler touchdown passes in the second quarter sparked an explosion of scoring as Cal Poly defeated San Diego 52-34. Hamler accounted for five of Cal Poly's seven touchdowns, passing for 221 yards and running for 96. His 55-yard touchdown pass to J.J. Koski early in the second quarter broke a 14-14 tie and ignited a run of 38 unanswered points.
• At Fayetteville, Ark., Arkansas put together just enough offense to beat Portland State 20-13. Arkansas compiled 395 yards of total offense, 204 on the ground. The Razorbacks were just 18 of 35 passing for 191 yards with one turnover. PSU was limited to 75 yards rushing and committed three turnovers. The Vikings pulled within 20-13 with 4:14 to play on a 32-yard pass from quarterback Jaloni Eason to tight end Charlie Taumoepeau.
• At State College, Pa., quarterback Sean Clifford had a near flawless first-half performance backed by a dominant effort from the defense that allowed Clifford to take the second half off as the 15th-ranked Nittany Lions hammered Idaho 72-7. Clifford left the game early in the third after his 14-for-23, 280-yard, two-touchdown effort.The Nittany Lions overcame early sloppiness before coasting the rest of the way to their biggest point total since an 81-0 win against Cincinnati in 1991.
• At Seattle, Jacob Eason threw for 349 yards and four touchdowns, and No. 13 Washington opened the season with a 47-14 win over FCS No. 4 Eastern Washington . Taking his first snaps since the 2017 season when he lost the starting job at Georgia to Jake Fromm, Eason showed no rust, carving up one of the top FCS programs in the country. Eason completed 27 of 36 passes and led Washington on touchdown drives on four of its first five possessions.
Around the Frontier ...
• At Caldwell, Idaho, preseason conference favorite College of Idaho ran roughshod over Eastern Oregon behind running back Nick Calzaretta and quarterback Darius Peterson in a 48-14 romp. Calzaretta ran 18 times for 124 yards and a touchdown, and Peterson carried 20 times for 114 yards and a TD while also completing 9 of 13 passes for 100 yards and a score. The Yotes, who rushed for 377 yards, led 27-0 in the third quarter. Eastern Oregon was limited to 91 yards rushing. Quarterback Kai Quinn was 17-for-35 passing for 184 yards and was intercepted twice.
Around the region ...
• At Tallahassee, Fla., Hank Bachmeier tossed a third-quarter TD pass and Robert Mahone had a 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth as Boise State rallied from an 18-point deficit to knock off Florida State 36-31. In a game moved from Jacksonville to Tallahassee due to Hurricane Dorian, Florida State squandered a 31-13 lead and lost its season opener for the third straight time. Bachmeier, a true freshman, was pounded early by Florida State's defensive front for five sacks and eight hurries. But he threw for 407 yards as Boise State defeated a Power 5 team for the sixth time since the 2014 season. It was the most passing yards by a Boise State first-time starting quarterback.

Texto completo: The Illinois State Board of Education will honor five educators from District 207 for their efforts on behalf of students at Maine East, Maine South and Maine West as part of the 45th annual Those Who Excel Awards.
Career and Technical Education Teacher Tom Kaiser from Maine East earned a meritorious award in the classroom teacher category. The ASCEND leadership team at Maine West earned a meritorious award in the team category.
Those honored at West include Assistant Principal for Student Services Dr. Claudia Rueda-Alvarez, English Department Chairman Dr. Tim Pappageorge and science teacher Nate Hassman.
Counselor Tim Spiegel at Maine South earned a recognition award in the Student Support Personnel category.
As part of Kaiser’s nomination, Maine East Principal Dr. Mike Pressler wrote: "Tom believes that all students can learn. His planning reflects differentiation, with time for students to think and process. Most importantly, Tom believes that failing is a step on the learning journey for most students, and he is there to provide support so that they are willing to keep trying."
ASCEND is a program that encourages, supports and prepares minority and other students to take challenging courses at Maine West. The initiative includes support meetings, mentoring, summer prep courses, office hours and specific check ins with students in the program.
In the nomination letter for the ASCEND team, a former student wrote: "I always thought that I would never be able to take an Advanced Placement class because it would be way too hard for me to handle. My way of thinking was the same as that of the rest of the group members. But after attending several meetings, we were prepared to take on the challenge. We always felt supported every step of the way."
As part of Spiegel’s nomination, a former student wrote: "What distinguishes Mr. Spiegel is his dedication to his students. As a counselor, Mr. Spiegel helped me to see the various educational paths I could choose to follow as a freshman, taught me time management strategies as a sophomore, was my most trusted adviser as I researched universities and internships junior year, and helped me to manage the plethora of college applications I opened senior year (including a multistep West Point application)."
The District 207 educators, along with others from across Illinois, who have made significant contributions to the state’s public and nonpublic elementary and secondary schools, will be celebrated at a statewide recognition ceremony n Oct. 19 at the Bloomington-Normal Marriott Hotel and Conference Center.

Texto completo: Mundelein was well on its way to pulling off a surprising upset against Maine West on Friday. But the game took a decisive turn when Warriors linebacker Isaiah Siem-Davis went mining for gold in the end zone.
Trailing 13-7 with time winding down in the third quarter, Maine West’s Eduardo Cisneros blocked a punt and sent the ball rolling backward into the end zone. At first, it appeared Mundelein punter Alex Wing recovered the ball for a safety. But when officials dug through the pile, Siem-Davis had possession of the ball for what turned out to be the go-ahead touchdown in the Warriors’ 27-13 nonconference victory.
"Basically what I did was I saw the ball on the ground, I saw the Mundelein dude grabbed it. I took it from him, simple as that," Siem-Davis said. "It wasn’t really a wrestling match. I just got it. Easy money."
Host Mundelein was playing its first game under new head coach Vince DeFrancesco and unveiled a new run-oriented, double wing offensive attack. The Mustangs moved the ball and controlled the clock for a large part of this contest and led 13-0 in the second quarter.
"I thought we let one get away," DeFrancesco said. "I thought our kids came out, they fought hard. There’s no moral victories. We’re not happy with the outcome. We expected to win tonight. We thought we were the better football team tonight and we made some mistakes in the second half."
Maine West was sloppy at the start. After a three-and-out on their first drive, the Warriors didn’t line up in a traditional punt formation and the kicker was swarmed by several Mustangs as he tried to boot it.
The blocked punt set up Mundelein at the Maine West 27-yard line. After two runs netted no gain, quarterback Isaac Wellman rolled to his right, sold the run and fired a pass to a wide-open Syam Atade-Nauguit for the first touchdown of the season.
After the kickoff, Maine West put together a 16-play drive and reached a first-and-goal at the 8-yard line. But the Mustangs forced four straight incomplete passes to keep the Warriors scoreless.
After Mundelein picked up a pair of first downs, Edder Rebollar-Velazquez recovered a muffed punt return to set up the Mustangs near midfield. From there, Mundelein used 8 runs to cover 48 yards, with Patrick Shawn taking it in from 8 yards out, to give the home team a surprising 13-0 lead.
Maine West responded with another long drive and this time on fourth-and-goal, senior quarterback Danny Kentgen hit David Jackson for a 3-yard touchdown to make it 13-7 with 1:48 left in the first half.
After completing just 9 of 22 passes in the first half, Kentgen caught fire. He hit 9 of 11 passes after halftime for 153 yards and 2 touchdowns. The backbreaker was a two-play 80-yard drive, which consisted of two completions to senior Jaden Dolphin. The first went for 44 yards over the middle. After a Mundelein offside penalty, Kentgen dumped a short pass across the field. Dolphin juggled the ball and the Mustangs coaches argued that it hit the ground. But Dolphin appeared to gain control just in time and ran for a 31-yard touchdown to make it 20-13 with less than a minute left in the third quarter.
"First half wasn’t our half, but we had to get the boys riled up," Siem-Davis said. "I told them, ‘Second half is our half.’ We got the job done."
Maine West finished the scoring with a 13-yard TD pass to senior Jacob Riedl in the fourth quarter. Mundelein’s rushing attack was led by juniors Rudy Orsornio (9 carries, 46 yards) and Joey Foreman (7 carries, 45 yards).
"I was disappointed by how we responded to adversity," DeFrancesco said. "We got better, but I think we could get even better. I think we could be a very dangerous football team this year."

Texto completo: Mundelein was well on its way to pulling off a surprising upset against Maine West on Friday. But the game took a decisive turn when Warriors linebacker Isaiah Siem-Davis went mining for gold in the end zone.
Trailing 13-7 with time winding down in the third quarter, Maine West’s Eduardo Cisneros blocked a punt and sent the ball rolling backward into the end zone. At first, it appeared Mundelein punter Alex Wing recovered the ball for a safety. But when officials dug through the pile, Siem-Davis had possession of the ball for what turned out to be the go-ahead touchdown in the Warriors’ 27-13 nonconference victory.
"Basically what I did was I saw the ball on the ground, I saw the Mundelein dude grabbed it. I took it from him, simple as that," Siem-Davis said. "It wasn’t really a wrestling match. I just got it. Easy money."
Host Mundelein was playing its first game under new head coach Vince DeFrancesco and unveiled a new run-oriented, double wing offensive attack. The Mustangs moved the ball and controlled the clock for a large part of this contest and led 13-0 in the second quarter.
"I thought we let one get away," DeFrancesco said. "I thought our kids came out, they fought hard. There’s no moral victories. We’re not happy with the outcome. We expected to win tonight. We thought we were the better football team tonight and we made some mistakes in the second half."
Maine West was sloppy at the start. After a three-and-out on their first drive, the Warriors didn’t line up in a traditional punt formation and the kicker was swarmed by several Mustangs as he tried to boot it.
The blocked punt set up Mundelein at the Maine West 27-yard line. After two runs netted no gain, quarterback Isaac Wellman rolled to his right, sold the run and fired a pass to a wide-open Syam Atade-Nauguit for the first touchdown of the season.
After the kickoff, Maine West put together a 16-play drive and reached a first-and-goal at the 8-yard line. But the Mustangs forced four straight incomplete passes to keep the Warriors scoreless.
After Mundelein picked up a pair of first downs, Edder Rebollar-Velazquez recovered a muffed punt return to set up the Mustangs near midfield. From there, Mundelein used 8 runs to cover 48 yards, with Patrick Shawn taking it in from 8 yards out, to give the home team a surprising 13-0 lead.
Maine West responded with another long drive and this time on fourth-and-goal, senior quarterback Danny Kentgen hit David Jackson for a 3-yard touchdown to make it 13-7 with 1:48 left in the first half.
After completing just 9 of 22 passes in the first half, Kentgen caught fire. He hit 9 of 11 passes after halftime for 153 yards and 2 touchdowns. The backbreaker was a two-play 80-yard drive, which consisted of two completions to senior Jaden Dolphin. The first went for 44 yards over the middle. After a Mundelein offside penalty, Kentgen dumped a short pass across the field. Dolphin juggled the ball and the Mustangs coaches argued that it hit the ground. But Dolphin appeared to gain control just in time and ran for a 31-yard touchdown to make it 20-13 with less than a minute left in the third quarter.
"First half wasn’t our half, but we had to get the boys riled up," Siem-Davis said. "I told them, ‘Second half is our half.’ We got the job done."
Maine West finished the scoring with a 13-yard TD pass to senior Jacob Riedl in the fourth quarter. Mundelein’s rushing attack was led by juniors Rudy Orsornio (9 carries, 46 yards) and Joey Foreman (7 carries, 45 yards).
"I was disappointed by how we responded to adversity," DeFrancesco said. "We got better, but I think we could get even better. I think we could be a very dangerous football team this year."

Resumen: "First half wasn’t our half, but we had to get the boys riled up," Siem-Davis said. Trailing 14-7 at halftime, Downers Grove North looked like it was in for a real struggle Friday night in the Trojans’ 2019 season-opening football game at Buffalo Grove. [...]Downers Grove North definitely held the upper hand of this contest as the Trojans really owned the ground game against the Bison in the second half. Buffalo Grove took the lead back when Pasquale Dellaquila barely reached his arms over the goal line for a 6-yard TD run and a 14-7 lead late in the first half.

Texto completo: Oh, Mann.
As in Ryan Mann, the Vernon Hills junior running back who rushed for 3 touchdowns — all in the first half — in the Cougars’ 43-0 defeat of visiting Grayslake Central in a football season opener Friday night.
The 5-foot-10, 185-pounder finished with 15 carries for a game-high 130 yards. His scoring trips covered 9, 3 and 8 yards, as the hosts skipped to a 28-0 lead at the half.
"We worked really well together, and so many of our guys have improved since last year," Mann said. "What we’re able to do on offense … options, so many options."
VH senior quarterback Thomas Monken, a transfer from Libertyville, opted to chuck a 30-yard TD pass to sophomore dart Jake Pieper after Mann’s first two TDs. Monken completed 16 of 25 passes for 227 yards, and Pieper need only 3 snares to rack up 93 receiving yards.
Vernon Hills’ defense, particularly its interior linemen, limited the Rams’ feature back, sophomore Maurice Edwards, to 2 yards on 12 totes.
The visitors gained only 89 total yards, with 58 coming via the air.
Cougars linemates Vito Accettura, Bradley Gothelf and David Mun might as well have planted mailboxes in GLC’s backfield.
They practically lived there, after all.
"Full team effort — that’s what that game was," said Cougars coach Bill Bellecomo, whose club topped GLC in an opener for the fifth year in a row. "We played well in all three phases, something we’d been preaching to the guys for a while. Ryan Mann is just a football player, an old-school kid who runs downhill, runs hard. And our defensive linemen are strong kids with high motors.
"They give us fits in practice."
VH junior wideout/linebacker Justin Morris proved to be a handful for the foes, collecting 6 passes for 79 yards and coming down with a toss from Monken for a 2-point conversion after Mann’s final tally. He also picked off a pass in the second half.
Nothing went wrong for the hosts, but it appeared something would on consecutive plays at the end of their first possession in the second half. Monken, taking the snap from the Rams’ 4-yard line, turned to execute a hand off, paused and then chose to keep the football and run for a TD at 9:57 of the third quarter.
On the ensuing extra-point attempt, holder Pieper secured a ground ball and alertly raced to the east side of the end zone for a 2-pointer.
Reserve senior running back Daniel Shin completed the scoring with a 20-yard TD run that made it 42-0 at 4:03 of the third frame, triggering a running clock.
"That’s a good football team, with a fine staff," first-year Grayslake Central coach Mike Maloney said. "Their players executed better than our players did. The spotlight got a little too bright for some of our kids; several played meaningful football for the first time tonight."
Rams senior Grant Spicer caught 3 passes from sophomore quarterback Darryl Overstreet (8-for-20, 50 yards) for 26 yards.
GLC junior punter Andy Rubio booted a 56-yard punt to the Cougars’ 2-yard line in the second quarter.
— Bill McLean Maine West 27, Mundelein 13: Mundelein was well on its way to pulling off a surprising upset against Maine West on Friday. But the game took a decisive turn when Warriors linebacker Isaiah Siem-Davis went mining for gold in the end zone.
Trailing 13-7 with time winding down in the third quarter, Maine West’s Eduardo Cisneros blocked a punt and sent the ball rolling backward into the end zone. At first, it appeared Mundelein punter Alex Wing recovered the ball for a safety. But when officials dug through the pile, Siem-Davis had possession of the ball for what turned out to be the go-ahead touchdown in the Warriors’ 27-13 nonconference victory.
"Basically what I did was I saw the ball on the ground, I saw the Mundelein dude grabbed it. I took it from him, simple as that," Siem-Davis said. "It wasn’t really a wrestling match. I just got it. Easy money."
Host Mundelein was playing its first game under new head coach Vince DeFrancesco and unveiled a new run-oriented, double wing offensive attack. The Mustangs moved the ball and controlled the clock for a large part of this contest and led 13-0 in the second quarter.
"I thought we let one get away," DeFrancesco said. "I thought our kids came out, they fought hard. There’s no moral victories. We’re not happy with the outcome. We expected to win tonight. We thought we were the better football team tonight and we made some mistakes in the second half."
Maine West was sloppy at the start. After a three-and-out on their first drive, the Warriors didn’t line up in a traditional punt formation and the kicker was swarmed by several Mustangs as he tried to boot it.
The blocked punt set up Mundelein at the Maine West 27-yard line. After two runs netted no gain, quarterback Isaac Wellman rolled to his right, sold the run and fired a pass to a wide-open Syam Atade-Nauguit for the first touchdown of the season.
After the kickoff, Maine West put together a 16-play drive and reached a first-and-goal at the 8-yard line. But the Mustangs forced four straight incomplete passes to keep the Warriors scoreless.
After Mundelein picked up a pair of first downs, Edder Rebollar-Velazquez recovered a muffed punt return to set up the Mustangs near midfield. From there, Mundelein used 8 runs to cover 48 yards, with Patrick Shawn taking it in from 8 yards out, to give the home team a surprising 13-0 lead.
Maine West responded with another long drive and this time on fourth-and-goal, senior quarterback Danny Kentgen hit David Jackson for a 3-yard touchdown to make it 13-7 with 1:48 left in the first half.
After completing just 9 of 22 passes in the first half, Kentgen caught fire. He hit 9 of 11 passes after halftime for 153 yards and 2 touchdowns. The backbreaker was a two-play 80-yard drive, which consisted of two completions to senior Jaden Dolphin. The first went for 44 yards over the middle. After a Mundelein offside penalty, Kentgen dumped a short pass across the field. Dolphin juggled the ball and the Mustangs coaches argued that it hit the ground. But Dolphin appeared to gain control just in time and ran for a 31-yard touchdown to make it 20-13 with less than a minute left in the third quarter.
"First half wasn’t our half, but we had to get the boys riled up," Siem-Davis said. "I told them, ‘Second half is our half.’ We got the job done."
Maine West finished the scoring with a 13-yard TD pass to senior Jacob Riedl in the fourth quarter. Mundelein’s rushing attack was led by juniors Rudy Orsornio (9 carries, 46 yards) and Joey Foreman (7 carries, 45 yards).
"I was disappointed by how we responded to adversity," DeFrancesco said. "We got better, but I think we could get even better. I think we could be a very dangerous football team this year."
— Mike McGraw Downers Grove North 35, Buffalo Grove 14: Trailing 14-7 at halftime, Downers Grove North looked like it was in for a real struggle Friday night in the Trojans’ 2019 season-opening football game at Buffalo Grove.
But Downers Grove North definitely held the upper hand of this contest as the Trojans really owned the ground game against the Bison in the second half.
Behind senior quarterback Drew Cassens’ 3 touchdown runs in the third quarter, Downers Grove North wound up taking a 28-14 lead into the fourth quarter before rolling to an impressive 35-14 nonconference victory behind 28 unanswered points.
It only took 1:37 into the third quarter for Cassens (199 yards rushing on 22 carries) to strike the Bison defense.
On a first-and-10 play, Cassens faked a handoff to senior teammate Josh Lumpkins (104 yards on 19 rushes) before racing 22 yards up the middle for the touchdown. The second of 5 extra points by Azriel Henriquez deadlocked the score at 14-14.
Then came a huge turnover as Buffalo Grove quarterback Mark Antonetti (78 yards on 11 carries) fumbled a handoff exchange in the backfield with the Trojans recovering the ball at the Buffalo Grove 23-yard-line.
Five plays later, Cassens scored on a 1-yard keeper, and DGN had its first lead of the game at 21-14 with 8:28 left in the third quarter.
"We just kind of lost our steam in the second half. They did a great job up front, and Drew Cassens was the best player on the field tonight," said Buffalo Grove coach Jeff Vlk, whose team lost a whopping 37 seniors to graduation. "Our kids are hungry, our kids are fighting, but the youth and inexperience was big tonight. We were excited in the first half, but they adjusted in the second half and played us really well."
After the Bison’s next drive stalled, a partially deflected punt gave the Trojans great field possession again at the Buffalo Grove 36.
On fourth-and-3, Cassens broke free up the middle for a 29-yard TD run and a 28-14 advantage late in the third quarter.
"We were disappointed coming out slow, but in the second half the offensive line really brought it," said Cassens, who had 80 yards rushing at halftime. "It was honestly the best blocked game I’ve ever been a part of, and we wanted to keep the ball on the ground."
The consistent running of Lumpkin helped salt away the victory as a 1-yard TD run by Lumpkin with 1:57 to play accounted for the final score.
"I think we hurt ourselves in the first half with the little things on offense, but our coaches did an unbelievable job at halftime making some adjustments," said DGN coach Joe Horeni, whose team had 330 of its 367 total yards on the ground. "Drew Cassens does a lot of things for us. He did a phenomenal job, and it was a good learning experience for our guys coming back."
The Bison got on the scoreboard first when Antonetti (10-for-15, 128 yards passing) broke a tackle and scored on a 49-yard keeper before the extra point by Cal Gerhardt made the score 7-0.
The Trojans answered with a 29-yard TD run by Cassens exactly one minute into the second quarter.
Buffalo Grove took the lead back when Pasquale Dellaquila barely reached his arms over the goal line for a 6-yard TD run and a 14-7 lead late in the first half.
"To score three touchdowns in the third quarter was really special on their field," said Horeni, whose team lost 49-19 to the Bison last year. "With two guys over 100 yards that says something about our offensive line and our kids carrying the ball."
Buffalo Grove wound up with 128 yards both rushing and passing for a total of 256 yards of offense. Senior Max Oberman caught 2 passes for 64 yards for the Bison.

Mrs. Vimmerstedt graduated from Mountain Lakes High School in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey in 1946, and attended Bates College in Lewiston, Maine before completing her Bachelor’s Degree at University of Michigan in 1950. From 1950 – 1952, she taught high school math, science, and physical education in New Hampshire.
Mrs. Vimmerstedt dedicated herself to her family. While taking care of her nephew, she met Mr. Vimmerstedt in Syracuse, New York. After marrying, the couple followed Mr. Vimmerstedt’s military assignments to Fort Dix, New Jersey, and Fort Benning, Georgia, and lived in North Carolina and Connecticut during his professional education and early career in forestry. Mrs. Vimmerstedt moved her growing family to Wooster, Ohio in 1963, when Mr. Vimmerstedt started his research professorship at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center. The family enjoyed swimming, canoeing, camping, and music together.
Mrs. Vimmerstedt was a swimming instructor in the American Red Cross / Wooster Parks and Recreation program for many years, approaching instruction for adult beginners with care, patience, and analytic precision. She loved teaching adapted aquatics, helping children overcome barriers and launch into the pool. She continued to study mathematics and teaching, auditing mathematics classes at the College of Wooster, and receiving a teaching license after completing education classes at the Ohio State University.
Mrs. Vimmerstedt believed in civic participation as an expression of her patriotism, advocating for women’s reproductive health, and taking an active role in many civic organizations.
Mrs. Vimmerstedt is survived by her husband, four children and ten grandchildren: Carol Crawford of Denmark, Wisconsin (husband Jim Crawford; Mary, Ben, and Sam Crawford); Margaret Vimmerstedt of Chapel Hill, North Carolina (husband Loren Hintz; Carl Hintz); William Vimmerstedt of Columbus, Ohio (Joseph, Elaina, William, and Henry Vimmerstedt); and Laura Vimmerstedt of Denver, Colorado (husband Christian Hopfer; Theodor and Alex Hopfer). We will miss her thoughtful devotion to family and remember her commitment to equality and open-mindedness. She rejoiced in our growth and perceptively engaged with our challenges. Values of health and physical activity, music, detailed and strategic analysis, parenting of young children and empathy to all are legacies of Mrs. Vimmerstedt that will live on.
Burial was August 27 at Evergreen Memorial Park, Colorado with arrangements by Feldman Mortuary, of Denver CO. Donations in her memory may be sent to Viola Startzman Clinic, 1874 Cleveland Rd., Wooster, OH 44691.

Texto completo: More Kmart and Sears stores will close by the end of the year.
Weeks after announcing 26 Sears and Kmart locations would close in October, nearly 100 additional stores are facing a similar fate in December or sooner.
While company officials did not release an official list of the locations closing, news outlets across the nation reported this week that their local stores were closing. A list was posted on the website thelayoff. com with more than 80 Kmart stores.
"After careful review, we have made the difficult decision to close the Kmart stores in Wayne, Trenton, Wall and Somers Point," TransformCo. said in a statement sent to Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, about four New Jersey closures. "We encourage customers to continue shopping on Kmart. com for all their product needs. ”
Liquidation sales are expected to begin in mid-September.
More store closings coming: An estimated 12,000 shops could close by the end of 2019
Forever 21: Teen retailer is preparing for potential bankruptcy filing, report says
In February, former Sears CEO Eddie Lampert struck a last-minute deal to buy Sears assets out of bankruptcy and keep about 400 stores open under a new entity, Transform Holdco, also known as Transformco.
Lampert, who relinquished the CEO role when the company filed for bankruptcy, was the company's largest shareholder and creditor at the time of the bankruptcy.
In early August when announcing the October closures, the company said more closings were still a possibility.
“Following these steps, we will continue to evaluate our network of Sears and Kmart stores and cannot rule out additional store closures in the near term,” the company's Aug. 6 statement said. “Our goal remains to return the company to profitability and preserve as many jobs as possible in the communities we serve. ”
As of Aug. 7, company spokesman Larry Costello said about 380 locations remained open.
“As we continue our transformation efforts, we are working closely with our stakeholders, and evaluating our network of stores, operations and business strategy in order to stabilize the business and support a long-term path to profitable success,” Transformco said in a statement to USA TODAY Friday.

In rural Maine, family planning clinics face threat of closure

Texto completo: DEXTER, Maine — The Trump administration's effort to restrict abortion at federally funded family planning centers is about to hit home in parts of New England, where far-flung clinics that serve the rural poor face the threat of cutbacks or closure.
The closing of clinics in remote towns would make it harder for low-income women to get not just abortions but also birth control. Maine's network of family planning providers has warned that in the worst-case scenario, it could be forced to close most of its health centers, leaving large swaths of one of the most rural states in the nation with no such clinics.
“It would be heartbreaking to me to see people in this community that won't be able to access care like this," said Christy Suvlu, nurse practitioner at Dexter Family Planning, the clinic in this rural town about an hour northwest of Bangor. Patients range from teenagers to small business owners who find insurance coverage prohibitively expensive and instead pay for care on a sliding scale.
“It just makes everything much easier for them, getting their basic reproductive health taken care of and preventing pregnancy," Suvlu said.
The changes stem from a new rule for the federal Title X program issued by the Trump administration that aims to disentangle abortion services — which can't be funded with federal dollars — from family planning programs that can. The new rule is a response to longstanding concerns by abortion opponents who see the family planning money as an indirect subsidy for abortion. Clinics that provide both would have to physically separate their abortion operations, potentially requiring renovations or new facilities.
And, even if they stopped providing abortions, clinics could no longer tell their patients where else to turn. Suvlu, for instance, wouldn't be able to tell a pregnant woman that abortion is available at a clinic in Bangor.
Nationally, the best-known provider of family planning is Planned Parenthood, but in Maine, a nonprofit called Maine Family Planning manages the federal funding for Planned Parenthood and numerous other health centers and schools, and operates 18 clinics of its own. Like Planned Parenthood nationally, Maine Family Planning recently pulled out of the Title X program, rather than adhere to the new restrictions. For Maine Family Planning, that meant giving up about $2 million a year.
The Maine nonprofit also challenged the rule in federal court, saying it could “undo decades of progress for the health of those most in need" and have “devastating effects on the state of Maine." The state currently has a low rate of pregnancies among teenagers and, a recent analysis found, the nation's highest rate of contraceptive use among those at highest risk of unintended pregnancy.
Complying with the new rule would have forced Maine Family Planning to stop providing abortions at 17 of its 18 health centers, leaving just three centers statewide where new patients could get an abortion, according to the lawsuit. Currently, there are 20 such centers.
But Maine Family Planning said that even if it could afford to separate its abortion and family planning services, it would not do so because it would be unethical to withhold information about abortion from patients.
Maine Family Planning said it has gotten signals that the state's political leaders will step in to fund the difference — as Governor Charlie Baker and the Legislature did months ago in Massachusetts — but that probably couldn't happen before spring, said Evelyn Kieltyka, senior vice president of program services at the nonprofit.
But more than 27 percent of the nonprofit's budget comes from the federal Title X program, and if the funding isn't restored in the long run, Maine Family Planning could be forced to close or cut back services at 11 to 15 of its health centers, the group said in its lawsuit. It might also have to end services it provides through other health centers.
The result would be devastating to the people of Maine, “many of whom have no other access to health care, much less to family planning services," the nonprofit's lawsuit said. Some of Maine Family Planning's clinics are as far north and east as the Canadian border, making travel to alternate clinics in southern Maine cities prohibitive. Poverty, lack of health insurance, and unpredictable driving conditions create additional hurdles for Mainers to travel for care, the suit says.
The loss of a clinic would hit especially hard in Dexter, a tiny town of 3,800 nestled in the Maine Highlands with an aging population that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016. Dexter still hasn't recovered from the loss of its largest employer nearly two decades ago; even its town manager describes it as “struggling." The metal husk of the Dexter Shoe Co. factory, which employed 800 before the company was bought by Warren Buffett, now accommodates just a few dozen workers handling shoe distribution and returns. The shuttered old mill now houses adult education classes.
Low-income patients who qualify for MaineCare — the state's Medicaid program — will still be able to get birth control through doctors' offices, hospitals, or other federally funded clinics, and patients covered by the Affordable Care Act still receive free birth control, for now, despite Republican efforts to alter it.
But the family planning centers now being affected have, for decades, been the place to turn for confidential, nonjudgmental treatment for sexual preventive health, sanctioned by a federal government that considered it a public good. A patient who comes in for a chlamydia test won't be turned away if she can't pay the fee; a payment plan is permitted. The clinics dole out several months' worth of birth control pills at once, recognizing such conveniences help women stay on track.
Title X is intended to make contraception readily available to anyone, including low-income patients, immigrants, and rural residents who might otherwise lack access. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognized family planning as one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. In Dexter, 28 percent of patients at the clinic receive services funded by Title X.
“This program has been around since the '70s, and it was Richard Nixon who signed into law, and one of the champions was George H.W. Bush," Kieltyka said. “It was 'the right thing to do.' "
Not everyone agrees — particularly in a conservative town such as Dexter, where some still see stigma hanging over the family planning clinic. Inside Our “FAMB"ily Restaurant (named for the first initials of the members of the family that owns it), the regulars often grumble about abortion and Planned Parenthood, said 20-year-old Ashley Reynolds, the “A" of the family and a liberal outlier in town. In high school, when students solicited local businesses for fund-raisers, they were urged to steer clear of the clinic, she recalled.
Her mother, Melissa Reynolds, said visits to the clinic are kept mostly “hush-hush" because of the dual implications of sexual activity and poverty. Still, she acknowledges, “When I was 15, that's where I went to go get birth control. If you're having sex and you can't talk to your family about it, then that's the best place to go."
Not all patients come to family planning clinics for sex-related concerns, of course. Rosemary Polichak, a 64-year-old retiree, had an appointment last week for her annual checkup and Pap smear. She started going to the clinic for birth control in the 1970s, before she had children, when money was especially tight, she said. She keeps going back for the familiar.
“I always knew the people. And they didn't change doctors every other day," she said.
Other recent walk-in patients included a 20-year-old mother who thought she was pregnant again. (She wasn't, but Suvlu educated her about birth control options and screened her for STDs.) Another was a woman who had been bounced out of MaineCare because she failed to fill out the paperwork after she turned 19.
Last week, 16-year-old Lilah McCormack dashed into the clinic after the first day of school and before field hockey practice to pick up her birth control pills.
“If this wasn't here, it would be a lot harder for me to get," she said, noting she was borrowing her mother's car. “I couldn't drive an hour just to get my birth control or get tested."
A junior at Dexter Regional High School who has six siblings, McCormack said she started coming to the clinic secretly last year, but her mother later found out and supported her decision. She encourages friends who are sexually active to take advantage of the clinic, recommending regular STD screenings there.
“I'm just that friend," she said.
“It's just hard to imagine not having something as accessible as this, 'cause I've had it for a while now," she said. “And I don't know, I just can't imagine how bad it could be for people that had it worse than I do."

Texto completo: Ben DiNucci has a little extra incentive not to let down his new coach at James Madison.
"One of the funny things about this whole relationship is his sister and my mom are best friends," the former Pitt quarterback told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, referring to Curt Cignetti, the former Pitt assistant and head coach at IUP who was hired to lead the Dukes in December.
"We kind of joked about that when he first got here. One of the first things he said to me was 'Don't make me ruin the relationship between your mom and my sister.' "
High stakes. Enough to make James Madison's national championship aspirations - the Dukes are ranked No. 2 in Football Championship Subdivision to start the season - seem tame by comparison.
Still, DiNucci is taking those seriously, too, as he looks for a strong finish to a college career that's had a fair amount of bumps in the road.
The former Pine-Richland High School standout transferred from Pitt after a 2017 season in which he started more games than any quarterback on the roster but had to battle Max Browne and Kenny Pickett almost constantly for the privilege. He chose to walk on and compete for the starting job at James Madison in part because Cignetti, then the coach at Elon, recommended the program.
Two years later, DiNucci is Cignetti's starter in Harrisonburg, Va., after winning the job in camp.
"I have total trust and confidence in him," the coach told reporters in announcing his choice last week. "He has played a lot of football. He's impressed me. He has done a good job with his decision-making."
DiNucci started all last season for departed coach Mike Houston's regime, too, after quickly working his way up the depth chart. He passed for 2,275 yards and 16 touchdowns in leading the Dukes to 9-4 overall and 6-2 in the Colonial Athletic Association, second only to champion Maine.
That was the good. His 12 interceptions were the bad. Five of them came in a 23-20 loss against Colgate in the second round of the FCS playoffs. So, obviously, there's room for improvement in the turnover department, something DiNucci readily acknowledged.
It helps, though, that he's entrenched in his role. He isn't looking over his shoulder at a hot-shot freshman or a well-traveled veteran like he was at Pitt. And that security gives him confidence.
"Knowing that the coaches have a lot of trust in me, I'm able to go out there and just play my game," DiNucci said. "Kind of let loose. Not have to worry about, if I make a mistake, is this going to happen or that going to happen. Just being able to trust myself and trust the guys around me."
He's also enjoying the opportunity to work with Cignetti, who's more offensively oriented than Houston and Pitt's Pat Narduzzi were.
Reflecting on his time at Pitt, DiNucci spoke highly of the experience of playing for his hometown team. Most of his friends on the team have graduated or transferred, and he hasn't had much time to follow the Panthers while managing his responsibilities. But he wishes the program well and said he wouldn't change a thing about his time there.
At the same time, he has a hunger to prove himself that's common among players who transfer to lower levels in their careers. He'll get an excellent opportunity to do so Saturday when his Dukes travel to Morgantown to open the season against West Virginia.
ESPN's Football Power Index gives them a puncher's chance - 26.4 percent odds to win - and James Madison has a history of stunning power conference opponents, including No. 13 Virginia Tech in 2010.
Another upset would not only thrill DiNucci's mom, his coach's sister and other family and friends planning to make the trip to Morgantown. It likely would please a lot of fans of his former school, too, and he's looking forward to showing what he's got.
"Growing up, I didn't really hate West Virginia, hate Penn State," DiNucci said. "There's not really any resentment toward any programs there. Just the fact that I grew up in Pittsburgh, went to Pitt for three years and now getting a chance to play another one of those power-five teams there so close to home . it will be fun for me to get the play in that atmosphere. Have that support system there."

'Emeritus' Heitkamp sees path for ND Dems

Texto completo: Dwindled Democratic-NPL power in North Dakota and the loss of the party's only statewide incumbent present a natural question: What is the party's future in the Republican-controlled state?
Former U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp thinks there is one, if Democrats get the right breaks and offer a substantive vision.
"I think there's truly an opportunity for the next generation of Democrats to, No. 1, drive a state narrative about what is the policy of the Democratic party here in the state," she said.
Heitkamp, a Democrat, lost her bid for reelection in 2018 to Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer. She's a former tax commissioner and attorney general from an era when Democrats controlled a raft of state offices.
Now the party is without any incumbent or an apparent governor candidate in 2020. Heitkamp, her party's nominee for that post in 2000, has said emphatically she's not running.
"You have to admit that maybe it's time for somebody else to offer themselves up," she told The Bismarck Tribune editorial board recently. "And that's not said with any bitterness or disdain. It's just, at some point, you start reimagining and doing something else with your life."
She has started the "One Country" project with former Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., using contributions and her leftover Senate campaign funds. The project aims to connect rural issues, such as health care and manufacturing, to the national political narrative as Democrats seek to oust President Donald Trump in 2020.
"What are those things that unite the factory worker in Cincinnati and the cab driver in New York and the CNA at a nursing home in Wishek?" Heitkamp said.
She still lives in North Dakota and has been frequently traveling, recently to Maine and San Francisco, and will appear as an ABC News contributor during the Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate in Houston.
She also appeared recently on "Real Time with Bill Maher," contributes to CNBC and has had a visiting fellowship at Harvard.
'A full effort'
After a career in public office, Heitkamp, 63, considers herself in an "emeritus role" or "sage adviser, maybe" to North Dakota Democrats.
"I like telling people I think all new ideas are good ideas, but sometimes you do need somebody who's been around the block a few times to say that might not be the best idea," she said.
Democratic-NPL Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said Heitkamp is always welcome to be engaged in the party and has been a mentor to its up-and-comers.
Oversen expects North Dakota's 2020 races to be different than in 2018, when more than $32 million poured into the state's high-profile Senate race, seen as key for determining the Senate's majority power. And the party plans to offer a slate of candidates up and down the ballot.
"We intend to put forth a full effort, no matter the outcome, and we know it's important for voters to have those choices," said Oversen, her party's unsuccessful 2018 nominee for state tax commissioner.
Democrats will be "curiously watching" Republicans' primary process for challenges, especially in the governor's race, given Gov. Doug Burgum's past rubs with legislative leaders, Oversen said.
She also said Democrats plan to put forth "a strong candidate" against Burgum, who has made no official reelection announcement but is expected to run.
The Democratic party has been in talks with former elected officials and "some who are not maybe your typical candidate for an office like that," Oversen said.
But no announcements yet.
Heitkamp said the Democratic-NPL Party has run good candidates and campaigns but has been "drug down" by the national Democratic brand, aligned by critics with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who is seen by some as a liberal firebrand. Heitkamp prefers a moderate Democratic message.
"I've been a Democrat my whole life. She's never even said she's a Democrat. She's a Democrat socialist, right?" Heitkamp said. "And she got 14,000 votes in Queens and beat a Democratic incumbent, so why does she get to be the voice of the Democratic party?"
Oversen said the national party has shaped how North Dakotans view Democratic-NPL candidates, but every state is more "nuanced" than the national message.
"We have a lot of members and supporters who work in the energy industry, for example, and that changes their perspective on how we handle climate change," she said. "We've got a lot of members who are or come from families of hunters, and that obviously changes how you look at gun safety measures."
'People want good government'
Former Republican Gov. Ed Schafer said that without a statewide incumbent, North Dakota's Democrats lack enough visibility to gain acceptance and momentum.
But he said the party could get its foot back in the door if voters find themselves unhappy with Republicans. Schafer's 1992 election amid Democratic state control and a poor economy is seen as the start of Republicans' rise to now total control of state offices.
"In spite of all the politics and commercials and everything that's out there, people want good government," Schafer said. "They just want good government, and if there's a sense that their government isn't doing good things for them, they'll swap it out."
He compares political power to a bell curve, swooping up to a point that eventually drops down.
"The pendulum swings, and it generally is because something has emerged that the electorate says, 'I want a change,' and you have to answer that," Schafer said.
But it can be hard to recruit statewide candidates, Oversen said, and some have seen repeated defeats. She pointed out that's not unique to Democrats -- Cramer lost three U.S. House bids before his 2012 win.
Trump remains popular in North Dakota, where Heitkamp said barriers to Democrats are a bigger Republican base than before and an evaporated margin of crossover support for Democrats.
If Democrats can offer a message that resonates should Republicans suffer from controversial policies of the Trump administration, that could be their break, she said.
"I think you can exploit mistakes, but you also have to come not empty-handed," Heitkamp said.

Texto completo: BLUE HILL, Maine -- When you cast off from the downtown dock in Blue Hill Harbor, there's no guarantee that water will be there when you return.
Karlo and Paula Appro didn't know that. The married couple toured the harbor shoreline in their two-person kayak at a casual pace on Friday, admiring the golf course and stately homes on the shoreline and stopping for lunch at a seaside restaurant before finishing their approximately 5-mile journey hours later.
They had no idea that low tide leaves the town-owned facility at the edge of a vast and sometimes smelly mudflat. Although some residents oppose the notion, fearing a glut of tourist traffic, the Board of Selectmen is investigating having the harbor dredged so that users, including local lobstermen, can make better use of it.
[image id="2860914" size="full" pos="center" /]
The Appros were glad they didn't get stuck in ankle-deep muck as much as 100 yards from shore, which can happen.
"We had no clue. No clue at all," Paula Appro said, "but as we were paddling back, my husband marveled at how lucky we got that we arrived just perfectly at high tide. We came from Rockland. We didn't check the tides at all, so we just lucked out."

Lobster boats use the town dock, which has a winch for lifting traps, but only at high tide. The water just isn't deep enough to accommodate their boats otherwise, said Florence B. Prouty, owner of Bears n' Me, a gift shop that sits opposite the town dock and fire station on Water Street.
[image id="2860918" size="full" pos="center" /]
"I think it would be nice to have the lobstermen who are now in South Blue Harbor," Prouty said. "We should set it up so that we will have more of our working class people who live here working in downtown."
Whether to dredge the harbor has been a town issue going back to the 1880s. Most recently, selectmen have been working with the Army Corps of Engineers to finish an analysis of the harbor it began and has been working on intermittently since about 2014, Selectmen Vaughn Leach said.
Early estimates place the cost of dredging at about $2 million. With federal grants and the town paying back its share of the cost over 30 years, that cost might be bearable, or it might be "optimistic," Selectwoman Ellen Best said.
[image id="2860917" size="full" pos="center" /]
Another concern would be how much it would cost to develop the infrastructure, such as docks, that would be needed to make dredging worthwhile, Best said.
And how close to the town dock could the dredging actually get?
"The issue becomes, as we were discussing earlier in a different format, what's cost effective? There are some obvious benefits to having the harbor dredged, depending on what that price tag is, [and] what people's appetites for it are," Best said.
[image id="2860915" size="full" pos="center" /]
Today, dozens of sailboats, lobstering craft and other boats use the harbor, but they anchor in the eastern portions near Peters Point, Kollegewidgwok Yacht Club and Sculpin Point. Most of the back half of the harbor, which adjoins Water and Main streets, drains at low tide, leaving only shallow pools.
Most fishermen have rowboats or other shallow-draft vessels tied to trees or stakes in the ground near the yacht club or Peters Point that they use as transport to their fishing boats. None of the smaller vessels are anchored near the town dock.
"Sail boats, motor boats, they all come in here, but they have to do it right now, when the tide is up," Prouty said.
[image id="2860916" size="full" pos="center" /]
Local kayak rental businesses schedule trips that allow clients to have lunch or dinner at local restaurants, but the trips are all scheduled around the tide -- a costly inconvenience, said Annaliese Riggall, owner of The Boat Yard Grill, which adjoins the harbor on East Blue Hill Road.
With dredging, "that kind of traffic would increase, which would be good for that kind of business and other businesses like it," Riggall said.
"I think [with dredging] you're just looking at increasing a little bit more foot traffic in town, not necessarily cutting down on the amount of traffic driving through town, unfortunately," Riggall said.
Selectmen have been waiting for more than a month for a cost estimate report from the Army Corps of Engineers. That town has spent about $100,000 on corps studies of the harbor without seeing a final report. Corps representatives told the board that they would need another $20,000 or so to finish their work, but agreed to send a report to the town after the board said it couldn't appropriate that kind of money without a town vote, Leach said.
The board doesn't know when the report will arrive.

Garden Guru: The year of the Joe Pye

Texto completo: Our family drove it this weekend and I have an unquenchable thirst to go back. If the mountains and streams weren't enough to keep you spell bound the entire route seem adorned with tall clumps of Joe Pye weed.
Swallowtail butterflies would swoon down to partake of the nectar rich pink flowers. This summer, wherever I go in Georgia, it seems to be the year of the Joe Pye. While Joe Pye will forever be tagged with the indignation of having weed associated with its name rest assured it is and forever will be a dazzling perennial for the garden border.
At the Columbus Botanical Garden, they created a stunning combination with Goldsturm rudbeckias in the front with a layer of Joe Pye followed by a tall sweep of white hydrangea paniculatas.
Early in the year, I saw them for sale at one of the national chains in Columbus. It stands to reason that mother mature's partners seen on the scenic highway may also one day be for sale. Can you imagine combinations in the garden featuring Joe Pye, purple ironweed, yellow helianthus and white blooming boneset or thoroughworts?
Joe Pye is a relative of the chrysanthemum and has been loved worldwide for a long time. It made it into European gardens while we weren't even paying attention. Legend has it that Joe Pye was a Native American Indian, Jopi who used the plant to cure fever. While we won't use it for its medicinal properties this chrysanthemum relative can be a trusted perennial for the landscape and is a must have for backyard habitats and butterfly gardens.
The Joe Pye has changed botanically from Eupatorium to Eutrochium. You'll find them native from the Gulf States to Canada. In Georgia, we have three species and another just across the river that all gather under the Joe Pye name. We have Eutrochium fistulosum or hollow stem Joe Pye weed which is the one is often seen at the edge of woodland roadsides producing rose-pink flowers on stalks that may reach 6 to 8 feet tall.
When I was at the Coastal Georgia Botanical Gardens we grew Little Red, a variety of the native
Eutrochium purpureum. Little Red is a slightly more compact selection at 4 to 6 feet with large rose purple heads of flowers. Then there is Eutrochium maculatum or spotted Joe Pye Weed that is also touted as compact, but still reaches 5 feet plus.
Oddly the white blooming common boneset that looks like Joe Pye kept the old Eupatorium perfoliatium as did the tall boneset Eupatorium altissimum. These are two great choices or substitutes if you want a white Joe Pye.
Then from South Carolina along the coast to Maine you will start finding the Coastal Plain Joe Pye weed, Eutrochium dubium. Little Joe is a widely popular selection of this species becoming one of the easiest to find for sale. It too is more compact reaching 3 to 4 feet tall.
Regardless of the one you choose, remember that the Joe Pye does best in fertile, loamy soil. To look their best, you will most likely need to give them supplemental water during droughty periods of the summer. Plant them informally in clusters or sweeps at least three feet apart. With their rapid growth, you may find it to your liking to pinch in early summer to encourage branching.
If mother nature can stop traffic, think how beautiful it will look in your garden whether it is a cottage style, backyard pollinator habitat or simply a modern 2020 garden.

Texto completo: Barbara Ann Cooley, 79, passed away at Naples Community Hospital Downtown on August 20, 2019, after contracting pneumonia days earlier.

Born on September 28, 1939 to Andrew C. Szetela and Helen B. Borowski in New Britain, Connecticut, she attended local Connecticut schools and graduated from the University of Connecticut's School of Social Work with a Master's Degree. Barbara was Executive Director of Combined Health and Alcohol Programs (then "CHAP") in Hartford, Connecticut and would focus on those recovering from alcohol or other addictions. It is here where Barbara would meet and work closely with her husband William James "Bill" Cooley of the City of Hartford's Police Department, together offering assistance to those in need.

Following retirement in 1986, Barbara and Bill toured the United States for two years, ending with a move to Naples, Florida where Barbara opened a private practice in social work. Barbara would go on to receive her Doctorate in Social Work. Barbara remained in her private practice through 2013, when Bill became ill and passed away. Barbara and Bill were also members of three motorcycle clubs: The Blue Knights, the HOG (Fort Meyers and Naples Florida) and ABATE. Together, Barbara and Bill continued with their life-long passions of hunting, fishing and motorcycle riding.

Barbara is survived by her daughters Lynn Katherine Sadosky and her husband Michael Mackey of Westport, Connecticut; Alesia Beth Sadosky of Westerly, Rhode Island; Cynthia Lynn Cooley of Stafford Springs, Connecticut; granddaughter and grandson Carissa and Tyler Sawyer of Pittsfield, Maine; and Michael DeLisa of Stafford Springs, Connecticut. In addition, she is survived by her Sister and her husband Andrea and Earnie Palmer of Ashford, Connecticut; Nephew Gregory and his wife, Amy Schaffer and their children Ava, Adam and Teddy of Middlefield, Connecticut; and Nephew Daniel Schaffer of San Diego, California. Barbara is also survived by many other nephews in the Connecticut area. A special Mass will be said at St. John the Evangelist Church in Naples, Florida at a later date. Barbara's ashes will be placed alongside those of her beloved husband Bill at the National Veteran's Cemetery in Sarasota, Florida.

Texto completo: (Editor’s note: A name has been changed in the story to reflect the person’s chosen last name. An earlier version of the story used the person’s birth name, as provided to us. The person cited safety concerns in asking for the revision. )
Three years ago, no one in the USA was legally recognized as neither male or female.
Today, thousands of people can point to a gender-neutral marker on state driver's licenses and identification cards, according to records obtained by USA TODAY.
After two more states announced plans last week to offer a gender X or nonbinary marker, advocates said momentum for the option can help validate gender identity, but the designation can also raise safety concerns.
The National Center for Transgender Equality encourages people to choose the marker that feels most appropriate and comfortable, said Arli Christian, the organization's director of state policy. More states offering the gender-neutral designation, Christian said, allows more people to access accurate IDs.
'A unique variation of nature': When asked their gender, some are going with option 'X'
At least 7,251 gender X IDs and driver's licenses have been issued in nine states plus Washington, D. C. , according to records obtained by USA TODAY from state departments. Indiana is the only state that issues gender X IDs that did not respond to USA TODAY's records request.
Although the number of those people who got the marker for increased privacy around their gender versus the number of people who got it to reflect their nonbinary identity is unknown, advocates described the progress as exciting.
"I'm really happy for all those people, but I'm not surprised there's quite a few," said Dana Zzyym, a nonbinary and intersex activist who sued the State Department for a gender-neutral passport. "I think the nonbinary population will surprise a lot of people in this country. "
States issuing gender-neutral IDs
Ten states offer gender X IDs: Arkansas, Oregon, Minnesota, Maine, Utah, Colorado, California, Indiana, Nevada and Vermont. In the coming months, policies in Maryland, New Hampshire and Hawaii will go into effect.
Washington and Pennsylvania announced plans last week to roll out a third gender option, and their departments are likely to pass the rule changes.
In July 2017, Oregon was thought to be the first state to begin issuing gender X IDs, just after Washington, D. C. , started its policy. However, Arkansas adopted a policy allowing people to change their gender marker with no questions asked in 2010, and it remains in place, said spokesperson Scott Hardin of the Department of Finance and Administration.
Five other states join Arkansas in allowing people to self-certify, or designate their own gender, while Maine, Utah, Colorado and Indiana require residents to provide documentation for gender changes. Requirements include approval from medical providers, which can be difficult to obtain in places where few doctors are trained to provide gender-affirming care to transgender people, Christian said.
'Completely outrageous': Some Americans are denied health care because they are transgender
"In order to get the most accurate gender marker on an ID, that reporting should come directly from the individual without additional barriers such as medical documentation and medical provider signatures," Christian said.
Validation? Or discrimination?
Mari Wrobi, 22, has the opportunity to self-certify the gender marker in California.
A nonbinary and intersex person, Wrobi held on to the paperwork to get the gender X marker for months as the transgender ban in the military went into effect and the Trump administration announced plans to scrap rules protecting transgender people from discrimination in homeless shelters and health care.
The feeling of excitement for the marker gave way to concern, said Wrobi, who worried that the X designation could out transgender nonbinary people or mark them as "other" in today's political climate.
FAQs: What does it mean to be intersex?
Wrobi considered all the people who examine IDs – from TSA agents, bouncers to bank workers – and asked: Do I want to feel validated in my gender, or do I want to feel safe?
"We give our ID to so many people that have so much power over our lives," Wrobi said. "They have the power to decide if we can get a loan or if we can continue to drive and so many other things. These people don't always outwardly express their bigotry toward people who are trans, intersex and nonbinary, but they certainly can have views that are homophobic, transphobic and that are just essentially dangerous toward us. "
Wrobi is passing on the X marker for now but described the opportunity to get a gender-neutral ID as "incredible" and respects those who choose the "X. "
The correct ID marker, after all, can affirm people's identity and benefit their mental health, said Jules Baldino, micro-grants coordinator at Trans Lifeline, a nonprofit transgender support organization. People look at their ID often in daily life, so seeing an official document reflect who they are can be encouraging.
When IDs don't match how people present their gender, Baldino said, needing to show it can trigger feelings of depression, anxiety and gender dysphoria, a discomfort or distress caused by a discrepancy between a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth. Authorities who check the ID may confront the person for the discrepancy, Baldino said, possibly concluding the card does not belong to them.
'Queer Eye' star Jonathan Van Ness: 'I’m nonbinary – I’m gender nonconforming'
In the largest survey of transgender people's experiences in the USA, about a third of respondents who showed an ID with a name or gender that did not match their gender presentation said they were verbally harassed, denied benefits or service, asked to leave or assaulted. The National Center for Transgender Equality, which conducted the survey, has not received any reports of people facing discrimination for having an X gender marker, Christian said.
While working with transgender people applying for grants to update their government IDs, Baldino said, Trans Lifeline has heard safety concerns. Some worry that authorities who check IDs may not understand what a gender X marker means, Baldino said, possibly leading to invasive questions about their sex and body or harassment.
"I think there will be this time where there's a lot of people who might interact with these IDs who don't know what that is," Baldino said. "That could potentially put people's safety in question. "
How large is the nonbinary population?
#InTheirWords: Being transgender in the USA
The survey and study do not include minors, meaning the numbers could be higher since research shows members of Generation Z are more familiar with nonbinary identity.
About 35% of people ages 7 to 22 say they personally know someone who prefers to go by gender-neutral pronouns such as "they," according to the Pew Research Center. That number is 12% among baby boomers, and one of four millennials say they do.
Nonbinary people existed long before states began legally recognizing them, said Zzyym, 61.
Zzyym first tried to get the X gender marker on a driver's license around 2012, before some Gen Z nonbinary activists were old enough to drive. As one of the first to obtain a gender-neutral license in Colorado last year, Zzyym described a feeling of deep satisfaction to USA TODAY: finally, a document that recognized Zzyym's identity.
Future advances, improvements
As more states consider offering gender-neutral markers for IDs, Baldino described the present as a pivotal moment for recognition of nonbinary identity. Trans Lifeline will continue to offer grants to update IDs and track the processes and fees for updating gender makers in different states, Baldino said.
Policies for updating IDs can be improved, said Christian, who works with state and local governments to make gender changes on documents more accessible by offering self-certification. Removing requirements such as medical documents or court orders can take expensive and time-intensive steps out of the process, especially for people in rural areas.
'It messes up your life': Some Americans are denied 'lifesaving' health care because they are transgender
Various agencies can update their databases to offer a gender-neutral option, the way United Airlines rolled out a nonbinary booking option.
On the federal level, advocates watch Zzyym's case for a gender-neutral designation on passports play out in the 10th Circuit of the U. S. Court of Appeals. A district court judge ruled in Zzyym's favor in September 2018, saying the State Department exceeded its authority when it denied Zzyym's passport application and did not make its decision reasonably. The department filed for an appeal.
“It’s absurd that the State Department would rather me just randomly check a box: male or female," Zzyym said in a release by Lambda Legal, which represents Zzyym in the case. "It’s not who I am, and it would expose me to greater scrutiny when my Colorado driver’s license now shows ‘X. ' "

Texto completo: The Tyson Helton era at Western Kentucky is ... not off to an ideal start.
On Thursday, the Hilltopper football team dropped its first game under Helton, who was hired as coach in December, letting Central Arkansas rally in Bowling Green for a 35-28 win over host WKU.
In a vacuum, opening the season with a loss isn't so bad. WKU is facing a rebuild after a couple of subpar seasons under former coach Mike Sanford. And losses are going to happen — no one had the Hilltoppers pegged as a national title contender in 2019.
But the loss was against Central Arkansas, an FCS program that WKU reportedly paid $325,000 to play. That hurts.
And it came after the Hilltoppers were outscored 21-0 in the fourth quarter, which also doesn't feel great.
This is actually WKU's second loss in the past 365 days to an FCS squad. The Hilltoppers fell to Maine in the second week of last season's 3-9 debacle on Sept. 8, 2018. (Don't laugh, Louisville fans. Western Kentucky came within a missed field goal of beating the Cardinals a week later.)
Helton's hiring was pitched as a possible return to one of WKU's golden eras — the Jeff Brohm years.
Helton served as Brohm's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2014 and 2015, when record-setting quarterback Brandon Doughty won Conference USA Player of the Year honors in back-to-back seasons and WKU went 20-6.
It would be unfair to write all of that off after one loss. But it's safe to say Helton and the Hilltoppers have some work to do.
WKU is back in action on Sept. 7 at Florida International.

Texto completo: WOODSTOCK - Ned Lamont never got to Woodstock as a 15-year-old teenager, but he made up for it Friday by staging a major celebration 50 years later as Connecticut's governor.
It wasn't the famed Yasgur Farm in upstate New York, and the crowd wasn't "half a million strong" as the song says, but Lamont tried to recreate the spirit of the rock festival at the namesake of the annual Woodstock Fair near the Rhode Island and Massachusetts borders.
The 65-year-old governor stepped onto the large stage to greet the crowd, which was estimated by officials at about 1,500 in the concert area as thousands more visited other sections of the expansive fair grounds.
"Woodstock - 50 years ago!" Lamont announced to the crowd. "Three days of peace, love and music. Well, we've got a few differences here. ... At Woodstock, now the grass is on the ground where it belongs."
Lamont explained later that his family had prevented him from attending the original, multiday, psychedelic festival.
"That's absolutely true," he said. "I'm still gnashing my teeth 50 years later. My father looked at me like I was nuts."
As one of the bands played, Lamont started dancing in an impromptu move that was caught on video, and he was joined by Ann Labb from Manchester, who had been dancing in the same area near the stage.
"He needed somebody to dance with, and I guess I was it," Labb said. "I was as surprised as anybody."
Lamont himself served as a judge at the event that became known as "Nedstock." He was joined in the judging by his friend, Republican state Sen. George Logan of Ansonia, who also played the "Star Spangled Banner" on the guitar in a repeat of his performance at Lamont's inaugural ball in Hartford in a Jimi Hendrix tribute. The other judges included WFSB-TV anchor Dennis House, state troubadour Nekita Waller and state agricultural commissioner Bryan Hurlburt.
In a competition that originally started with more than 50 bands, five finalists emerged to play on the stage Friday. Lamont took his duties seriously, saying, "That's my job."
On the stage, Lamont announced that rock star Janis Joplin did not play one of her most famous songs at Woodstock, but he asked the crowd to join him in the song.
"Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?" Lamont sang as the crowd joined in. "My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends. Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends. Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?"
During the 2018 gubernatorial campaign, Lamont talked about a 50th anniversary celebration of Woodstock, but now-Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz said Friday she initially did not expect it to happen.
"I thought he was kidding," said Bysiewicz. "I never thought he would do it. He is reliving his youth - just a little later."
A cable television entrepreneur from Greenwich, Lamont personally financed the event, including $17,000 in prize money for the bands that included $7,500 for the winners. No state money was spent.
In the same way, Lamont paid for many of the transition costs for his new administration, as well as the plane flight recently from his Maine vacation home to Lake Ontario in western New York to see Gov. Andrew Cuomo for talks on mutual interests during a fishing trip.
The winner Friday was "Last Licks," which has been playing for the past 13 years across Connecticut. One of the crowd favorites was the Hollister Thompson Band, which has played at Mohegan Sun and came in second place Friday. The band played the classic "White Rabbit" by the Jefferson Airplane, as well as "My Generation" by The Who.
"These guys are good," Lamont said as Hollister Thompson was playing. "What I like about them is they can play everything."
The bands were allowed to play for 30 minutes each, but the rules said they needed to perform at least one song that was played at the actual Woodstock festival in 1969.
Lamont's wife, Annie, said others had doubts the anniversary celebration would be held, but it turned into a large event that prompted additional turnout at the fair.
"I thought it might because he has regretted not going to Woodstock," Annie Lamont said. "That is so Ned. He's a classic entrepreneur."
A heckler began shouting at the start of Lamont's speech, but his comments could not be heard by much of the crowd before he was escorted away by the fair's security staff.
"Hey, how you doing, man?" Lamont responded to the heckler. "Well, at Woodstock, there were a lot of protests, too. ... That's what it's about."

Texto completo: Motorized electric bicycles may soon be humming along serene trails in national parks and other public lands nationwide.
It's part of a new Trump administration order - hotly opposed by many outdoors groups - that will allow e-bikes on every federal trail where a regular bike can go.
Sales of the bikes, powered by both pedals and battery-driven small motors, are booming, and some aging or less fit people have sought the rule change.
It will allow them to whirr up and down biking trails in the country's roughly 400 national parks and other federally managed backcountry areas.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt signed the order without fanfare Thursday, classifying e-bikes as non-motorized bikes.
The e-bikes "make bicycle travel easier and more efficient, and they provide an option for people who want to ride a bicycle but might not otherwise do so because of physical fitness, age, disability or convenience," National Park Service Deputy Director Daniel Smith said in a statement Friday.
Welcoming the change in Bar Harbor, Maine, on Friday, Gordon Goodwin, 69, said he and his wife look forward to riding the 57 miles of carriage paths that meander throughout Acadia National Park.
The paths, offering stunning views of lakes, mountains, forests and the ocean, are popular with bicyclists, but e-bikes have had to stay on the park's roads instead.
"We're stoked. We're really stoked," Goodwin said. "There's just too much traffic on the main park roads that you can't enjoy them. It'll be great to get in the park and see nature and all that stuff."
But more than 50 hiking, horse-riding and other outdoor and conservation associations, including the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and Pacific Crest Trail Association, objected in a July letter to the Interior Department. They say the administration is fundamentally changing the nature of national parks with little or no public notice or study.

Texto completo: Coverage of Biden visit unfair
We found your coverage of former Vice President Joe Biden’s visit to the Upper Valley misleading and unfair (“Biden prioritizes climate change,” Aug. 24). We particularly cite the subheadline: “Ex-vice president … ponders hypothetical Obama assassination.”
Biden’s reference to President Barack Obama was said in the context of recalling traumatic events in our country, such as the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. Your headline misleads the reader and seems an egregious misrepresentation of a short, passing remark.
We attended the Croydon event and the vice president’s comment about “rich people being as patriotic as poor people” was in reference to a plan to finance some of his health care proposals by imposing a tax on higher income earners. He was highlighting his belief that wealthy Americans love their country and would be willing to support it financially. It was not a “problematic comment” as your article claimed.
The citing of several other such “problematic comments” seemed to us to be poorly imagined examples of a self-fulfilling prophecy about Biden.
We look to the Valley News to provide us with more thoughtful summaries of what leading Democratic and Republican presidential candidates have to say. During this critical political time, it is essential that you do that, both for us and for the country.

Biden story was reprehensible
I found the story about former Vice President Joe Biden’s event at Dartmouth College to be reprehensible (“Biden prioritizes climate change: Ex-vice president talks of wooing younger voters, ponders hypothetical Obama assassination,” Aug. 24). This was one of the most powerful political events by a presidential candidate that this registered Republican has attended in 27 years of living here. Moreover, Biden’s discussion of the “hypothetical Obama assassination” was no gaffe — it was one of the most powerful sections of his discussion with voters.
Biden was discussing when he decided that gay marriage was acceptable. He explained that it was because of something his father said to him just after they saw two male lawyers kiss outside a courthouse in Delaware in the 1960s. Biden’s father told him it was OK because they loved each other.
Biden then turned to a larger exposition about civil rights and the 1960s. He was trying to explain to the students how politically charged the times were. As part of that, he described how two people he idolized at the time, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., were both assassinated. To explain how he felt, he asked to the students to imagine how they would have felt if Obama had been assassinated during the primaries in 2007. This was one of the most powerful parts of his talk. I was spellbound.
If this is a gaffe, I want more gaffes. I want politicians who can make people feel the real emotions of life. And it would be very useful to our discourse if newspapers actually provided context and nuance, instead of simply reporting random sentences.

Ruling could impact elections
On Aug. 20, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled that Colorado’s presidential electors do not have to vote according to the results of their state’s election process, but may vote any way they want. This could mean that national elections could be decided by the votes of a small number of electors appointed to the Electoral College.
This decision is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. I would recommend contacting your representatives in Congress to voice your opinion.

Better tactic for fighting back
The people who are attacked and insulted by President Donald Trump often do not fight back smartly. They usually defend themselves on his terms rather than fighting back on theirs. That is not a good tactic in many spheres of life.
For example, Greenland. The Danish prime minister could have immediately insisted that Trump return the Virgin Islands to Denmark for the paltry sum that the U.S. paid for them in 1917. The Danish people and their Parliament rejected the proposed sale. The U.S. threatened military action. The pro-sellers had to cajole, threaten and finally wheel into Parliament ill legislators to barely provide the votes necessary to approve the sale. And Mexico could insist that Trump give back New Mexico and Arizona. Then he would have no problems on those borders. And what about northern Maine, which is populated significantly by Acadian French? It should be part of bilingual New Brunswick. Canada should insist that Trump sell it.
And when Trump insults the appearance and words of others, they could note his flabby appearance and his limited vocabulary and knowledge of grammar. And they could comment that the patriotism and toughness he likes to display seem to be phony, as evidenced by his dodging military service five times when his country called him.

Texto completo: Seacoast Online
James McClelland became a “big, quivering pile of mess” when he answered a call from Boston Marathon bombing survivor Heather Abbott, telling him her foundation would be giving him a water prosthesis.
Only the seventh person in the world to undergo the “Ewing Amputation,” McClelland would finally be able feel the Atlantic Ocean on his skin again.

“Imagine you have to sit in a chair every day, and then someone says, ‘You can get out of the chair now and get your life back,' ” McClelland said. “That's what Heather did for me.”
The donor and recipient met Thursday at the very end of Island Path in Hampton, where McClelland showed off his new prosthesis to family and friends from atop a paddleboard. He paddled around the quiet estuary as a late afternoon sun cast down on the water, and family and friends snapped picture after picture from the sand.

A Hampton resident who lives not far from Cinnamon Rainbows Surf Shop, McClelland, 54, was voraciously active prior to his April 2018 amputation. At Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital, he was part of a Department of Defense clinical trial to develop bionic limbs. The pioneering Ewing Amputation allows for McClelland's prosthesis to feel and act like the real thing.

The amputation came after five ankle breaks – twice hiking, and the others times from being hit by a car, slipping on a wet floor and dancing. The breaks caused 25 years of excruciating pain, impeding his ability to partake in his favorite activities.

“The leg I was born with turned my life into a prison,” McClelland said. While he was visiting specialists, deciding whether or not to amputate, he met a man in Maine who said amputation had given him his life back. And so McClelland decided – surgeons removed his leg below the knee.

McClelland hunts, kayaks, paddle boards and goes fishing. He is a former CAT 2 cyclist, and he loves ice climbing. This year he contacted the Heather Abbott Foundation about the possibility of getting a “water leg,” to get back into his favorite outdoor sports.

Abbott, of Newport, R.I., was wounded by the second bomb that detonated at the 2013 Boston Marathon. As a result, doctors amputated her left leg below the knee.
The Heather Abbott Foundation has provided approximately 50 people with prostheses, and given summer camp opportunities to kids with limb differences. Abbott said many types of prostheses are not covered by health insurance, and those with microprocessor parts, for example, can cost $100,000 or more.

Not only can McClelland now paddleboard, swim and kayak, but he can “stand in the shower,” Abbott noted. The leg was created by Next Step Bionics and Prosthetics in Manchester.

“He's a very active guy, and he's definitely a go-getter,” Abbott said. “He's not going to let anything stop him. He loves the ocean, and we're happy to get him back out.”
McClelland said Abbott “made this happen.” Otherwise, he said, he would have been “sitting in my truck looking at the water.”
McClelland was joined Thursday by his wife, daughter, mother, parents-in-law, niece, brother and friends, all wearing Heather Abbott Foundation gear.

“It's been a journey, seeing him get back on the water where he's happiest,” said family friend Gretchen Trafton. “Being able to watch him come back from that, it's pretty awesome. His face has lit up. It's the James back from 1985.”
McClelland said the “first thing on the agenda” for the winter season is the White Mountains, where he's excited to do some ice climbing. “There is absolutely nothing that is going to stop me,” he proclaimed.
“This is a new life,” said his mother, Carol Lee Sawyer, of Cape Elizabeth, Maine. “It's just amazing. His spirit and his feelings about life are different now, too.”
McClelland's wife, Kris McClelland, said, “It's like fireworks going off today.”
“He's fantastic,” she smiled.

Wilton’s Forster Mill is no more

Texto completo: Demolition of Forster Mill has been completed. Once final sign-off from Maine Department of Environmental Protection and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is issued, town officials will consider future use of the site.

WILTON — Four-and-a-half years after foreclosing on the property, the walls of Wilton’s Forster Mill have finally come down. EnviroVantage, of Epping, New Hampshire, started the long process in March of 2018 and finished its work last Friday. Last year’s efforts focused on asbestos abatement and removal of salvageable materials. In June the second phase of the project began to completely raze the remaining structures.
Final approval to close out the project is still pending from both Maine Department of Environmental Protection and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Presence of asbestos and hazardous solvents and substances required oversight from the government agencies. Once the town has filed its final environmental reports, Wilton officials will assess the site for future use.
The most recent work done by EnviroVantage is projected to cost about $384,000, with current charges from Ransom consulting, the engineering services company overseeing the demolition, at about $11,500. The town received a combined $500,000 in grants and interest-free loans from ME DEP through the EPA Brownfields Project, and from Androscoggin Valley Council of Governments.
Town manager Rhonda Irish has already made recommendations to the Board of Selectpersons about things that should be done before winter, such as filling in low spots and adding additional security fencing. Concrete piers that supported the building over Wilson Stream will remain.
“While these columns are showing signs of deterioration, we opted to leave them as is,” explained Jamie Madore of Ransom Consulting last Friday. “Each one has footings below ground in the stream that are essentially established habitat. At this point we want to cause as little disruption to the waterway as possible. Removal of the concrete would require stream restoration, a completely different type of project with its own set of permitting requirements.”
The Select Board will have a land use consulting firm sort out the next steps, including how much buildable space is left on the site for a developer to work with. The property is 17.65 acres, split by Wilson Stream. The portion of the site where Forster Mill was located is about 5.33 acres.
“Since more than 50% of the property value no longer exists any development will fall under current codes as new construction. That means no building can be located within 75 feet of the stream,” said Codes Enforcement Officer Charlie Lavin. The contours of the stream and Depot Road limit how much of the lot can be considered buildable.
The demolition of Forster Mill brings an end to a historic town landmark, where generations of Wilton residents worked, going back to 1901. For several years it was the Wilton Woolen Mill, adapting ownership and production several times over the years according to consumer and even World War II demand. Between 1960-1985 operations shifted to wood products made by Forster Manufacturing Company, like croquet sets and snap clothespins. After Forster Manufacturing closed out its Maine-based operations, Jarden Plastic Solutions moved in, producing plastic cutlery until it opened a new facility in town in 2003. Since then the property sat dormant until its last owner Adam Mack attempted to dismantle the mill in 2012.
A fire and subsequent discovery of hazardous materials that were not properly handled shut down his effort. By 2015 Wilton officials took steps to foreclose on the property.
“Once the site is surveyed for use the town can come up with a final plan,” said Irish. “We may decide to sell it for development. It’s in the village zone so a buyer will have options, within the buildable footprint. Many residents have indicated they’d like to see it become a park. There is still a lot of work for us to do.”

They both have severe injuries

MADISON — Two men were severely injured after a bull got loose from its pen on Friday afternoon, according to Mike Mitchell, chief deputy of the Somerset County Sheriff’s Office.
At approximately 12:56 p.m., officers were called to a farm on the Horsetail Road to find Ronald McEwen, 57, of Madison and his father-in-law, Robert Neal, 83, of Madison with severe injuries from trying to apprehend McEwen’s bull which had escaped its enclosure.
According to Mitchell, Neal received severe injuries to his arm and leg and McEwen to his face and leg.
After the men were attacked, McEwen retrieved a rifle from his residence and was able to “dispatch the bull” before it caused further harm.
Neal was transported by Life Flight to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and McEwen by Anson-Madison Ambulance Service to Redington-Fairview General Hospital in Skowhegan for treatment of injuries that were not considered life threatening.
Mitchell said that the risk to public safety would have been significant if the bull had continued to roam at large outside his enclosed pasture.

Texto completo: If the newest $27.12 million budget isn't passed by voters on Sept. 12, it will be the third failed budget in a matter of months.

FAIRFIELD — Residents from Albion, Benton, Clinton and Fairfield approved a $27.12 million budget for Maine School Administrative District 49 at a meeting on Thursday evening.
The budget, which was shot down twice in the last two months, reflects a $250,834 decrease from the last approved budget on July 9 and a $36,218 decrease from the original budget that was presented at a meeting in May, making this the lowest proposed budget the board has presented yet.
The board was able to reduce the budget significantly by rearranging a special education position between two schools and aligning the budget with changes in salaries and personnel benefits for the upcoming year and with the cost of natural gas, the rate of which is anticipated to be less this school year.
The budget’s articles on regular instruction and special education raised concerns, while the other 13 articles garnered minimal discussion.
Former school board member Shelley Rudnicki, who resigned with Caroline Toto-Lawrence and Tim Martin at a Fairfield Town Council meeting on Aug. 10, made her way to the microphone to raise her concerns about the regular instruction article.
“The May 14 budget, which was originally posed and sent to taxpayers had regular education at $10.8 million. What did the addition of $118,000 go towards?” Rudnicki said. “And why haven’t we considered reducing at least one position in the Albion schools. Fairfield has nearly 25 kids to one teacher where Albion has 8 or 9.”
Vice Chairwoman Jenny Boyden answered.
“We didn’t work off (the) number that was amended from that meeting; we went from what was originally proposed, not the amendment,” Boyden said.
Boyden also explained that additional costs reflected the addition of reading recovery positions as well as shifts in positions that were previously funded by Title 1.
Rudnicki motioned to amend the article by $100,000, which was seconded by Toto-Lawrence.
Rudnicki’s motion was defeated when only she, Toto-Lawrence and Toto-Lawrence’s husband, Fairfield Town Council Member Peter Lawrence, supported the article.
The article for special education was the next point of contention for Rudnicki and a fellow unnamed citizen.
“Once again please explain the differences between what the original May 14 budget came at to what it is now,” Rudnicki said. “It’s not a decrease like you’re trying to tell us; it’s actually an increase. … It just seems like we’re playing games here.”
Boyden responded by explaining that the decrease the board is talking about is from the last approved budget on July 9, not the one from May 14.
After Rudnicki asked about the district’s enrollment numbers, Board Member Kara Kugelmyer chimed in.
“I don’t know what this has to do with special education. I don’t understand the argument,” Kugelmyer said.
“The argument about our taxes continuing to go up, and you have not done anything but play games with this budget,” Rudnicki said.
According to documents provided by Board Chairman Shawn Knox, the mil rate increase for each town is: 0.82 for Albion; 0.91 for Benton; 0.82 for Clinton; and 0.66 for Fairfield.
Another resident questioned the board about the increases to special education, which came out to be around $115,480.
“A lot of administrators said they didn’t have adequate staff,” Boyden said. “That was a primary concern so we added staff. We had two special education teachers and five techs added between May and July… So a substantial portion of the budget increases is salary since that was the main concern.”
The board made additional changes from July to when it approved the budget on Aug. 12 by shifting one of the special education teachers from Albion Elementary to Lawrence Junior High School. Knox said this wouldn’t disrupt the students of Albion.
“To address the previous concern, I want to applaud the board for taking the time to make sure we have an additional teacher,” Benjamin Kent, a mathematics teacher at Lawrence High School, said. “Our students are in dire need. … Some of our students were supposed to have one-on-one ed tech help, and they were going without and they were suffering. It (the budget) might go up but it’s needed. … We’re all going to have to accept the fact this piece of the budget is going up a significant amount, but it’s for the benefit of the students.”
After Kent’s comment the article was approved by voters.
The remaining articles were approved with no discussion and the meeting adjourned less than an hour after it began.
The revised budget goes to a referendum on Sept. 12. If not passed, it would be the third failed referendum since June.
Voters rejected a $27.42 million budget in June with 586 “no” votes to 325 “yes” votes and again defeated a $27.36 budget in July 290- 262.
The two failed referendums come after an unsteady year which included resignations from seven teachers, the superintendent and Lawrence High School’s assistant and head principals along with three board members from Fairfield.
The tenure of former Superintendent Dr. Reza Namin, whose resignation took effect on Aug. 2, was rife with controversy in great part due to his divisive restructuring plan that eventually cost the district $417,665 in administrative buyouts.

Texto completo: State Bureau of Motor Vehicle branch offices are facing what officials call a 'perfect storm' of issues that have left thousands of motorists waiting in line for hours as they try to renew a driver's license or register a vehicle.

AUGUSTA — Many Maine motorists have been stuck in the slow lane at the state’s Bureau of Motor Vehicle branch offices this summer — with thousands waiting more than 1.5 hours to get their license renewed or a new car registered.
Kristen Muszynski, a spokeswoman for the Maine Secretary of State’s Office, which oversees the BMV, said Friday that the situation isn’t normal for an agency that is usually praised for its speedy and helpful customer service.
“We are usually a lot quicker,” she said. “We’ve just had a perfect storm of different things coming into play right now.”
One major factor, Muszynski said, is a staffing shortage that’s left the BMV offices with 15 staff vacancies across the three different regions of the state — south, central and north.
Some customers at the Portland BMV office on Presumpscot Street said Friday that they waited as long as three hours for service.
Nick Hoffman, 20, of Kennebunk said this was his third day in a row waiting to turn in paperwork documenting his driving hours on a learner’s permit. Hoffman said he waited two hours on Wednesday, an hour Thursday and was going on another hour Friday.
“It’s pretty frustrating,” he said.
Bill Robinson, a Falmouth resident, came to register a car but after taking a ticket number for No. 220, he turned around and left — as workers paged No. 97 over the office’s loudspeakers.
“I’ll have to try another day,” Robinson said.
Jim Beale, of Portland, was there to get his motorcycle license at 9:30 a.m. but left at noon for lunch when his number (116) hadn’t come up and it looked like it would be a while. But by the time Beale got back his number had passed and he had to take another — 246.
While frustrated — Beale said he could think of better ways to spend a sunny Friday afternoon — he was understanding of the state’s situation and said finding workers was a problem for many businesses in Maine. “I get it,” he said. “I’m not that upset really. I just made a poor choice. Also the last day of the month is always busy. So what am I doing here?”
The BMV’s vacancies represent 21% of the staff in the 70-person bureau. The starting wage for BMV customer service workers is $14.16 an hour but that is going to $14.58 an hour starting in September, Muszynski said.
Nationally, the average wait time for a customer in a bureau of motor vehicles office is 34 minutes, according to an eight-month study conducted by BMV.com in 2018. The website is a clearinghouse portal for motorists offering links to online license and registration services, as well as educational postings for drivers.
The site also ranks the best and the worst BMV operations around the country. Among those with notorious reputations for long wait times and poor customer service are Connecticut, South Carolina and Oregon. Those with the best rankings include Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. Maine ranks near the middle of the pack.
Muszynski said the bureaus have been slowed considerably by a wave of Mainers trying to switch their driver’s licenses to the new federally compliant Real ID, the regular uptick in summer traffic and vacation season.
“When we combine the 11% increase in traffic with the number of positions vacant, the implementation of Real ID, the summer vacation season and already minimal staffing levels, that creates longer wait times for customers,” she said.
In all, the bureaus have seen 8,000 more customers from July 1 to Aug. 20 this year than they did for the same period last year, according to data Muzsynski provided to the Portland Press Herald.
Muszynski said six new staffers are in training. She also suggested that residents consider delaying applying for a Real ID, as the federal government won’t enforce that requirement for Mainers until October 2020.
Muszynski also noted that many bureau services, including basic driver’s license renewals and motor vehicle registrations, are provided online. She said those who must visit the BMV should try to avoid Mondays, which is always a busy day, and to avoid the midday lunchtime crush between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.

Texto completo: Harvest Bucks is a nutrition incentive program that provides extra fruit and vegetables to folks who shop with an EBT/SNAP card at farmers markets.
SOMERVILLE — The Farmers Market at Pumpkin Vine Family Farm at 217 Hewett Road will launch its Maine Harvest Bucks program on Sunday, just in time for the fall harvest season. Shoppers can fill their market basket for less by using their EBT/ SNAP card to purchase any of of the fresh, local food at the market (meat, cheese, eggs, bread), then receive a dollar for dollar match in Maine Harvest Bucks, that can be used to buy fresh fruits and vegetables, according to a news release from the family farm.
Halfway between the capital and the coast, the market is located on a working historic farm and aims to serve country folks where they live. The market was built by and for the community, in the belief that everyone should enjoy fresh local food. Locally grown food, tended by hand, often costs more than the food at grocery stores and can be hard to fit into a tight budget. But the farmers at the Pumpkin Vine Market want to make sure all can enjoy their food no matter their budget. Not only will every SNAP dollar be matched with Harvest Bucks, but first time SNAP shoppers will get an extra bonus $10 in Harvest Bucks on their first purchase.
According to the release, Maine Harvest Bucks is funded by the USDA through a FINI (Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Program) and implemented in Maine by the Maine Federation of Farmers Markets. The farmers market at Pumpkin Vine Family Farm is proud to join the effort to provide healthy food for all. The market is open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. every Sunday from May through December.
For more information, email info@pumpkinvinefamilyfarm.com or call Kelly Payson-Roopchand at 549-3096.

BACK ON THE MARKET Three Minot Avenue properties in Auburn - once the focus of an ambitious medical tourism project backed by Chinese investors - are for sale at $5 million.

Texto completo: AUBURN -- The properties at the heart of a stalled medical tourism redevelopment effort are back on the market.
The properties, including "The Barn" at 67 Minot Ave., were part of an ambitious $40 million plan backed by Chinese investors to create a health and wellness hotel aligned with Central Maine Medical Center. But, there have been no signs of life for the project for some time, because of a restrictive EB-5 visa program and changes at CMMC.
The former shoe factory was purchased by Miracle Enterprise in 2015, a sale that also included a former car dealership at 81 Minot Ave. Later that year, the company also bought the former Auburn police station at 1 Minot Ave. Now, four years later, all three properties are packaged together for $5 million.
Its chairwoman, Shi Qi, was also chairwoman of the Beijing-based Guo Tou Sheng Tong Investment Co., which was expected to finance the $40 million effort to convert the former Lunn and Sweet shoe factory into the state-of-the-art medical hotel.
Shortly after the sale, the Chinese investors and city officials held a news conference, boasting the city could expect 5,000 wealthy Chinese citizens to stay at the new luxury medical tourism facility planned for The Barn in its first year.
However, according to Michael Chammings, director of Economic and Community Development, the redevelopment hinged on a visa program known as EB-5, which, because of restrictions at the federal level, has held up the project for years.
The program grants green cards to foreign investors and sets them on the path to U.S. citizenship, in exchange for a significant business investment on U.S. soil. However, Maine was not yet an approved EB-5 regional center, as the state waited on U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which must approve all regional centers.
"What was supposed to take a few months turned into a number of years," Chammings said Friday about the EB-5 program. "By the time it came into Maine, it was over two years, which is a long time to hold a project up. For people who want to invest in that project, to hold them up for two years, it just doesn't work in a business plan."
While that was held up, there was also leadership and financial changes at CMMC. Former CEO of CMMC parent Central Maine Healthcare, Peter Chalke, had been closely involved in project discussions, but that shifted once a new CEO came on board.
A hospital spokesperson told the Sun Journal in 2017, "To say that we will be or won't be involved is kind of like grasping at a cloud. There's nothing there."
Chammings, as well as the listing broker, Lily Huang for Legacy Realty, said Friday that there is potential for the properties to be redeveloped into housing. "There's good potential because it's a major street in Lewiston-Auburn, which averages a daily traffic count of 30,000," Huang said.

Texto completo: WATERVILLE -- A Maine State Police trooper was charged this week with being impaired while accompanying a motor vehicle permittee, Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said.
Daniel Murray, 33, of Mount Vernon joined Troop C in Skowhegan in September 2017. The Messalonskee High School graduate previously worked in security at MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta.
Murray and the 15-year-old driver were stopped just after midnight Tuesday when a Waterville police officer spotted their 2014 Toyota Corolla leaving Mainely Brews in Waterville without its headlights on.
The officer stopped the car on Silver Street, saw the teenager driving and suspected Murray of being intoxicated, Waterville Deputy Police Chief Bill Bonney said.
"Basically, you have got to be sober if you're going to accompany a permittee," Bonney said. "And if you're not, you can get charged and the permittee can get charged for operating without a license."
Both Murray and the teenager, who was summonsed for driving without a license, are scheduled to appear in Waterville District Court on Oct. 8. Both charges are Class E misdemeanors that are punishable by up to six months in jail.
The Department of Public Safety is reviewing the arrest and has not determined if it will pursue disciplinary action against Murray, McCausland said.

Two men severely injured when bull gets loose
Two men were severely injured by a bull that got loose from its pen Friday afternoon, prompting them to get a rifle they used to shoot and kill the bull, said Mike Mitchell, chief deputy of the Somerset County Sheriff's Office.
At approximately 12:56 p.m., officers were called to a farm on the Horsetail Road to find Ronald McEwen, 57, of Madison and his father-in-law, Robert Neal, 83, of Madison with severe injuries from trying to corral McEwen's bull after it had escaped its enclosure.
Neal received severe injuries to his arm and leg and McEwen to his face and leg, Mitchell said.
After the men were attacked, McEwen retrieved a rifle from his residence and was able to "dispatch the bull" before it caused further harm.
Neal was transported by Life Flight to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and McEwen by Anson-Madison Ambulance Service to Redington-Fairview General Hospital in Skowhegan for treatment of injuries that were not considered life threatening.
Mitchell said that the risk to public safety would have been significant if the bull had continued to roam at large outside his enclosed pasture.

Scientist who resettled puffins in Maine retiring
A scientist who helped re-establish puffins on islands off the Maine coast is retiring.
Dr. Steve Kress served as executive director of the Seabird Restoration Program and vice president of bird conservation at the National Audubon Society.
Kress said that about 1,000 puffin chicks were moved from Newfoundland to Eastern Egg Rock, starting in 1973.
He said he's proud to have succeeded in rebooting the colony.
Kress earned global recognition for his "social attraction" techniques using bird decoys, sound recordings, and mirrors to lure puffins to Eastern Egg Rock.
The seabird work continues under the leadership of Dr. Donald Lyons, who spent 20 years at Oregon State University working on seabird science and conservation.
Gifford's unveils new flavor honoring Patriots
Gifford's Famous Ice Cream, the Maine-based company that last month became the official ice cream of the New England Patriots, has revealed its new custom flavor honoring the six-time Super Bowl champs: Dough Your Job.
The ice cream, unveiled during the Patriots' last preseason game at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Thursday night, is described as fudge-striped vanilla ice cream packed with chocolate caramel footballs and cookie dough. The name is a play on the team's unofficial motto, "Do your job," a phrase oft uttered by head coach Bill Belichick and superstar quarterback Tom Brady.
"It's become a team saying, and it's all about staying focused on hard work, preparation, and the attention to detail needed to win," said JC Gifford, vice president of sales at Gifford's.
Dough Your Job will be sold at Gillette Stadium and at grocery stores and ice cream stands all over New England. Gifford's contract with the Patriots is for five years.
WATERVILLE
Ban on plastic bags takes effect on Sunday
Starting Sunday, shoppers at large stores in the city will have to bring their own bags to tote their merchandise - or use paper bags if stores supply or sell them.
Sunday is the day the city's plastic bag ban goes into effect, prohibiting stores that are 10,000-square-feet or larger from dispensing single-use plastic bags to customers at checkout. That would include stores such as Shaw's, Hannaford, JC Penney and Walmart.
Earlier this year, the state Legislature passed a law banning the practice at all Maine businesses, and in June, Gov. Janet Mills signed the bill into law. The statewide ban will go into effect on Earth Day, April 22, 2020.

Mexico man seeks to overturn sentence
A Mexico man who is seeking a new hearing to overturn a 45-month sentence said the Lewiston police officer who testified against him had a history of drug use and evidence-tampering that made him an unreliable witness and whose testimony lacked credibility.
Norman "Bo" Thompson, 47, filed a motion in Androscoggin County Superior Court last week aimed at reversing the nearly four-year sentence a judge imposed on him in January. The sentence stemmed from suspended portions of sentences from earlier convictions in Oxford, Cumberland and Androscoggin counties for theft, burglary and forgery.
Nicholas Meserve, 34, a 10-year veteran of the Lewiston Police Department, testified at Thompson's Jan. 31 probation revocation hearing. Meserve was one of the officers who pursued Thompson in a police car and foot chase on the night of Nov. 22, 2018, in Lewiston near the city's high school. Meserve assisted in Thompson's arrest on two felony charges and several misdemeanors related to the incident.
Those charges prompted Thompson's probation revocation.
Roughly a week after Thompson's hearing, Meserve died from acute fentanyl intoxicaton, according to Lewiston Police Chief Brian O'Malley.
Thompson's attorney, Paul Corey, wrote in his recent motion that "Mr. Meserve was an addict who consumed illegal drugs daily for at least two years prior to his death," quoting from a report shared with him by prosecutors. "There were occasions," the report continues, "when Mr. Meserve stole drugs from other dealers with whom he interacted in his law enforcement capacity, some of which he consumed and some of which he provided to his own dealer to sell to others to finance his drug habit."
Corey wrote that the conduct of Meserve involving opioid abuse and evidence-tampering was shared with Thompson after his client was sentenced in January based on Meserve's testimony. That means Meserve's drug-related behavior is new evidence that has arisen since Thompson's sentencing and should entitle him to a new hearing on his probation revocation, Corey wrote.

Texto completo: Daniel Murray, a Maine State Trooper from Mount Vernon, was summoned on Tuesday after being stopped by Waterville Police for accompanying a 15-year-old permit driver while intoxicated.

WATERVILLE — The Mount Vernon man who was summoned on Tuesday on a charge of accompanying a motor vehicle permittee while impaired is a Maine State Trooper, according to Steve McCausland, the spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.
Daniel Murray, 33, a Messalonskee High School graduate, previously worked in security at MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta and joined Troop C in Skowhegan in Sept. 2017.
Murray and the 15-year-old driver were stopped just after midnight on Tuesday when a Waterville police Officer spotted their 2014 Toyota Corolla leaving Mainely Brews in Waterville without its headlights on.
The officer stopped the car on Silver Street and saw the 15-year-old driving and suspected the passenger of being intoxicated from drinking alcohol, according to Waterville Deputy Police Chief Bill Bonney.
“Basically, you have got to be sober if you’re going to accompany a permittee,” Bonney said Wednesday. “And if you’re not, you can get charged and the permittee can get charged for operating without a license.”
Both Murray and the 15-year-old, who was summoned for driving without a license, are scheduled to appear at 8:30 a.m. Oct. 8 in Waterville District Court. Both charges are Class E misdemeanors which are typically punishable by up to six months in jail.
It has not been confirmed whether the state will pursue disciplinary action against Murray as McCausland said the Department of Public Safety is still reviewing the arrest.

Texto completo: Daniel Murray, a Maine State Trooper from Mount Vernon, was summoned on Tuesday after being stopped by Waterville Police for accompanying a 15-year-old permit driver while intoxicated.

WATERVILLE — The Mount Vernon man who was summoned on Tuesday on a charge of accompanying a motor vehicle permittee while impaired is a Maine State Trooper, according to Steve McCausland, the spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.
Daniel Murray, 33, a Messalonskee High School graduate, previously worked in security at MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta and joined Troop C in Skowhegan in September 2017.
Murray and the 15-year-old driver were stopped just after midnight on Tuesday when a Waterville Police Officer spotted their 2014 Toyota Corolla leaving Mainely Brews in Waterville without its headlights on.
The officer stopped the car on Silver Street and saw the 15-year-old driving and suspected the passenger of being intoxicated from drinking alcohol, according to Waterville Deputy Police Chief Bill Bonney.
“Basically, you have got to be sober if you’re going to accompany a permittee,” Bonney said Wednesday. “And if you’re not, you can get charged and the permittee can get charged for operating without a license.”
Both Murray and the 15-year-old, who was summoned for driving without a license, are scheduled to appear at 8:30 a.m. Oct. 8 in Waterville District Court. Both charges are Class E misdemeanors which are typically punishable by up to six months in jail.
It has not been confirmed whether the state will pursue disciplinary action against Murray as McCausland said the Department of Public Safety is still reviewing the arrest.

Texto completo: ORONO -- Whenever you talk about the University of Maine football team, the discussion invariably starts with the Black Hole defense. Chris Ferguson and the offense want to change that.
Ferguson, the junior quarterback, surpassed his career high in the first half with 404 yards and finished with 423 passing yards and three touchdowns as seventh-ranked Maine overwhelmed Sacred Heart 42-14 in the season opener Friday night at Alfond Stadium. That gave Nick Charlton a victory in his first game as Black Bears head coach.
"I thought the execution was very high and that definitely pleased me and made me feel encouraged," said Charlton. "That's got to be the mentality of this offense. We're challenging the offense to be at that high level.
"I said in the offseason, we have an elite defense that's trying to go from being elite to being the best in the country. And we have a solid offense that's trying to be elite. And tonight there were some points where I think we reached that. And that starts at the quarterback position."
Maine scored touchdowns on all six first-half possessions as Ferguson was nearly perfect, completing his first 11 passes.
"I think we had a good week of prep, I was seeing everything we prepared for," said Ferguson, who completed 23 of 29 passes before being replaced by freshman Joe Fagnano with 4:30 remaining in the third quarter. "I'd say the game plan was pretty good because everything we called worked out. I had guys open and the offensive line did an unbelievable job.
"Wide receivers did what they had to do and they made plays. Credit them."
Ferguson, whose previous career high in the first half was 325 yards, threw touchdown passes to Earnest Edwards (8 yards), Devin Young (10 yards) and Jaquan Blair (14 yards). Blair finished with seven catches for 140 yards. Andre Miller had five catches for 53 yards, Young four catches for 104 and Edwards three for 84.
"That's what Top Flight does," said Blair, invoking the wide receiver corp's nickname. "Ferg puts the ball in position where only we can make the play and we go out there and we compete and make plays whenever we can."
The defense was good too. While Maine put up 582 yards of total offense, the Black Bears held the Pioneers to 207. Maine held Sacred Heart, which rushed for 241 yards a game last year (15th in the nation), to just 103, most coming late.
"We knew we had our hands full," said Sacred Heart Coach Mark Nofri. "They're a great team and they showed it tonight."
Emmanuel Reed, a grad transfer from FBS school Buffalo, scored two touchdowns and gained 62 yards. Joe Fitzpatrick, the former Cheverus star from North Yarmouth, had 36 rushing yards and a touchdown.
Maine led 21-0 in the game's first 10:12, putting together long quick-strike drives. The first one went 74 yards in 2:47, resulting in Edwards' touchdown catch; the second 91 yards in 2:02, with Reed scoring from the 9; the third went 76 yards in 67 seconds, with Fitzpatrick scoring from the 4 - one play after Blair caught a 68-yard pass.
Those drives spurred the defense to play better. "(The offense) came out fast," said senior safety Josh Huffman. "After the first (touchdown) to Earn, then another big one and then another big one, I said, 'They are rolling.' And the defense had to do the same thing - three-and-out, three-and-out."
NOTES: Maine's last 400-yard passing game by a quarterback came on Sept. 19, 2012 when Marcus Wasilewski threw for 409 yards in a 35-14 win over Villanova ... With 10:47 left in the second quarter, linebacker Deshawn Stevens was injured on a pass rush. He was taken off the field and carted to the locker room. Stevens, a preseason all-America choice, was Maine's leading tackler last year. Charlton didn't know the extent of the injury.

Texto completo: N.C. Hunt Lumber President Rob Hunt said 17 workers who were laid off in the wake of the March fire will likely return this winter.

JEFFERSON — A new steel-frame sawmill is almost complete at N.C. Hunt Lumber, signaling the return of more than a dozen jobs to Jefferson after a fire forced layoffs.
On Tuesday, workers were welding parts of the sawmill and placing steel panels on the roof. The steel-frame doesn’t have any walls yet, but N.C. Hunt President Rob Hunt — son of owner Norman Clark Hunt — said portions of the mill should be turned on in a matter of weeks to be calibrated. He said the whole sawmill should be running at full power in December.
The former wooden sawmill burned down in March and, in April, Department of Public Safety spokesperson Steve McCausland said the fire was accidental. The fire was caused by sparks from a torch used while making repairs to machinery. No one was injured in the blaze.
Rob Hunt said the company had to lay off 17 people after the fire, but kept 15 on to help build the mill. Some of the workers building the mill will operate it once construction is finished, he said, and the rest of the laid-off workers will return later.
“The goal is to bring them all back by this winter once we get the machines up and running,” Rob Hunt said. “Hopefully, we can grow. We’re super excited about that.”
He said employees were nervous the day after the fire, but were quick to move onto the rebuild.
“Everyone was pretty nervous that day,” Hunt said. “Within four weeks, we got the guts of the plan … and they started building it.”
“We jumped on it quick,” he added. “Take one step, if you thought about all 500 you’d get discouraged.”
Crews are reusing some parts of the old mill — like sections of foundations and components from old machinery — and combining them with new, state-of-the-art components to construct the facility. Rob Hunt compared the sawmill’s controls to those used to play video games, adding they are more intuitive for employees. He said if he contracted the job, it would cost about $3 million.
“We’ve used some assets we had here,” he said, adding that the company is using its own construction crew. “We’re doing it for quite a chunk less (than $3 million).”
Hunt said the new mill will help the company add more types of high-end wood to its inventory, which he said is shipped as far away as New York City and North Carolina. He said the sawmill was also engineered to be safer and more efficient.
The company used stored sawmill product to sustain some clients while the facility was rebuilt, but Dave Smith, N.C. Hunt Lumber’s retail general manager, said Tuesday some product had to be purchased from competitors to keep up with demand.
That was tough on the company’s bottom line, Hunt said, because it increases already-high transportation costs for products that would otherwise be produced in N.C. Hunt’s own lumber yard.
“It makes a huge difference for us … and we’re able to be very competitive,” he said.
Despite having to contact competitors for product, Smith and Hunt said other lumber yards have offered them reasonable prices.
“The other mills have been good to us,” Smith said. “The Maine lumber community came together (to help N.C. Hunt).”
“We’ve just had a tremendous amount of support, whether it be vendors, customers, loggers (or) employees,” Hunt added. “Without all the support we’ve had from the community, state and town, we wouldn’t have come close to what we’re doing.”

Texto completo: Stores that are 10,000-square-feet in size or larger may no longer dispense plastic bags to customers at check-out, as required by the city of Waterville's plastic bag ordinance.

WATERVILLE — Starting Sunday, shoppers at large stores in the city will have to bring their own bags to tote their merchandise — or use paper bags if stores supply or sell them.
Sunday is the day the city’s plastic bag ban goes into effect, prohibiting stores that are 10,000-square-feet or larger from dispensing single-use plastic bags to customers at checkout. That would include stores such as Shaw’s, Hannaford, JC Penney and Walmart.
Earlier this year, the state Legislature passed a law banning the practice at all Maine businesses, and in June, Gov. Janet Mills signed the bill into law. The statewide ban will go into effect on Earth Day, April 22, 2020.
Toby Rose, general manager of Save-A-Lot on The Concourse in downtown Waterville, is prepared for Sunday’s launch.
“We will have paper bags for sale, but our clients are already used to bringing in their own bags,” Rose said Wednesday. “I do have clients that are buying bags in bulk right now to prepare for it.”
Rose said the store will continue to sell plastic bags to customers until Sunday, when the ban takes place. They are six cents each, he said.
Rose is on board with the city’s plastic bag ordinance.
“I definitely think it’s going to have a huge effect, so I’m really excited,” he said.
Hannaford, which has two stores in Waterville, at both Elm Plaza off Main Street and JFK Plaza off Kennedy Memorial Drive, also is ready.
Hannaford spokesman Eric Blom said the company has posted signs in the stores to inform people of the change. Hannaford has had a lot of experience with the plastic bag ban in other communities. Blom said paper bags will be available for sale in the stores for about five cents each, but there also is an environmental impact with paper bags in terms of manufacturing and trucking.
“We really hope that people will move toward reusable bags — that’s really the best environmental solution — but there are paper bags available,” Blom said.
Waterville residents in November approved the bag ban in a 3,052-2,906 vote.
The question on the ballot asked if voters wished to enact a proposed ordinance establishing a ban on providing free carryout plastic bags to a customer at the point of departure in any retail or commercial establishment with a retail or commercial space at or exceeding 10,000 square feet. The Sustain Mid-Maine Coalition helped to initiate the plastic bag ban.
Waterville resident Todd Martin, who also helped in the bag ban effort, said Wednesday that it will help reduce litter in city neighborhoods.
“When Waterville voters approved the ordinance to ban plastic bags at big box (stores) at the polls last November, Waterville became the 20th Maine town to take action to reduce plastic bag pollution,” Martin said. “Not only do they litter our community, they clog sorting equipment at ecomaine where Waterville sends its recycling. Reusable shopping bags are a cheap and easy solution.”
Martin notes that with the ban starting in Waterville, shoppers may bring any type of bag they want with them to stores to use at check-out, including reusable plastic or paper bags. The ban does not ban thin film plastic bags used by stores to bag meat, fruit, vegetables or bulk items. All Waterville restaurants are exempt from the plastic bag ban, Martin said.
The city ordinance was to have gone into effect this year on Earth Day, April 22, but Mayor Nick Isgro led an effort to collect signatures from residents to force the votes to be recounted. The bag issue eventually went to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court after a recount reversed the election results, defeating the controversial measure by seven votes. The court dismissed the case and the bag ban ultimately was upheld. The City Council this spring voted 6-0 to extend the plastic bag ban launch to Sept. 1 to allow time for a city board to hear the appeal.
The ordinance, posted on the city website, www.waterville-me.gov, says it is in the best interest of residents and visitors to reduce the cost of solid waste disposal and protect the environment and natural resources by discouraging use of plastic carryout bags and encourage use of reusable bags at large stores. The ordinance, titled “Ordinance Regulating Carryout Plastic Shopping Bags,” says large stores may sell or give away paper bags to customers for carrying items.
The city’s code enforcement officer is the enforcer of the ordinance and shall issue a warning to stores violating it, according to the document. Subsequent violations are subject to up to a $250 fine for the first violation in a one-year period and up to $500 for the second and each subsequent violation on a one-year period.
Waterville Code Enforcement Officer Dan Bradstreet said this week that in June, he sent notices to all the stores that must comply with the bag ban and he heard back from only one that had some questions about the criteria for reusable bags.
“I sent out 21 notices, so there are 21 stores affected,” Bradstreet said. “I’m not anticipating any issues.”
In an email Thursday, Shaw’s issued a statement about the bag ban, saying Shaw’s and Star Market care about the environment. Their stores, offices and distribution centers take part in many programs that promote recycling, cardboard baling, plastics recycling, zero-waste programs and more, the statement says.
“To reduce the use of plastic and paper bags, we continually encourage our customers to bring in reusable bags for their shopping orders. We also have available at our stores other shopping bag alternatives that further promote the use of reusable bags. In addition, we will continue to comply with all local ordinances regarding the use of plastic bags.”

Uncovering a fort in Windham, inch by inch

Texto completo: The Maine Historic Preservation Commission's roadside archaeological dig is helping resolve mysteries of a fort that was built in the 1740s.
Maine Historic Preservation Commission’s archaeological dig is helping resolve mysteries

Layer by layer, archaeologists in Windham are resolving — and revealing — mysteries.
The questions they have as they sift through nearly three centuries of dirt and rubble include how a 1744-era fort was constructed, how many people sought refuge in it and what life was like for the colonists who had moved to the area from Marblehead, Massachusetts.
John Mosher and his team from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission have to work fast to find answers. Their excavation is being done alongside River Road in Windham, which is being rebuilt by the Maine Department of Transportation. On Tuesday, the archaeologists will wrap up work on the west side of the road and move to the east side, where they will have another month or so to excavate and examine the remains of the fort.
After that, construction crews will lower the hilltop road about 5 feet and rebuild and widen the pavement. Whatever is left of the fort is likely to be trucked from the site.
Most of the site consists of clusters of rock, which Mosher said is evidence of chimney foundations and a base for a wooden boardwalk inside the fort. The archaeologists are unsure of the reason for another large cluster of rocks on the site, he said, but hope that the excavation of the rest of the fort might provide an answer.
The only artifacts found from the period when the fort existed, he said, were gun flints and small pieces of ceramics.
The area around the fort was called New Marblehead by the 60 or so colonists from Massachusetts who had been granted a large tract of land to settle west of Portland. Province Fort was built on a hilltop near the center of the settlement, and close to the Presumpscot River, as hostilities were growing between English colonists, like those from Massachusetts, and Native Americans, who were allies of the French.
The hostilities eventually grew into King George’s War, which was fought between 1744 and 1748, primarily in upstate New York, New England and Nova Scotia. The war did little to resolve the territorial ambitions of the British and the French, or the status of the Native Americans in the Northeast and eastern Canada.
Province Fort was used mainly as a refuge for the settlers, Mosher said. Records indicate it was a square that was roughly 50 feet by 50 feet, but it may have been larger, Mosher said, and was surrounded by a palisade of posts with a gate. Colonists would rush to the safety of the fort in case of attack. A block house was constructed inside the fort walls, he said, and archaeologists are trying to determine if there were other structures as well, which would indicate that large numbers of settlers might have spent significant time inside the fort.
After hostilities eased, Mosher said, the fort became the center of town, getting used for meetings, and a church and the minister’s house were located nearby. The fort was eventually sold in 1782 and the new owner deconstructed it and used the timbers for other purposes.
That leaves Mosher and his team with clues, but not many concrete facts, to go on, he said.
“It becomes really complicated,” he said. “But it’s a fun puzzle. Every day we tend to generate more questions than answers.”
Mosher said a lot of the work involves taking pictures of the site that can be analyzed later. The artifacts collected, he said, also will be analyzed and catalogued over the winter.
They had to be sorted carefully, he said, because residents apparently dumped a fair amount of rubbish on the site and archaeologists found items from as recent as the 1920s.
Archaeologists knew for years that the fort was somewhere in the area, Mosher said, but weren’t able to confirm it until three years ago, when they dug test holes alongside River Road and found signs of the structure. The road project is getting some federal funds, he said, and rules require the state to take steps to preserve or allow exploration of archaeological and architecturally significant sites when federal money is involved.
Susan Simonson, president of the Windham Historical Society, said town members had heard rumors that there was a fort in the area and she is gratified that the Historic Preservation Commission’s work proves its existence and provides more details about the fort. However, she also said it’s “disheartening” to know that, in the end, the fort’s remains will be removed and the site covered over.
“It would be really nice to preserve it,” she said.

Texto completo: A 17-year-old from North Waterboro was lucky to escape alive from a fiery crash after he apparently fled from a traffic stop on Tuesday night in Waterboro.

What started as an attempted traffic stop on a rural road in Waterboro on Tuesday night could have ended in tragedy if a York County Sheriff’s deputy hadn’t rescued the speeding driver from a fiery wreck.
York County Sheriff’s Deputy Kevin Collins had just turned from Victoria Lane onto the winding, two-lane pavement of New Dam Road about 9:15 p.m. Tuesday when he saw a pair of headlights come whizzing around a curve toward him.
The deputy switched on his cruiser’s radar, which clocked the oncoming driver at 65 mph, exactly 30 mph over the posted speed limit, the threshold for a misdemeanor charge of criminal speeding.
“I turned my blue lights on before he even went by me,” said Collins, 41, of Waterboro. “Sometimes it works and they pull right over.”
This wasn’t one of those times.
Instead, Collins said he heard the thrum of exhaust as the oncoming 2009 Chevrolet Silverado seemed to accelerate past him. Collins executed a three-point turn on the narrow roadway, but as soon as he was pointed in right direction, the truck was gone around a curve.
“He’s outta sight,” Collins said. “I never saw him.”
Collins said he switched off his blue lights and drove in the direction the pickup had headed. The deputy made it about a half mile when he came upon a sharp, S-shaped curve in the road that breaks right and then left. Traffic was scattered onto the shoulders, and there was debris in the roadway.
The driver of the truck, 17-year-old Dylan Tardif, apparently lost control as he failed to negotiate the turn, crossed the center line and careened into the trees.
James Exley, 33, a neighbor who lives about 100 yards away, said he was lying in bed when he said he heard the truck’s motor, then screeching tires and the unmistakable crunch of twisting sheet metal.
A few feet off the shoulder and into the brush, the pickup lay mangled, a tree trunk standing in the passenger side of the engine bay. The windshield was shattered and the dashboard crumpled. A haze of smoke from the exploding airbags and steam from the radiator hung in the darkness around the wreck.
Collins stopped his cruiser and ran to the vehicle. Although he’s been a full-time police officer since 2014, Collins had been a firefighter since he was 16, and served 23 years in the Scarborough Fire Department before shifting to law enforcement, he said. He knew what to do.
Inside, Tardif was stretched awkwardly across the truck’s center console unconscious.
Collins looked him over and saw that Tardif’s left hand had a deep cut that was bleeding, and his right leg and foot had taken the brunt of the impact. The force of the crash had pushed the dashboard, firewall and center console toward Tardif. The area below the dash near the pedals was crushed, and with it, Tardif’s right foot, which was pinned in place. Tardif was wearing shorts, Collins said, and his right thigh bone was broken and exposed.
“I could see his right foot was kind of folded up under near the floorboard under the dashboard kind of pinned in there. So my initial instinct is he’s got some pretty severe injuries, I’m just going to stay with him, I’m not going to try to get him him out because I don’t want to cause further injury to him,” Collins said. “If he’s got a chance, I’m going to just kind of leave him there.”
“I could see his chest rising and falling so I knew he was breathing at least,” Collins said. He then reached toward Tardif and rubbed his sternum, a technique used to wake people after traumatic injuries. Tardif stirred, and began to groan in pain. He was confused, and didn’t know where he was, but Tardif knew his name.
Stay with me, Collins told him. The fire department is on its way, he said.
Then through a gap between where the windshield met the hood, Collins saw the orange glow. Flames.
“So my next thought was, I have to go get my fire extinguisher and put the fire out,” Collins said.
Exley, the neighbor, ran down to the scene and watched as Collins raced to his cruiser, retrieved the extinguisher and began to try to put out the fire. Exley said he heard Tardif from the vehicle crying out in pain
“He knew his vehicle was on fire,” Collins said. “He was screaming that he was burning. He was saying, ‘My truck’s on fire; I’m burning up.’”
With each blast of the extinguisher the flames died down, but Collins ran out of fire retardant, and the flames returned. Collins knew he had to get Tardif out.
“I told him that I was going to get him out of that truck, and he needs to bear with me, it’s going to hurt, but I need to get you out of the truck,” Collins said. “You can scream, you can do whatever you need to do, but I need to get you out of the truck now.”
Collins hooked his arms under Tardif’s armpits and pressed his chest to Tardif’s back. Collins pulled once and then again, but the teenager was stuck. So Collins reached under the dash and manipulated Tardif’s foot. The flames had advanced, and were inside the cabin on the headliner and approaching them, Collins said.
On the last tug, Tardif popped free. Collins said he dragged him 10 feet away.
“He was in excruciating pain,” Collins said. Tardif saw his injured leg and was panicking.
“I turned back around, and the entire truck was engulfed in flames.”
Collins and Tardif were on the ground when Deputy Fire Chief Lisa Bennett, who is also a paramedic, arrived on scene after responding from her home, Collins said. Tardif was in bad shape. She immediately asked Collins to call for LifeFlight.
As rescue workers prepared Tardif for transportation to Maine Medical Center, Collins noticed that the Waterboro fire engine arrived and it was short-staffed with only one man on the engine.
“The fire was still going,” Collins said. “The woods were on fire, the trees were catching on fire. (The Waterboro firefighter) had just pulled the line off the truck, so I grabbed the nozzle and he charged it so I started extinguishing the fire.”
The flames died down, and Tardif was whisked to Maine Medical Center, where he had surgery to address multiple bone fractures, Collins said.
Tardif’s condition was unknown Thursday. Maine Medical Center had no information on Tardif, and a man who answered the phone at Tardif’s residence said the teenager was “fine,” and asked for privacy for the family.
Collins said it is premature to determine whether police will file any charges in the case. Right now, Tardif and his family should focus on the boy’s recovery, Collins said.
“If things hadn’t unfolded the way that they had, say (Tardif) had taken another turn and I hadn’t found him, or if I never found him, it could have been a lot different,” Collins said. “He’s very lucky.”

Texto completo: Robert McEwen and Robert Neal tried to apprehend the bull before it attacked them, leaving the men with severe injuries.
Pair of men severely injured

MADISON — Two men were severely injured after a bull got loose from its pen on Friday afternoon, according to Mike Mitchell, chief deputy of the Somerset County Sheriff’s Office.
At approximately 12:56 p.m., officers were called to a farm on the Horsetail Road to find Ronald McEwen, 57, of Madison and his father-in-law, Robert Neal, 83, of Madison with severe injuries from trying to apprehend McEwen’s bull which had escaped its enclosure. According to Mitchell, Neal received severe injuries to his arm and leg and McEwen to his face and leg.
After the men were attacked, McEwen retrieved a rifle from his residence and was able to “dispatch the bull” before it caused further harm.
Neal was transported by Life Flight to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and McEwen by Anson-Madison Ambulance Service to Redington-Fairview General Hospital in Skowhegan for treatment of injuries that were not considered life threatening.
Mitchell said that the risk to public safety would have been significant if the bull had continued to roam at large outside his enclosed pasture.

Texto completo: I like to keep things simple when it feels overly complicated.
We know that South Portland is home to a number of bulk oil storage facilities and tank farms. Environmental engineer David Falatko has told Protect South Portland that they collectively emit 633 tons a year of volatile organic compounds, 104 tons of which are hazardous air pollutants. That is an awful lot of toxins for the schools, the day cares and the people living near the tanks to be coping with.
We already have Chapter 16 of the city code, the nuisance ordinance, which prohibits air pollution, fining anyone or any company found to be in violation.
As a city we need to stand together and protect each other. We can't leave a section of our population unprotected, struggling with constant headaches, sore throats and breathing problems, when we and the companies know that vapor recovery units could be installed to clean the air 95 percent.
Nationally, Global Partners alone makes nearly $13 billion annually. Other companies have to clean their emissions, too.
We just have to apply our home rule and say enough is enough.

Safer options available to address insect issues
Like many of us, columnist Bill Nemitz continues under the spell of Big Chem solutions ("A homegrown moral dilemma: Kill the invaders or live and let live," Aug. 22), in that our first response to the infestation of unwanted insects has us running for a can of Raid.
From weed killers to air-freshening room spray, there's a seemingly harmless chemical solution for nearly any issue. Fortunately, though, one can use the internet to research potential safer alternatives, one of which may be to recognize the interconnectedness of all life, and just ... let ... be.
Our challenge, then, is to question, question, question what we've been conditioned to believe. And pssst: Did you know that a half-teaspoon of baking soda mixed with a tad of water makes a fully functioning underarm deodorant?

Suicide law offers choices to terminally ill patients
In reaction to the Aug. 22 letter "Mainers should block reckless assisted-suicide law," I would like to share a true story.
In the mid-1980s, a dear friend was diagnosed with AIDS. At the time there was no effective treatment and AIDS was a death sentence. My friend, understandably, suffered emotionally as well as physically.
At some point in the course of his disease he began stockpiling barbiturates and even asked a friend to help him with taking them if and when he decided that his quality of life was no longer bearable. As soon as he made this arrangement he noticeably relaxed, for the first time feeling he had some control over the turmoil his health had been thrown in for over a year.
The end of my friend's story came in 1987. Interestingly, he never took the drugs he had stockpiled nor asked his friend to assist in his suicide. Right to the end he knew he had the option to control his life and death but never felt the need to use it.
The empowerment given my friend by the option to say when enough was enough made for a much more bearable disease course. Shouldn't everyone be given that gift of empowerment?

As mayor, Thibodeau will work with all sides
As a grandmother and resident of Portland's North Deering neighborhood, I am voting for Spencer Thibodeau for mayor on Nov. 5.
I believe that in today's political climate, too much focus and energy have gone into surrounding ourselves with those who agree with us 100 percent. Unfortunately, that has found its way into City Hall.
Spencer Thibodeau will be a breath of fresh air as mayor. He is personable, cares about people and has proven over his four years on the City Council that he can work collaboratively to get things done. We cannot rely on promises. We need someone with the right experience and someone who has delivered real results for Portland.
Finally, the mayor is a member of the City Council, so let's elect someone with council experience who has the trust and confidence of his colleagues and city staff. Join me in voting for Spencer Thibodeau in November.

Implement ID system wherever guns are sold
Re: "Bill Nemitz: The good news: A mass shooting didn't happen in Maine last week" (Aug. 25):
In Massachusetts, I was a member of the Danvers Fish and Game Club. I was about 15 years old.
After attending training on gun handling and safety, and after a test, we were issued a firearms identification card.
Before being issued that card, we were background checked by some "powers that be."
After taking the test and getting the firearms identification card, we were allowed to go out on the range and fire the .22 bolt-action rifle at a target 50 feet away.
My question is: Why isn't something like that implemented wherever they are selling guns? The person would be required to present his or her firearms identification card before buying any type of gun. And I believe that "the powers that be" are smart enough to figure out how to do it in terms of private sales.
I believe that this would eliminate a lot of problems.

Island's bid to secede from Portland falls short The city clerk says a Great Diamond committee's petition needed just 3 additional signatures to begin the process.

Texto completo: An effort by residents of a Casco Bay island to secede from Maine's largest city appears to have failed.
Residents of Great Diamond Island fell three signatures short of kick-starting the secession effort, the Portland City Clerk's Office said.
"This isn't going to stop the process," said Matt Hoffner, co-chair of the Great Diamond Island Exploratory Committee, which spearheaded the secession effort.
City Clerk Katherine Jones said in a letter to the petitioners Thursday that they needed 50 valid signatures, or a majority of the 98 registered voters on the island. However, the city staff could only verify 48 names on the 50-person petition.
"Therefore, the petition is deemed insufficient," Jones wrote.
Hoffner said his group has asked the city to confirm the registration status of all 98 people on the city database. He wants to make sure that figure does not include people who have moved off the island years ago or passed away. And he wants to make sure the city is only counting Great Diamond Island residents, since the city's database lumps all of the islands together.
"These are the verification issues that he we would like to make sure are properly vetted," Hoffner said Friday. "I believe something has fallen through the cracks."
The petitioners originally estimated there to be only 75 registered voters on the island, but Jones said Friday that city records show 98 registered voters. She said one person on the petition was not registered to vote and another person was listed twice.
Hoffner said his group will make another effort to get 50 signatures if the city confirms that the island has 98 registered voters.
Under state law, the petition would have required island residents and city officials to meet in an effort to resolve differences before a vote on secession could be held. Even then, the Maine Legislature would have the final say before secession could occur.
Islanders said that they were pursuing secession because they do not feel they are getting the requisite amount of city services in exchange for the $2 million they contribute in property taxes annually.
"The feeling among residents is that this is more than just a money issue, it truly is a cultural difference between the needs and priorities of a large city and the needs and priorities of a small island community," Hoffner said in an Aug. 15 statement.
The Exploratory Committee, formed in late 2018, identified 12 issues that islanders are concerned about, ranging from the lack of parking and short-term docking space in Portland to road maintenance on the island, the need for full-time EMTs during the summer months, the lack of representation in Portland, and the level of taxation imposed by the city.
Hoffner said that there are more than 300 summer or seasonal residents living on Great Diamond Island, and roughly 65 year-round residents. There are two distinct island communities, located at each end of the island. Diamond Cove is a private, residential community and the Village side of the island is public.
"GDI is a unique community of year-round, but mostly summer, residents who require very little from a city in terms of municipal services," the Exploratory Committee said. "The needs of urban neighborhoods in Portland, compared to our small summer community are divergent and uneven. As time has progressed, the disparity has increased."
Great Diamond Island is the second island to try - and fail - to secede from Portland in the last decade.
Peaks Island residents have tried to break away from Portland on several occasions. Their most recent secession effort was rejected by the Legislature in 2011.
Other island communities have been successful in their secession bids.
Long Island officially seceded from Portland on July 1, 1993, becoming Maine's 490th town.
And in 2007, Chebeague Island seceded from the town of Cumberland.
Great Diamond Island's effort is the second unsuccessful petition effort during this election cycle.
Fair Election Portland fell 76 signatures short of the number it needed to ask residents to expand ranked-choice voting to all City Council and Board of Education races. But the group is asking the City Council to place the question on the March ballot.
Ranked-choice voting has been used in Portland's mayoral elections since 2011.
In a ranked-choice election, voters rank the candidates in order of preference. If no one wins a majority after the first tally, election officials eliminate the last-place finisher and redistribute that candidate's votes based on each voter's second-choice ranking. This process continues - with non-viable candidates being eliminated from the bottom up and their votes reallocated - until someone hits the magic threshold of 50 percent plus one vote.
Fair Elections Portland, however, was successful in securing enough signatures to ask voters this fall if they would like establish a clean elections program that would limit private fundraising for candidates that opt to use public money for political campaigns.
The proposal could establish a program similar to one used by state legislative and gubernatorial candidates, who have to collect a certain amount of small donations before qualifying for public funding for their campaigns.
The referendum does not include details, including the amount of financing that should be made available to candidates in district or at-large races. Those details would be left up to the City Council, which would have to have a program up and running by 2021.

NEWCASTLE — The Frances Perkins Center has announced a “Last Dollar” Challenge to secure the purchase of the Frances Perkins Homestead. At the center’s 11th annual Garden Party on Aug. 18, board chairwoman Sarah Peskin announced that when the Frances Perkins Homestead Campaign: Seeking the Public Good receives $235,000 in additional gifts and pledges, she and her husband William Kelley will contribute the final $100,000 needed for the center to purchase this National Historic Landmark and conservation land, ensuring public access for generations to come, according to a news release from the center.
In her announcement, she appealed, “Please join our “Last Dollar” pledge and help us to get this place removed from the “Maine’s Most Endangered Places” list!”
The “Last Dollar” gift deadline is Dec. 31. Meeting this challenge will enable the Frances Perkins Center to exercise a $1.6 million option agreement in time to purchase the 1837 Brick House, connected ells and barn, and 57 acres of Perkins family land that borders the Damariscotta River. Every dollar matters.
All new campaign gifts and pledges will move the Frances Perkins Center closer to meeting this “Last Gift” Challenge, completing Phase 1 (acquisition of the homestead) of the Perkins Center’s overall $5.5 million Homestead Capital Campaign initiative to preserve, renovate, and endow this nationally significant property in perpetuity, and use this facility to expand programming, according to the release.
In 2018, noting the potential sale of the Frances Perkins Homestead, Maine Preservation designated the homestead property as one of Maine’s most endangered historic places. Maine Preservation executive director Greg Paxton recently said, “The principal structures of the homestead, stewarded by the family, have survived nobly over 180 years, and now is the ideal time for the next chapter for this property… The center has demonstrated that it is an institution that has the ability, outreach and capacity to carry out this ambitious program. And like Margaret Chase Smith, Edmund Muskie and other distinguished Mainers, Frances Perkins is a nationally prominent figure that all of us should be proud of and seek to honor. With her national following, it is most fitting that she be honored here in Maine,” according to the release.
Located in Newcastle, the Frances Perkins Homestead, settled by the Perkins family in the mid-18th century, is a saltwater farm on the tidal Damariscotta River. Its 1837 brick house and connected barns sit on 57 acres within a protected landscape of fields and forest bounded by 2.8 miles of picturesque stone walls. The property contains Frances Perkins memorabilia, earlier homestead foundations, and remnants of the family’s brickworks, allowing the center to teach how this place shaped Perkins as someone dedicated to improving the lives of all Americans.
Sarah Peskin and William Kelley encourage readers to join them and be part of Frances Perkins’ legacy, adding, “Together, we can advance the principles of Frances Perkins, preserve the Frances Perkins Homestead, inspire learning among students, scholars, and people of all ages, and continue to engage civic leaders in nonpartisan dialogue through programs of learning and civil discourse to address 21st century economic and social issues,” according to the release.
Perkins was the first woman to serve in a U.S. Cabinet position. She was the Secretary of Labor under Franklin Delano Roosevelt and a driving force behind the New Deal. The Frances Perkins Center, founded in 2008, honors the legacy of Perkins by sharing her commitment to the principle that government should provide all its people with the best possible life, and by preserving the place that shaped her character.
The center convenes leaders and future leaders in public policy, labor and related fields to generate creative solutions to today’s social and economic problems and teaches students of all ages about a remarkable woman whose work continues to improve the lives of ordinary Americans.

Texto completo: Like many parents, Ashley Livingston is worried about making sure her children are ready for school. Unlike most parents, however, she and her family are homeless and living in a tent.
Livingston said her family was kicked out of the Portland Expo in early August and barred from the city's family shelter - she says unjustly - for not following the shelter's rules.
For now, Livingston, her husband, David Pippin, and their two youngest children are living in a tent in various spots, including behind the tennis courts in Deering Oaks park. They eat at the Preble Street Resource Center soup kitchen, wander Portland during the day and try to be discrete about where they pitch their tent at night.
"This is the absolute last option," said Livingston, who has been working with social workers at the Opportunity Alliance to try to find housing.
"I can't remember the last time I cooked for the kids," she said Friday, tearing up. "I just want to bathe them, get them ready for school, have new shoes and some new outfits for school, just like normal families. Is that so bad? Are my kids undeserving?"
City officials were either unable or unavailable to comment on Livingston's situation Friday.
Maine is experiencing a surge in homeless school-aged students, with more than 2,500 homeless students in the 2016-17 school year, according to the most recent data available from the National Center for Homeless Education. That is up from about 1,900 homeless students in 2014-15.
Livingston said her family was kicked out of the Portland Family Shelter for not following rules that she says are arbitrary and unclear. She said they may have been forced out for not following spending rules for clients staying at the shelter that are designed to get families to save money for housing.
Livingston doesn't have documentation explaining why she was kicked out, but she believes it was because she broke the spending rules when she paid for school supplies for her four children. The two older children - an 11-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy - are temporarily staying with relatives or friends, while the two youngest - David, a 5-year-old entering kindergarten and Harry, his 3-year-old brother - are staying in the tent.
She showed the Press Herald receipts showing that she spent about $300 on shoes, outfits and school supplies for her children. Livingston said her children had holes in their shoes. She also spent money for several weeks early this year when the family was living out of hotel rooms.
Livingston's mother, Wendy Livingston of South Portland, said her daughter needs help, and that she has trouble managing her money. Wendy Livingston said her daughter spends money on items that could be put off until later, when she should be saving for rent.
"She carelessly spends her money because it feels good in the moment," said Wendy Livingston, who currently resides at the Barron Center. She is recovering from injuries she sustained when she was hit by a car in South Portland and has no place for her daughter's family to stay. "She is not well and she does need help."
Wendy Livingston said her daughter also has long-standing mental health problems, and that she needs to attend more consistent therapy sessions. Ashley Livingston, who dropped out of South Portland High School in 10th grade, acknowledged that she suffers from mental illness.
Jeff Tardif, program manager for the city's family shelter, said he was not available for an interview Friday afternoon. He said in an email that all media interviews have to be coordinated by communications director Jessica Grondin, who was not available Friday.
Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling said that he doesn't know about the family's specific situation, but that the shelter has rules that allow the shelter to evict families that are disruptive.
Ashley Livingston said she has had several disputes with Tardif over rules at the shelter, and that they don't get along.
Portland City Manager Jon Jennings couldn't be reached for comment late Friday afternoon.
Ashley Livingston is originally from South Portland and has lived there off and on for many years, so her children attended South Portland schools last school year and she hopes they can attend there this year. Homeless families are permitted to have their children attend schools where they have traditionally been located, to provide some stability in the children's lives.
Livingston, 33, said "they had no right to kick us out of" the Portland Expo and bar them from the family shelter and the overflow shelter at the Salvation Army.
"It's just so frustrating," Livingston said. She said they had been living at the family shelter or the shelter's overflow space, and also were one of the few families from Greater Portland who were housed at the Portland Expo with asylum seekers this summer.
"Why is it so hard on me and my family?" Livingston asked. "My kids don't understand why no one is helping us."
Livingston said she receives about $930 per month from federal disability payments related to her children's disabilities, but has been unable to save enough to find housing.
She used to have Section 8 housing vouchers, but those expired, and she can't remember why. She also said that she's a diabetic and that her health has deteriorated from eating an unhealthy diet living on the streets.
She said she is on a waiting list to get into South Portland public housing. She and her husband have worked various jobs, including fast food restaurants and housekeeping, but are currently unemployed.
"We've been through the wringer," Livingston said.

Texto completo: Mt. Blue's Cullenberg takes girls title, Mt. Ararat rolls to team victory.
AUGUSTA — Will Shaughnessy ran alone towards the finish line at the Scot Laliberte Invitational, crossed it, and asked over his shoulder what his time was.
He certainly had nothing else to worry about.
Brunswick’s Shaughnessy won the Laliberte Invitational and set the record at the 2.4-mile course in the process, coming in at 13:01.25 to break Luke Laverdiere’s mark by 17 seconds and beat the rest of the field to the finish by more than 50 seconds.
“My expectation coming in was to win, and I accomplished that goal,” said Shaughnessy, who finished ahead of Grady Satterfield, Jace Hollenbach, Lucas Bergeron and Nate Cohen, all from Mt. Ararat. “That’s super satisfying. It’s a good indicator of my fitness right now.”
Mt. Blue’s Kahryn Cullenberg was the highest-finishing girl, coming in at 16:38.61. She was 36 seconds ahead of Edward Little freshman Payton Bell, while Caribou’s Kayley Bell, Mt. Blue’s Emma Charles and Mt. Ararat’s Camila Ciembroniewicz rounded out the top five.
“It’s definitely surreal. This is a race I’ve been coming to my whole life, pretty much, having siblings older than me,” said Cullenberg, who was third last season. “To finally have it be my senior year and accomplish winning the race is a goal I can check off.”
The event has the boys and girls run together, and as such combines both scores into an overall total. Spurred by its dominance of the boys race — even with state champion Lisandro Berry-Gaviria sitting out the race — Mt. Ararat won the title with 543 points, while Brunswick (615), Cony (700), Mt. Blue (728) and Caribou (752) made up the top five.
Shaughnessy, who finished second to Berry-Gaviria last year, knew the race was his to lose with the Eagles’ star runner out after a college visit that ended just before the event.
“I never like to say anyone’s unbeatable,” Shaughnessy said, “but he is about the closest thing to it in terms of the state of Maine.”
The Brunswick senior cruised by the competition, using the course’s daunting hill just under a mile in to make his move on the field.
“Nobody really was going, so I kind of just went,” he said. “I didn’t feel like I was going that fast. I thought it was reasonable.”
He looked no worse for the year when he crossed the line after the 2.4 miles.
“I definitely felt like I had a lot left,” Shaughnessy said. “I wasn’t shooting for time today, I kind of just wanted to get the win. I felt like I could have given it a bit more.”
After Shaughnessy came a line of Eagles. Satterfield, who was third last year, finished next at 13:51.73, and teammates Hollenbach (14:05.49), Bergeron (14:07.39) and Cohen (14:11.57) followed.
Satterfield said the presence of so many teammates near the top fueled the runners to their finishes.
“We have a new runner (in) Jace, so that’s a big deal, and we pretty much returned most of our varsity top seven,” he said. “The team aspect can really push you as an individual. Your team is relying on you. So it really pushes you to become a better athlete.
“It’s competitive in the team, but we use each other to excel. So we’re not trying to beat each other, we’re trying to win as a team.”
Cullenberg found the key to her finish in the first 200 meters. Mt. Blue runners were lined up on the far right side of the starting line and Cony’s course narrows to the left, so Cullenberg knew that when the pack first got to the bottleneck, she had to be in front with the hardest-charging boys.
“The boys tend to have more aggressive starts than the girls,” she said. “It’s really crucial to have an aggressive start and be able to get your spot before everyone else boxes you in. I definitely tried to go out hard for this race, and try to maintain the spot.”
The plan worked perfectly.
“It’s definitely encouraging,” she said. “Hopefully I’ll be able to keep with it.”
The next girl across the line was Payton Bell, who won all but one race in middle school. The freshman wasn’t sure if her dominance would transfer to the varsity level. Seventeen minutes and 14 seconds later, she had her answer.
“I definitely couldn’t have gone faster,” she said. “I was expecting to get top 10, maybe. I didn’t really know anything else. … I just kept counting every person I passed, hoping I would get pretty far up. The more people I passed, the faster I tried to go. That was what I kept thinking about.”

Wilton’s Forster Mill is no more

Texto completo: Demolition of Forster Mill has been completed. Once final sign-off from Maine Department of Environmental Protection and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is issued, town officials will consider future use of the site.

WILTON — Four-and-a-half years after foreclosing on the property, the walls of Wilton’s Forster Mill have finally come down. EnviroVantage, of Epping, New Hampshire, started the long process in March of 2018 and finished its work last Friday. Last year’s efforts focused on asbestos abatement and removal of salvageable materials. In June the second phase of the project began to completely raze the remaining structures.
Final approval to close out the project is still pending from both Maine Department of Environmental Protection and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Presence of asbestos and hazardous solvents and substances required oversight from the government agencies. Once the town has filed its final environmental reports, Wilton officials will assess the site for future use.
The most recent work done by EnviroVantage is projected to cost about $384,000, with current charges from Ransom consulting, the engineering services company overseeing the demolition, at about $11,500. The town received a combined $500,000 in grants and interest-free loans from ME DEP through the EPA Brownfields Project, and from Androscoggin Valley Council of Governments.
Town manager Rhonda Irish has already made recommendations to the Board of Selectpersons about things that should be done before winter, such as filling in low spots and adding additional security fencing. Concrete piers that supported the building over Wilson Stream will remain.
“While these columns are showing signs of deterioration, we opted to leave them as is,” explained Jamie Madore of Ransom Consulting last Friday. “Each one has footings below ground in the stream that are essentially established habitat. At this point we want to cause as little disruption to the waterway as possible. Removal of the concrete would require stream restoration, a completely different type of project with its own set of permitting requirements.”
The Select Board will have a land use consulting firm sort out the next steps, including how much buildable space is left on the site for a developer to work with. The property is 17.65 acres, split by Wilson Stream. The portion of the site where Forster Mill was located is about 5.33 acres.
“Since more than 50% of the property value no longer exists any development will fall under current codes as new construction. That means no building can be located within 75 feet of the stream,” said Codes Enforcement Officer Charlie Lavin. The contours of the stream and Depot Road limit how much of the lot can be considered buildable.
The demolition of Forster Mill brings an end to a historic town landmark, where generations of Wilton residents worked, going back to 1901. For several years it was the Wilton Woolen Mill, adapting ownership and production several times over the years according to consumer and even World War II demand. Between 1960-1985 operations shifted to wood products made by Forster Manufacturing Company, like croquet sets and snap clothespins. After Forster Manufacturing closed out its Maine-based operations, Jarden Plastic Solutions moved in, producing plastic cutlery until it opened a new facility in town in 2003. Since then the property sat dormant until its last owner Adam Mack attempted to dismantle the mill in 2012. A fire and subsequent discovery of hazardous materials that were not properly handled shut down his effort. By 2015 Wilton officials took steps to foreclose on the property.
“Once the site is surveyed for use the town can come up with a final plan,” said Irish. “We may decide to sell it for development. It’s in the village zone so a buyer will have options, within the buildable footprint. Many residents have indicated they’d like to see it become a park. There is still a lot of work for us to do.”

Texto completo: JEFFERSON -- A new steel-frame sawmill is almost complete at N.C. Hunt Lumber, signaling the return of more than a dozen jobs to Jefferson after a fire forced layoffs.
Earlier this week, workers were welding parts of the sawmill and placing steel panels on the roof. The steel frame doesn't have any walls yet, but N.C. Hunt President Rob Hunt - son of owner Norman Clark Hunt - said portions of the mill should be turned on in a matter of weeks to be calibrated. He said the whole sawmill should be running at full power in December.
The former wooden sawmill burned down in March and, in April, Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said the fire was accidental. The fire was caused by sparks from a torch used while making repairs to machinery. No one was injured in the blaze.
Rob Hunt said the company had to lay off 17 people after the fire, but kept 15 on to help build the mill. Some of the workers building the mill will operate it once construction is finished, he said, and the rest of the laid-off workers will return later.
"The goal is to bring them all back by this winter once we get the machines up and running," Hunt said. "Hopefully, we can grow. We're super excited about that."
He said employees were anxious the day after the fire, but were quick to move on to the rebuild.
"Everyone was pretty nervous that day," Hunt said. "Within four weeks, we got the guts of the plan ... and they started building it."
"We jumped on it quick," he said. "Take one step - if you thought about all 500 you'd get discouraged."
Crews are reusing some parts of the old mill - sections of foundations and components from old machinery - and combining them with new, state-of-the-art components to construct the facility. Hunt compared the sawmill's controls to those used to play video games, saying they are more intuitive for employees. He said if he contracted the job, it would cost about $3 million.
"We've used some assets we had here," he said, and the company is using its own construction crew. "We're doing it for quite a chunk less (than $3 million)."
Hunt said the new mill will help the company add more types of high-end wood to its inventory, which he said is shipped as far away as New York City and North Carolina. He said the sawmill was also engineered to be safer and more efficient.
The company used stored sawmill product to sustain some clients while the facility was rebuilt, but Dave Smith, N.C. Hunt Lumber's retail general manager, said some product had to be purchased from competitors to keep up with demand.
That was tough on the company's bottom line, Hunt said, because it increases already-high transportation costs for products that would otherwise be produced in N.C. Hunt's own lumber yard.
"It makes a huge difference for us ... and we're able to be very competitive," he said.
Despite having to contact competitors for product, Smith and Hunt said other lumber yards have offered them reasonable prices.
"The other mills have been good to us," Smith said. "The Maine lumber community came together (to help N.C. Hunt)."
"We've just had a tremendous amount of support, whether it be vendors, customers, loggers (or) employees," Hunt said. "Without all the support we've had from the community, state and town, we wouldn't have come close to what we're doing."

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Will Shaughnessy of Brunswick ran alone toward the finish line at the Scot Laliberte Invitational, crossed it, then asked over his shoulder what his time was Friday.
He certainly had nothing else to worry about.
Shaughnessy won the Laliberte Invitational and set the record at the 2.4-mile course, coming in at 13 minutes, 1.25 seconds to break Luke Laverdiere's mark by 17 seconds and beat the rest of the field by more than 50 seconds.
"My expectation coming in was to win and I accomplished that goal," said Shaughnessy, who finished ahead of Grady Satterfield, Jace Hollenbach, Lucas Bergeron and Nate Cohen, all from Mt. Ararat. "That's super satisfying. It's a good indicator of my fitness."
Kahryn Cullenberg of Mt. Blue was the highest-finishing girl, coming in at 16:38.61. She was 36 seconds ahead of Edward Little freshman Payton Bell. Kayley Bell of Caribou, Emma Charles of Mt. Blue and Camila Ciembroniewicz of Mt. Ararat followed.
"It's definitely surreal. This is a race I've been coming to my whole life, pretty much, having siblings older than me," said Cullenberg, who was third last season. "To finally have it be my senior year and accomplish winning the race is a goal I can check off."
The event has boys and girls run together, and combines both scores into an overall total. Spurred by its dominance of the boys' race - even with state champion Lisandro Berry-Gaviria sitting out the race - Mt. Ararat won the title with 543 points, while Brunswick (615), Cony (700), Mt. Blue (728) and Caribou (752) made up the top five.
Shaughnessy, a senior who finished second to Berry-Gaviria last year, knew the race was his to lose with Berry-Gaviria making a college visit.
"I never like to say anyone's unbeatable," Shaughnessy said, "but he is about the closest thing to it in terms of the state of Maine."
Shaughnessy cruised by the competition, using the course's daunting hill just under a mile in to take over.
"Nobody really was going so I kind of just went," he said. "I didn't feel like I was going that fast. I thought it was reasonable."
He looked fine at the finish.
"I definitely felt like I had a lot left," Shaughnessy said. "I wasn't shooting for time today, I kind of just wanted to get the win. I felt like I could have given it a bit more."
Cullenberg found the key to her finish in the first 200 meters. Mt. Blue runners were lined up on the far right side so Cullenberg knew when the pack first got to the bottleneck, she had to be in front.
"The boys tend to have more aggressive starts than the girls," she said. "It's really crucial to have an aggressive start and be able to get your spot before everyone else boxes you in. I definitely tried to go out hard for this race and try to maintain the spot."

Texto completo: A pond in South Portland's Hinckley Park has tested positive for a type of algae that produces toxins that can be fatal for dogs.
The South Portland Parks and Recreation Department posted warning signs Friday based on testing results that showed a blue-green algae bloom could possibly produce the same toxins that have killed pets in other states this summer.
"We are asking that people please keep your dogs away from the shorelines. Don't let them drink the water, swim or go near the algae that is accumulating on the shorelines," the department wrote in an initial Facebook post Thursday evening.
Along with posting signs around the pond Friday morning to warn dog owners to keep their dogs away from the water, the city posted a new message on Facebook urging park visitors to pick up after their dogs because the feces left around the pond contributes to the algae problem.
"The signs have been posted at Hinckley Park, near main entrances and along the water's edge. We will be sure to post again when we have new information about changes in water conditions," the post says.
"We would also like to take this time to point out that one cause of this bloom is from an excess of pet waste that is left behind in our park. We need park visitors to pick up ALL pet waste and dispose of it in proper receptacles. Failure to comply with our parks rules and regulations could result in an unfavorable change to those rules and regulations."
Blue-green algae growth, known as cyanobacteria, is made up of microscopic organisms that naturally occur in streams and lakes. Much of it is harmless, but it can produce toxic chemicals that cause sickness in people and can be fatal to dogs.
Scott Williams, executive director of Lake Stewards of Maine, a volunteer lake monitoring program, said blue-green algae has been found in what he called "moderately high" levels in a handful of lakes out of thousands across the state.
"It's not unusual to find some cyanobacteria, even in the clearest lakes," he said. "Algae is a normal component - it's the base of the food chain - but it's really only a problem when the concentration rises."
Williams said the two things that contribute to higher levels of blue-green algae are temperature and phosphorus levels, both of which are tied to climate change. Higher temperatures warm bodies of water and soil erosion creates runoff that contains phosphorus.
Williams said he wasn't aware of the algae bloom in South Portland - his organization doesn't track that water body because it's not a swimming spot - but said public ponds are more likely to be susceptible to water quality issues.
A good rule of thumb for people, Williams said, is to never drink untreated water. As for whether lakes are safe to swim in, he said if you can wade out to your shoulders and look down in the water and still see your feet, the water is almost certainly safe.
"We're fortunate that this isn't a major concern here in Maine," he said. "But it's something to be aware of."
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection lists lakes at risk of algal blooms on its website, but that list does not note if any of those blooms are ongoing. The Lake Stewards of Maine also share its water quality data online.
At least four dogs have died this summer in North Carolina and Georgia after swimming in water contaminated with blue-green algae, The Associated Press reported.
Blooms of blue-green algae have been documented in all 50 states, David G. Schmale III, a professor at Virginia Tech, told CNN.
Dave Maker was glad to see warning signs posted at Hinckley Park when he stopped by Friday afternoon with his pitbull, Debris. While Maker lives in Alfred, he visits Hinckley Park weekly because he has friends in South Portland.
"I love this park," Maker said. "I'm glad they put up signs. My dog is my life. I wouldn't let her swim in something toxic."

Texto completo: Harvest Bucks is a nutrition incentive program that provides extra fruit and vegetables to folks who shop with an EBT/SNAP card at farmers markets.
SOMERVILLE — The Farmers Market at Pumpkin Vine Family Farm at 217 Hewett Road will launch its Maine Harvest Bucks program on Sunday, just in time for the fall harvest season. Shoppers can fill their market basket for less by using their EBT/ SNAP card to purchase any of of the fresh, local food at the market (meat, cheese, eggs, bread), then receive a dollar for dollar match in Maine Harvest Bucks, that can be used to buy fresh fruits and vegetables, according to a news release from the family farm.
Halfway between the capital and the coast, the market is located on a working historic farm and aims to serve country folks where they live. The market was built by and for the community, in the belief that everyone should enjoy fresh local food. Locally grown food, tended by hand, often costs more than the food at grocery stores and can be hard to fit into a tight budget. But the farmers at the Pumpkin Vine Market want to make sure all can enjoy their food no matter their budget. Not only will every SNAP dollar be matched with Harvest Bucks, but first time SNAP shoppers will get an extra bonus $10 in Harvest Bucks on their first purchase.
According to the release, Maine Harvest Bucks is funded by the USDA through a FINI (Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Program) and implemented in Maine by the Maine Federation of Farmers Markets. The farmers market at Pumpkin Vine Family Farm is proud to join the effort to provide healthy food for all. The market is open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. every Sunday from May through December.

Texto completo: A $5.1 million legal settlement won by Maine against German automaker Volkswagen Group and its affiliates is being used to fund a new statewide rebate program for buyers of hybrid and electric vehicles.
The program, announced Friday by Gov. Janet Mills, will provide rebates of $1,000 to $2,000 on qualifying plug-in hybrid and battery-powered electric vehicles, with higher rebates being offered to low-income households and government entities, including tribal governments. The initiative is called the EV Accelerator Program and is being administered by the quasi-state agency Efficiency Maine Trust.
According to the Natural Resources Council of Maine, the new rebate can be combined with federal incentives to provide a total of up to $9,500 off the price of a plug-in vehicle in Maine. It said states offering financial incentives have experienced 15 to 25 percent higher sales of plug-in vehicles compared with the national average.
"Cars and trucks are the largest source of climate change pollution in Maine and contribute to unhealthy air conditions across our state," the council's clean energy director, Dylan Voorhees, said in a statement. "The new rebate announced today will help prompt more Mainers to save money and reduce pollution by choosing to drive electric."
In 2017, then-Attorney General Mills won the settlement after taking legal action against Volkswagen and its affiliates Audi and Porsche for violating state environmental laws and emissions through their marketing and sales of light vehicles in Maine. The state also received an additional $21 million settlement as part of a federal lawsuit against Volkswagen over the company's diesel engines that illegally produced high levels of greenhouse gases.
Mills announced in March that Maine would put the $5.1 million settlement toward subsidies to encourage residents and companies to buy electric vehicles. She said the state also would add at least 50 public vehicle charging stations as part of the initiative. Funds from the other settlement have been earmarked for other energy-efficiency and emissions-reduction programs.
Mills said in a statement Friday that the rebate program's goal is to displace the use of inefficient internal combustion engines in Maine with the increased use of high-efficiency electric vehicles in order to reduce harmful emissions including nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide.
"Maine people shell out $5 billion a year to out-of-state fossil fuel companies, and a lot of that money is spent on gas for vehicles that just becomes carbon dioxide pumped into our atmosphere," Mills said. "We can do better. It is time to usher in the next generation of technologies that will move our state towards a renewable future."
The EV Accelerator program is offering instant rebates to Maine residents at the point of purchase through participating automobile dealerships, the statement said.
"Maine's new car dealers welcome the EV rebate program as an assist to their customers looking at this new and exciting technology," Tom Brown, president of the Maine Automobile Dealers Association, said in the statement. "Rebate-eligible vehicles are currently available, and many more will be coming as manufacturers expand their EV production."
Program details and lists of eligible vehicles and participating dealerships are available online at efficiencymaine.com/EV.

Texto completo: BAR HARBOR -- The province of Nova Scotia is considering extending the ferry service season this year once international ferry service starts up between Bar Harbor and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, according to news reports.
The ferry season was originally planned to run from June 21 to Oct. 15. With work still being done on the terminal in Bar Harbor, the start date has been postponed indefinitely, but provincial officials are still hopeful that the ferry will run this season, according to Peter McLaughlin, a spokesman for the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal.
"Bay Ferries is working with the province to have the ferry service in operation as soon as possible," McLaughlin said. "We continue to work closely with our project consultants, contractors and U.S. Customs and Border Protection."
"Work is ongoing at the Bar Harbor terminal," McLaughlin said. "Marine facility work is complete, and we are focused on the land side."
Adding extra weeks to the regular season is one of the tactics that Lloyd Hines, the province's minister of transportation and infrastructure renewal, is considering "to save the sailing season" after multiple delays, the Global News reported.
Hines told Canadian reporters last month that the province was negotiating square footage requirements for the Bar Harbor ferry terminal with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
"(CBP) has taken the position that they want 100 percent compliance in the facility before they permit any activity in the facility," Hines said, according to the Global News.
The Star, a Halifax newspaper, reported last month that Hines went to Washington, D.C., to meet with CBP and "to push for expedited approval of the ferry terminal in Bar Harbor."
Also present at the meetings in Washington were former U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Wilkins, who has been hired by the province to work with CBP, Maine Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King, and 2nd District Rep. Jared Golden.
"We didn't nail down a definitive time, but we're certainly optimistic that we will have a partial season this year," Hines said.
According to The Star, Hines said the meetings were important "to put some faces" on the issue of the international ferry service.
Bay Ferries announced on June 7 that the start date would be delayed because the Bar Harbor terminal was not ready. "The earliest date on which any service could commence is mid-summer," a statement from the company said at the time.
Bay Ferries Chief Executive Officer Mark MacDonald told the Islander this week, "There is nothing new to report at this time." However, he said, "All parties are focused on getting the work approved and finished."
Last June, Bar Harbor voters authorized the purchase of the ferry terminal from the Maine Department of Transportation for $3.5 million. The town closed on the purchase of the property Jan. 31. Prior to that, in October, the Town Council approved the five-year lease agreement allowing Bay Ferries to operate from a portion of the ferry terminal.

Texto completo: The "Franklin County Sheriff's Office received a report in July from a state lab indicating white powder seized during the stop was 8.6 grams of fentanyl, according to the sheriff.

FARMINGTON — A Peru man was arrested recently on a Franklin County warrant charging him with selling fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.
The warrant was issued Aug. 23 and served on Eric Tidswell, 43, at the Androscoggin County Jail in Auburn where he is incarcerated, according to Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols Sr. He is charged with aggravated trafficking in drugs. A conviction carries a penalty of up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.
When Franklin County Deputy Andrew Morgan conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Tidswell in New Sharon in March, he was arrested on a charge of operating after suspension. During the arrest, the drug Suboxone and another white, powdery substance was found inside the vehicle along with drug scales and over $3,000, Nichols wrote in a news release. Tidswell was charged at the time with unlawful possession of a scheduled drug and violation of condition of release.
The white powder was sent to a state laboratory for analysis and a report came back in July that the substance was 8.6 grams of fentanyl, Nichols wrote.
Franklin County Detective Stephen Charles took over the case and conducted an in-depth investigation that spanned two states prior to the warrant being issued.
Once Tidswell finishes his time at the Auburn jail, he will be transferred to the Franklin County Detention Center to face charges.
Tidswell has been arrested a number of times this year on charges that included violation of bail and operating after suspension.
On April 6, Maine State Police Trooper Jason Wing arrested Tidswell after a 7-mile chase on Route 108 in Canton to Livermore with speeds that reached 114 mph, according to state police Lt. Kyle Tilsley.

Waterville plastic bag ban launches Sunday

Texto completo: Stores that are 10,000-square-feet in size or larger may no longer dispense plastic bags to customers at check-out, as required by the city of Waterville's plastic bag ordinance.

WATERVILLE — Starting Sunday, shoppers at large stores in the city will have to bring their own bags to tote their merchandise — or use paper bags if stores supply or sell them.
Sunday is the day the city’s plastic bag ban goes into effect, prohibiting stores that are 10,000-square-feet or larger from dispensing single-use plastic bags to customers at checkout. That would include stores such as Shaw’s, Hannaford, JC Penney and Walmart.
Earlier this year, the state Legislature passed a law banning the practice at all Maine businesses, and in June, Gov. Janet Mills signed the bill into law. The statewide ban will go into effect on Earth Day, April 22, 2020.
Toby Rose, general manager of Save-A-Lot on The Concourse in downtown Waterville, is prepared for Sunday’s launch.
“We will have paper bags for sale, but our clients are already used to bringing in their own bags,” Rose said Wednesday. “I do have clients that are buying bags in bulk right now to prepare for it.”
Rose said the store will continue to sell plastic bags to customers until Sunday, when the ban takes place. They are six cents each, he said.
Rose is on board with the city’s plastic bag ordinance.
“I definitely think it’s going to have a huge effect, so I’m really excited,” he said.
Hannaford, which has two stores in Waterville, at both Elm Plaza off Main Street and JFK Plaza off Kennedy Memorial Drive, also is ready.
Hannaford spokesman Eric Blom said the company has posted signs in the stores to inform people of the change. Hannaford has had a lot of experience with the plastic bag ban in other communities. Blom said paper bags will be available for sale in the stores for about five cents each, but there also is an environmental impact with paper bags in terms of manufacturing and trucking.
“We really hope that people will move toward reusable bags — that’s really the best environmental solution — but there are paper bags available,” Blom said.
Waterville residents in November approved the bag ban in a 3,052-2,906 vote.
The question on the ballot asked if voters wished to enact a proposed ordinance establishing a ban on providing free carryout plastic bags to a customer at the point of departure in any retail or commercial establishment with a retail or commercial space at or exceeding 10,000 square feet. The Sustain Mid-Maine Coalition helped to initiate the plastic bag ban.
Waterville resident Todd Martin, who also helped in the bag ban effort, said Wednesday that it will help reduce litter in city neighborhoods.
“When Waterville voters approved the ordinance to ban plastic bags at big box (stores) at the polls last November, Waterville became the 20th Maine town to take action to reduce plastic bag pollution,” Martin said. “Not only do they litter our community, they clog sorting equipment at ecomaine where Waterville sends its recycling. Reusable shopping bags are a cheap and easy solution.”
Martin notes that with the ban starting in Waterville, shoppers may bring any type of bag they want with them to stores to use at check-out, including reusable plastic or paper bags. The ban does not ban thin film plastic bags used by stores to bag meat, fruit, vegetables or bulk items. All Waterville restaurants are exempt from the plastic bag ban, Martin said.
The city ordinance was to have gone into effect this year on Earth Day, April 22, but Mayor Nick Isgro led an effort to collect signatures from residents to force the votes to be recounted. The bag issue eventually went to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court after a recount reversed the election results, defeating the controversial measure by seven votes. The court dismissed the case and the bag ban ultimately was upheld. The City Council this spring voted 6-0 to extend the plastic bag ban launch to Sept. 1 to allow time for a city board to hear the appeal.
The ordinance, posted on the city website, www.waterville-me.gov, says it is in the best interest of residents and visitors to reduce the cost of solid waste disposal and protect the environment and natural resources by discouraging use of plastic carryout bags and encourage use of reusable bags at large stores. The ordinance, titled “Ordinance Regulating Carryout Plastic Shopping Bags,” says large stores may sell or give away paper bags to customers for carrying items.
The city’s code enforcement officer is the enforcer of the ordinance and shall issue a warning to stores violating it, according to the document. Subsequent violations are subject to up to a $250 fine for the first violation in a one-year period and up to $500 for the second and each subsequent violation on a one-year period.
Waterville Code Enforcement Officer Dan Bradstreet said this week that in June, he sent notices to all the stores that must comply with the bag ban and he heard back from only one that had some questions about the criteria for reusable bags.
“I sent out 21 notices, so there are 21 stores affected,” Bradstreet said. “I’m not anticipating any issues.”
In an email Thursday, Shaw’s issued a statement about the bag ban, saying Shaw’s and Star Market care about the environment. Their stores, offices and distribution centers take part in many programs that promote recycling, cardboard baling, plastics recycling, zero-waste programs and more, the statement says.
“To reduce the use of plastic and paper bags, we continually encourage our customers to bring in reusable bags for their shopping orders. We also have available at our stores other shopping bag alternatives that further promote the use of reusable bags. In addition, we will continue to comply with all local ordinances regarding the use of plastic bags.”

Texto completo: A horse in York County tested positive for Eastern Equine Encephalitis and had to be euthanized, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday.
State health officials issued a warning this week about the rare mosquito- borne disease, which can be fatal. No human cases have been reported in Maine since 2015, but other Northeast states have experienced recent cases, including one death in Massachusetts.
Maine CDC officials said the horse was not vaccinated against the disease. This was the first known instance of a horse in Maine contracting EEE since 2013.
"EEE, which is carried by mosquitoes, is a fatal, viral disease in horses," state veterinarian Dr. Michele Walsh said in a statement. "The virus can affect human beings if they are bitten by mosquitoes that carry the virus. People cannot acquire EEE infection from sick animals, only from the bite of an infected mosquito."
Still, officials repeated the warning for residents to take precautions against mosquito bites.
"This positive result confirms that mosquitoes carrying the virus are present in Maine, which is the reason why Maine CDC urges the state's residents and visitors to take precautions to protect themselves and their animals from mosquito bites," Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav D. Shah said in the statement. "We want everyone to take precautions while enjoying themselves this holiday weekend."
Many states, although not Maine, also have seen positive results in humans and mosquitoes for West Nile virus, which causes symptoms similar to EEE.
State officials also informed animal owners that a vaccine for EEE and West Nile virus is available for horses, and they encouraged those that have not been vaccinated in the last six months to get the initial shot or a booster. Officials also warned that the virus can affect specialty livestock, like llamas, alpacas, emus, ostriches and other farm-raised birds, such as pheasants, quail and ducks. They advised owners to contact their veterinarians to discuss available vaccines and other precautions.
EEE was first detected in birds in Maine in 2001. In horses, the symptoms include stumbling or poor balance, unusual behavior and lethargy. Other signs are head pressing, circling, tremors, seizures and coma. Some species experience bloody diarrhea or sudden death. In animals, the fatality rate is 90 percent, and the survivors can have permanent brain damage.
In humans, those who develop symptoms may experience mild flu-like illness to high fever, headache, stiff neck and decreased consciousness. About one in every three individuals who are infected with EEE dies and many of those who recover experience lasting health problems. Individuals with symptoms suggesting an EEE infection should contact their physician immediately, although there is no vaccine for humans and no specific antiviral treatment for either EEE or West Nile virus.
CDC officials said people should minimize outdoor activity from dusk to dawn, when mosquitoes are most active. When outdoors, people should use an EPA-approved insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, treat clothing with Permethrin and manage mosquitoes around their property.
More information on preventing EEE and WNV is available on the CDC website at: cdc.gov/EEE/ orcdc.gov/westnile.

Texto completo: Winslow police found more than 100 grams of fentanyl after a bail check led to the discovery of drug-related activity at the Monument Street residence of Joseph Romagno, 38.

WINSLOW — Three people were arrested in Winslow Thursday night in a drug bust that uncovered more than 100 grams of fentanyl and $3,000 cash.
Joseph Romagno, 38, of Winslow, Kendu Watts, 21, of New York, New York, and Amanda Martinez, 20, of New York, New York, were all charged with aggravated trafficking of scheduled drugs and are being held at the Kennebec County jail after being unable to make bail. Romagno is also charged with violating conditions of release, unlawfully possessing scheduled drugs and using drug paraphernalia, according to Winslow Police Chief Shawn O’Leary.
O’Leary said that “officers observed items that were consistent with ongoing drug activity,” during a routine bail check of Romagno at his 17 Monument St. residence at approximately 10:13 p.m. Romagno was out on bail for drug-related charges, according to O’Leary. After a search warrant was issued and executed, officers found 134.3 grams of fentanyl, 1.5 grams of crack cocaine and $3,060 in cash. Watts and Martinez were also found in the apartment at the time.
“That particular area is very well known to us,” O’Leary said, adding that one of the observations that led officers to suspect drug activity was “a lot of vehicles coming or going.” O’Leary noted that Thursday’s incident is considered a source-level drug bust.
Winslow police were assisted by Waterville police and a K9 team from the Kennebec County Sheriff’s Office.
Romagno is being held on $12,500 cash bail, Watts on $15,000 cash bail and Martinez on $10,000 cash bail. All three individuals are set to appear in Kennebec Superior Court on Oct. 29. “This is a typical drug case that unfortunately people from out of state, particularly source cities like New York City, are coming to Maine to peddle their poison and unfortunately taking the lives of us Mainers,” O’Leary said. “We are in hopes that they will eventually get the idea to stay out of Maine.”

Texto completo: motorists idling for hours
AUGUSTA -- Many Maine motorists have been stuck in the slow lane at the state's Bureau of Motor Vehicle branch offices this summer - with thousands waiting more than 1½ hours to get their licenses renewed or new cars registered.
Kristen Muszynski, a spokeswoman for the Maine Secretary of State's Office, which oversees the BMV, said Friday that the situation isn't normal for an agency that is usually praised for its speedy and helpful customer service.
"We are usually a lot quicker," she said. "We've just had a perfect storm of different things coming into play right now."
One major factor, Muszynski said, is a staffing shortage that's left the BMV offices with 15 staff vacancies across the three different regions of the state - south, central and north.
Some customers at the Portland BMV office on Presumpscot Street said Friday that they waited as long as three hours for service.
Nick Hoffman, 20, of Kennebunk said this was his third day in a row waiting to turn in paperwork documenting his driving hours on a learner's permit. Hoffman said he waited two hours Wednesday, an hour Thursday and was going on another hour Friday.
"It's pretty frustrating," he said.
Bill Robinson of Falmouth came to register a car but after taking a ticket number for No. 220, he turned around and left - as workers paged No. 97 over the office's loudspeakers.
"I'll have to try another day," Robinson said.
Jim Beale of Portland was there to get his motorcycle license at 9:30 a.m. but left at noon for lunch when his number (116) hadn't come up and it looked like it would be a while. But by the time Beale got back, his number had passed and he had to take another -- 246.
While frustrated - Beale said he could think of better ways to spend a sunny Friday afternoon - he was understanding of the state's situation and said finding workers was a problem for many businesses in Maine.
"I get it," he said. "I'm not that upset really. I just made a poor choice. Also, the last day of the month is always busy. So what am I doing here?"
The BMV's vacancies represent 21 percent of the staff in the 70-person bureau. The starting wage for BMV customer service workers is $14.16 an hour but that is going to $14.58 an hour starting in September, Muszynski said.
Nationally, the average wait time for a customer in a bureau of motor vehicles office is 34 minutes, according to an eight-month study conducted by BMV.com in 2018. The website is a clearinghouse portal for motorists offering links to online license and registration services, as well as educational postings for drivers.
The site also ranks the best and the worst BMV operations around the country. Among those with notorious reputations for long wait times and poor customer service are Connecticut, South Carolina and Oregon. Those with the best rankings include Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. Maine ranks near the middle of the pack.
Muszynski said the bureaus have been slowed considerably by a wave of Mainers trying to switch their driver's licenses to the new federally compliant Real ID, the regular uptick in summer traffic and vacation season.
"When we combine the 11 percent increase in traffic with the number of positions vacant, the implementation of Real ID, the summer vacation season, and already minimal staffing levels, that creates longer wait times for customers," she said.
In all, the bureaus have seen 8,000 more customers from July 1 to Aug. 20 this year than they did for the same period last year, according to data Muzsynski provided to the Portland Press Herald.
Average wait times in that period for the bureaus in Bangor and Portland were 55 and 51 minutes, respectively. And 2,244 customers waited longer than 100 minutes for service, according to the bureau's data.
Muszynski said six new staffers are in training. She also suggested that residents consider delaying applying for a Real ID, as the federal government won't enforce that requirement for Mainers until October 2020.
Muszynski also noted that many bureau services, including basic driver's license renewals and motor vehicle registrations, are provided online. She said those who must visit the BMV should try to avoid Mondays, which is always a busy day, and to avoid the midday lunchtime crush between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.

Texto completo: N.C. Hunt Lumber President Rob Hunt said 17 workers who were laid off in the wake of the March fire will likely return this winter.

JEFFERSON — A new steel-frame sawmill is almost complete at N.C. Hunt Lumber, signaling the return of more than a dozen jobs to Jefferson after a fire forced layoffs.
On Tuesday, workers were welding parts of the sawmill and placing steel panels on the roof. The steel-frame doesn’t have any walls yet, but N.C. Hunt President Rob Hunt — son of owner Norman Clark Hunt — said portions of the mill should be turned on in a matter of weeks to be calibrated. He said the whole sawmill should be running at full power in December.
The former wooden sawmill burned down in March and, in April, Department of Public Safety spokesperson Steve McCausland said the fire was accidental. The fire was caused by sparks from a torch used while making repairs to machinery. No one was injured in the blaze.
Rob Hunt said the company had to lay off 17 people after the fire, but kept 15 on to help build the mill. Some of the workers building the mill will operate it once construction is finished, he said, and the rest of the laid-off workers will return later.
“The goal is to bring them all back by this winter once we get the machines up and running,” Rob Hunt said. “Hopefully, we can grow. We’re super excited about that.”
He said employees were nervous the day after the fire, but were quick to move onto the rebuild.
“Everyone was pretty nervous that day,” Hunt said. “Within four weeks, we got the guts of the plan, … and they started building it.”
“We jumped on it quick,” he added. “Take one step, if you thought about all 500 you’d get discouraged.”
Crews are reusing some parts of the old mill — like sections of foundations and components from old machinery — and combining them with new, state-of-the-art components to construct the facility. Rob Hunt compared the sawmill’s controls to those used to play video games, adding they are more intuitive for employees. He said if he contracted the job, it would cost about $3 million.
“We’ve used some assets we had here,” he said, adding that the company is using its own construction crew. “We’re doing it for quite a chunk less (than $3 million).”
Hunt said the new mill will help the company add more types of high-end wood to its inventory, which he said is shipped as far away as New York City and North Carolina. He said the sawmill was also engineered to be safer and more efficient.
The company used stored sawmill product to sustain some clients while the facility was rebuilt, but Dave Smith, N.C. Hunt Lumber’s retail general manager, said Tuesday some product had to be purchased from competitors to keep up with demand.
That was tough on the company’s bottom line, Hunt said, because it increases already-high transportation costs for products that would otherwise be produced in N.C. Hunt’s own lumber yard.
“It makes a huge difference for us … and we’re able to be very competitive,” he said.
Despite having to contact competitors for product, Smith and Hunt said other lumber yards have offered them reasonable prices.
“The other mills have been good to us,” Smith said. “The Maine lumber community came together (to help N.C. Hunt).”
“We’ve just had a tremendous amount of support, whether it be vendors, customers, loggers (or) employees,” Hunt added. “Without all the support we’ve had from the community, state and town, we wouldn’t have come close to what we’re doing.”

Texto completo: If the newest $27.12 million budget isn't passed by voters on Sept. 12, it will be the third failed budget in a matter of months.

FAIRFIELD — Residents from Albion, Benton, Clinton and Fairfield approved a $27.12 million budget for Maine School Administrative District 49 at a meeting on Thursday evening.
The budget, which was shot down twice in the last two months, reflects a $250,834 decrease from the last approved budget on July 9 and a $36,218 decrease from the original budget that was presented at a meeting in May, making this the lowest proposed budget the board has presented yet.
The board was able to reduce the budget significantly by rearranging a special education position between two schools and aligning the budget with changes in salaries and personnel benefits for the upcoming year and with the cost of natural gas, the rate of which is anticipated to be less this school year.
The budget’s articles on regular instruction and special education raised concerns, while the other 13 articles garnered minimal discussion.
Former school board member Shelley Rudnicki, who resigned with Caroline Toto-Lawrence and Tim Martin at a Fairfield Town Council meeting on Aug. 10, made her way to the microphone to raise her concerns about the regular instruction article.
“The May 14 budget, which was originally posed and sent to taxpayers had regular education at $10.8 million. What did the addition of $118,000 go towards?” Rudnicki said. “And why haven’t we considered reducing at least one position in the Albion schools. Fairfield has nearly 25 kids to one teacher where Albion has 8 or 9.”
Vice Chairwoman Jenny Boyden answered.
“We didn’t work off (the) number that was amended from that meeting; we went from what was originally proposed, not the amendment,” Boyden said.
Boyden also explained that additional costs reflected the addition of reading recovery positions as well as shifts in positions that were previously funded by Title 1.
Rudnicki motioned to amend the article by $100,000, which was seconded by Toto-Lawrence.
Rudnicki’s motion was defeated when only she, Toto-Lawrence and Toto-Lawrence’s husband, Fairfield Town Council Member Peter Lawrence, supported the article.
The article for special education was the next point of contention for Rudnicki and a fellow unnamed citizen.
“Once again please explain the differences between what the original May 14 budget came at to what it is now,” Rudnicki said. “It’s not a decrease like you’re trying to tell us; it’s actually an increase. … It just seems like we’re playing games here.”
Boyden responded by explaining that the decrease the board is talking about is from the last approved budget on July 9, not the one from May 14.
After Rudnicki asked about the district’s enrollment numbers, Board Member Kara Kugelmyer chimed in.
“I don’t know what this has to do with special education. I don’t understand the argument,” Kugelmyer said.
“The argument about our taxes continuing to go up, and you have not done anything but play games with this budget,” Rudnicki said.
According to documents provided by Board Chairman Shawn Knox, the mil rate increase for each town is: 0.82 for Albion; 0.91 for Benton; 0.82 for Clinton; and 0.66 for Fairfield.
Another resident questioned the board about the increases to special education, which came out to be around $115,480.
“A lot of administrators said they didn’t have adequate staff,” Boyden said. “That was a primary concern so we added staff. We had two special education teachers and five techs added between May and July… So a substantial portion of the budget increases is salary since that was the main concern.”
The board made additional changes from July to when it approved the budget on Aug. 12 by shifting one of the special education teachers from Albion Elementary to Lawrence Junior High School. Knox said this wouldn’t disrupt the students of Albion.
“To address the previous concern, I want to applaud the board for taking the time to make sure we have an additional teacher,” Benjamin Kent, a mathematics teacher at Lawrence High School, said. “Our students are in dire need. … Some of our students were supposed to have one-on-one ed tech help, and they were going without and they were suffering. It (the budget) might go up but it’s needed. … We’re all going to have to accept the fact this piece of the budget is going up a significant amount, but it’s for the benefit of the students.”
After Kent’s comment the article was approved by voters.
The remaining articles were approved with no discussion and the meeting adjourned less than an hour after it began.
The revised budget goes to a referendum on Sept. 12. If not passed, it would be the third failed referendum since June.
Voters rejected a $27.42 million budget in June with 586 “no” votes to 325 “yes” votes and again defeated a $27.36 budget in July 290- 262.
The two failed referendums come after an unsteady year which included resignations from seven teachers, the superintendent and Lawrence High School’s assistant and head principals along with three board members from Fairfield.
The tenure of former Superintendent Dr. Reza Namin, whose resignation took effect on Aug. 2, was rife with controversy in great part due to his divisive restructuring plan that eventually cost the district $417,665 in administrative buyouts.

New rebate program for hybrids

Texto completo: The program, which will award rebates of $1,000-$2,000, will be funded by a $5.1 million legal settlement against Volkswagen and its affiliates for violating state environmental laws.
Program will be funded by $5M legal settlement against Volkswagen

A $5.1 million legal settlement won by Maine against German automaker Volkswagen Group and its affiliates is being used to fund a new statewide rebate program for buyers of hybrid and electric vehicles.
The program, announced Friday by Gov. Janet Mills, will provide rebates of $1,000 to $2,000 on qualifying plug-in hybrid and battery-powered electric vehicles, with higher rebates being offered to low-income households and government entities, including tribal governments. The initiative is called the EV Accelerator Program and is being administered by the quasi-state agency Efficiency Maine Trust.
According to the Natural Resources Council of Maine, the new rebate can be combined with federal incentives to provide a total of up to $9,500 off the price of a plug-in vehicle in Maine. It said states offering financial incentives have experienced 15% to 25% higher sales of plug-in vehicles compared with the national average.
“Cars and trucks are the largest source of climate change pollution in Maine and contribute to unhealthy air conditions across our state,” the council’s clean energy director, Dylan Voorhees, said in a news release. “The new rebate announced today will help prompt more Mainers to save money and reduce pollution by choosing to drive electric.”
In 2017, then-Attorney General Mills won the settlement after taking legal action against Volkswagen and its affiliates Audi and Porsche for violating state environmental laws and emissions through their marketing and sales of light vehicles in Maine. The state also received an additional $21 million settlement as part of a federal lawsuit against Volkswagen over the company’s diesel engines that illegally produced high levels of greenhouse gases.
Mills announced in March that Maine would put the $5.1 million settlement toward subsidies to encourage residents and companies to buy electric vehicles. She said the state also would add at least 50 public vehicle charging stations as part of the initiative. Funds from the other settlement have been earmarked for other energy-efficiency and emissions-reduction programs.
Mills said in a news release Friday that the rebate program’s goal is to displace the use of inefficient internal combustion engines in Maine with the increased use of high-efficiency electric vehicles in order to reduce harmful emissions including nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide.
“Maine people shell out $5 billion a year to out-of-state fossil fuel companies, and a lot of that money is spent on gas for vehicles that just becomes carbon dioxide pumped into our atmosphere,” Mills said. “We can do better. It is time to usher in the next generation of technologies that will move our state towards a renewable future.”
The EV Accelerator program is offering instant rebates to Maine residents at the point of purchase through participating automobile dealerships, the release said.
“Maine’s new car dealers welcome the EV rebate program as an assist to their customers looking at this new and exciting technology,” said Tom Brown, president of the Maine Automobile Dealers Association, in the release. “Rebate-eligible vehicles are currently available, and many more will be coming as manufacturers expand their EV production.”
Program details and lists of eligible vehicles and participating dealerships are available online at efficiencymaine.com/EV.

Quitting while you're ahead, or before being booed off stage An athlete's retirement leads humble to ponder what it would take to get a performer to put down the mic.

Texto completo: The other day you might have seen a football player on TV who said that he was quitting the game while he could still walk. In seven years, the poor boy had broken or fractured or ruptured more body parts than a Port Clyde family of lobster catchers does in a lifetime. I seem to recall that he was 29 years old and that he had earned a hundred million dollars being pounded into the ground by big guys who knew what he earned and resented it. With consumer prices already shooting up because of the trade war with China, we can sympathize with him for not quitting months ago.
But the day finally came when enough was enough. And when he said he was tired of being smeared on the ground, his fans booed him off the field.
That gave me the shivers because, although I quit speaking on a regular basis years ago, I've agreed to say a few words at the September meeting of the Maine Organization of Storytelling Enthusiasts at the Portland Public Library. Why, I wondered, don't more of us who perform quit before we are booed or carried off the field?
Do you ever agree to do something on the spur of the moment and only later consider the ramifications? Perhaps you've said you'd play a trumpet that you haven't touched in years. Or throw away your crutches long enough to take on some rangy teenager on the tennis court. Roping steers at the rodeo was once second nature, but now it seems that all you remember are the early days when you were dragged about in the dust.
For years I spoke at hundreds of association meetings all over the United States. But there comes a day when just the thought of flying to Utah to deliver a few cheerful words to a conclave of undertakers is tiring. The presentation itself is easy and the compensation good, but flying across the country to sit in a hotel room and eat Subway sandwiches for breakfast, dinner and supper for two or three days while either waiting to perform or go home is too much. I thought I had phased out that kind of personal suffering.
Adding to my panic was the last-minute notice from MOOSE that I was scheduled to speak in the auditorium. If you've performed where people are expected to laugh at your remarks, you know that the venue is more important than your content or delivery.
Two things that are sure doom to a humorous after-dinner speaker are bottles of wine on the table or a half-filled room - no matter the size. Fifteen hundred people in an auditorium that seats 3,000 is the kiss of death. You get a better response from 60 people in a grange hall that seats only 50.
It had been so long since I'd spoken on a regular basis that it took me a couple of days to remember that it is possible to give a talk in an auditorium.
You take a roll of red plastic tape and tape off the two side sections. Then you use the tape to tape off the entire center section except for the two front rows.
People are generally willing to go along with seats that have been blocked off before they arrive at the venue, but once ensconced in the back row, they couldn't be moved by a tractor - unless they are personally escorted down to the front where they can join the 20 or so hopeful people in the two front rows.
Thinking about the auditorium reminded me of a similar venue I encountered long ago.
The sides and the back were taped off. The faithful who had showed up dutifully seated themselves in the two front rows, center.
But one young woman was hovering way up back by the entrance.
As an experienced professional, I wanted that woman to know that she was a valued member of my audience. So I ran up back and invited her, face to face, to sit down front with the others.
No, she said she'd rather stand up back.
I insisted and, taking her by the arm, dragged her protesting to the front of the hall, where I proudly seated her in one of the best seats in the house.
At the end of the show, she came up to me and said that she'd just had an operation way up high on the back part of her left leg.

Texto completo: The program, which will award rebates of $1,000-$2,000, will be funded by a $5.1 million legal settlement against Volkswagen and its affiliates for violating state environmental laws.

A $5.1 million legal settlement won by Maine against German automaker Volkswagen Group and its affiliates is being used to fund a new statewide rebate program for buyers of hybrid and electric vehicles.
The program, announced Friday by Gov. Janet Mills, will provide rebates of $1,000 to $2,000 on qualifying plug-in hybrid and battery-powered electric vehicles, with higher rebates being offered to low-income households and government entities, including tribal governments. The initiative is called the EV Accelerator Program and is being administered by the quasi-state agency Efficiency Maine Trust.
According to the Natural Resources Council of Maine, the new rebate can be combined with federal incentives to provide a total of up to $9,500 off the price of a plug-in vehicle in Maine. It said states offering financial incentives have experienced 15% to 25% higher sales of plug-in vehicles compared with the national average.
“Cars and trucks are the largest source of climate change pollution in Maine and contribute to unhealthy air conditions across our state,” the council’s clean energy director, Dylan Voorhees, said in a news release. “The new rebate announced today will help prompt more Mainers to save money and reduce pollution by choosing to drive electric.”
In 2017, then-Attorney General Mills won the settlement after taking legal action against Volkswagen and its affiliates Audi and Porsche for violating state environmental laws and emissions through their marketing and sales of light vehicles in Maine. The state also received an additional $21 million settlement as part of a federal lawsuit against Volkswagen over the company’s diesel engines that illegally produced high levels of greenhouse gases.
Mills announced in March that Maine would put the $5.1 million settlement toward subsidies to encourage residents and companies to buy electric vehicles. She said the state also would add at least 50 public vehicle charging stations as part of the initiative. Funds from the other settlement have been earmarked for other energy-efficiency and emissions-reduction programs.
Mills said in a news release Friday that the rebate program’s goal is to displace the use of inefficient internal combustion engines in Maine with the increased use of high-efficiency electric vehicles in order to reduce harmful emissions including nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide.
“Maine people shell out $5 billion a year to out-of-state fossil fuel companies, and a lot of that money is spent on gas for vehicles that just becomes carbon dioxide pumped into our atmosphere,” Mills said. “We can do better. It is time to usher in the next generation of technologies that will move our state towards a renewable future.”
The EV Accelerator program is offering instant rebates to Maine residents at the point of purchase through participating automobile dealerships, the release said.
“Maine’s new car dealers welcome the EV rebate program as an assist to their customers looking at this new and exciting technology,” said Tom Brown, president of the Maine Automobile Dealers Association, in the release. “Rebate-eligible vehicles are currently available, and many more will be coming as manufacturers expand their EV production.”
Program details and lists of eligible vehicles and participating dealerships are available online at efficiencymaine.com/EV.

Texto completo: The "Franklin County Sheriff's Office received a report in July from a state lab indicating white powder seized during the stop was 8.6 grams of fentanyl, according to the sheriff.

FARMINGTON — A Peru man was arrested recently on a Franklin County warrant charging him with selling fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.
The warrant was issued Aug. 23 and served on Eric Tidswell, 43, at the Androscoggin County Jail in Auburn where he is incarcerated, according to Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols Sr. He is charged with aggravated trafficking in drugs. A conviction carries a penalty of up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.
When Franklin County Deputy Andrew Morgan conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Tidswell in New Sharon in March, he was arrested on a charge of operating after suspension. During the arrest, the drug Suboxone and another white, powdery substance was found inside the vehicle along with drug scales and over $3,000, Nichols wrote in a news release. Tidswell was charged at the time with unlawful possession of a scheduled drug and violation of condition of release.
The white powder was sent to a state laboratory for analysis and a report came back in July that the substance was 8.6 grams of fentanyl, Nichols wrote.
Franklin County Detective Stephen Charles took over the case and conducted an in-depth investigation that spanned two states prior to the warrant being issued.
Once Tidswell finishes his time at the Auburn jail, he will be transferred to the Franklin County Detention Center to face charges.
Tidswell has been arrested a number of times this year on charges that included violation of bail and operating after suspension.
On April 6, Maine State Police Trooper Jason Wing arrested Tidswell after a 7-mile chase on Route 108 in Canton to Livermore with speeds that reached 114 mph, according to state police Lt. Kyle Tilsley.

Police found more than 100g of fentanyl after bail check

WINSLOW — Three people were arrested in Winslow Thursday night in a drug bust that uncovered more than 100 grams of fentanyl and $3,000 cash.
Joseph Romagno, 38, of Winslow, Kendu Watts, 21, of New York, New York, and Amanda Martinez, 20, of New York, New York, were all charged with aggravated trafficking of scheduled drugs and are being held at the Kennebec County jail after being unable to make bail. Romagno is also charged with violating conditions of release, unlawfully possessing scheduled drugs and using drug paraphernalia, according to Winslow Police Chief Shawn O’Leary.
O’Leary said that “officers observed items that were consistent with ongoing drug activity,” during a routine bail check of Romagno at his 17 Monument St. residence at approximately 10:13 p.m. Romagno was out on bail for drug-related charges, according to O’Leary. After a search warrant was issued and executed, officers found 134.3 grams of fentanyl, 1.5 grams of crack cocaine and $3,060 in cash. Watts and Martinez were also found in the apartment at the time.
“That particular area is very well known to us,” O’Leary said, adding that one of the observations that led officers to suspect drug activity was “a lot of vehicles coming or going.” O’Leary noted that Thursday’s incident is considered a source-level drug bust.
Winslow police were assisted by Waterville police and a K9 team from the Kennebec County Sheriff’s Office.
Romagno is being held on $12,500 cash bail, Watts on $15,000 cash bail and Martinez on $10,000 cash bail. All three individuals are set to appear in Kennebec Superior Court on Oct. 29.
“This is a typical drug case that unfortunately people from out of state, particularly source cities like New York City, are coming to Maine to peddle their poison and unfortunately taking the lives of us Mainers,” O’Leary said. “We are in hopes that they will eventually get the idea to stay out of Maine.”

Texto completo: Former Harpswell resident and Hyde School dean Matt Newberg will be the new head of school at the Maine Academy of Natural Sciences.
Newberg spent 14 years at Hyde School in Bath, where he served in a variety of roles: teacher, coach, director of the school's performing arts program, and dean of students and faculty, respectively.
A native of Syracuse, New York, Newberg grew up in Harpswell and earned a bachelor of science degree in environmental education at the University of Vermont, where he developed and taught his own environmental studies curriculum.
Newberg earned a certificate in leadership studies from the University of Southern Maine in 2018 and also holds an assistant principal certification from the Maine Department of Education.
"What excited me the most in learning about this position was how multifaceted and dynamic it is, and that's a testament to what they've built here at MeANS," Newberg said in a statement. "It's not just about being an administrator; it's about being involved in the classroom, being with students and teachers and understanding their experience."
Founded in 2012, Maine Academy of Natural Sciences offers classes in farming, forestry, sustainability, alternative energy and other science-based fields.
The goal of the curriculum is to help students gain knowledge through hands-on projects, experiential learning and targeted courses, Newberg said.
The school is located on the campus of Good Will-Hinckley, an organization that's been providing educational and other resources to young people in need for more than 130 years.
"Matt brings a wealth of talent to the Maine Academy of Natural Sciences," said Cheryl Bulmer board chairwoman. "We're very excited to have him on board to work with the students, staff, board, Charter Commission and community to ensure MeANS continues to grow and prosper."
"We know that Matt brings a wealth of knowledge to help us create a respectful, responsible and community-centered school environment, and we look forward to him developing meaningful relationships with everyone within the MeANS community."

Uncovering a fort in Windham, inch by inch

Texto completo: The Maine Historic Preservation Commission's roadside archaeological dig is helping resolve mysteries of a fort that was built in the 1740s.

Layer by layer, archaeologists in Windham are resolving — and revealing — mysteries.
The questions they have as they sift through nearly three centuries of dirt and rubble include how a 1744-era fort was constructed, how many people sought refuge in it and what life was like for the colonists who had moved to the area from Marblehead, Massachusetts.
John Mosher and his team from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission have to work fast to find answers. Their excavation is being done alongside River Road in Windham, which is being rebuilt by the Maine Department of Transportation. On Tuesday, the archaeologists will wrap up work on the west side of the road and move to the east side, where they will have another month or so to excavate and examine the remains of the fort.
After that, construction crews will lower the hilltop road about 5 feet and rebuild and widen the pavement. Whatever is left of the fort is likely to be trucked from the site.
Most of the site consists of clusters of rock, which Mosher said is evidence of chimney foundations and a base for a wooden boardwalk inside the fort. The archaeologists are unsure of the reason for another large cluster of rocks on the site, he said, but hope that the excavation of the rest of the fort might provide an answer.
The only artifacts found from the period when the fort existed, he said, were gun flints and small pieces of ceramics.
The area around the fort was called New Marblehead by the 60 or so colonists from Massachusetts who had been granted a large tract of land to settle west of Portland. Province Fort was built on a hilltop near the center of the settlement, and close to the Presumpscot River, as hostilities were growing between English colonists, like those from Massachusetts, and Native Americans, who were allies of the French.
The hostilities eventually grew into King George’s War, which was fought between 1744 and 1748, primarily in upstate New York, New England and Nova Scotia. The war did little to resolve the territorial ambitions of the British and the French, or the status of the Native Americans in the Northeast.
and eastern Canada.
Province Fort was used mainly as a refuge for the settlers, Mosher said. Records indicate it was a square that was roughly 50 feet by 50 feet, but it may have been larger, Mosher said, and was surrounded by a palisade of posts with a gate. Colonists would rush to the safety of the fort in case of attack. A block house was constructed inside the fort walls, he said, and archaeologists are trying to determine if there were other structures as well, which would indicate that large numbers of settlers might have spent significant time inside the fort.
After hostilities eased, Mosher said, the fort became the center of town, getting used for meetings, and a church and the minister’s house were located nearby. The fort was eventually sold in 1782 and the new owner deconstructed it and used the timbers for other purposes.
That leaves Mosher and his team with clues, but not many concrete facts, to go on, he said.
“It becomes really complicated,” he said. “But it’s a fun puzzle. Every day we tend to generate more questions than answers.”
Mosher said a lot of the work involves taking pictures of the site that can be analyzed later. The artifacts collected, he said, also will be analyzed and catalogued over the winter.
They had to be sorted carefully, he said, because residents apparently dumped a fair amount of rubbish on the site and archaeologists found items from as recent as the 1920s.
Archaeologists knew for years that the fort was somewhere in the area, Mosher said, but weren’t able to confirm it until three years ago, when they dug test holes alongside River Road and found signs of the structure. The road project is getting some federal funds, he said, and rules require the state to take steps to preserve or allow exploration of archaeological and architecturally significant sites when federal money is involved.
Susan Simonson, president of the Windham Historical Society, said town members had heard rumors that there was a fort in the area and she is gratified that the Historic Preservation Commission’s work proves its existence and provides more details about the fort. However, she also said it’s “disheartening” to know that, in the end, the fort’s remains will be removed and the site covered over.
“It would be really nice to preserve it,” she said.

Texto completo: Culvert had flooded ‘repeatedly’ where a marsh feeds into Jug Stream.

A culvert on Sanborn Road that has been a headache for the town has been replaced.
After a three-week closure for construction, Monmouth Town Manager Curtis Lunt said the road will reopen by early next week.
The culvert, which is near the intersection with Route 135, had been in use from the early 1980s. The bottom is rusted through, so water was able to leak out of it and erode the ground beneath it.
“It had flooded out repeatedly every couple years over the road,” Lunt said. “It wasn’t big enough.”
The culvert allows drainage from a marsh into Jug Stream, the outlet of Annabessacook Lake that flows into Cobbossee Lake.
The 5-foot culvert was holding the water back, though, Lunt explained. In the spring when the water was high, it would dam behind the culvert, eventually flowing over Sanborn Road and washing it out, causing temporary closures.
“That area is plagued with beavers,” Public Works Director Bruce Balfour said in April 2018 after the road flooded in the spring last year, causing a closure.
The old structure was replaced with an approximately 10-by-17 box culvert. From a distance, Lunt said, it looks similar to a bridge.
“It is about three times the size it was before and should allow a lot better waterflow,” he said.
The cost of the project, which was contracted to L.P. Poirier of Lewiston, was $180,000. The town received a Stream Crossing Grant from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection that matched the town’s investment of $90,000.
In order for the project to be completed, Lunt said, the town had to receive federal permission through the Army Corps of Engineers to work on the waterway, because “it is an ecologically sensitive area.”
The DEP grant is designed for stream crossings to maintain water flow and protect wildlife, including fish.

Texto completo: State Bureau of Motor Vehicle branch offices are facing what officials call a 'perfect storm' of issues that have left thousands of motorists waiting in line for hours as they try to renew a driver's license or register a vehicle.

AUGUSTA — Many Maine motorists have been stuck in the slow lane at the state’s Bureau of Motor Vehicle branch offices this summer — with thousands waiting more than 1.5 hours to get their license renewed or a new car registered.
Kristen Muszynski, a spokeswoman for the Maine Secretary of State’s Office, which oversees the BMV, said Friday that the situation isn’t normal for an agency that is usually praised for its speedy and helpful customer service.
“We are usually a lot quicker,” she said. “We’ve just had a perfect storm of different things coming into play right now.”
One major factor, Muszynski said, is a staffing shortage that’s left the BMV offices with 15 staff vacancies across the three different regions of the state — south, central and north.
Some customers at the Portland BMV office on Presumpscot Street said Friday that they waited as long as three hours for service.
Nick Hoffman, 20, of Kennebunk said this was his third day in a row waiting to turn in paperwork documenting his driving hours on a learner’s permit. Hoffman said he waited two hours on Wednesday, an hour Thursday and was going on another hour Friday.
“It’s pretty frustrating,” he said.
Bill Robinson, a Falmouth resident, came to register a car but after taking a ticket number for No. 220, he turned around and left — as workers paged No. 97 over the office’s loudspeakers.
“I’ll have to try another day,” Robinson said.
Jim Beale, of Portland, was there to get his motorcycle license at 9:30 a.m. but left at noon for lunch when his number (116) hadn’t come up and it looked like it would be a while. But by the time Beale got back his number had passed and he had to take another — 246.
While frustrated — Beale said he could think of better ways to spend a sunny Friday afternoon — he was understanding of the state’s situation and said finding workers was a problem for many businesses in Maine. “I get it,” he said. “I’m not that upset really. I just made a poor choice. Also the last day of the month is always busy. So what am I doing here?”
The BMV’s vacancies represent 21% of the staff in the 70-person bureau. The starting wage for BMV customer service workers is $14.16 an hour but that is going to $14.58 an hour starting in September, Muszynski said.
Nationally, the average wait time for a customer in a bureau of motor vehicles office is 34 minutes, according to an eight-month study conducted by BMV.com in 2018. The website is a clearinghouse portal for motorists offering links to online license and registration services, as well as educational postings for drivers.
The site also ranks the best and the worst BMV operations around the country. Among those with notorious reputations for long wait times and poor customer service are Connecticut, South Carolina and Oregon. Those with the best rankings include Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. Maine ranks near the middle of the pack.
Muszynski said the bureaus have been slowed considerably by a wave of Mainers trying to switch their driver’s licenses to the new federally compliant Real ID, the regular uptick in summer traffic and vacation season.
“When we combine the 11% increase in traffic with the number of positions vacant, the implementation of Real ID, the summer vacation season and already minimal staffing levels, that creates longer wait times for customers,” she said.
In all, the bureaus have seen 8,000 more customers from July 1 to Aug. 20 this year than they did for the same period last year, according to data Muzsynski provided to the Portland Press Herald.
Average wait times in that period for the bureaus in Bangor and Portland were 55 and 51 minutes, respectively. And 2,244 customers waited longer than 100 minutes for service, according to the bureau’s data.
Muszynski said six new staffers are in training. She also suggested that residents consider delaying applying for a Real ID, as the federal government won’t enforce that requirement for Mainers until October 2020.
Muszynski also noted that many bureau services, including basic driver’s license renewals and motor vehicle registrations, are provided online. She said those who must visit the BMV should try to avoid Mondays, which is always a busy day, and to avoid the midday lunchtime crush between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.

Texto completo: The parks and recreation department is warning people to keep their dogs away from a blue-green algae bloom in the pond at Hinckley Park.

A pond in South Portland’s Hinckley Park has tested positive for a type of algae that produces toxins that can be fatal for dogs.
The South Portland Parks and Recreation Department posted warning signs Friday based on testing results that showed a blue-green algae bloom could possibly produce the same toxins that have killed pets in other states this summer.
“We are asking that people please keep your dogs away from the shorelines. Don’t let them drink the water, swim or go near the algae that is accumulating on the shorelines,” the department wrote in an initial Facebook post Thursday evening.
Along with posting signs around the pond Friday morning to warn dog owners to keep their dogs away from the water, the city posted a new message on Facebook urging park visitors to pick up after their dogs because the feces left around the pond contributes to the algae problem.
“The signs have been posted at Hinckley Park, near main entrances and along the waters edge. We will be sure to post again when we have new information about changes in water conditions,” the post says.
“We would also like to take this time to point out that one cause of this bloom is from an excess of pet waste that is left behind in our park. We need park visitors to pick up ALL pet waste and dispose of it in proper receptacles. Failure to comply with our parks rules and regulations could result in an unfavorable change to those rules and regulations.”
Blue-green algae growth, known as cyanobacteria, is made up of microscopic organisms that naturally occur in streams and lakes. Much of it is harmless, but it can produce toxic chemicals that cause sickness in people and can be fatal to dogs.
Scott Williams, executive director of Lake Stewards of Maine, a volunteer lake monitoring program, said blue-green algae has been found in what he called “moderately high” levels in a handful of lakes out of thousands across the state.
“It’s not unusual to find some cyanobacteria, even in the clearest lakes,” he said. “Algae is a normal component — it’s the base of the food chain — but it’s really only a problem when the concentration rises.”
Williams said the two things that contribute to higher levels of blue-green algae are temperature and phosphorus levels, both of which are tied to climate change. Higher temperatures warm bodies of water and soil erosion creates runoff that contains phosphorus.
Williams said he wasn’t aware of the algae bloom in South Portland — his organization doesn’t track that water body because it’s not a swimming spot — but said public ponds are more likely to be susceptible to water quality issues.
A good rule of thumb for people, Williams said, is to never drink untreated water. As for whether lakes are safe to swim in, he said if you can wade out to your shoulder and look down in the water and still see your feet, the water is almost certainly safe.
“We’re fortunate that this isn’t a major concern here in Maine,” he said. “But it’s something to be aware of.”
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection lists lakes at risk of algal blooms on its website, but that list does not note if any of those blooms are ongoing. The Lake Stewards of Maine also share its water quality data online.
At least four dogs have died this summer in North Carolina and Georgia after swimming in water contaminated with blue-green algae, The Associated Press reported.
Blooms of blue-green algae have been documented in all 50 states, David G. Schmale III, a professor at Virginia Tech, told CNN.
Dave Maker was glad to see warning signs posted at Hinckley Park when he stopped by Friday afternoon with his pitbull, Debris. While Maker lives in Alfred, he visits Hinckley Park weekly because he has friends in South Portland.
“I love this park,” Maker said. “I’m glad they put up signs. My dog is my life. I wouldn’t let her swim in something toxic.”

Medical pot in K-12 schools? Measure would allow parents to bring cannabis products to children on campuses.

Texto completo: California moved a step closer Friday to allowing parents to bring some medical marijuana products to their children on school campuses, and now Gov. Gavin Newsom will be the final arbiter on an idea rejected by his predecessor.
The state Senate gave final legislative approval to a controversial bill that would authorize school districts to let parents bring nonsmoking medical cannabis products -- including pills, creams and oils -- onto school campuses to administer them to their children. They could only do so for children who had received a doctor's recommendation for the medical marijuana.
State Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo) said his measure is needed to help students with severe health problems, including epilepsy, attend school without disruptions caused by parents otherwise taking them off campus to administer the drug. The bill was named for an epileptic teenager who lives in Hill's district and depends on daily doses of cannabis oil.

"Jojo's Act would enable students who are living with severe medical disabilities and rely on medicinal cannabis to take their medication on campus under strict conditions and supervision, so they can get on with their school day without disrupting their education," Hill said Friday, noting that the drug can be administered only in nonsmoking and nonvaping forms.
The measure, which applies to students in kindergarten through 12th grades, was opposed Friday by many Republican legislators as well as by the California Police Chiefs Assn., which wrote to lawmakers that the exemption could jeopardize student safety by opening the door for drugs on school campuses.
"One of law enforcement's top priorities is to prevent any youth under the age of 21 from accessing all types of cannabis products," the chiefs said in a statement. "While we understand some parents may choose to treat their student's illnesses with cannabis, we are opposed to allowing parents or guardians administer the drug to their student while on school grounds."
Then-Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a similar bill last year, saying it was too broad.
"Generally, I remain concerned about the exposure of marijuana on youth and am dubious of its use for youth for all ailments," Brown wrote in his 2018 veto message.
"This bill goes too far -- further than some research has -- to allow use of medical marijuana for youth. I think we should pause before going much further down this path."
Unlike Brown, Newsom was a driving force behind legalization of marijuana in California as a leading proponent of Proposition 64, the 2016 initiative approved by voters that allowed licensed growing and sales. Like most governors, Newsom has been noncommittal about bills before they reach him.
"If and when the bill reaches the governor's desk, it will be evaluated on its own merits," said Jesse Melgar, a spokesman for Newsom.
Because marijuana is still an illegal drug under federal law, there are restrictions on research involving the use of cannabis and that has limited the available scientific evidence of its medicinal value to children, state officials said.
However, in a 2017 paper published in the journal Pediatrics, researchers examined existing studies and found evidence for therapeutic uses in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy and pediatric chemotherapy-induced nausea.
State officials also noted that the Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of CBD, a non-psychoactive chemical, under the trade name Epidiolex for the treatment of certain epileptic syndromes.
Those urging the governor to sign the measure include Karina Garcia, a San Bruno mother who must take her son, JoJo, off campus every day to administer a cannabis tincture that is used to control his rare form of epilepsy. Her son graduated from high school last year but is still taking classes.
She began providing the ingestible oil to her son after pharmaceutical drugs failed to effectively stop seizures, she said. "I was watching my son die right before my eyes," she told a Senate panel during a recent hearing on the bill.
"It is not fair that this medicine that has saved my son's life [would] not be given the same treatment as other pharmaceuticals on campus," Garcia added. "My son's life and so many others depend on it."
Another parent told legislators that her son has missed 10% of class time -- thousands of minutes -- because state law requires her to take him at least 1,000 feet from his school to administer medical marijuana oil.
The measure is supported by the California School Boards Assn. "Every child is entitled to an uninterrupted education," the association said in a letter to lawmakers. The group estimated the bill could have an effect on hundreds of students in the state.
Similar laws have been adopted by eight other states: Washington, Colorado, Florida, New Jersey, Maine, Delaware, Illinois and New Mexico.
Opponents of the California bill include Kevin Sabet, president of the anti-pot group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, who called it "another gift to Big Marijuana."
"It's rife for abuse," Sabet said. He said that he is concerned students might "forge a note, and claim their high potency pot oil is 'medical.' "
Critics of California's medical marijuana law that was in place for two decades before the passage of Proposition 64 complained that getting a doctor's recommendation was easy for even relatively minor ailments, including a stiff neck and headaches.
"No one has ever been denied a recommendation," said state Sen. Andreas Borgeas (R-Modesto), who along with all but a few Republicans opposed Hill's measure.
Borgeas said he is concerned that the definition of what constitutes a legitimate medical use in the bill is too broad and that students would be able to use cannabis with just a doctor's recommendation rather than a prescription.
"I have a tough time with that," Borgeas said during the hearing. "Anybody can get a recommendation."
He asked why school nurses, rather than parents, couldn't administer the cannabis medicine. Hill told him that school districts are concerned about losing federal funding if school employees provide students with what is still an illegal drug under federal law.
State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), who supported the bill as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the federal government needs to change the law.
"Cannabis is now legal in California," she said, adding that marijuana "is not the boogeyman. It's kind of shocking we look at it that way."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Democratic National Committee said Friday it would recommend exemptions to Iowa and Nevada that would allow them to avoid new guidelines requiring caucus states to allow remote participation without attending a caucus event. The waivers avert, for now, a showdown over voting rules between the committee and early caucus states.
The proposed waivers, which are expected to be approved by the party's powerful rules and bylaws committee, come after D.N.C. leadership signaled it would block plans to allow some caucusgoers in Iowa and Nevada to vote by phone next year, bowing to security concerns about the process being hacked, according to four people with knowledge of the decision.
The committee's announcement serves as a major setback to Democrats who have long hoped to expand the caucus-state electorate beyond those voters able to attend a winter-night gathering for several hours.
"People who believe in democracy and believe that people who are working or physically challenged should be able to participate are screwed by this decision," said Larry Cohen, a D.N.C. member from Maryland who has long advocated allowing absentee participation in caucuses.
Mr. Cohen, who was a senior official on the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, said Friday that Iowa and Nevada still have time to create a system to participate in caucuses by mail.
With five months to go before Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses, it was not clear what alternatives the state's Democrats have to allow absentee participation. Troy Price, the Iowa Democratic Party chairman, said he would "explore what alternatives may exist to securely increase accessibility from previous years given the time allowed."
"Regardless of today's news, we remain confident the 2020 Iowa Caucuses will be our best yet, and set the standard for years to come," Mr. Price said.
In August 2018, D.N.C. members voted to adopt new rules for the 2020 presidential primary that encouraged states that held caucuses to switch to primaries and required caucus states to allow for a form of participation that did not require attending an event. Other reforms included reducing the power of the party's superdelegates.
The D.N.C. rules preserved Iowa's place at the front of the presidential nominating calendar, but in New Hampshire, whose state constitution requires it to hold the first presidential primary, officials are highly sensitive to Iowa's moves to alter its caucus in ways that make it appear more like a primary.
Iowa Democrats said Friday that they feared mailing absentee paper ballots for their caucus would lead the New Hampshire secretary of state, Bill Gardner, to jump his state ahead of Iowa on the presidential calendar. Mr. Gardner has sole authority to set the date of New Hampshire's primary.
The presidential campaigns had spent months training their Iowa volunteers to recruit supporters to participate in the phone caucuses. Now they must revert to how Iowa caucus campaigns have been run for generations, persuading people to attend in-person events on a cold February night.
Julian Castro, the former secretary of housing and urban development, called the decision to abandon phone caucuses "an affront to the principles of our democracy."
"As I've campaigned in every corner of Iowa, I've heard from teachers, home care workers, nurses, single parents, shift workers, and senior citizens who tell me the same thing: One night of caucusing is not enough," Mr. Castro said Friday.
Iowa Democrats, along with party officials in other states, face a Sept. 13 deadline for the D.N.C. to approve plans for their presidential primaries and caucuses. Iowa's caucuses are scheduled to be held Feb. 3.
The Iowa Democrats were proposing a plan that would have allowed voters not attending a traditional caucus to register their preference during one of six "virtual caucuses" over the phone. But D.N.C. security officials told the rules committee at a closed-door session in San Francisco last week that they had "no confidence" such a system could remain safe from hostile hackers.
The D.N.C.'s leadership concluded that the technology that exists is not secure and poses too large a risk of interference from a foreign adversary, according to officials with knowledge of the deliberations. Several presidential campaigns expressed concern to top party officials that Iowa's results could be compromised, people familiar with the discussions said Thursday.
The rules and bylaws committee has the power to approve state plans for primaries and caucuses.

The Democratic caucuses in Iowa can be hourslong affairs on often snowy winter nights. The state's caucus rules require a candidate to receive support from at least 15 percent of the voters in the room; backers of candidates who fail to meet the 15 percent threshold are then freed to choose a different candidate. This leads to haggling and horse-trading between campaigns and places a premium on being a caucusgoer's second or even third choice.
Party forces allied with Hillary Clinton have argued for years that states should shift from caucuses to primaries -- or at least make the caucus process more accessible to people who cannot attend in person.
Nine states that held Democratic presidential caucuses in 2016 -- Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, Utah and Washington -- have switched to primaries for 2020 at the urging of the D.N.C.
Six other states, including early-voting Iowa and Nevada, will continue to hold caucuses in 2020.
Mrs. Clinton, whose 2008 presidential bid was upended by her third-place finish in Iowa, and who nearly lost the state to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2016, had long been a public skeptic of Iowa's show-up-to-caucus system.
"You know, there were a lot of people who couldn't caucus tonight, despite the very large turnout," Mrs. Clinton said the night she lost the 2008 Iowa caucuses to Barack Obama. "There are a lot of people who work at night, people who are on their feet, people who are taking care of patients in a hospital, or waiting on a table in a restaurant, or maybe in a patrol car keeping our streets safe."
A February poll from The Des Moines Register found that a virtual caucus could increase participation by a third. The Monmouth University Polling Institute found earlier this month that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. increased his polling advantage in the state when the survey included Iowa Democrats who planned to participate in the virtual caucus.
Democrats of all stripes remain shellshocked by Russian hacking that colored the 2016 election, which included the wide release of Clinton campaign emails and D.N.C. documents.

Texto completo: FORT KENT, Maine -- In what was a tightly contested match on a scorching 80-plus-degree afternoon in late August, the Husson Eagles secured a victory over the University of Maine at Fort Kent Bengals 1-0. According to Fletcher Brown, UMFK sports information representative, the Bengals had a great scoring opportunity early with Tolu Oyeniyi slipping past the defense in the first few minutes however it proved unsuccessful. The Eagles were able to score late in the first half off of a penalty kick after Alyssa Driscoll was fouled in the box.Throughout the second half, the Bengals had many chances to score off of corner kick action but were never able to send one home past the Eagle defense. Both goal keepers proved their value to their respective teams as Eagle keeper Shie Smith and Bengal keeper Olexia Mitchell each made multiple acrobatic diving saves throughout the entire 90 minutes.

Texto completo: CARIBOU, Maine -- The Aroostook Agency on Aging and Cary Medical Center are teaming up to provide a new 6-week series of the Savvy Caregiver program, beginning on Wednesday, Sept. 4 and Saturday, Sept. 7.
Designed for individuals who are caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease or other form of dementia in their home, the session will take place at two separate times, from 1 to 3 p.m. on Wednesday and from 12 to 2 p.m. on Saturday, in the Chan Center at Cary. The programs are free.
Caring for someone with Alzheimer's can be one of the most stressful caregiving situations, often impacting the health of the caregiver. The Savvy Caregiver program is an evidence based and researched program that has been shown to improve both the quality of caregiving and the quality of life for the caregiver.
Sharon Berz, Director of Long Term Care for the Aroostook Agency on Aging and who instructs the course, said the six-week program can really be a game changer.
"Our caregivers are some of the most courageous, compassionate people in the world," said Berz who works with hundreds of seniors throughout The County. "But the challenges they face in meeting the needs of loved ones with Alzheimer's or other dementia can be daunting. This Savvy Caregiver Training offers so many tips, and different approaches to caregiving that can be of great help to family members."
The Savvy Caregiver is a 12-hour training program delivered in two-hour sessions over a six-week period. In evaluations from the original study and the program versions, participants report increased caregiver skill, knowledge and confidence. Results also indicate better caregiver wellbeing.
Bill Flagg, director of community relations and development at Cary, said the hospital recognizes the need for such training and is grateful to have the opportunity to collaborate with the Aroostook Agency on Aging.
"The number of families coping with Alzheimer's here in Aroostook County is on the rise," said Flagg, who also facilitates an Alzheimer's Caregiver Support Group.
"I have learned from our support group about the many challenges caregiver face and how important it is for them to share ideas and how they can learn from each other, The Savvy Caregiver program has a lot of research behind it and we hope that families will take the opportunity to attend the training sessions," Flagg said.
The program requires pre-registration. Individual interested should call the Aroostook Agency on Aging at 207-764-3396.

Texto completo: Maine's new fish and wildlife boss, Judy Camuso, who has been at the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife helm since January, shared her views recently as a guest on my Sunday night statewide radio program Maine Outdoors (103.9, 101.3 and 95.1 FM).
Throughout the interview her unbridled enthusiasm for her new job, as well as her resolve to be a leader who listens, came through loud and clear. "I love this job!" she exclaimed. The former wildlife director for MDIF&W, Camuso believes that she has "the best job in the world" and speaks with pride about the "professionals" who make up the Department.
What are her priorities? Aware that hunting in Maine and the decline of non-resident deer hunters needs to be turned around, she hopes to address this through aggressive marketing and sound whitetail management.
"If the anti-bear hunting element from out of state makes another attempt to ban bear trapping and hunting with hounds," I asked, "will you stand behind our trappers and houndsmen?"
Camuso was unequivocal in her answer. She said that managing growing bear populations makes it imperative to support any type of legal bear harvesting, including trapping and hunting with dogs.
She believes that the essence of her leadership role is putting the right people in the right jobs and standing behind them. Along with this, she emphasized that "good leaders listen" and she plans on making public contact as much as her job will allow.
From one listener who called in on the show, the commissioner did take some heat when it came to a longtime complaint: complicated fishing regulations. She indicated that there is more that can be done to simplify fishing regs, but that careful pond-by-pond management of Maine's sport fishery has led to improved fishing in the past few years.
Anyone who has ever served as commissioner of the MDIF&W will most likely tell you that it's anything but dull. As a matter of fact, just about anyone who has worked for MDIF&W in the same building within earshot of the commissioner's top floor office will attest that there is a burden to bear for those for whom the buck stops at the Augusta fish and wildlife department.
Sportsmen and women and the organizations that represent them, as a rule, tend to know best how to manage deer populations, regulate the state's sport fishery, or control coyotes. And they are not timid about expressing their views to any sitting fish and wildlife commissioner.
Suffice to say that any commissioner, worth his or her salt, has to walk a tightrope trying to accommodate diverse constituencies while at the same time making hard choices, even when those choices aren't always popular.
Historically, just about every Maine fish and wildlife commissioner has enjoyed the luxury of a so-called "honeymoon period" when new to the job. The duration of this varies but generally comes to a screeching halt when the first big hunting or fishing controversy rises to the fore.
It looks like Maine's first female fish and wildlife leader is up to the challenge and formulating her own management style. As she well knows, Maine sportsmen are tuned in, and will be in the months and years ahead.

Texto completo: Editorial: Misguided rule change puts women's health at risk
The Trump wrecking ball continues. Telling physicians and medical staff what they can and cannot discuss with patients? That is supposed to make America free again?
-- pizanos
In this day and age of low cost/free birth control, there is absolutely no reason for (nearly) 1 million babies to be aborted each year in the United States. Some time in the future people will look back at the wholesale slaughter of babies and wonder how cold and heartless we were. Kudos to President Trump for slowing access to a procedure that should be rarely contemplated.
-- Greenie
Ignores the value of women's health and family planning provided by Planned Parenthood and similar organizations including reduction in abortions. They provide the low cost/free services that are cited in this screed. Continued ignoring of these facts and continuing to preach this way is dishonest.

Story: Monarch butterflies are making a comeback, and thousands have taken over this Maine farm
Great story! My only comment is to clarify that the Western Monarch, which does not follow the same migration path as those in the east, is not yet rallying and faces actual extinction. According to the Xerxes Society website, "In the west, the news is more dire. Monarchs have experienced a decline of 99.4 percent in coastal California, from an estimated 4.5 million in the 1980s to 28,429 as of January 2019." From what I have read, the marker for an indication of imminent extinction was 30,000. This is heartbreaking and shamefully sad -- there is no excuse for extinction. Keeping anyone interested in saving the monarchs fully informed about both the Eastern & Western Monarchs should help keep the efforts going and of course planting native milkweed, eradicating pesticides and keeping yourself informed can ensure future generations of Monarchs will be for our own future generations. Thank you again for the inspiring article and for providing space for comments!

Texto completo: Difficulty: Easy. The trail is about 0.7 mile long and travels over fairly even terrain. The most challenging part of the hike is staying on trail because the blue blazes that mark it are spaced far apart in some areas. Also, near the field, the trail can become a bit overgrown.
How to get there: From Route 201 in Vassalboro, drive east on the Webber Pond Road for 1 mile, then turn right onto Hannaford Hill Road. Drive 2.1 miles, then turn left onto Cross Hill Road. Drive 1.6 miles, then turn right onto Seawards Mills Road. Drive about 0.2 mile and the sign marking the trailhead is across the field on your right, at the edge of the woods. Park on the side of the road, well out of the way of traffic. Do not park in field entrances (what looks like a pull out or the beginning of a driveway).
Information: The 44-acre Seaward Mills Stream Conservation Area was donated to the Kennebec Land Trust by Elizabeth Cole, a longtime Vassalboro resident, in June 2011. The land features a mixed deciduous forest, a stand of mature hemlocks, 3,800 feet of frontage on the historic Seawards Mills Stream and 15 acres of agricultural fields, which are leased to a local farmer.
A 0.7-mile trail explores the forested part of the property and travels close to the banks of the stream much of the way. Starting at the edge of a field, the trail travels gradually downhill through a mostly deciduous forest to the edge of the stream. Just before reaching the water, the trail takes a sharp left and strikes east, weaving through the forest.
The traditional hiking path, the trail is narrow and travels over unimproved forest floor that includes plenty of exposed tree roots. Watch your footing. At about the halfway point on the trail, two benches are located at scenic spots on the stream less than 0.1 mile apart.
The most common forest on the property is aspen-birch, according to Kennebec Land Trust. But you'll also notice several large oak trees on the property, which are especially vibrant in the fall. There's also a sugar maple forest, and as you hike east, the forest transitions into a mature hemlock stand. Also, along the stream, you can find patches of bluejoint, a type of tall, long-lived grass that serves as food and cover for certain animals, including deer, muskrats and moose.
Flowing through the property from east to west, Seaward Mills Stream is just under 3 miles long, starting at its outlet on Threemile Pond (at 180 feet above sea level) to Webber Pond (at 120 feet above sea level). The stream was named after of Seaward family (which has also been spelled "Seawards," "Sowards" or "Seward" by different sources). The family built a house on Webber Pond in the late 1700s and developed a mill at the stream's inlet, according to Kennebec Land Trust. Also, during the late 18th and 19th centuries, the stream was home to a grist mill, saw mills and a hub mill.
Today, the stream serves as an important waterway for alewives, a species of fish that swims from the ocean up rivers and streams in the spring to spawn. Because the trail is located between a field and a waterway, it's an excellent place to spot wildlife, including a wide variety of songbirds and waterfowl, as well as deer and moose.
The property is open to the public for hiking, nature observation, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and hunting. Motorized vehicles are not permitted. Dogs should be under voice command or on a leash; and dog waste should be bagged and carried out. For more information, visit tklt.org or call 207-377-2848.
Personal note: A work assignment led me to central Maine on April 25, a sunny day with temperatures in the low 50s and a brisk breeze. Having escaped the office, I decided to prolong my freedom with a hike at Seaward Mills Stream Conservation Area.
I drove past the trailhead at first. It doesn't exactly jump out at you. You have to follow the driving directions exactly and know where to look for it across the field. But once you spot it, it seems obvious and is marked with a large wooden sign.
From the trailhead, I followed the blue blazes painted on trees to the stream's edge, then became confused about which way the trail turned and had to refer to the trail map provided on the KLT website. Once I confirmed that the trail turned east, I found the blazes again, but I lost them a couple more times throughout the hike. In some areas, they're spaced just a little too far apart. In addition, hiking trails can be more difficult to follow in the fall and spring when the previous year's fallen leaves coat the forest floor and hikers have yet wear down the path. Fortunately this trail follows the stream for most of the way, so if you lose it for a bit, it's not a big deal.
Because I'd been in town to conduct an interview, I didn't have my dog, Oreo, with me. So while walking the trail, I took the opportunity to slow down and take more photos than I would have if walking Oreo (who always wants to go, go, go). This slow pace resulted in me finding a variety of interesting mushrooms, including large, saucer-shaped white mushrooms growing on the trunk of a birch tree and clusters of dark brown jelly mushroom, which looks and feels like globs of Jello. I also found a beautiful mass of what I believe to be turkey tail mushrooms, which grow in layers and are the general shape of a fanned out turkey tail. This type of fungi displays bands of different colors -- in this case, green, blue and purple, as well as grey, white and tinges of yellow-orange.
Other highlights of my hike included the sound of the rushing water of Seaward Mills Stream, the curly shapes of unfurling ferns, and piles of deer and moose poop scattered along the trail. In addition, I noticed a few wooden signs displaying the latin names of various trees and the general shape of their leaves. I imagine it's a beautiful place to be in the fall, when the leaves of the many aspen, oak and maple trees on the property turn vibrant colors.

Texto completo: DOVER, N.H. — A man accused of being married to four women pleaded guilty Monday to bigamy in New Hampshire, but he will avoid jail time if he remains on good behavior for the next five years.
Michael Middleton, 43, married a Georgia woman in 2006, an Alabama woman in 2011 and a New Hampshire woman in 2013.
That led to the bigamy charge in New Hampshire, but according to court documents, he also married a fourth woman in Kentucky in 2016.
Prosecutors say he used the marriages to gain access to the women’s assets.
In court Monday, Assistant Strafford County Attorney David Rotman read a statement from Middleton’s New Hampshire wife, Alicia Grant, who blamed Middleton for her transformation from a compassionate person to someone with a “not-my-problem” attitude.
She said she was “satisfied” that he was facing consequences for his actions.
“When we got married six years ago, what I thought I had found in him was a life partner, someone that I could face life’s ups and downs with, someone my children could look up to,” Grant wrote. “Instead I got six years of pain and misery as I tried to free myself from the prison of his lies and manipulations.”
Middleton was arrested in Ohio in February. He also has faced domestic violence charges in Maine.
As part of his 12-month suspended sentence, Middleton was ordered to undergo screenings for domestic abuse and substance abuse, and comply with any recommended counseling or programs. Neither he nor his attorney spoke at the hearing other than to answer brief questions from the judge.
After the hearing, Middleton was asked if he was sorry for his actions.
He told reporters he felt “compassion and understanding” for his New Hampshire wife, Grant, after hearing her letter.
“It was a good outcome,” he said. “I hope to move forward with my life and everything, and abide by everything that was handed down to me.”

Early release bid on hold for N.H. man

Texto completo: ■ EARLY RELEASE ON HOLD A New Hampshire man's bid to win early release from prison where he is serving time for the 2001 murders of Dartmouth College professors Susanne and Half Zantop was put on hold Monday after a defense witness fell ill, according to court papers. James Parker was originally scheduled to appear in New Hampshire's Grafton Superior Court Tuesday for a hearing on a motion to suspend his sentence of 25 years to life and release him from the New Hampshire State Prison for Men in Concord. But a defense witness has fallen ill and both New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Strelzin and Parker defense attorney Cathy Green alerted court officials they cannot proceed without the witness's testimony. A new date for the hearing was not immediately available Monday. Green contends that while spending more than half his life behind bars, Parker has been a model prisoner, rehabilitated himself, and earned another shot at life. If released, he initially would live with his parents and take a construction job with his father, a contractor. But prosecutors contend the killings of Susanne Zantop, 55, chairwoman of Dartmouth's German studies program, and Half Zantop, 62, a Dartmouth professor of earth sciences, were brutal and premeditated, and because Parker was given the minimum sentence, he should serve out his term. “The Zantops were not killed in self-defense or in the heat of the moment," Strelzin wrote in an objection in November. “Instead, their deaths were the result of months of detailed criminal planning that included the purchase of weapons and failed attempts to rob and kill others." Parker became eligible to seek early release in 2017, after serving two-thirds of his sentence. If a judge rejects his petition, he cannot be released before May 2024.
■ SENTENCING SET FOR FORMER PRIEST The delayed sentencing of a defrocked Massachusetts priest convicted of sexually abusing an altar boy has been scheduled. Officials at York County Superior Court in Maine say 76-year-old Ronald Paquin will be sentenced on May 24. Two men testified they were altar boys when he invited them on trips in the 1980s and assaulted them repeatedly. The jury returned guilty verdicts on 11 of 24 gross sexual misconduct charges, involving one of the men. Paquin had been slated for sentencing in early March, but his attorney filed a motion requesting a mental health evaluation. He spent more than a decade in a Massachusetts prison for sexually abusing another altar boy in that state and was released in 2015 before being taken into custody in Maine. (AP)
■ GUILTY PLEA A man accused of being married to four women has pleaded guilty to bigamy in New Hampshire but will avoid jail time if he behaves for the next five years. Authorities allege that 43-year-old Michael Middleton married women in Georgia, Alabama, and New Hampshire between 2006 and 2013. That led to the bigamy charge in New Hampshire, but court documents say he also married a fourth woman in Kentucky in 2016. In court Monday a prosecutor read a statement from the New Hampshire victim, Alicia Grant, who said she thought she was gaining a life partner but ended up with six years of pain and misery.

Bill would create safe drinking water guide
Aiming to protect public health and the state's waterways, the Vermont Legislature has passed a measure that would create a drinking water standard for a class of toxic chemicals and require by year's end that public water systems monitor for the so-called PFAs. The Senate on Friday concurred with a House amendment to the legislation. When asked if he would sign it, Republican Governor Phil Scott said: "I think we're getting very close on that." The perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances are used in products like nonstick cookware, carpets, firefighting foam, and fast-food wrappers and have been linked to health threats ranging from cancer to decreased fertility. More than a dozen states are considering legislation related to the industrial compounds, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In Vermont, PFOA has been found around two former ChemFab factories in the Bennington area. 'These substances can be toxic to humans in extremely small concentrations and unfortunately have been found in public and private water supplies in Vermont," said Representative Amy Sheldon, chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, Fish, and Wildlife, when the bill passed the full House. "This bill establishes regulatory monitoring of Vermont drinking waters to ensure that Vermonters remain safe and manufacturers are held accountable for their waste." The agency has a maximum contamination level for groundwater but not for drinking water. The Vermont Health Department's advisory level for PFAS in drinking water is not to exceed 20 parts per trillion. (AP)

Fishing restrictions aim to protect right whales
Fishing managers on the East Coast are beginning the daunting process of implementing new restrictions on lobster fishing that are designed to protect a vanishing species of whale. A team organization by the federal government recommended last week that the number of vertical trap lines in the water be reduced by about half. The lines can entrap and drown the North Atlantic right whale, which number a little more than 400 and have declined by dozens this decade. The interstate Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission met on Monday near Washington to discuss the implementation of the new rules, which are designed to reduce serious injuries and deaths for whales by 60 percent. Colleen Coogan coordinates the federal government team designed to protect the whales. She says cooperating with Canadian authorities is going to be very important. (AP)

Bill would mandate students study genocide
A bill to require students to learn about acts of genocide, including the Holocaust, is moving through Maine's Legislature. Democratic Senator Louie Luchini said a legislative committee initially voted 5-4 Monday on the legislation, which now faces House and Senate votes. Luchini originally proposed requiring Maine to join the less than a quarter of states that mandate Holocaust education. The committee voted favoring an amended bill to require public and private school students to learn about genocide, including the Holocaust. Luchini said he supports Republican Representative Justin Fecteau's proposal. The bill was recommended by Ellsworth High School's Heidi Omlor, who teaches a Holocaust course. US Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, reintroduced a bill that would authorize Holocaust education grants from the US Department of Education. (AP)

Some political ideas are gutter balls

Texto completo: Not all ideas in the Democrat presidential primary are strikes out here in the hinterlands. Candidates try to "out progressive each other, which only highlights the outlandish. It's like they're rolling gutter balls. Take these proposals, for instance.
Prisoners voting:
According to an article from PolitiFact, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said, "all prisoners - including terrible people,' like the Boston Marathon bomber - should be allowed to vote. He said people serving time, no matter how serious their offense, deserve enfranchisement.
Sanders' home state of Vermont, and neighboring Maine, have long allowed prisoners to vote while incarcerated. A measure to permit the same failed in Connecticut, but bills to do so are active in Louisiana, Massachusetts and New Jersey.
It won't get traction here. Why? Numbers.
The National Institute of Corrections (Department of Justice) lists West Virginia with a prison population of 7,118 in 2015, with another 4,027 in jails or adult correctional facilities in 2013. That's 11,145, or 0.6 percent, of about 1.8 million residents. Add to that the 7,008 adults on probation and the 3,123 on parole, and we're still only up to 21,276, or 1.2 percent, and not all of them would be affected.
Besides, only 57 percent of those eligible to vote did so in 2016. So, I don't know how enthusiastic prisoners would be.
Gutter ball, in my view.
Popular vote for president:
Presidential hopefuls Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg are behind a proposal to eliminate the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote for president. Additionally, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is "open to the discussion.
This is another gutter ball here (I've written about it twice this year). Why? It would lessen West Virginia's influence and would require a constitutional amendment to change (two-thirds vote in House and Senate; then ratification by three-fourths of the states).
So, I'm with longshot Democrat presidential candidate and former Rep. John Delaney, D-Md, when he dismisses it as a waste of time.
Attacks on old white men:
West Virginia Democrats should shy away from any attacks on "old white men. Why? With a median age of 41.9 years, we have the oldest population in the country, according to World Population Review. Also, 49.4 percent of us are male; and 93.4 percent of us are white. So, attacking "old white men is no way to win friends and influence people in West Virginia.
Green New Deal:
While not presidential candidates, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., lurched the Democratic presidential debate to the left with the Green New Deal.
Democrats say the ideas are something to aspire to. Republicans say they're socialism. I say they needlessly burn debate time.
For instance, it proposes to cure social inequities by, "guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States. Nice concept, until someone does the math.
There's no official cost estimate, but opponent Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, quoted $93 trillion based on a right-leaning-think-tank study, rated by PolitiFact as false. The study authors even said $50 trillion to $90 trillion would be more descriptive.
So, let's use the lower $50 trillion estimate, and then cut that in half to $25 trillion. Maybe not the best estimate, but we'll circle back when there's a more serious one.
Now compare that $25 trillion to our current national debt of $22 trillion, which already grew $1.3 trillion in 2018.
So, potentially the Green New Deal could double our national debt? Gutter ball.
These are all ideas. They're just not good ones. Why aren't they good? Because time wasted debating these gutter balls will be that much less time spent debating real issues.
Like what? I say the fact that our national debt increased $1.3 trillion in 2018 alone, during a "great economy, is a much bigger one.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- The two Presque Isle boys who were taken out of state in a custody dispute were located safe in North Carolina and their father arrested on Tuesday, according to the Presque Isle Police Department.
In late April, local police asked for the public's help in a case that had been under investigation for several weeks. Joel Strother, 40, who has resided in the Madawaska area, allegedly took his sons Joel II, 12, and Carter III, 10, out of state against their will and against the wishes of their mother, who lives in the Presque Isle area.
"He has violated the custody agreement," Presque Isle Police Detective Chris Beck said earlier. "He has basically hidden the children. There has been no communication from Mr. Strother or from the two children to their mother."
Police believed Strother left Maine with the boys heading toward the southern United States.
On Tuesday, Presque Isle police said that Strother was arrested in North Carolina and the boys were located safe.
The multi-state police search for the Strothers ended after a tip from a member of the public, police said.
A felony arrest warrant had been issued for Strother's arrest. He now faces a Class B felony charge of criminal restraint by a parent and is currently being held in Macon County, North Carolina, where he is awaiting transportation back to Maine. Beck said that arrangements are being made to bring the boys back to Maine.

Texto completo: ELLSWORTH, Maine -- The former Ticonic 4 firehouse building is no more.
Webber Group, the building's owner, demolished the old firehouse on Friday, City Manager David Cole said. The city had issued a permit for the razing in August.
The demolition brings to an end a long-running dispute over the building, which a group of residents had tried to save, claiming that the firehouse had historic value. The building dates back to the 1800s, but had fallen into some disrepair. Webber Group bought it from the city 13 years ago for $5,000.
[image id="2804514" size="full" pos="center" /]
Judy Blood, who lives next door to the building, challenged the city's demolition permit for the structure before the city's Board of Appeals. But after the city resolved questions about whether the board even had authority to take up the appeal, the panel denied Blood's challenge in a 6-0 vote in February.
Blood contended that the city sold the property to Webber Group in 2005 for $5,000 with the understanding that Webber would seek city permission for any change in use for the firehouse building, which would include tearing it down. However, the property deed contained no such restrictions, limiting the Board of Appeals' authority to revoke the demolition permit, the board's chairman said at the time of the vote.
Blood did not immediately respond to a social media request for comment Tuesday.
Webber postponed the building's demolition several times during the challenge.
The property is now for sale.

Texto completo: CARIBOU, Maine -- The Cat Coalition of Western Maine's Mobile Spay Unit, sponsored by a grant from Marion's Dream, will arrive in Caribou the evening of Thursday, May 2, for a three-day cat spay and neuter clinic.
The event will take place at the 2nd Chance Thrift Store at 31 Herschel St. in Caribou on Friday, May 3, Saturday, May 4 and Sunday, May 5.
The Halfway Home Pet Rescue has supervised local arrangements for the event. According to Norma Milton, HHPR president, the clinic aims to spay/neuter close to 200 cats belonging to low-income families within Caribou and the surrounding communities.
There is no charge for this service, which includes the surgery, rabies vaccination, ear cleaning, ear mite treatment, nail trimming and parasite treatment. Donation containers will be available at the clinic.
Although all spaces are full for this session, interested pet owners can make arrangements for an upcoming clinic in June.
Milton advised pet owners can help curb the overpopulation of cats in Aroostook County by supporting these free spay/neuter clinics.
For more information, call 310-3011 or email ccowm@yahoo.com.

Maine Senate endorses ban on Native American school mascots

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- The Maine Senate voted Tuesday to ban the use of Native American names, imagery and mascots in public schools, putting the state on track to pass a bill to do so after a long local controversy over the Skowhegan "Indians" nickname.
The Democratic-led chamber voted 23-10 to back the bill from Rep. Ben Collings, D-Portland; the bill initially passed the House of Representatives last week. It faces further action in both chambers. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has stopped short of backing the bill, but she wrote a letter in December urging Skowhegan to drop the name.
All Democrats present and four Republicans -- Minority Leader Dana Dow of Waldoboro and Sens. Marianne Moore of Calais, David Woodsome of North Waterboro and Kim Rosen of Bucksport -- voted for it on Tuesday.
The bill would bar public schools and higher education institutions from having names, symbols or images referring to Native Americans as a mascot, team nickname or logo. The push was led by the Penobscot Nation and supported by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine.
It was motivated by Skowhegan Area High School, the last Maine school to retain Native American imagery as part of its nickname. After years of debate, the school board voted in March to get rid of it and has since turned back a bid from opponents of that move to hold a non-binding referendum on the issue.
Two alumni of the school voiced different sides of the issue Tuesday on the Senate floor. Senate Majority Leader Nate Libby, D-Lewiston, voted for it citing the 1724 massacre of a band of Abenaki people who inhabited the Skowhegan area at the hands of British troops. Sen. Brad Farrin, R-Norridgewock, opposed it and called it a local control issue.
While the Mills administration has urged schools not to use Native American mascots and applauded the Skowhegan school board's move to drop the mascot, the Maine Department of Education has said it supports the right of school boards to make these types of decisions.
At a news conference on climate change legislation on Tuesday, Mills didn't answer a question on whether she would sign the bill, saying it was off topic.

2 electric vehicle charging stations open to the public at Cross Insurance Center

Texto completo: Those arriving at the Cross Insurance Center by electric car will now have a free way to charge their vehicles for the drive home.
On Tuesday, the Bangor venue unveiled two new electric vehicle charging stations in the southwest parking lot near Bass Park Boulevard that are free for members of the public to use. Even if drivers are not attending an event, they can still use the charging station, according to Blake Henry, general manager of the venue.
The Cross Insurance Center paid for the installation of the stations in partnership with the city of Bangor and Emera Maine, which is one of the venue's sponsors.
Besides offering convenience to Bangor-area residents who drive electric cars, the new resource also "is a signal that Bangor is an environmentally friendly community," City Councilor Ben Sprague said during the unveiling.
Emera Maine representatives also demonstrated how to use the charger on a white Chevrolet Bolt, a fully electric car that can drive more than 200 miles on a single charge, that they had driven to the Cross Insurance Center.
The new charging stations are classified as Level 2, meaning they use a 240-volt power source and can charge more quickly than those classified as the lower Level 1, but are still not the most powerful chargers on the market, according to Consumer Reports.
There are a couple other charging stations in the Bangor area, including another Level 2 station at Darling's Nissan in Bangor and a Tesla Supercharger at the Ruby Tuesday in Brewer, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
The opening of the new stations at the Cross Insurance Center comes as the number of Maine residents driving electric vehicles more than doubled between 2014 and 2018 as the technology has become more functional and affordable, according to a recent survey from the Natural Resources Council of Maine. More than 1,300 Mainers owned them in 2018.
But they still account for just a small share of the vehicles that Mainers drive, with the 799 that were sold in Maine last year making up just 1.8 percent of all vehicles sold in 2018, according to data compiled by Alliance of Auto Manufacturers
[More Mainers driving electric cars, but many not sold on going gas-free]
The unveiling also comes as Gov. Janet Mills and the Efficiency Maine Trust have announced that at least 50 new public vehicle charging stations will be installed in Maine as part of an effort to move the state to clean transportation.
That project, which will also include initiatives to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles, is being partly funded with a $5.1 million settlement that Maine reached with Volkswagen for its violation of state environmental laws.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- A bill that could make Maine the first state to reinstate internet privacy rules similar to those nixed by a Republican-led Congress in 2017 was endorsed by a legislative committee on Tuesday in a move that bodes well for its passage.
The bill from Sen. Shenna Bellows, D-Manchester, would prohibit internet service providers operating in Maine from using or selling access to personal information of customers unless the customer consents to it. A similar bill failed to pass last year by one vote in the Senate.
That chamber was Republican-led at the time, but the Maine Legislature is now led by Democrats. Bellows' bill has a bipartisan list of co-sponsors and was endorsed on Tuesday in an 8-1 vote of the Legislature's energy panel. It will now go to the chambers for votes.
Nevada and Minnesota have long-standing laws making internet service providers keep certain information private without consent, but Maine's would be the most ambitious law passed after Congress' 2017 move to repeal privacy rules enshrined under former Democratic President Barack Obama.
Those rules would have required customers' consent before using personal information to target advertisements to them, but they never took effect after President Donald Trump signed the repeal into law. Maine's two senators -- Republican Susan Collins and Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats -- split on the change. Collins voted with her party.
Repeal proponents said the rules were an economically harmful overreach, while opponents including the American Civil Liberties Union and the digital-rights Electronic Frontier Foundation argued that the highly personal information should be regulated.
The push for the Maine bill was led by the ACLU of Maine -- which Bellows once ran -- and it was backed by Attorney General Aaron Frey, a Democrat, and GWI, the Biddeford-based Internet service provider. It was opposed by national trade groups for the wireless communications and broadband industries and the Maine State Chamber of Commerce.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- A superior court justice on Tuesday found 44-year-old Shawna Gatto guilty of depraved indifference murder in the Dec. 8, 2017, death of 4-year-old Kendall Chick at their Wiscasset home.
Superior Court Justice William Stokes delivered his verdict just before 2 p.m. at the Capitol Judicial Center, where less than a month ago he presided over Gatto's bench trial.
Stokes described the abuse inflicted by Gatto as "outrageous, revolting, shocking and brutal," and said "such conduct can only be described as torture."
Stokes said Gatto's insistence that Chick injured herself was "inherently incredible" and "utterly unworthy of belief."
Chick was the granddaughter of Gatto's fiance, Stephen Hood. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services removed Chick from her mother's custody and placed her with Gatto and Hood three years before her death.
[image id="2804603" size="full" pos="center" /]
Chick's death and that of 10-year-old Marissa Kennedy three months later prompted legislative investigations into their deaths, a state investigation into the child welfare system, changes to the system by lawmakers and a contracted report from the department.
Gatto pleaded not guilty to the crime and waived her right to a jury trial.
During the weeklong trial, experts from the Maine State Police crime lab testified that Chick's DNA and what they surmised to be her blood stains had been found throughout the Wiscasset home, and the state's medical examiner testified that Chick died from blunt force trauma to her head, a "catastrophic" traumatic injury to her abdomen and chronic "child abuse syndrome," or multiple injuries to many parts of her body over time.
Prosecutors played recorded interviews with Gatto in which she described Chick as "very accident-prone" and said she "wondered a few times if she could feel pain because she never cried."
Hood, who testified for the prosecution, told the court that he saw bruises and other injuries on his granddaughter throughout her life. He added that when he questioned Gatto about them, she said the child "would be fine."
But Gatto's defense attorneys, Jeremy Pratt and Philip Cohen, said too much remains unknown about Chick's death to convict Gatto, and then focused on Hood as a potential alternative suspect in the murder.
[image id="2804602" size="full" pos="center" /]
Stokes said Tuesday that whether Hood knew or should have known what was happening to Chick is not a matter for him to decide.
"The external injuries are certainly consistent with a child who has been slapped, pushed, slammed, grabbed, twisted, pinched and, perhaps, kicked," Stokes said Tuesday. He said Gatto knew her explanation that Chick was accident-prone and injured herself was "preposterous."
Gatto did not take the stand in her own defense.
Stokes set sentencing for June 25 in Wiscasset Superior Court. Gatto could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
Following the verdict, Assistant Attorney General John Alsop, who with Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber prosecuted the case, said the facts in the "very horrific case" demanded the verdict that was rendered.
"This is the first step of justice for Kendall," Macomber said.
Alsop said prosecutors will ask for a severe sentence.
He said prosecutors will discuss whether to file charges against Hood.
Cohen, the defense attorney, said he was disappointed in the verdict but would have to respect the court's decision. He said attorneys will appeal the decision.

Thomaston residents say they would rather pay higher taxes than lose police department

Texto completo: THOMASTON, Maine -- Voters in Thomaston will head to the polls in June to decide whether to dissolve their local police department, which like other departments across the country has struggled to retain police officers in recent years.
While it would be cheaper for the town to dissolve the department and rely on the Knox County Sheriff's Office for coverage, residents at a Monday night meeting on the issue gave resounding support to keeping the Thomaston Police Department open, even if it means higher taxes.
"I just really feel strongly that our hometown police department is [what's] best for us," Bill Watson said. "If people are only interested in taxes, well I think perhaps you're in the wrong town."
While the department has struggled for years to retain police officers, the staffing problem has reached a critical point within the past year.
Thomaston police Chief Tim Hoppe is the only full-time officer with the department. Hoppe, one part-time officer, a reserve officer and support two days a week from the sheriff's office patch together police coverage for the town of about 2,800 residents.
But it's not sustainable solution.
Hoppe has advocated for the town to again offer health insurance that would extend to an officer's family. He said while adding family benefits wouldn't be a cure-all, it would help entice and retain more officers than their current employee-only health plan does.
It would cost the town between $570,000 to $620,000 to maintain a five-person police department and add family health benefits, according to figures presented Monday night by Town Manager Val Blastow.
To have four dedicated sheriff's office deputies cover Thomaston, it would cost about $450,000, according to Blastow's presentation.
Comments from some of the more than 100 residents who turned out Monday night made it clear that folks are willing to pay more to maintain a local police department.
"We're losing the fabric of the town of Thomaston by solely [looking at] the statistical analysis of what it would cost to maintain Thomaston PD and what it would cost to go to the sheriff's office," John Fochtman said. "As a taxpayer, I think we should maintain what we have right now. Yes, it may be a little bit more [money], but the benefits are there."
Not a single person at the meeting spoke in favor of dissolving the local police department. Being able to maintain close relationships formed with Hoppe and his officers was one of the most common reasons cited for keeping the department open.
Nearly every person who spoke had a personal anecdote about a positive interaction they had with Hoppe or the department, even if it was something as small as the officers giving out candy on Halloween.
Those in favor of keeping the Thomaston Police Department worried it would take awhile for these types of relationships to be formed with new deputies from the sheriff's office.
"You can't pick that up overnight," Fochtman said.
Knox County Sheriff Tim Carroll said that if his office took over coverage, he would try to mimic the community policing practices that Hoppe has put into place.
Other residents said that having an established police department draws people to the community.
Susan Hoekstra, who moved to town three years ago, said she settled in Thomaston and opened her bookstore in part because the town had its own police force, with additional coverage from the Knox County Sheriff's Office.
Having moved to town from an area of Texas with a high crime rate, Hoekstra said it took her some time to "relax and realize this is a wonderful, safe community," which she credits the Thomaston Police Department for maintaining.
"I think that when we look at budgets, sometimes we get wrapped up in numbers," Hoekstra said. "I think that what we're paying for is a way of life and the security of knowing that local police are available when we need it."
Hoppe, who has been with the Thomaston Police Department since 2001, said he has fielded other job offers, but he doesn't see himself as a police officer anywhere else.
"If you choose to keep us, I will rebuild this department," Hoppe said. "I am confident I will get the officers that the town of Thomaston wants to see, not just officers who are coming in to get a paycheck."

Maine will provide records on Long Creek suicide attempts to advocacy group

Texto completo: The Maine Department of Corrections has agreed to turn over records pertaining to suicide attempts at the Long Creek Youth Development Center to an advocacy group for people with disabilities.
Disability Rights Maine, the state's officially designated advocate for people with disabilities, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court last year alleging that the state was violating federal law by refusing the group access to the facility's records of suicide attempts.
When the suit was filed, Republican Gov. Paul LePage was in office. Since then, Democrat Janet Mills has become governor, and her administration -- including Corrections Commissioner Randall Liberty -- have assumed oversight of the department.
The lawsuit further argued the failure to turn over the records was obstructing an investigation by the group into "evidence of a facility-wide failure to provide youth with disabilities with programs and services that are required by law," according to the lawsuit.
As part of a consent judgment filed in U.S. District Court in Bangor on Tuesday, the department has agreed to provide the records to Disability Rights Maine, as long as the group has a signed information release from former Long Creek residents -- if they are older than 18 -- or a parent or guardian, according to court documents.
"[This agreement] is important because it allows us to do the work that we are mandated and authorized to do, which is to protect and advocate for the rights of people with disabilities, including kids with disabilities at Long Creek," said Jeff Skakalski, a staff attorney with Disability Rights Maine.
The agreement between Disability Rights Maine and the DOC comes in the wake of recent tumultuous years for Long Creek, the state's only youth correctional facility. After the suicide of an inmate in 2016, as well as a reported pattern of abuse and self-harm within the youth prison, there have been repeated calls for reform at the facility -- or for its outright closure.
In 2017, an independent review of Long Creek found that the facility's low staffing levels and high population of inmates with mental illness was creating a dangerous environment.
Disability Rights Maine is conducting its own investigation into whether the facility is providing inmates with disabilities -- including mental illness -- access to legally required programming and services.
Between March and July 2018, according to the lawsuit, Disability Rights Maine received numerous complaints about treatment of inmates at Long Creek, including at least five separate cases that allegedly led to suicide attempts.
The group requested records related to the alleged suicide attempts at Long Creek but was either denied accesss to the records or given records that were heavily redacted. As a result, the investigation was put on hold.
"We have had to put our investigation on hold because we weren't able to get the records and the information that we were requesting pursuant to the investigation," Skakalski said.
With the lawsuit settled, Skakalski said the group can resume their investigation. He said they are still trying to figure out just when they will receive the records previously requested from the DOC.
Per the agreement, going forward, the DOC will have three days to respond to a records request from Disability Rights Maine. The judgement also limited the reasons for why a request could be denied.
"We do think that going forward that the department of corrections is going to be more responsive and cooperative in the course of our work," Skakalski siad.
Liberty said Tuesday that the department is pleased with the mutual agreement reached.
"The court has ruled and we look forward to working with Disability Rights Maine," he said.

Texto completo: A person was killed early Tuesday evening after a car left the southbound lanes of Interstate 95 in Hampden, crashed into a set of trees and burst into flames, police said.
[image id="2804718" size="half" pos="right" /]
The crash happened around the Hampden-Carmel town line early Tuesday evening and closed the southbound lanes to traffic, according to Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Maine State Police. Maine State Police called it a "fiery crash" in a brief Facebook post.
Traffic was flowing with delays in the northbound lanes after the crash, which was reported around 5:20 p.m. By 7:20 p.m., the fire was extinguished, the car was towed from the scene and traffic returned to normal conditions. Tire tracks were left in the grass to the side of the highway, and the trees in that area were all heavily burnt.
The crash happened near mile marker 176, which is 4 miles south of the Coldbrook Road exit serving Hermon and Hampden, and 2 miles north of exit 174 for Route 69 in Newburgh.
The fatal crash came less than a month after the April 3 death of Maine State Police Detective Ben Campbell on the same stretch of I-95 south. Campbell was killed in a freak accident at mile marker 179 while helping the driver of a disabled vehicle. He was struck by a wheel that separated from a logging truck trailer.

Texto completo: A malfunctioning fire suppression system is delaying the seasonal opening of the observatory at the Penobscot Narrows Bridge until at least next week.
The Penobscot Narrows Bridge Observatory was due to open May 1, but it's opening is being delayed several days, according to the Maine Department of Transportation.
The Transportation Department cited malfunctioning in the observatory's fire suppression system as the cause for the delay.
[How the tallest man-made thing in Maine compares to other tall things]
The 2,120-foot-long cable-stayed bridge carries U.S. Route 1 over the Penobscot River, connecting Verona Island to Prospect. It replaced the Waldo-Hancock Bridge, built in 1931.
The observatory, which opened in May 2007, is the tallest public bridge observatory in the world, according to the Transportation Department. It is one of four bridge observatories in the world, with the other three located in China, Thailand and Slovakia.

What 'Medicare for all' could mean for Maine hospitals

Texto completo: A version of the "Medicare for all" bill championed by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, several of his rivals for the nomination and the two Democrats in Maine's congressional delegation had its first committee hearing on Tuesday.
It won't happen without full Democratic control of Washington, D.C., but the party is increasingly rallying around the concept -- alongside less sweeping ones such as public options -- as it tries to map a movement that will oust President Donald Trump in 2020.
Such a plan would ostensibly cover the 28.5 million estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau to be uninsured at cost estimates that vary widely but are generally above $3 trillion per year, though tax increases for many could be offset by reductions in premiums and other health care expenses.
Lost in some of the debate is the impact on the health care system. Maine's economy is the most reliant on hospitals among U.S. states, according to the American Hospital Association, and a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association predicted a negative revenue impact on hospitals from Medicare-for-all plans.
The impact of a Medicare-for-all plan would likely vary because of the different proportions of government and private insurance payers. The JAMA study, released last month, found that hospital profit margins could go from 9 percent to 7 percent in the negative under a Medicare-for-all plan, assuming that the Medicare fee schedule was extended to all people. Currently, the fees paid by Medicare and Medicaid are less than the services cost to deliver, so patients with private insurers pay higher prices to subsidize that care.
The American Hospital Association opposes the Medicare for all concept, with a top official saying in February it would "disrupt coverage for the more than 180 million Americans who are covered by employer-sponsored health plans." The Maine Hospital Association has been quieter on it, but Jeff Austin, a lobbyist for the group, said it agrees with the national group.
Austin's group said in 2017 that Medicare and Medicaid paid about 53 percent of Maine hospital bills then, while private insurers and self-pay patients paid 47 percent, though the latter group only constitutes about 39 percent of utilization. That payer mix was roughly in line with national estimates from 2014. However, those figures vary widely by region.
The payer mix in Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington was 80 percent governmental and 20 percent commercial and self-pay, according to a 2013 review. Maine Medical Center in Portland got 37 percent of payments from private payers in that fiscal year. The ones with more commercial payers have more to lose, though it's also probably unlikely that a plan would pass without accounting for that move in funding.
Austin said that phenomenon is largely why Maine hospitals "have big concerns moving from payers who more than cover their costs," though he said "cleaning up" the number of uninsured people would have positive impacts for hospitals. Hospitals also could offset some of this impact with administrative efficiencies. All of this underscores the future nuance of the debate over Medicaid for all as it gets more serious.
The two Democrats in Maine's congressional delegation are supporting the 'Medicare for all' bill, though they have taken slightly different paths. In a statement, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of the reliably liberal 1st District said her boss is "focused on solutions that will both reduce costs and ensure quality coverage for all Americans." She is a longtime supporter of a Medicare for all concept and joined a caucus aimed at promoting it last year.
U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of the more conservative 2nd District is also sponsoring the bill and has released a "roadmap" for health care that gets to Medicare for all after steps including Medicaid expansion and a Medicare buy-in option for people between the ages of 50 and 64. His spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment on Monday.

Texto completo: A mile-long stretch of Route 15 in South Brewer stretching south from Interstate 395 to the Orrington town line is one of the city's busiest thoroughfares. For two years now, city officials have been assuring residents and businesses that the Maine Department of Transportation will pave the road this summer, according to Finance Director Karen Fussell.
That was the department's plan as well, until unexpectedly high bids from firms interested in doing the work forced the state agency to put the project on hold.
Statewide, the DOT has so far rejected three project bids in the runup to the 2019 construction season after quotes from interested firms exceeded project cost estimates by at least 60 percent.
One of the rejected bids was for a combined proposal to do paving work in Brewer, Orrington and Old Town. Individually, the paving projects were small, but the DOT grouped them together in hopes that the larger project would attract more competitive bids, Fussell said.
The DOT estimated the work would cost about $1.3 million, according to a DOT document outlining its revisions to construction plans. But the lowest bid that came in for the joint paving project was for $2.1 million.
"The costs of construction have been a lot more than we anticipated," said department spokesman Paul Merrill. "But we didn't expect them to be so high that it would prompt us to rethink our plans in the middle of the year."
The DOT has a running three-year work plan for road projects around the state. The current plan lists projects slated for 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Department of Transportation had already raised project cost estimates by 10 percent before advertising 2019 construction projects earlier this year, but that additional cushion proved insufficient.
[The road construction projects you'll encounter in Bangor this spring]
Brewer officials learned that the DOT had rejected bids for the Route 15 paving job in an April meeting with state transportation officials. The new plan, as discussed in that meeting, is to put each of the paving projects out to bid individually.
"Brewer's hoping its South Main Street project will get back out to bid early this summer," Fussell said.
Even with that timeline, actual construction will be delayed for a few months, which does not bode well given the condition of the state road.
"We are very disappointed because it's a major thoroughfare for the city, and the condition of the road is in desperate need of repair," Fussell said.
[image id="2804555" size="full" pos="center" /]
The other two bids the Department of Transportation has rejected were for a paving project on Route 1 in Rockland for which bids came in 90 percent over estimates and intersection improvements on Congress Street in Portland for which bids exceeded project estimates by 120 percent. The lowest bid for the Rockland work was $4 million for a project estimated to cost $2.1 million. In Portland, the Congress Street intersection work was estimated to cost $500,000, and the lowest bid came in at $1.1 million.
The DOT said it decided to cancel some work based on the amount by which bids exceeded estimates, the current road conditions and a lack of competition for the work. The department said it expects a shortage of construction workers to be a root cause of the spiraling construction costs.
As for Brewer, the city is making plans to contribute more than its required share of 10 percent for the road work if the new bidding process demands it, Fussell said.
"After this winter, the road is in very very difficult condition," she said. "It remains to be seen how we are going to manage through the fall."

Texto completo: Story: How Janet Mills is moving to repair Maine's relationship with its native tribes
The damage done by Mills and the state is irreparable. When they could have negotiated to achieve amicable terms on important issues, they refused, and the Tribal State Commission was thrown overboard. Now Mills says let's bring it back. For what? Tokenism is all that remains. Issues of substance are gone.
-- Nochigahneh10
It's good to see a politician move to make amends for past wrongs done to the Native Americans. We need a good deal more of that. And to those who falsely claim "we" are being stripped of "historical honors" by making changes, I offer this direct quote from the article, "It's still very much an attack in your spirit when you celebrate a man who really is the poster child for 500 years of genocide," Dana said during the hearing.
-- Wednesday's Child
Wow, Mills is just doing a great job. No work requirements for able bodied adults with no children, expand Medicaid that will cost us tens if not hundreds of millions, no photos on welfare cards and that's just a couple in her first 6 months! What's it going to be like in 4 years? The party is on now!
-- Ben Crow
Story: Climate change inspired 25 protesters who were arrested at Bath Iron Works
I'd protest the fact the ship was named after LBJ, not the miniscule effect it may have on climate change. I see I was correct (on another thread) about my assumption of octogenarian hippies being there.
-- NotGunnaPlayAnymore
Another dumb waste of time and police resources, from chronic troublemakers who have made their lives "meaningful" by creating silly troubles and inconvenience for others. What a swell crew.
-- Disqus1965
Civil resistance has a long history of being effective. It ended Jim Crow, apartheid in South Africa, and gave women the vote among many other examples. As for protesting the odious namesake of this weapon of mass destruction -- a president driven from office by anti-war protests ... "Hey, hey, LBJ, how much carbon did you spew today?" was one of our chants.
-- Lisa Savage
Obviously this was a story meant to cause conflict and deliver the BDN's personal editorial position in a news story. If you truly don't want to have to remove comments there was no reason to promote the ages of those arrested and attempt to link it to some left wing morality. You pick a fight people are going to respond.

How Central Maine Power failed its customers and still increased profits

Texto completo: In January, David Ellis, 61, retired from Central Maine Power Co. where he worked for just shy of 39 years as a meter reader, lineman and troubleshooter, a job that required him to fix downed lines and restore power at odd hours and in inclement weather.
The job is demanding, and it slowly became more demanding, and dangerous, as CMP declined to replace workers who retired or left the company, Ellis said, forcing him and his coworkers to work longer and harder.
"You can't operate like that, not for very long anyway," Ellis said. "It's a sad state of affairs."
In Lewiston, the line workers were getting between 800 and 1,000 hours of annual overtime -- almost 20 hours a week -- when Ellis left, he said, adding that the workload was "killing them." CMP was also increasingly relying on contractors who often lacked local knowledge, Ellis said.
On April 19, after years of declaring the company short-staffed, the union representing CMP workers announced it had reached an agreement to increase staffing at the state's largest electric utility. The agreement comes as CMP is fighting a multifront battle for public trust, which includes seeking approval for a $1 billion transmission line project, after a series of missteps have eroded its credibility with customers.
In late 2017, the company botched the rollout of its $55 million billing system, prompting regulators to launch an investigation, attorneys to seek a class action lawsuit and ratepayers, thousands of whom continue to believe their bills are inaccurate, to organize. In the aftermath of the rollout, which coincided with a catastrophic October windstorm, the company also failed to bill thousands of customers for months on end, or provide accurate information to customers who call the company or show up to appointments, according to regulators.
In the wake of the company's troubles, the Bangor Daily News reviewed hundreds of pages of regulatory and financial filings and interviewed current and former employees, regulators and customers to understand why Maine's largest electric utility has failed to live up to its long history of service to the state. The BDN found that insufficient staffing was a common issue, and that customer service deteriorated as Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, which bought CMP's parent company in 2008, reorganized its U.S. holdings under the banner of Avangrid, a publicly traded company headquartered in Connecticut.
And while CMP reduced staff under Iberdrola, the company's annual net income soared, rising from $58 million in 2007 to $130 million in 2018.
Those profits were driven by the company's investment in Maine's infrastructure, Avangrid spokesperson Catharine Hartnett said. Since Iberdrola took over CMP in 2007, "Maine has benefited from over $2.65 billion in investment, creating jobs, paying property taxes and overall contributions to the Maine economy," she said.
The growth in profits "recognizes the significant investments that have been made in the Company's facilities and are not related to staffing reductions or cutting corners," Hartnett said.
While CMP has reduced staff under Iberdrola and Avangrid, the company now appears to be reversing course. The company said it has hired new staff in recent months, and the new staffing agreement with the union serves as the most visible sign of the company's newfound commitment to hiring, which it says is necessary because of growth in both the number of customers and storms. The agreement runs contrary to what observers saw as Iberdrola's desire to streamline operations and reduce staff in recent years.
Since Avangrid launched in 2015, CMP, like other utilities under the Avangrid banner, has been moving functions, such as information technology, human resources, accounting and communications, to Avangrid, with the goal of standardizing processes and departments across Avangrid companies.
The idea is that instead of Avangrid subsidiaries like CMP, New York State Electric & Gas Corporation and Rochester Gas & Electric all having their own IT or HR departments, for example, Avangrid would house a single version of those departments that would serve all Avangrid subsidiaries.
The result is that, in recent years, the number of people working at CMP declined as staff were transferred to the company's corporate parent or offered early retirement or severance packages.
Avangrid has said this streamlining of operations improves efficiency and benefits customers. But given the problems CMP has had since the corporate reorganization, regulators aren't so sure.
"The Staff has concerns with the overall quality of utility service currently being provided by CMP," the Maine Public Utilities Commission hearing examiner Chuck Cohen wrote in March. "The degradation in the quality of service seems to be coincident with the change in Avangrid's management structure and the removal of operational decisions from the local company." Cohen added that the service quality issues seem to be "most apparent in customer facing situations."
Ellis, the longtime CMP employee who retired in January, reached the same conclusion.
"I hate to use the term 'fall off the deep end,' but it really did when Avangrid took over," Ellis said. "The whole model changed. There was no more, as far as I was concerned, customer service."
Whether or not the changes made to the company under Iberdrola and Avangrid have been good for customers, they have increased profits. In 2007, the year Iberdrola announced it was buying CMP parent company Energy East, CMP's net income was $58 million. In 2017, CMP generated $158 million in net income, a 133 percent increase when adjusted for inflation. (The company's net income fell to $130 million in 2018.)
Meanwhile, the company's payroll remained flat, rising from $65 million in 2007 to just $74 million in 2018. When adjusted for inflation, that change actually represents a 5 percent decrease.
From December 2013 to June 2018, CMP's workforce declined from 913 to 808, according to filings at the Public Utilities Commission, a 12 percent reduction. Forty-one of those staff members were transferred from CMP to Avangrid, filings showed.
At the end of 2018, CMP had 815 staff, according to Hartnett. At the same time, Avangrid employed 240 workers in Maine. While these employees are working for Avangrid, they are also, in a sense, working for CMP -- along with the seven other electric and natural gas utilities Avangrid owns.
Some of Avangrid's staff in Maine "had been CMP employees in the past," said Hartnett, an Avangrid employee who handles press communications for CMP.
Together, Avangrid, CMP and Maine Natural Gas -- another Avangrid subsidiary with about 20 staff -- employed 1,076 workers at the end of 2018, Hartnett said. Those employees were paid a total of $105 million in 2018, with $75 million going to CMP employees, said Hartnett, who added that Maine ratepayers "do not pay for work done by Maine employees on behalf of companies and customers in other states."
Avangrid and Iberdrola have been the beneficiaries of CMP's homegrown talent, said David Flanagan, who served as CMP's CEO from 1994 to 2000.
"When we were merged into larger companies, CMP had a lot of capable people who were given broader responsibilities and took over leadership positions in other departments in broader parts of New England and New York," Flanagan said. "At the same time, there has been some loss of local knowledge."
Former longtime president and CEO Sarah Burns, who retired from the company at the end of 2017, did not respond to requests for comment. Burns is one of a growing number of CMP employees retiring in recent years. In both 2014 and 2015, there were 13 retirements at the company, according to PUC filings. That number rose steadily to 30 in 2016, 38 in 2017 and 51 in 2018.'A cautionary tale'
John Hazen has been surveying customers of American electric utilities for more than a decade at marketing research company J.D. Power. When he started, CMP was the "king of the hill" for customer satisfaction for electric utilities its size in the eastern part of the U.S., he said.
But that changed around the time Iberdrola created Avangrid.
CMP was ranked No. 1 for residential customer satisfaction among large electric utilities in the eastern part of the country in the early part of the decade, and still ranked second as late as 2013. But last year it fell to 12th out of 16 utilities.
In 2013, Central Maine Power ranked first for business customer satisfaction among its peer group. Last year, the company ranked dead last, not just among its grouping, but among all 85 American utilities ranked by J.D. Power.
"I use them as a cautionary tale," said Hazen, who is a senior director of Global Business Intelligence at J.D. Power.
Customer service has been the area with the greatest number of staff reductions at CMP in recent years, according to PUC filings. It's also the part of the company that regulators have repeatedly warned CMP about.
Since 2016, regulators at the PUC have formally warned CMP six times that it could face consequences for its customer service failures, which included providing inaccurate information to customers and not having adequate levels of staffing at its call center, a violation of PUC rules. In February, PUC staff recommended that the commission reduce the amount of money CMP can make from ratepayers as a penalty for its substandard customer service.
"[S]tarting in 2016 and through the present time, CMP's performance has significantly and consistently fallen below standards reasonably expected of a utility to provide adequate service," PUC staff wrote. "Much of the decline in customer service levels can be traced back to insufficient customer service staffing."
A number of people have shared their frustrating interactions with the company. The first time that Michelle Ricardo called CMP to dispute her bill, she was on hold for an hour and 40 minutes, she said. She had moved with her husband, James, and their then-teenage children to Dixmont in the summer of 2016, where they bought a 3,100-square-foot house.
Ricardo, an education technician, decorated the house with lights at Christmas time, until her CMP bills started climbing.
In December 2017, the Ricardos used roughly 1,800 kilowatt hours of electricity, according to bills shared with the BDN. The next year, despite foregoing Christmas lights due to rising electricity costs, their usage nearly doubled to more than 3,100 kilowatt hours, according to their bill statements. As a result, they owed $490 in December 2018, up from $250 in December 2017.
In February, CMP said the Ricardos used nearly 3,600 kilowatt hours, more than double what it billed the previous February, and the electric bill topped $600. The family's bill was just $70 in October 2017.
Ricardo spent hours on the phone with CMP trying to understand why her electric bills continued to rise as she and her family reduced their usage. When she did reach a representative, Ricardo was told, again and again, that her bills were accurate.
Believing her bills to be incorrect, Ricardo stopped paying them in full. As a result, she received a disconnect notice from the company in March, informing her that her electricity would be shut off if she didn't pay $254.24 of the more than $900 she owed the company.
But after calling to complain again and prevent her electricity from being shut off, she was told somebody would investigate and call her back, she said. When she finally heard back, she was told she only owed $405.87.
She said that must be a mistake because her previous bill showed an outstanding balance of nearly $1,000. Was some adjustment made? Did CMP realize a mistake and refund her account? No, she was told. That was the amount she owed.
"Where are they even coming up with these figures?" Ricardo said.'Long overdue'
As part of the company's reorganization under Avangrid, CMP combined its Augusta and Portland customer contact centers in 2015, and offered voluntary separation packages to staff, according to documents filed at the PUC. While call center management conducted an analysis in 2016 that recommended the company needed 45 additional customer service representatives, the company only sought approval for 14.
Between July 2017 and February 2018, a period spanning the October 2017 windstorm and the company's new billing system rollout, 25 percent of calls to CMP were answered with a "courtesy message" that advised the customer to call back later, according to the PUC. Those callers were then disconnected. Customers who weren't disconnected often gave up trying to reach a person due to wait times. The number of "abandoned calls" peaked in late March and early April 2018 at around 40 percent of callers, the PUC said in a February report.
Despite these issues, across 2017 and 2018, 29 customer service staff either retired or voluntarily left the company, the PUC said.
The employees that remained seemed to have concerns about whether they had enough resources to do their jobs effectively, according to the results of a third-party survey of CMP customer service employees conducted in the spring of 2018.
Just a third of respondents agreed with the statement "I have the resources I need to do my job effectively," according to PUC filings. At comparable companies, two-thirds of employees respond affirmatively to that question, according to the administrators of the survey. A third of respondents also agreed that "the Company is effectively managed and well-run." At comparable companies, 60 percent agreed.
Also in late 2017 and early 2018, PUC staff noted they began hearing from customers and contractors that CMP "was often not showing up for field appointments or was canceling long-scheduled field appointments for no apparent reason."
The company has since added customer service employees, including 20 after the October 2017 windstorm, said Avangrid spokesperson Hartnett. CMP also recently hired 13 apprentices from the Kennebec Valley Community College lineworker program, Hartnett said.
According to IBEW 1837, the union that represents CMP workers, the new agreement signed in April, if implemented, would immediately increase the minimum number of the company's union employees, which include customer service as well as field staff, from 546 to 606, with a goal to increase minimum union staffing to 665 by 2024, a 22 percent increase over current levels.
"I feel comfortable saying, when fully implemented, this will have a huge impact on CMP and power restoration, customer service and new services," said IBEW 1837 business manager Dick Rogers, who noted that the added numbers will also increase worker safety.
The new agreement may represent a shift toward more local control, according to Public Advocate Barry Hobbins.
"I believe the decision making is not like the old Central Maine Power Company," Hobbins said. "But having said that, I believe that because of all the bad publicity and the lack of trust of many of their customers, it looks to me like they've given more decision making back to the management here in Maine."
Others aren't so sure. CMP critic Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, co-chair of the Maine Legislature's Energy, Utilities and Technology committee, has introduced a bill to create a "Maine Power Delivery Authority" that would buy out CMP and Emera from investors. Rogers, with the union, said Berry's proposal helped pressure CMP to agree to the new staffing levels.
Berry welcomed the staffing agreement but said it doesn't fix what's wrong with CMP.
"Adequate staffing is long overdue," Berry said. "It is a step in the right direction. But it does not fix the underlying issue at CMP, which is that it's controlled by Spain and not Maine."
As the company shed staff, usually due to retirements, its frontline workers would ask management about hiring replacements, said Ellis, the CMP troubleshooter who retired in January. The answer was always the same.
"'It's got to go to Spain for approval.' That's all we kept hearing," Ellis said. But the approval never seemed to come.
"We just kept thinking this was their way of saying that we're not going to get any more help," Ellis said.
Current CMP linemen agreed.
"They tell us that they have to submit the paperwork and get approved by people in Spain," said a current lineman who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak to the press. "They get sick of us asking the same questions, I'm sure. I'm not blaming local management. From what I can see, they're just as stressed as we are."
PUC staff had worries about foreign ownership when the commission was evaluating Iberdrola's proposed purchase of CMP and its parent company.
"Iberdrola's physical and language separation from Maine creates the potential that decisions affecting CMP may be removed from the local concerns of Maine's citizenry and government," PUC staff wrote in a November 2007 analysis.
"This is not a theoretical concern," the staff continued. "Maine has experience with other utility acquisitions, and has observed the tendencies of large companies to treat as unimportant problems of an affiliate located in a relatively small and remote state."
Today, CMP has roughly 620,000 customers, a group that makes up less than 2 percent of the 34.7 million customers serviced by Iberdrola across the U.S., Europe, Brazil and Mexico.
In an email response to a question about Iberdrola's influence on CMP staffing levels, Hartnett wrote that "CMP has one parent company -- AVANGRID." But in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Avangrid admits that Iberdrola controls the company.
"Iberdrola exercises significant influence over us, and its interests may be different than yours," it warned shareholders in its 2018 annual report. 'We started to get a little bit nervous'
While questions about CMP's customer service have intensified since the creation of Avangrid, Dick Davies saw a gradual shift in CMP's approach after Iberdrola bought the utility in 2008.
Appointed Maine public advocate by former Gov. John Baldacci, now vice chair of the Avangrid board of directors, Davies was responsible for representing customers' interests before regulators from 2007 to 2013.
Davies said at first it seemed as if Iberdrola would take a hands-off approach to its new acquisition. But that slowly seemed to change.
"It was only later on as Iberdrola became more interested in reducing the workforce and cutting back on certain things that we started to get a little bit nervous," Davies said.
In 2010, for example, CMP reduced its workforce as part of the company's transition to smart meters, which transmit customer usage data to the company electronically and reduce the need for CMP staff to physically take readings from customer meters. Eighty-five staff accepted voluntary early retirement, and another 36 accepted a severance package from the company in 2010, according to PUC filings.
The $200 million smart meter project was funded with the help of a $96 million federal grant. Iberdrola and its subsidiaries have received more than $2.2 billion in state, local and federal subsidies since 2000, according to corporate and government accountability watchdog Good Jobs First.
Davies said when Iberdrola took over CMP, the utility was "sort of a local company," but within a few years he realized "that they were now a world company."
"They were going to be doing whatever they needed to get an income level they decided they wanted to get, and they were not about to let local interests get in the way," Davies said.
Like nearly all electric utilities, CMP is a monopoly. (Customers can't choose to get electricity delivered by non-CMP power lines in the company's service area.) Because the state has allowed CMP to operate a monopoly, CMP is subject to heavy state regulation. Part of that regulation involves determining how much profit CMP can make off ratepayers. Too much, and ratepayers are overcharged. Too little, and the company can't attract the investment needed to keep the lights on. The industry standard is somewhere around 10 percent.
As part of this regulation, the PUC has set a cap on how much CMP can pay to affiliates like Avangrid for services the company used to have in-house. CMP can spend over this cap, but the PUC won't allow CMP to be reimbursed by ratepayers for that amount.
The cap was instituted in 2001, not long after CMP first became a subsidiary when it was purchased by Energy East in 1999. The PUC has raised the cap over the years, and in 2013 it rose to $32.5 million.
CMP first exceeded the cap in 2016, according to PUC filings. From July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, CMP spent $42.8 million on affiliate services, outspending the cap by more than 30 percent.
In recent PUC filings, CMP has asked for the cap to be eliminated, noting that its sister utilities in other states aren't subject to such a limit. But the PUC staff rejected this argument, noting that CMP agreed in 2014 to work with interested parties to develop a way to evaluate whether the payments to its affiliates were reasonable. But that never happened. And while CMP recently commissioned an ongoing study to look at the payments to Avangrid and affiliates, the study won't answer the essential question about these payments: Would it be cheaper for CMP to do these things itself?
CMP's failure to provide information about its payments to affiliates "makes it difficult if not impossible to judge the reasonableness" of CMP's request to increase or eliminate the cap, PUC staff wrote.Third-largest fine ever levied
CMP's billing system has been the source of many customer complaints since the company debuted it in late 2017. After the rollout, 100,000 accounts had billing errors, thousands of existing customers simply stopped getting bills, and thousands of new customers didn't receive bills for months. At least a few thousand customers continue to have unresolved complaints about their bills nearly a year and a half later. Billing issues have prompted a PUC investigation as well as a lawsuit accusing the company of fraud.
Maine regulators found that inadequate staffing for the project was among many problems with the system rollout. After the new billing system went live, "insufficient numbers of staff slowed identification and correction of errors," they said.
For utilities, problems stemming from the rollout of billing systems are not unusual. For example, Maine's other investor-owned utility, Emera, rolled out a new billing system in 2015. The project ran 80 percent over budget, and the company's mismanagement of the project was one of the factors that led Maine regulators to reject the utility's full rate increase request in 2016.
For Iberdrola, the problems with CMP's billing system rollout must seem all too familiar.
In June 2016, UK regulators fined ScottishPower, another Iberdrola-owned electric utility, 18 million pounds -- about $23.5 million dollars -- for breaking regulations related to "billing issues and complaints handling." At the time, it was the third-largest fine the UK's Office of Gas and Electricity Markets had ever levied, and regulators made clear the cause of the company's violations was the rollout of a new billing system, which began in December 2012.
The billing and customer service problems identified by regulators seem to directly mirror the more recent issues at CMP. UK regulators wrote that the migration of ScottishPower customers to the new system "resulted in a number of customer service problems, including long call times, a large number of late bills," customer complaints, and issues with its obligation "to record the handling of complaints."
Regulators also noted that ScottishPower failed to resolve its issues until nearly a year and a half after they announced their investigation and blamed the botched rollout in part on the company's failure to staff its customer contact centers.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — Erica Haywood had been growing, formulating and selling medical marijuana products for about five years and was in her first year of cultivating and selling hemp when something went wrong.
Unbeknownst to her, a supply of hemp flowers she sent out for processing into oil came back contaminated with rubbing alcohol
Haywood didn’t know anything was amiss until one of her clients approached her, saying she’d experienced some strange symptoms and had sent her oil for testing. The news devastated Haywood and her husband, who had built their company, LoveGrown Agricultural Research in Farmington, on providing safe, organic products.
“We were floored, shocked, everything,” Haywood said.
That was the first time LoveGrown had used someone else to process its products. It was also the last.
“Until there is some sort of verification required, there is no way I’d use anybody,” Haywood said, “at least not without testing and verifying it myself.”
That requirement may be coming.
The state is considering rules that would mandate testing of recreational marijuana products sold to consumers, including testing for residual solvents, harmful chemicals, mold, pesticides and microbes. Similar rules for medical marijuana could follow.
“I think that there’s a significant interest in the Legislature to make sure that patients who are receiving product in the medical program are receiving product that is just as safe, if not safer, than that which is in the future adult use program,” said David Heidrich, spokesman for the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, which includes the newly created Office of Marijuana Policy.
Medical marijuana possession has been legal in Maine since 1999 and dispensaries have been legal since 2009. However, only one consumer safety rule covers medical marijuana and it has to do with pesticides. There has been no requirement to test for toxins, poisons or other harmful contents before a product reaches patients.
In 2016, Maine voters approved recreational marijuana, but regulations were delayed. This year, the state created the Office of Marijuana Policy and released draft rules governing the recreational marijuana program and proposed rules covering mandatory testing of those recreational products.
Those mandatory testing rules do not need legislative approval and could be implemented this year. The state could then align Maine’s recreational and medical marijuana programs to also require mandatory testing of medical marijuana.
“There’s a Marijuana Advisory Commission that the Legislature created, and they actually have to deliver a report to the Legislature early next year,” Heidrich said. “And one of the big items that they’re tasked with doing is providing recommendations as to how the two programs can be aligned as closely as possible.”
Such mandatory testing could have stopped Haywood from receiving and sending out tainted oil.
Her processor did not — and did not have to — test for contaminants, so he said he didn’t know the product had a problem. Neither did LoveGrown.
Haywood said three clients received oil from the tainted batch. Two used it, including a teenage girl in pain from a rare disease. That girl’s mother later told the Portland Press Herald that her daughter began experiencing itching, headaches and stomach aches about a month after she started the oil. Haywood said the girl had received a diluted version of the oil that later tested safe.
The other person who used it, a woman from Vassalboro, told the Portland Press Herald that she also began to feel sick after taking the oil. She told the newspaper she had the oil tested and it contained more than three times the Massachusetts legal limit for rubbing alcohol.
That woman brought the problem to Haywood’s attention. Haywood said the lab results were also circulated on social media, where people threatened her for selling tainted oil.
“It was so scary,” Haywood said. “I was scheduled to appear at the NoCo Hemp Expo in Colorado, and because of all of these threats of violence, I canceled. I was too scared to go by myself. I had no idea who was going to come up to me and stab me because I ‘poisoned children’ according to this Facebook group.”
Haywood said follow-up lab tests showed the amount of rubbing alcohol found in the oil shouldn’t have been enough to make anyone sick, but she agrees that no amount should have been in it. She prides herself on LoveGrown’s organic certification and said rubbing alcohol shouldn’t have been anywhere near her products.
She said she offered a refund and an apology to those affected, and she immediately decided to keep all processing in-house so she could be solely responsible for quality and safety.
She likens the risk to this: “You’re a farmer, you grow cows, beef. You send your cows off for slaughter at the end of the a season and they come back to you and some processor gives you ground goat instead.”
Haywood likes the proposed testing rules for recreational marijuana and the possibility they could include medical marijuana sometime soon. However, she is concerned that mandatory testing of every batch could put small growers out of business, particularly those for whom “a batch” is one plant and testing costs upward of $300.
She’d like to see the state waive a testing requirement for growers who are certified by another recognized group, such as the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association.
That said, she believes testing could have prevented tainted products from ever reaching her clients.
“The most encouraging part of every single day for me is that every single day somebody thanks me for what we’ve made and what we do for them,” she said. “Somebody says, ‘My life has changed.’ That’s the power of this cannabis plant when it’s handled properly, when it’s formulated potently, when it’s grown cleanly.”

Texto completo: STRONG — Ephie Toothaker has been repairing and maintaining automobiles and trucks for decades, but starting Wednesday he’ll consider what he wants to do next.
Toothaker, 66, of Strong has owned and operated Main Street Service, a garage and 24-hour towing business on South Main Street for 38 years.
“All during high school I would work on my own cars, friends’ cars,” he said Tuesday. “It was just something I wanted to do.”
Toothaker graduated from Mt. Abram High School in Salem Township and Central Maine Vocational Technical Institute in Auburn, now Central Maine Community College. He worked for a business in Phillips for eight or nine years before opening his garage. He bought the building in May 1981.
He took night classes to keep up on the newest automotive techniques, including the change from points and condensors to electronic ignitions, which was a big deal, he said.
“One of the big improvements over the years was the emission-control system,” he said. “It is so much cleaner than they were.”
Since 1993 he has maintained the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office cruisers.
“I like being involved and taking care of my community,” he said.
His wife, Joan, has been his accountant.
Toothaker said he’ll miss his customers.
“I’ve taken care of their cars,” he said. “Now I’m taking care of their children’s cars.”
“A lot of my customers are the ones who’ve been with me for a lot of years,” Toothaker said. “They are kind of at a loss. I’ve always been just a phone call away,” he said.
For the foreseeable future, he will continue the towing business.
His employee, Fred Pease, who has been with him for about 30 years, will take one of several job offers he’s had.
Both men are beginning new ventures.
“Today at 5 o’clock, we’re going to lock the door and I will decide what I’m going to do with the next chapter of my life,” Toothaker said Tuesday.

Tick alert: May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month

Texto completo: AUGUSTA — Welcome to the start of tick season.
May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month in the United States, and the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a reminder that everyone be “tick aware and tick alert,” especially as the days get warmer.
Maine game wardens are definitely seeing ticks, according to spokesman John MacDonald.
Ticks like damp, wet grass and woods. The National Weather Service said Tuesday that Maine in April received 5.14 inches of rain — 23.3% more than the typical 4.17 inches.
Lyme disease is caused by a bacterial infection passed through the bite of an infected deer tick. Maine health care providers reported more than 1,400 cases of Lyme disease in 2018, according to the Maine CDC.
Most at risk are adults older than 65 and children between the ages of 5 and 15, and individuals who frequently work or play outside.
Lyme disease is treatable and most people recover with the right care.
Prevention, meanwhile, requires avoiding tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease.
Released Tuesday, the state’s Lyme disease alert urged:
• Using caution in areas where ticks might be found.
• Wearing light-colored clothing that covers arms and legs, and that makes it easier to spot ticks.
• Using an Environmental Protection Agency-approved repellent, such as DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus.
• Performing tick checks on people and pets every day, especially after outdoor activities.
Taking a shower is recommended to inspect for and wash off ticks, which, if attached for 24 to 48 hours, can transmit bacteria that causes Lyme disease.
Those bitten by deer ticks must monitor for early symptoms of Lyme disease, and should call their health care providers if symptoms develop.
The most common sign of Lyme disease is a skin lesion known as a “bull’s-eye” rash, which usually appears three to 30 days after a tick bite. Other symptoms include fever, headache and joint or muscle pain.
In addition to Lyme disease, other diseases carried by deer ticks include anaplasmosis, babesiosis, Borrelia miyamotoi and Powassan. All four continue to be public health concerns, according to the Maine CDC.
While the deer tick is the only species in Maine that causes Lyme disease, a number of other species of ticks are found across the state. When bitten and when removing a tick, identifying what kind it is is important. To learn more, see the Maine CDC website at www.maine.gov/lyme.
The University of Maine Cooperative Extension Tick ID Lab also offers identification, testing services and educational material at www.extension.umaine.edu/ipm/tickid/.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — The Bates Dance Festival returns in 2019 with an exciting new performance schedule and an artist roster comprising faces new to Bates, familiar friends and longtime festival favorites.
With an eye toward achieving a critical mass of onstage excitement, the new Bates Dance Festival schedule arranges the performances into three clusters in July and early August.
The Festival Prelude begins July 12 with a weekend of high-energy hip-hop dance and music by The Reminders and MaMa2 (featuring Amirah Sackett) with DJ Man-O-Wax.
On July 25, Doug Varone and Dancers kick off four nights of performance that also feature returning artist Lida Winfield, Netta Yerushalmy and Reggie Wilson/Fist and Heel Performance Group.
Onstage Aug. 1-3 for the festival’s final weekend are Joanna Kotze, artist-in-residence nora chipaumire and jumatatu m. poe & Jermone Donte Beacham.
Why the new schedule? “We wanted to make the festival more accessible by offering multiple opportunities to see shows in one day, not just evening performances,” said Shoshona Currier, festival director since 2017.
Festival artists cover styles from poe and Beacham’s J-Sette work to the dance experiments of Netta Yerushalmy to the versatile contemporary of Varone and Kotze. They tackle themes ranging from questions of faith to social justice, from personal history to imagination’s role in society and culture. All told, the 2019 Bates Dance Festival promises to be a tour de force of diversity and creativity.
Alongside the main stage performances, the festival offers dance training for young dancers ages 14-18 and professionals 18 and up. The Youth Arts Program provides dance, music, theater and visual arts training for local youths ages 6-16.
Most main stage performances take place in Bates’ air-conditioned Schaeffer Theatre, 329 College Ave. The event schedule will go live online Wednesday, May 1, at batesdancefestival.org/. Tickets go on sale June 1. For more information, please contact 207-786-6381 or dancefest@bates.edu.
Here’s a summary of the 2019 main stage performances:
The Reminders and MaMa2 with DJ Man-O-Wax: It’s a Hip-Hop weekend as soul-roots musicians The Reminders (Big Samir and Aja Black) join dancers MaMa2 (Amirah Sackett and Mary Mar) and DJ Man-O-Wax (Asad Ali Jafri). Man-O-Wax’s global-fusion sound frames the Reminders’ socially conscious music and the mesmerizing, high-energy movement of MaMa2 to create an immersive experience for all audiences (7:30 p.m. Friday and Sunday, July 12 and 14, Schaeffer Theatre). The Reminders are Brussels, Belgium-born emcee Big Samir and Queens, N.Y., native emcee-vocalist Aja Black. They blend soulful sounds and roots music with thoughtful lyrics that message peaceful social change. Learn more: http://www.theremindersmusic.com/. MaMa2 is the hip-hop and breakin’ dance duo of Amirah Sackett, making a return appearance at Bates, and Mary Mar. A Chicago-based dancer-choreographer, Sackett received the Sage Cowles award for her choreography in Brother Ali’s music video “Mourning in America.” Her love of hip-hop dance and devotion to her faith fused to inspire a contemporary dance collective called We’re Muslim, Don’t Panic, which is dedicated to elevating the status of women and educating the public on women’s issues.

Mar has been breakin’ since 2001 and has studied, taught and performed hip-hop dance all over the U.S. Asad Ali Jafri is a cultural producer, global arts leader and interdisciplinary artist with a creative vision for sustainable social change. As DJ Man-O-Wax, he plays and blends soulful, spiritual and funky music from around the globe. Learn more: http://asadalijafri.com/.
Doug Varone and Dancers: Varone, who first performed at the festival in 1992, presents the New England premiere of “in the shelter of the fold/epilogue,” two full-ensemble works including an inquiry into public and personal acts of faith. Tapping his own curiosity about prayer, Varone questions what constitutes faith — to whom are we speaking, and what are we asking for? Is this a mystical or spiritual experience, or simply a dialogue we’re having with ourselves? (7:30 p.m. Thursday and Friday, July 25 and 26, Schaeffer Theatre). An award-winning choreographer and director, Varone makes work that’s extraordinary for its emotional range, kinetic breadth and the many arenas in which he works. For more than 30 years, Varone and Dancers have dedicated themselves to the humanity and virtuosity of dance, touring to more than 125 cities across the U.S. and in Europe, Asia, Canada and South America. “Varone’s ability to convey depths of emotion through highly charged, physically exciting choreography,” wrote The New York Times, “has made him a rarity among his generation.” Learn more: http://www.dougvaroneanddancers.org/.
Lida Winfield: Visiting professor of dance at Middlebury College, choreographer Winfield returns to Bates with the Maine premiere of “Imaginary.” A quirky and innovative all-ages work for five dancers with live music, the piece explores perception in relationship to the imagination, and imagination’s role in social and cultural constructs (7:30 p.m. Friday, July 26, and 2 p.m. Saturday, July 27, in Gannett Theater, 305 College St.). Winfield is an innovative and accomplished dancer, choreographer, spoken-word artist and educator. Her original works merge storytelling, dance and visual art to create captivating and poignant performances. A visiting professor in the dance department at Middlebury College, Winfield received a National Performance Network grant for the commissioning of “Imaginary.” Learn more: http://lidawinfield.com.
Netta Yerushalmy: Yerushalmy offers the Maine premiere of her epic 20-performer “Paramodernities,” a series of six lecture-performances or dance-experiments. These juxtapose deconstructions of landmark choreographies by Nijinsky, Graham, Ailey, Cunningham, Fosse and Balanchine with contributions by scholars and writers who situate these works within Modernism. Incorporating public discussion, the series offers a unique hybrid of academic conference, dance performance and town hall gathering (1 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, July 27 and 28, Schaeffer Theatre). Raised in Israel, now living in New York City, Yerushalmy is an award-winning artist who aims to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived, not as they are known, and to challenge how meaning is attributed and constructed. Her work has been commissioned and presented by venues such as the Joyce Theater, Danspace Project, American Dance Festival, New York Live Arts and La Mama.
Reggie Wilson/Fist and Heel Performance Group : Director-choreographer Wilson leads Fist and Heel in an evening of selected works, including the riveting “Introduction,” a solo performed by Wilson, an excerpt solo from the provocative full-evening work “Citizen,” and the “dew wet” (7:30 p.m. Sunday, July 28, Schaeffer Theatre). Recipient of numerous awards, Wilson draws from the cultures of Africans in the Americas and combines them with postmodern elements and his own style to create what he often calls “post-African/Neo-Hoodoo Modern dances.” His work has been presented across the U.S. as well as in Europe and Africa. Learn more: www.fistandheelperformancegroup.org.
Joanna Kotze: A longtime member of New York City’s dance community, Kotze presents, “What will we be like when we get there,” a multidisciplinary contemporary performance. Fusing dance, sound and visual art, the piece recalls the social and political vibe in the wake of 2016’s presidential election. “What will we be like” brings attention to our desires, flaws, strengths and fantasies (7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, Aug. 1 and 2, Alumni Gymnasium, 130 Central Ave.). Originally from South Africa, Kotze is a Brooklyn-based dancer, choreographer and teacher who joined the New York City dance community in 1998. Recipient of the 2013 New York Dance and Performance Bessie for Outstanding Emerging Choreographer, she has presented work across the U.S. and has held residencies here and in Europe. Kotze is on faculty at Movement Research and Gibney Dance. Learn more: http://www.joannakotze.com/
nora chipaumire: Concluding a yearlong residency at Bates, chipaumire and company present the New England premiere of “100% POP.” Developed in part at the Bates Dance Festival, the piece instigates the idea of a “cover” through Grace Jones’ renowned “one-man show,” soundclashing, Zimbabwe’s Chimurenga music, dub and noise. It explores how “information and knowledge were acquired by those of us who grew up in less free times” (9:30 p.m. Friday and Sunday, Aug. 1 and 3; 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 2, Gannett Theater). Born in Mutare, Zimbabwe, and based in New York City, chipaumire has been challenging and embracing stereotypes of Africa, the black performing body, art and aesthetics since she started making dances in 1998. Her ongoing projects include a digital book project compiling theory, technology, practice and process of her artistic work. She is a 2018 Guggenheim fellow and a three-time Bessie Award winner.

jumatatu m. poe & Jermone Donte Beacham : Co-choreographers poe and Beacham present the New England premiere of “This is a Formation: Intervention.” Part performance, part public action, the piece uses J-Sette performance and culture — a genre originating with the popular female dance team of the Jackson State University marching band — to explore contemporary issues of black queer life (Bates: 6 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 3, Bates College campus. Also: 6 p.m. Friday, Aug. 2, at SPACE Gallery, Portland, in partnership with Indigo Arts Alliance). Jumatatu m. poe is a choreographer, performer and educator based in Philadelphia and New York City. Poe began formal dance training with the African dance technique of Kariamu Welsh. He produces dance and performance work with idiosynCrazy productions, founded in 2008 and co-directed with Shannon Murphy. Learn more: https://www.jumatatu.org/. Jermone Donte Beacham is a champion of the J-Sette style pioneered by Jackson State University’s female drill team. He has his own J-Sette line, Mystic Force, and has participated in competitions including Atlanta Pride 2010, Tennessee Classics 2009 and Memphis Pride 2008. In 2015, he was named New Legendary by the Meet Me on the Dance Floor J-Sette council. Learn more: http://pica.org/artists/donte-beacham/.

Texto completo: AUBURN — Officials in the Twin Cities are hoping a forum Friday can help connect regional stakeholders to federal resources, including the Opportunity Zones program created last year to spark investment in low-income communities.
The event, dubbed a “federal resource forum,” will be held at 11:30 a.m. Friday in the Kirk Hall Gymnasium at Central Maine Community College, 1250 Turner St. in Auburn.
According to Auburn Mayor Jason Levesque, the forum was organized following a recent visit to Lewiston-Auburn by Ben Carson, secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. While in the cities, Carson toured several HUD-funded programs with U.S. Sen. Susan Collins and met with Levesque to discuss Opportunity Zones.
Levesque said the idea behind the event is to capture the unique challenges facing Lewiston-Auburn and to bring the “appropriate representatives from federal agencies into one area to help solve those problems.”
With space limited, organizers are hoping for a mix of government and elected officials, nonprofit organizations, the local chamber of commerce, and other regional stakeholders for a dialogue on what’s available for resources and investment incentives.
He said the connections could lead to economic development, revitalization of housing, and other issues facing the cities.
While the forum is meant to make connections with multiple federal programs, the marquee discussion will be the Opportunity Zones program, created last year as part of the $1.5 trillion tax cut bill passed by Republicans in 2017.
Opportunity Zones are defined as “economically distressed communities where new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment.”
The program allows investors to create “opportunity funds” through which they can reinvest capital gains — profits from the sale of investments — into designated areas tax-free for up to 10 years, then get a 15 percent tax break on the initial investment.
The money could be put into commercial projects, startup companies and real estate.
Proponents believe the program will free up money from investors who are hesitant to cash out of investments because of capital gains taxes. However, critics worry the program will give tax breaks to investments in high-end real estate or other projects that don’t benefit poor neighborhoods, and that the administration is misusing the zones to give tax breaks to projects already in development.
Uncertainties still remain over the specific regulations that will govern the program because they are still being finalized.
Last week in Lewiston, Nelson Toner, a lawyer at Bernstein Shur, discussed Opportunity Zones during a Maine Real Estate & Development Association breakfast meeting at DaVinci’s Eatery.
“If you don’t invest in a Qualified Opportunity Fund correctly, the whole thing blows up,” Toner cautioned the audience of about 20 people. He added later, “For those of you who were math majors, this is going to be great.”
To help clear up any confusion over the complicated program, Friday’s event will feature a Q&A session by HUD representatives, followed by what Levesque described as a trade show-inspired forum with representatives from other government agencies.
“It’s such a new program that there’s still a lot of ambiguity and uncertainty out there in the business and development community on how to properly implement Opportunity Zone funds,” he said.
Instead of having to travel to regional offices in Boston or New York, local leaders will benefit from government agencies coming to them, he added.
Two similar forums have taken place elsewhere in New England, Levesque said, but not yet in Maine.
When the Opportunity Zones were announced last year by former Gov. Paul LePage, officials in Lewiston and Auburn were both excited and a bit surprised by the selections.
In Lewiston, the area selected differed from what city officials advocated.
LePage chose Lewiston census tract 203, which includes Bates College, St. Mary’s Regional Medical Center and the Sabattus Street corridor. City officials had stumped for tract 201, the downtown area featuring mill buildings deemed ripe for reinvestment.
Lincoln Jeffers, director of economic and community development in Lewiston, said Tuesday he’s looking forward to the dialogue Friday, and he still hasn’t given up on census tract 201 getting the Opportunity Zone designation.
“We don’t want to be greedy,” he said. “We don’t want two or three census tracts, we just want our preferred census tract.”
He added that the rule-making process for the Opportunity Zones has also prioritized job creation, which he said would be much more likely in Lewiston’s mill district.
Auburn’s census tract 105 in New Auburn was chosen based on the New Auburn Village Center revitalization project already underway.
Levesque said Tuesday that the New Auburn Village project will create “shovel-ready” land, which he said is the best incentive for development within an Opportunity Zone.

State agrees to hand over records of suicide attempts at Long Creek

Texto completo: The Maine Department of Corrections will turn over records of suicide attempts at Long Creek Youth Development Center to an advocacy group for people with disabilities.
Disability Rights Maine filed a lawsuit last year in U.S. District Court in Bangor to get access to those records. The state’s only juvenile detention center has been the focus of calls for reform or closure in recent years, and Disability Rights Maine was investigating a slew of complaints about neglect and suicide attempts. The lawsuit alleged that the department was violating federal law by withholding related records and obstructing that investigation.

The parties have agreed that the state will provide the records in question to Disability Rights Maine when the organization has a signed release from a parent, guardian or the former resident if that person is over 18 years old. A judge approved a consent judgment that outlined those terms and closed the case Tuesday.
“We’re disappointed that we had to litigate in order to get this outcome, but we are satisfied with the outcome, and we do think that this vindicates our important work and certainly our federal access authority,” said Jeffrey Skakalski, a staff attorney in the Augusta office of Disability Rights Maine.
Commissioner Randall Liberty of the Department of Corrections said he was also pleased with the agreement.
“Initially we were seeking clarification on what we could legally release, and we had some disagreements on that,” he said. “What this judgment does is give us clarity on what we can release and when we can release it.”
Asked about the investigation into suicide attempts, Liberty said he will be transparent with Disability Rights Maine. He also noted that his department is convening a working group to reconsider Maine’s juvenile justice system and its options for incarcerating minors.
“It’s my intent to be transparent and provide them with all the information that we have available so they can fact find,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which represented the department, said in an email that the judgment speaks for itself.
An independent review in 2017 found that Long Creek is chronically understaffed and ill-equipped to handle the serious mental health needs of young residents. That report followed the 2016 suicide of a transgender teenager, Charles Maisie Knowles — the first suicide at the South Portland facility in decades.
The state has designated Disability Rights Maine as the protection and advocacy agency for people with disabilities, including developmental disabilities and mental illness. In the lawsuit, the group argued that role allows it to access certain records under federal law.
From March to July of last year, Disability Rights Maine received complaints from six individuals “alleging serious neglect in the Long Creek youth facility,” according to the lawsuit. Five complaints during that time reported that a youth in detention had attempted suicide. As a result, the group opened its investigation and wrote a letter to Long Creek Superintendent Caroline Raymond. That letter included a request for multiple documents, including the names of residents who had attempted suicide and information about suicide prevention.
The lawsuit described a back-and-forth correspondence that ensued over weeks between the Maine Attorney General’s Office and Disability Rights Maine. The state denied the request for information without citing any reason to do so under the law. Disability Rights Maine provided a signed authorization from six individuals or their guardians, giving the group access to their records.
The lawsuit did not specifically say what services are not available to residents at Long Creek. It gave some examples of records that were not provided to Disability Rights Maine, such as daily behavior cards for all six individuals. In October, the state allowed the group to review some of the requested records but continued to withhold others. In November, the group filed the lawsuit.
“Several complainants alleged that Long Creek youth were not receiving the behavioral supports and interventions they required and were at risk of self-harm and suicide, placing the youth, residents and others at risk of injury or death,” the lawsuit stated. “DRM’s monitoring of Long Creek found evidence of a facility-wide failure to provide youth with disabilities with programs and services that are required by law. DRM has not been able to fully investigate these complaints due to an inability to access necessary records.”
The parties engaged in settlement discussions, and Skakalaski said the state has been more willing to work with Disability Rights Maine. The group has received some records but anticipates more, and the investigation that was delayed by the legal battle will now continue. Disability Rights Maine does not need signed authorization in all records requests, but agreed to get those permissions as part of the settlement in this case, he said.
The state agreed to try to get that authorization from a parent or guardian when a resident is admitted to Long Creek, and when it is denied, the department will share contact information for the parent or guardian with Disability Rights Maine. The consent judgment also outlines the timeframe for the state to provide records upon request – three business days – and limited reasons for denial.
Skakalaski said filing a lawsuit was a last resort, but it was one the group was willing to pursue.
“I do think that this should put other facilities like Long Creek and other correctional facilities on notice that we have the authority to access records and information related to the treatment of individuals with disabilities,” Skakalaski said.

Weeks to go before official opening, 50 of 63 units already rented in The Hartley Block

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Weeks from the official grand opening, developers behind The Hartley Block on Lisbon Street are on the verge of seeing 50 of its 63 apartments scooped up and talking to retailers and restaurants about the first floor.
Since breaking ground, the $8.5 million project has gone as smoothly and on budget as hoped, Amy Cullen, vice president at The Szanton Co., said Tuesday.
Even a mid-project decision to dip into contingency funds to upgrade the exterior to stone composite panels paid off, she said.
“It was a really expensive upgrade, but we felt like we owed it to the city of Lewiston to really pay attention to that front facade,” Cullen said. “This is a sensitive location, this is Lewiston’s main economic and commercial district.
“In all the neighborhood meetings we had before we designed the project, all of the neighbors wanted us to make sure it was a beautiful building and not just a cheese box.”
Since March 20, 35 people have moved in and 15 more units will see renters over the next three weeks, she said.
A one-bedroom apartment starts at $550 for a subsidized rate and $850 for market rate.
Cullen said all of the market-rate units in the building are full.
“I think there’s a shortage of quality, market-rate housing in Lewiston, so they go really fast,” she said. “For people who can buy a house, that market is met. For people who need an affordable place, rent-restricted, those needs are kind of getting met, but the middle, where you make too much for a rent-restricted apartment but not enough for a house or a really nice apartment, you’re kind of stuck.”
Cullen projected all of the units will be rented by the end of June. She said she hopes to have at least a few open for the project’s grant opening May 31, so guests can look inside.
Before then, Szanton will host a one-day makers’ event May 18 sponsored by the Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and L/A Arts in its future retail space that will show off the possibilities there.
The building has 4,007 square feet of retail space that can be divided for future use.
“At this point, we’re open to all offers,” Cullen said. “(We) would love to get artists in there. It feels like it goes with the building.”
The company has also talked to traditional retailers and restaurants, she said, but, as is, it might be too wide open to picture themselves moving in.
Before the project broke ground, that downtown block had been empty for more than a decade after fire destroyed several buildings.
“When we walked by this hole in the earth, we could envision what it could be,” Cullen said. “Business owners sometimes go into a completely blank area and can’t envision their own business in there. Once it’s a restaurant, another restaurateur can come in and say, ‘Oh yeah, I can see where the kitchen is.'”
Two large mosaic interpretations of painter Marsden Hartley’s artwork will be installed on the front of the building before the grand opening, she said. Hartley, an American modernist painter, poet and essayist, was a Lewiston native.
Prints of his work also hang throughout the building. Cullen hopes details like that help toward Lewiston creating a defined arts district.
“Our whole business plan is to build and own and manage,” Cullen said. “We all live in Maine and we care about the communities we build in.
“We want the residents that live in them to be proud of where they live. We want the cities to be happy that they worked with us, because we always need a lot of city support.”

Texto completo: LEWISTON — The school budget referendum in Lewiston is scheduled for May 14.
Voting is set for 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. at the Longley Elementary School gymnasium.
Absentee ballots can be picked up at City Hall but cannot be returned until May 8, after the City Council votes on the budget May 7.
This year, voters will be asked three questions:
• Do you favor the Lewiston School Department’s budget as adopted by the City Council?
• Do you wish to continue voting on school budgets?
• Was the school budget too high, acceptable or too low? (a nonbinding question).
Traditionally, voter turnout for school budgets is low, “but interest in Lewiston is growing, which is great,” City Clerk Kathy Montejo said.
State law requires voters be asked every three years if they want to continue voting on school budgets.
“Lewiston voters have always said yes, as have most towns in Maine,” Montejo said.
Last year, the voter turnout was almost 4.3% — 1,135 out of 26,605 registered Lewiston voters.
The school budget vote in 2016 was among the more surprising: Voter turnout was only 2.8% and the budget was rejected by six votes: 373-367.
When a second school budget referendum was held a month later, voter turnout jumped to 13.7% and the budget passed 2,230 to 1,310.
This year, voters will be asked to approve an $86.5 million school budget, a 4.6% increase to current spending and a less-than-1% increase to local property taxes for the school side of the budget. The proposed school budget would increase annual taxes by about $15 on a property valued at $150,000, down from an earlier estimate of $24, Superintendent Bill Webster said Tuesday.
The reduction is attributable to more money expected from the state after it corrected earlier estimates for the number of English Language Learner students in Lewiston.
The proposed budget maintains existing programs and adds 20 new positions, not including more special education positions that could be added if more special education students show up in the fall, Webster said.
The 20 new positions are largely meant to help reduce chronic absenteeism at Lewiston schools, which is defined as missing at least 10% of school days.
Webster said 31% of high school students in Lewiston are chronically absent, which is one reason the city’s graduation rate is between 70% and 80%.
The budget’s impact on students “is limited by the financial capacity of our community,” Webster said.
He said more teachers “will better meet the needs of Lewiston students through reducing class size, expanding electives at Lewiston High School and improving the capacity of our alternative education options.”

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Gov. Janet Mills and Heather Johnson, commissioner of the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development, are scheduled to join Boston Brands of Maine officials at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday to announce a $4 million expansion of the company’s Lewiston facility.
The expansion is expected to bring 50 full-time jobs to the region, according to information from the governor’s office.
Boston Brands of Maine, a bottling facility that has operated at 21 Saratoga St. since 2013, is responsible for bottling the popular Fireball Cinnamon Whisky.
In 2017, Sazerac Co., which owns Boston Brands of Maine, announced a $1 million expansion of the the Lewiston facility and the addition of 30 full-time jobs.
At that time, Gerry Reid, director of business development for Boston Brands of Maine, said Sazerac moved into the Saratoga Street facility in 2013 when previous owner Beam Inc. decided to leave the state after buying the former White Rock Distilleries for $605 million in 2012.

Texto completo: INDIO, Calif. - It's normal for music lovers from as far away as Tokyo, New Zealand and London to converge at the Coachella festival, but it's not often you find such a global contingent crammed into one band's backstage trailer.
That was the scene two weekends ago as the members of the electro-pop septet Superorganism settled in ahead of their set.
Sporting a plain tourist-shop T-shirt with "Maine" emblazoned across the front -- the state where she attended a boarding high school -- Tokyo native Orono Noguchi confused a question about playing the festival for a broader query about her band's whirlwind two-year career. Either way, her answer fit.
"It's been a lot of fun but a lot of chaos," she said.
Noguchi was still attending high school in 2015 when her future bandmates e-mailed her a demo recording from London of the song that became
"Something for Your M.I.N.D.," a weird, warped-grooving blend of synth-pop and space-funk that went viral in early 2017 and had some fans believing it was a secretly released song by Damon Albarn's sneaky group Gorillaz.
In the same flat, sweetly blas-sounding tone that defines her singing voice, Noguchi recalled her reaction to that demo: "I thought, 'What a cool song. Yeah, I'll try something over it.' "
"I did my vocals in like 30 minutes and sent them back. I didn't think anything beyond 'this is fun and sounds cool.' I certainly didn't think it would lead to all of this."
"This" is Superorganism becoming one of the biggest bands ever formed over the internet.
Now with a second hit on their hands, "Everybody Wants to Be Famous," Noguchi and her bandmates have a summer of Coachella-like festival gigs on their itinerary, preceded by a club tour that brings them back to First Avenue in Minneapolis on Thursday.
Not bad for a band whose members had never all been in a room together before they started making a record two years ago.
"We really just got thrown into this," the group's flaming-red-haired co-vocalist Ruby (no last name) said as she and Noguchi sat for a pre-gig interview.
"Some of us had never been on tour before we hit the road. It was a big learning curve for the whole band. But after doing 100-some shows last year, I think we can confidently say it's working."
Noguchi interjected, "It was 144 shows, to be exact."
Ten or so years younger than many of her bandmates, the 19-year-old lead singer -- whose not-quite-5-foot stature and T-shirt-and-sneakers attire make her look even younger -- met some of the members when their earlier band, the Eversons, came to Tokyo on tour. A Facebook friendship ensued, which then led to making music via the web.
Noguchi humorously recalled what it was like starting Superorganism while she was still attending school in Bangor, Maine:
"You know how at the end of high school, all the teachers and even some students are like, 'So, what are your plans?' Usually, it's stuff like, 'Oh, I'm going to Hunter College,' or whatever. For me, it was, 'Oh, I'm moving to London to start a band with a bunch of strangers from the internet.' I would get looks like, 'Oh, I guess you're gonna be a failure.' "
For her, though, the decision was a no-brainer: "Why wouldn't I do this?"
From graduate to 'Famous'
Like an international, coed version of the Monkees, Superorganism's members wound up living together in a cramped London house, three girls and five boys (also counting their visual producer). There, they finished their album and soon signed with Domino, the U.K. label that helped birth Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand.
Given their close living arrangements at home, they apparently made a pretty easy transition once it came time to travel the world.
"We already knew how to live together and get along, and how to allow time for ourselves and not think it weird if one of us needs some quiet time," Ruby explained.
Plus, she cheerfully added, "The [tour] buses actually have a living room, which we don't have at home."
And while Superorganism has seemingly enjoyed an effortless, instantaneous rise, Ruby said her group has put in a lot of effort into making their live show a unique and literally colorful experience. This would prove true a couple hours later, when their oddball video and light production, fun stage outfits and light choreography shined bright amid the darkness inside Coachella's Sonora tent.
"We feel like if someone pays the money to buy a ticket to your show and stands there waiting for you to go on, you really owe it to them," she said.
"Everybody Wants to Be Famous" sparked a big singalong from the crowd. Noguchi said that song has taken on an even more ironic tone now that her group is flirting with at least modest fame.
"My favorite art is always anything that's abstract enough for it to be interpreted in different ways, and that's a song I personally interpret different ways depending on the day," she said. "On a bad day on tour singing that song, I interpret it as, 'What am I doing?! I don't want to be famous.' "
Gesturing toward the wild, sprawling festival setting around her, though, she added, "But sometimes, I'm like, '[Expletive], yeah! We're playing at Coachella. I do want to be famous!' "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Numerous Senate Republicans expressed concerns Tuesday over the possibility of President Trump nominating conservative commentator Stephen Moore to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, indicating he would face resistance in the chamber.
GOP senators, including some of the president's strongest allies, cited his writings about women, personal financial issues and views of the Fed among the issues that could make it difficult for him to win confirmation if formally nominated.
"It will be a very problematic nomination," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.). Asked whether he would support Moore himself, "I'm still looking at it but it'd be very problematic."
Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa) said Tuesday that she didn't think Mr. Moore had enough Senate support to be confirmed for the Fed job and added she had spoken with the White House and would prefer future Fed nominees to be thoroughly vetted before being named. "My hope would be that they just consider somebody else," she said.
Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.) said enough senators have expressed opposition to Mr. Moore's potential nomination—and sufficient concerns have been raised—that his candidacy "seems like quite a challenge." He added, "If I was a gambling person, I would say the odds are not—he's not gaining momentum."
Mr. Moore has faced criticism for columns he wrote for the National Review in the early 2000s seen as belittling to women athletes. "We are being force fed lady hoops. I have never in my life met anyone who actually liked watching women's basketball," Mr. Moore wrote in one of the columns. He called it a "travesty" that women were joining men in pickup games and recreational leagues.
Mr. Moore told The Wall Street Journal that he "very much" regretted writing the articles and said the economic policies he had advocated for under Mr. Trump have resulted in the lowest female unemployment rate in decades.

"What we're doing for the economy has greatly benefited women," Mr. Moore said. "But it is true that I'm not a big fan of women's college basketball. I can go on the record on that."
Nominees need a simple majority to be confirmed in the Senate, where the vice president can cast a tiebreaking vote. That means Mr. Moore can lose no more than three Republicans, assuming all members of the Democratic caucus oppose him.
Several female GOP senators said they were particularly concerned by his writings on women, among other issues.
"But certainly it appears that he has a lot of personal financial issues , as well as troubling writings about women, and our role in society, in sports, and also how he views the Federal Reserve," Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) said Tuesday.
"I do have some concerns. I'd like to see his statements vetted," said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.)
Some Republicans said they were evaluating those pieces in light of Mr. Moore's explanation that some of his writing was intended as a joke.
"You know, Mr. Moore has a sense of humor so we're trying to contextualize them and see how much of those were meant in seriousness," said Sen. Thom Tillis (R., N.C.)
Democrats said Mr. Trump should take heed and decide not to nominate Mr. Moore. "Neither his politics, nor his views of women are very funny," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told reporters Tuesday. "He didn't belong on the Fed even before these writings came out disrespecting women."
Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed, saying the central bank is holding back the potential growth of the U.S. economy.
"Our Federal Reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates, even though inflation is very low, and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening," he said on Twitter Tuesday . "We have the potential to go up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates, like one point, and some quantitative easing. Yes, we are doing very well at 3.2% GDP, but with our wonderfully low inflation, we could be setting major records &, at the same time, make our National Debt start to look small!"
The Fed is unlikely to cut rates at its two-day meeting this week, which concludes Wednesday.
Sen. Mike Braun (R., Ind.) said he wanted to hear more from Mr. Moore about the areas that had raised red flags.
"That is a concern," Mr. Braun said of some of Mr. Moore's writings involving women. "Anything you do here, it involves the entire package. I think he'd be eminently qualified for the functionality of the job. I need to learn more about the other stuff I've been hearing."
Mr. Moore said last week he was hopeful about his chances of being nominated and confirmed, but would bow out of the process if he became a political liability for the Trump administration or Senate Republicans.
"Why should we risk a Senate seat for a Federal Reserve Board person, you know? I mean that just doesn't make any sense," Mr. Moore said in the interview, adding, "I'm totally committed to it as long as the White House is totally committed to it."
The lawmakers' comments come little more than a week after former restaurant executive Herman Cain withdrew from consideration for a Fed nomination in the wake of enough outright Senate opposition to essentially sink his confirmation chances.
The candidacies of Messrs. Cain and Moore, both strong Trump political supporters, have revealed notable congressional opposition to making the Fed more partisan, said Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in a note to clients earlier this week.
"However this turns out, we can already declare a couple of winners from this process," he said. Among those winners are Fed traditionalists "who have been afraid that openly partisan candidates could join the board."
Both Messrs. Cain and Moore also faced skepticism because they pivoted from favoring much less stimulus for the economy when it was weaker earlier this decade and a Democrat was president to favoring more stimulus now, when the economy is stronger and a Republican is president.
Mr. Trump has signaled his unhappiness in recent months at his selection last year of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lead the central bank. "But the Cain-Moore episode shows that it won't be easy for the president to make the Fed more Trump-friendly," said Mr. Katz.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) said, while discussing Mr. Moore, "it's important I think for the Fed to be staffed and led by economists and folks that are not primarily partisan, and I'm reviewing his record, his writings and speeches to make that final assessment."
White House officials have said in recent days that they still support Mr. Moore's candidacy.
"The president stands behind him," said White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Tuesday. Ms. Conway referred to recent interviews in which Mr. Moore said he would pull his name from contention if he feels like a political liability. "For now, I guess, he feels comfortable that he would like to be considered," she told reporters.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), when asked if Mr. Trump should reconsider his plans to nominate Mr. Moore, said, "If he is nominated, we'll cross that bridge when we get there."

Texto completo: As the saying goes: Everyone loves progress; no one likes change. And, no one certainly likes it when you mess with a good thing. So, when Matthew Padilla took over as executive chef at the venerable White Barn Inn Restaurant, a rare AAA Five Diamond and Forbes Five Star dining experience in Kennebunk, Maine, well, there were mutterings.
“It was a bit intimidating," Padilla admits. “I was nervous about living up to the reputation of the restaurant and past chefs, but I was also excited about the opportunity to put my own stamp on things."
Padilla is a Relais & Châteaux veteran. He was executive chef at Dos Brisas in Washington, Texas, and oversaw the fine dining restaurant at The Little Nell in Aspen, Colo., also a Relais & Chateau property. He's worked at Michael Mina's flagship Michelin-starred restaurant, and spent several months training at the award-winning Noma in Copenhagen.
“This is my first time on the East Coast," he said. “I was really drawn by the history and the role that food has played in the region. The history of the property was also a driving force for me."
The beloved and longstanding White Barn Inn Restaurant will celebrate its 46th anniversary this year. When it opened in 1973, it was a pioneer on the culinary stage, offering ultra-sophisticated dining in a refurbished Maine 1860's barn. The juxtaposition of elegant, stylized dining in a rustic setting was revolutionary, way before “rustic chic" became common.
The setting is much the same: high ceilings and timber beams, glossy pine floors, and rafters filled with farm implements. Tall windows allow views to lighted paths and gardens. Under the rafters sit white linen-topped, candlelit tables, and original art.
But the menu has changed subtly and slowly under the helm of Padilla, who must play a delicate balancing act between the old and the new, attracting younger, more adventurous diners while still satisfying the generational clientele and staying true to the property's culinary pedigree. For example, the former lobster fettucine in a cognac sauce has been replaced with a lighter, lobster and morel mushroom linguine with carrots and Calabrian chili, topped with crunchy chicken skin cracklings, and served as a small bowl appetizer. The beef tartare is brilliant: a roasted trough of warm, buttery bone marrow serves as the platter for strips of raw tenderloin, lightly drizzled with a parsley aioli, sprinkled with crispy shallots and served with brioche. It hits all the right warm-cold, soft-crunchy, sweet-savory notes. A duo of foie gras comes with sauterne gel, apple cider gastrique, and caramelized apples. The creamy, ultra-fresh beet soup is garnished with trout roe, adding depth and pop. Main dishes have been updated, too. Yes, there's more lobster; locally caught, shelled, and deconstructed, served with champagne lobster glace, cauliflower, gnocchi, fennel, and morel mushrooms. The seared scallops come with kumquats, crispy sunchokes, sweet potato, and sautéed spinach. The prime beef ribeye is served with black trumpet mushrooms and black garlic.
Padilla's forward-thinking approach includes a strong local, farm-to-table ethos, and a commitment to sustainability. “As a chef, I want to have less impact on the environment by working with local purveyors and with sustainable ingredients," he says. “I think that's a powerful thing to do."
And, if anyone's missing the old standby dishes? “Periodically, and on special occasions, we'll bring back the classics on the menu," he says. White Barn Inn Restaurant at White Barn Inn, Auberge Resorts Collection; summer hours: Monday-Thursday, 6-9 p.m., Friday-Sunday, 5:30-9 p.m., 207-967-2321, www.aubergeresorts.com/whitebarninn/

Portland Wine Week celebrates women winemakers

Texto completo: If you're brainstorming where to enjoy great wine this summer, the sommeliers and restaurateurs of Portland, Maine, hope you'll keep their city top of mind — especially during the third week in June.
Portland Wine Week, now in its second year, will showcase the Forest City's vibrant wine and food scene, June 17-23. Last year's inaugural festival featured more than 50 events, from tastings and classes to multi-course dinners featuring wines from Austria to the Azores. This year's fête — which includes a track celebrating women in wine — is shaping up to be even more expansive.
Restaurants, bars, and shops all over town will present a multitude of offerings, from the budget-friendly to the splurge-worthy. Sip a gently priced glass of bubbly alongside freshly shucked oysters at a shellfish market, or learn to craft your own spritzer at a stylish cocktail lounge. In the evening, drop by a restaurant you've been wanting to try, and get acquainted with a winemaker over a prix fixe repast. The next morning, hop aboard a sailboat and enjoy a scenic brunch on Casco Bay. Tickets to events are sold a la carte, so it's a snap to customize your own adventure.
If the notion of Portland as a wine destination surprises you, don't forget that Bon Appétit magazine named it 2018's Restaurant City of the Year. (Chicago garnered the title in 2017, and Washington D.C. the year before that.) Many in the city's hospitality community are still basking in the glow of national media attention.
“We were awestruck," says sommelier Erica Archer, president of Wine Wise, the presenting sponsor of Portland Wine Week. “I'm from Portland, and I do business with the people in the article. My phone blew up," she recalls, referring to the calls and messages she received from colleagues about the honor.
The magazine's recognition is all the more satisfying given Archer's own career trajectory. Nearly a decade has passed since she left the corporate world to start her wine education events company. The somm has had a front row seat to the evolution of Portland's wine scene. A key feature of that growth is the upsurge of women professionals in the industry.
One of last year's most popular events was a panel discussion featuring women working in wine. Topics ranged from navigating a traditionally male-dominated industry, to raising capital to fund women-owned businesses. “When I was putting the group together, it was obvious to me that I was really onto something here," says Archer.
Panelists and attendees clamored for more female-focused programming, so this year's festival includes a Women in Wine Track. Offering a curated selection of seminars, wine dinners, and tours, the track highlights winemakers, sommeliers, chefs, and creatives — all of whom are female.
Tabitha Perry, owner of Crush Distributors, a wholesaler distributing wine in Maine and New Hampshire, isn't surprised that the panel resonated with people. “There weren't many women selling wine in 2008," she says, reflecting on the year she launched her company focused on boutique and small-production wines. “It's a hospitality town," she continues. “Young women are eager to learn from those of us who have been working in wine longer."
That theme of generational continuity is represented by two West Coast winemakers coming to the festival. Carol Shelton, owner and winemaker of a line of wines bearing her name, will be visiting from Santa Rosa, Calif. Shelton began her pioneering career in the late '70s and is lauded for her sumptuous bottles of zinfandel. Brianne Day, owner and winemaker of Day Wines, traveled and worked throughout the wine world before returning to Willamette Valley, Oregon. She started making her own wine less than a decade ago. Fingers crossed that she'll be pouring “Mamacita," her fragrant pétillant naturel (“pét-nat") crafted from vermentino, muscat, and malvasia bianca.
Courtney “Coco" O'Neill, director of operations and wine director at restaurant Central Provisions, is an avid proponent of the Women in Wine Track. For the week, she has put together a list of wines crafted entirely by female makers. “I'll be pouring everything from crisp, dry whites, skin-contact orange wines, to beautiful rosés, and summery reds," she enthuses.
O'Neill is quick to give credit to a Boston-area colleague, Lauren Friel, owner of Rebel Rebel in Somerville. Prior to launching her Bow Market wine bar, Friel created an all-female-made wine list for Dirt Candy in New York, the first of its kind in the country. “I met her a couple of years ago, and I was floored," says O'Neill admiringly. “There are enough women winemakers to populate a whole list."
The wine director emphasizes that the female-focused track is meant to be inclusive. Just as every wine list has a point of view — Old World, New World, French — the organizing principle here happens to be women and the delicious wines they make.
“It's a way to reimagine women's roles in wine and to create a conversation," says O'Neill. “It's truly for everyone."
Portland Wine Week takes place June 17-23 at venues throughout the city. For tickets and a full schedule of events, visit portlandwineweek.me.

Texto completo: South Strabane Township,Pa.:The latest atrocity
committed againstinnocent, honorable human beings
praying at a house of worship causes us to attempt
again to make sense out ofthe senseless. How can
someone become so infested with baseless hatred and
ignorance that he walks into a synagogue on a particularly
holy and important day,the Sabbath and the last day of Passover,to perpetrate a massacre?Whattype of upbringing did
such an individual have?What does one hope to accomplish
through such evil?
The reverberations ofthis shooting spree are particularly
painful for me as a member ofthe Pittsburgh Jewish community who lived for most of his life within blocks oftheTree of
Life synagogue where six months ago 11 beautiful lives were
taken. How does a human being shoot a 97-year-old woman?
How does one target a child?
We are now faced with what was for most of civilization
unthinkable: having to engage a large and costly corps of
armed guards to ensure that people will be able to worship
withoutlosing their lives.Ajust and righteous God surely joins
us in our sorrow as we reflect upon the degradation of our
society.
Oren Spiegler
Rallying cry
Bronx: Kudos to Voicer Michael Wells for so eloquently voicing the feelings of millions of Americans who are looking for the press to lead us out of the circus that exists today instead of sinking us deeper. Please heed his words! The country will be a better place for it.
David Rodriguez
Bird calls
Sandy Hook, Conn.: Our President is calling the Mueller investigation, initiated during his Republican presidency, with a Republican-controlled House and Senate, and authorized by a Republican attorney general, and investigated by Republican directors of the FBI and CIA, and a Republican special counsel, an attempted "Democratic coup." His "coup coup" outcries should lead us to believe he is going cuckoo!
Paul F. Adinolfi
Standard of care
Manhattan: Like any patient, Dawn Smalls ("Black mothers' lives matter," April 27) was and is free to accept or reject medical treatment such as post-partum Depo-Provera, a contraceptive which prevents ovulation thus preventing another pregnancy before a new mother's body has had sufficient time to recover from childbirth. Like all contraceptives, Depo-Provera comes with both risks and benefits which potentially apply to all women regardless of race. Smalls' has every right to refuse what she considers a dangerous drug but her article offers no proof that this prescription was done carelessly based solely on her race.
Carol Ann Rinzler
Blame the Dems
Massapequa, L.I.: Voicer Arlene Reilly states that she had to bring all kinds of ID as proof to renew her driver's license. She wants to know why there is such an uproar about the census form asking for similar information. Her comment "there are those who worry more about protecting the rights of lawbreakers than the rights of citizens" is right on target. They are called Democrats.
Tom Ascher
Punchline, missed
Stowe, Vt.: Only ignorant fools, your editorial board it appears, would suggest Irving Berlin's "White Christmas" as racist ("Our songs, our eras," April 23). White refers to snow, period. No hidden agenda or meaning, just a snow covered landscape.
John Stead Marhefka
Support fur babies
Old Orchard Beach, Maine: It is a sad day when the only no-kill animal shelter in the Bronx, where I used to live, had to shut down due to lack of funds. The New Beginning Animal Rescue, started by Pedro Rosario, was a place where many unwanted and abused dogs and cats would get a second chance to find their forever home. Pedro opened this rescue with his own money and private donations which was the only thing that sustained it for many years. He received no help from the borough, the city or the state. So now the powers-that-be have decided to open a shelter in Co-Op City where it will definitely not be no-kill. There was a perfectly good no-kill rescue operation up and running. We let that one close down and decide to open up one that will kill these unwanted, discarded and abused animals? We need to make better decisions. Kim Schwickrath
Pigskin loyalty
South Amboy, N.J.: Really Daily News? You don't even try to hide the fact that you are biased where the Jets and Giants are concerned! Let's put the Giants draft pick on the back page, and oh wait, I think someone said there is another New York football team, someone get me a tiny pick of the Jets draft pick. Phew, that was close! You suck! Lorraine Dietz
More cats' meow
Great Neck, L.I.: We, Lucky and Bobby, the cats of Walden Place have a fish bone to pick with you. Your comic pages have been publishing dog propaganda for far too long. We love "Mutts" because it features Mooch, the cat. But there are only rare sightings of Atilla, in "Mother Goose and Grimm" and Ninja Kitty in "One Big Happy." While our secretary, Wendy, likes "Red and Rover," we feel slighted. We demand news that cats can use. Please start running "Breaking Cat News" by Georgia Dunn or we will leave hairballs in your shoes.
Wendy Penner
Too little, too late
Brooklyn: The plan of having 100% electric buses by 2040 is great, the pace not so much. It's going to be difficult to live up to that commitment when the plan has only taken into account 10% of the fleet, and there are only three on-street charging stations. Perhaps Mayor de Blasio and Gov. Cuomo could help speed things up. The governor could set targets for transportation emissions and our mayor could make sure street charging stations become more plentiful. We need a coordinated effort here if we want to have all our buses electric by 2040.
Catherine Orrok
Let's play nice
Norwalk, Conn.: I too am concerned about the rising level of ugly rhetoric in the letters. There are increasing number of Trump supporters who feel empowered to curse at or demean their fellow citizens. I feel badly for them - incapable of having a discussion but willing to brand fellow Americans as ignorant. Sad. Just because we see the person in the White House for who he is: racist, misogynistic, untruthful and anti-law. And that's just what he happily admits to.
Stefanie Pont
Nicely done
Staten Island: It was refreshing to see true journalism by your guest writer, Jillian Abbotts ("Sri Lanka and the burdens of history," Op-Ed, April 24). Informative, well-written and thought provoking. I didn't know much about Sri Lanka prior to it, but came away enlightened with an actual thirst for continued knowledge of their situation. A true piece of journalism, casting a foundation with facts and thoughts, leaving readers to their own assessments and creating a developing interest.
GlennRamanauskas
Bring back Stasi
Manhattan: Each Sunday, I open my Daily News hoping that Linda Stasi's column will reappear. She is bright and tough with the politicians and politics of both parties. Is she too controversial for some readers? I think she shines a light where it should be, like it or not. Marilyn Levin

Texto completo: I have been attacked in recent days by President Trump and others for my conviction that people who are incarcerated should be given the right to vote. I make no apologies for that position.
Our country has had a long and shameful history of voter suppression. At our founding, despite rhetoric to the contrary, only land-owning white males were given the right to participate in our democracy. Lower income people, Women, Native Americans, African-Americans, and young people were excluded.
We have been engaged in an ongoing 243-year project to expand participation in our democracy. Thankfully, we have made much progress in that struggle. But our work is not done — not even close.
If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must firmly establish that the right to vote is an inalienable and universal principle that applies to all American citizens 18 years and older. Period. As American citizens all of us are entitled to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly and all the other freedoms enshrined in our Bill of Rights. We are also entitled to vote. Yes. Even if Trump’s former campaign manager and personal lawyer end up in jail, they should still be able to vote — regardless of who they cast their vote for.

Voters finally found a way to get things done and now politicians are thwarting them
Voting problems are predictable and avoidable. Here's how to fix them before 2020.
Death blow to partisan gerrymandering? Supreme Court has a chance to make all votes count
This is not a radical idea. Vermont and Maine allow inmates to vote and more than 30 nations — including Israel, South Africa, and Canada — also understand that voting rights for all citizens is a basic principle of democracy.
When we look at the history of why our country has banned incarcerated people from voting, we must understand that the efforts to rob citizens of their voting rights was a legacy of slavery and continuing racist attitudes post-Jim Crow. After the ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, which extended civil and legal protections to formerly enslaved people, many state governments rushed to create new felonies to put black people in jail and then institute lifetime disenfranchisement as a way to protect their own privilege and power.
A way to suppress people of color
Indeed, our present-day crisis of mass incarceration has become a tool of voter suppression. Today, over 4. 5 million Americans — disproportionately people of color — have lost their right to vote because they have served time in jail or prison for a felony conviction.
It goes without saying that someone who commits a serious crime must pay his or her debt to society. But punishment for a crime, or keeping dangerous people behind bars, does not cause people to lose their rights to citizenship. It should not cause them to lose their right to vote.
This should not devolve into a debate about whether certain people are “good enough” to have the right to vote. Voting is not a privilege. It is a right. In my view, the crooks on Wall Street who caused the great recession of 2008 that hurt millions of Americans are not "good" people. But they have the right to vote, and it should never be taken away.
Voting is a right we all should have
The reason why this issue is so important right now is that Trump and cowardly Republican politicians all over this country are working overtime to suppress the vote. Instead of trying to increase voter turnout, they are making it harder for people to participate in the political process.
In Florida, the Republican legislature is trying to undermine the will of 64 percent of the people who voted to reenfranchise formerly incarcerated people. In Georgia, we have a Republican governor who took office by instituting barriers to voting for people of color. In Tennessee, the Republican legislature is trying to shut down groups who do voter registration work. In New Hampshire and Iowa, the Republicans have tried to make it harder for college students to vote.
The point here is simple. At a time when voting suppression is taking place all across the country, we must make it clear that casting a ballot for American citizens is not a privilege. It is a right. If you’re an American citizen who is 18 years or older you must be able to vote, whether you're in jail or not.

Texto completo: A small high school nestled in a tiny northern Maine town bordering Canada was named the second-best public high school in the nation Tuesday in US News & World Report's annual rankings.
Maine School of Science and Mathematics' dean of enrollment Alan Whittemore was giddy with excitement Tuesday morning.
“We know what we're doing up here, but for us, as a small school on the fringes of Maine, to be recognized nationally — for others to take hold of the data and say we're worthy of being second in the nation — I'm still numbed by it. It's a great feeling," he said.
Whittemore said he hardly slept last night.
The elite school had fared well in the popular rankings in previous years — placing as high as 19th in 2017 — so he and other staff were anticipating the list's release, which was scheduled for 12:01 a.m.
Whittemore said he checked the US News website around when the rankings were set to be published and couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the school listed as No. 2 in the country.
“I immediately think it's one of those [online] tracking things, that they know I'm from Maine. This is some sort of joke," he said. “A hoax."
He called another staffer at the school, who didn't buy Whittemore's claim. Then the staffer checked the website himself and said, “Holy expletive!" Whittemore recalled, censoring his colleague's remarks.
“I've been on a cloud since then," Whittemore said, adding that the school was buzzing with energy and enthusiasm Tuesday morning. “People are pretty happy around here today."
The school scored a 99.99 out of 100 on the rankings, just a hair behind Academic Magnet High School in North Charleston, S.C.
US News says its rankings are based on six factors: reading and math proficiency, reading and math performance, underserved student performance, college curriculum breadth, graduation rates, and college readiness, which is measured by participation and performance on AP and IB exams.
The methodology used by US News, and the various approaches taken by other players in the cottage industry of ranking high schools and colleges, have faced criticism in the past.
The company's chief data strategist Robert Morse said in a statement that US News this year “enhanced the methodology to provide an even more comprehensive ranking that is easier to understand and, therefore, more useful to parents and educators."
The Maine School of Science and Mathematics, located about a five-hour drive north from Portland, is a magnet school specializing in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering, and math.
Its 145 students hail from all across Maine and live in an on-campus dormitory. Tuition is paid by the state and need-based financial aid is available to help cover room and board, which was set at $9,300 for the current school year.
All the faculty hold at least a master's degree. Half have a doctorate, Whittemore said.
Students can earn an associate's degree while in high school, through a partnership with the University of Maine.
Graduates have gone on to prestigious colleges — including MIT, Johns Hopkins, RIT, WPI, CalTech, UC Berkeley, and several of the Ivy League universities.
Whittemore said the high schoolers are socioeconomically diverse. And they're a talented bunch, but “they're not the know-it-alls."
“This school is for the kids who don't know everything yet, but who want to know everything — they want the chance," he said.
Students' Monday-to-Friday schedules resemble college life, with occasional gaps during the day between classes and some night courses, Whittemore said. Students get weekends to relax, but by Sunday afternoon many are prepping for the week ahead or participating in study groups.
Every four weeks, for at least four days, students are given a break away from the remote campus in Limestone, a 40 square-mile town home to only about 2,000 residents. They board buses that shuttle them to their parents in other parts of Maine.
US News, on its website, said the school “aims to foster a community learning environment by offering small class sizes, extracurricular activities and work assignments," and noted how its curriculum “includes Advanced Placement courses in physics, English and statistics," and that students get internship opportunities and can conduct research projects.
The school opened in 1995, said Whittemore, 61, who was the first employee hired back then.
He said it has consistently been named Maine's best public high school by the US News rankings.
Nationally, the school has ranked well in some years. But in other years, including just last year, the school has been missing entirely from the outlet's list of the top high schools nationally, Whittemore said.
Whittemore said he didn't know why that has happened but wondered whether perhaps the school's graduating class was too small to qualify for the national list in some years.
Whittemore on Tuesday said the school's second-place ranking was a much-appreciated reward for a job well done — and motivation to keep trying harder.
“We still have room for improvement. We're not done yet. We're not resting on our laurels. That's for sure," said Whittemore. “Next year's No. 1."

Texto completo: This month, the Penobscot Marine Museum in Searsport finished preserving, scanning and cataloging National Fisherman magazine's massive photographic archive. The images were stuffed into filing cabinets at the publication's Portland office for decades. Now, every image is online, in a searchable database, for the whole world to see for free.
The broad ranging archive reveals the compelling, gritty world of commercial fishing. The collection of prints and negatives originally accompanied stories and advertisements. They show emerging technology, as well as everyday fisherfolk hauling nets, processing the catch, repairing trawlers, building boats and setting Coast Guard buoys.
[image id="2801771" size="full" pos="center" /]
The Penobscot Marine Museum's mission is to preserve, interpret, and celebrate the maritime culture of the Penobscot Bay region. The museum dedicates significant resources to preserving historic photographs. It currently holds more than 140,000 negatives, prints, slides, postcards and daguerreotypes. All are available for research, reproduction and licensing.
National Fishermen is still published by Diversified Communications. It's headquartered on Commercial Street in Portland. It covers the fishing industry all over the country. It began publishing in Camden in 1946 as Maine Coast Fisherman. Over the ensuing decades, it bought and consolidated several regional fisheries magazines. It became National Fisherman in 1960.
[image id="2801765" size="full" pos="center" /]
The BDN recently spoke with the museum's Digital Curator, Matt Wheeler.
Q: As I understand it, recently retired Penobscot Marine Museum Curator Ben Fuller negotiated the donation of these materials. Is that right?
A: He knew that these analog photos -- prints and negatives -- were sitting in file cabinets there and mostly not being used or seen. Ben knew it would be a great fit for our collection so he started courting the editors, stopping in to talk to them, looking over what they had there. Eventually, they agreed we'd be an ideal final destination for the photographs.
Kevin Johnson [museum photo archivist] and I drove down to Portland in 2012 and loaded up these four file cabinets.
[image id="2801768" size="full" pos="center" /]
Q: Wait, you took the file cabinets and all? Not just the contents, but the actual cabinets?
A: Exactly. [laughing]
Q: What time period do these photos cover?
A: From the origins of the magazine in the early 60s, all the way up to when they went digital with their photos in the mid 90s. There's some earlier stuff in there, too, some pictures from Atlantic Fisherman [an earlier publication consolidated by National Fisherman]. The total object count is close to 25,000.
[image id="2801769" size="full" pos="center" /]
Q: Holy mackerel. You digitized and cataloged all of that?
A: We did, yeah. It's been a long road. There's so much there that's great, powerful and evocative -- ranging from crews at work on deck of fishing trawlers, to people tonging for oysters in the Chesapeake Bay and
Q: These aren't just local, Maine photos? These are fishermen from all over the country?
A: That's right. National Fisherman is this conglomeration of all kinds of regional fisheries magazines. That's one of the reasons we feel the collection is valuable and has the potential to benefit a broad community.
[image id="2801770" size="full" pos="center" /]
Q: Why is it important to preserve and research these old images?
A: That's a great question and it dovetails into the larger question of how do you get people to notice these photos in this age where there are hundreds of millions of images being made and shared every day -- that's a tough question. These images are important because they're a timeline, revealing a lot -- strictly on a visual level -- about how this very important industry has changed over the decades. After WWII, a lot of technology emerged that changed fisheries forever. There's a lot of cultural and historic significance to these images.
[image id="2801763" size="full" pos="center" /]
Q: These photos fascinate me. I'm old enough to recognize the look of some of the people in them. They remind me of my great uncle, who was a lobsterman, and his fishing buddies. They were all characters. They all had salty nicknames.
A: I'm with you, Troy. For me, the most powerful photographs are the photographs of people. That's one of the things I like best about this collection. There's so many photos of fishermen, captains, crews -- people in fish processing. I think you can discern something about the character of these people by looking at their photograph. It's great to see people who are, you know, a little "seasoned" and rough around the edges -- guys with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths while hauling a trap or weighing fish -- guys working, shirtless. It says so much, culturally.
Q: Such tough old salts.
A: Even the more recent photos are great. How many people know what the deck of a stern trawler looks like? What the fishermen's faces look like? Not many.
Q: I guess a lot more will know now that your collection is online. Thanks for taking the time to talk to me.
A: Thanks for your interest. I think there's a good future for this stuff.

Passamaquoddy police chief charged with emptying fellow elver fisherman's net

Texto completo: The police chief of the Passamaquoddy tribe's community at Indian Township is facing a misdemeanor criminal charge in Hancock County for allegedly removing baby eels, also known as elvers, from someone else's fishing net, according to officials.
Alexander Nicholas I, 55, and his son, Alexander Nicholas II, 37, each are facing a Class D charge of emptying another fisherman's net as a result of the same incident, Hancock County District Attorney Matthew Foster said Monday.
Jeff Nichols, spokesman for the Maine Department of Marine Resources, on Monday confirmed that the Passamaquoddy police chief is facing the Class D charge for the alleged fishing violation.
Class D crimes in Maine are punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $2,000 fine.
Attempts Monday and Tuesday to contact Nicholas, the tribal police chief, were unsuccessful. Nicholas also is an elected member of Indian Township's tribal council.
The incident involving the duo occurred April 7 in Orland at a site on the Orland River off Route 175, also known as Castine Road, officials said.
According to Foster, Marine Patrol officers went to investigate after receiving a complaint about littering at the property, and then came across the father and son tending to fyke nets, which are large, funnel-shaped stationary nets that fishermen set up along the edge of tidal rivers. He said the duo was part of a quartet of licensed fishermen who had set up their nets together. The other two fishermen were not present when the Marine Patrol officers observed the father and son emptying out one of the nets that did not belong to either of them.
Maine state law requires every fyke net to bear a tag that displays the name of the elver license holder who owns the net. Only that license holder is permitted to remove elvers from his or her net.
Nichols said there were a quarter pound of elvers involved in the incident. Prices have varied since the season started in late March, with the average statewide price rising from around $1,600 a pound on opening day to more than $2,000 per pound on April 28, according to DMR statistics.
Foster said the Marine Patrol allowed the fisherman whose net was emptied to keep the elvers, which had been legally caught.
The Nicholases are scheduled to appear in court in Ellsworth on June 4.
Maine is one of only two states that allow fishing for baby eels. It is one of the most lucrative fisheries in Maine and by far the most valuable per pound.
There typically are between 2,000 and 2,500 elvers in one pound. The vast majority of elvers caught in Maine are shipped to Asia where they are reared in aquaculture ponds and then harvested for the global seafood market, primarily for use in sushi.

Texto completo: Fred Lear's professional mixed martial arts debut came up short as North Carolinian Bryan Bullock scored a second-round stoppage of the Bangor fighter during Saturday night's NEF 38 show held in front of 1,100 fans at the Aura nightclub in Portland.
Lear, who entered the pro ranks after compiling a 6-2-1 amateur record, controlled much of the first round of the scheduled three-round bantamweight contest but got caught in a guillotine choke while working a takedown late in the second period.
The tapout came at 4:12 of the five-minute period, when Bullock improved his professional record to 2-0.
Among other professional fights on the card, former two-time Class C wrestling state champion Caleb Hall of Dirigo High School in Dixfield boosted his pro record to 3-0 with a first-round submission of journeyman Jay Ellis. Hall fights out of the Choi Institute in Portland.
The amateur portion of the fight card featured four New England Fights title bouts.
Tom Pagliarulo (3-1) of Haverhill, Massachusetts, won the vacant NEF amateur featherweight title with a unanimous-decision victory over Zac Richard of Waterboro. Richard (3-1-1) was coming off a five-round draw with Lear in their battle for the vacant title in February at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor.
Duncan Smith of Evolution Athletix in Saco (5-3) defended his NEF amateur welterweight title with a unanimous decision over Jon Tefft (2-1) of First Class Fitness & MMA in Brunswick.
Massachusetts-based Taylor Thompson (4-0) stopped Michigan's Andrea Howland (2-1) by first-round armbar to become the first NEF women's amateur bantamweight champion.
Kam Arnold (5-0) of Central Maine Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in Lewiston scored his fifth straight knockout victory; he stopped Henry Clark (5-5) of the Choi Institute to retain the NEF amateur bantamweight belt.
The fight promotion also announced several fights for its next show, NEF 39 on June 22 at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston.
Among the headliners will be Bangor-area pro Josh Harvey (6-0-1), who will defend his NEF featherweight championship against Jordan Downey (5-4) of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Harvey will make his first defense of the title he captured this past February in Bangor, while Downey enters the contest on a two-fight winning streak.
Nate Boucher (4-3) of CMBJJ will face Robert Presley (5-4) for the vacant NEF amateur flyweight title. Boucher has finished his last two opponents in the first round to move into contention for the 125-pound belt. Presley represents the Lancaster (Ohio) Academy of MMA.

Texto completo: The Presque Isle Police Department and other authorities are still trying to locate two boys taken out of state in an alleged custody dispute, and say they now know what vehicle the father is likely driving.
Presque Isle Police Detective Chris Beck has said Joel Strother, who has live in the Madawaska area, took his sons Joel II, 12, and Carter III, 10, out of state against their will and against the wishes of their mother, who lives in the Presque Isle area.

The police believe that the Strother left Maine with the boys heading toward the southern United States.
On Tuesday, the Presque Isle Police Department said that officers determined that Strother has taken the children to Florida and is driving a 2006 pewter-colored GMC Terrain SUV with temporary registration plates.
Joel Strother II has brown hair, green eyes and is about 5-feet tall, according to police. Carter Strother III has brown hair, brown eyes and is 4-foot-6, according to police.
"As of late last week a felony level warrant was issued for the arrest of Joel Strother, which he is aware of," the department said.

Beck said previously that the Presque Isle Police Department had been investigating the case going back several weeks and recently asked for the public's help in locating the boys and their father.
"He has violated the custody agreement," Beck said. "He has basically hidden the children. There has been no communication from Mr. Strother or from the two children to their mother."
Anyone with information is asked to contact the Presque Isle Police Department at (207) 764-4476.

Texto completo: ORONO, Maine -- University of Maine redshirt freshman safety Richard Carr was about to make an important phone call to his mother, Kanitra Alston.
After Saturday's 15th annual Jeff Cole Memorial Blue-White Spring Game, UMaine head football coach Nick Charlton awarded Carr a full scholarship in front of his teammates and coaches.
"I know she's going to cry," Carr said. "I've got to prepare myself for that."
The awarding of a full scholarship to a deserving player after the Cole Game has become a tradition at UMaine.
Last season, Carr appeared in 13 games, tied for the team lead with three interceptions and was involved in 26 tackles. He posted 3 1/2 tackles for a loss and registered four pass breakups.
The Philadelphia native said he was surprised to learn about the development.
"I was happy grateful thankful," Carr said. "I can't wait to call my mom and my dad (Richard Carr Sr.). They made so many sacrifices for me to go here [to school]."
Charlton said Carr is talented and has already become a leader.
"He works tirelessly every single day," Charlton said. "He has a chip on his shoulder," Charlton added.
UMaine sophomore quarterback Chris Ferguson is well acquainted with Carr's football attributes.
"He picked me off in high school and took it to the house [for a touchdown] in a championship game," Ferguson said with a grin. "To see a kid, especially from our area, to come up here, work his tail off, start off on special teams and play his way into our defense is a big thing."
Carr came to UMaine two years ago and redshirted his first year. He played on special teams at the beginning of last season and earned his way into the lineup as a safety.
"I thought special teams was going to be it," Carr said. "But me making plays on special teams wound up with me getting to play defense and having a role on defense with so many great guys."
His season nearly came to a bitter end when he was assessed a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the 23-18 win at Weber State in the Football Championship Subdivision national quarterfinals. UMaine was leading 13-12 midway through the fourth quarter and Weber State, instead of having to punt the ball on fourth-and-17, wound up with a first down.
A Jeffrey DeVaughn interception bailed out Carr and the Black Bears.
"Honestly, that one play really brought me closer to a lot of guys on the team," said Carr, who expected his teammates to berate him.
"But they gave me positive vibes, told me to keep my head up and said we would still win the game," Carr said.
The 5-foot-8, 184-pound Carr was originally going to attend Bryant University in Rhode Island, "but the coaching staff got fired, and I lost my scholarship."
UMaine assistant coach Michael Ryan contacted him. Carr visited UMaine, liked the atmosphere and told his parents he was going to take a chance on himself.
"We're all under-recruited guys, even the scholarship guys because they could have played at FBS (Football Bowl Subdivision) schools but they didn't get any offers. We all have the same hunger here," Carr said.
He has high expectations for the upcoming season, as the defending Colonial Athletic Association champs look to repeat and make another deep FCS run. The Black Bears went 10-4 last season and reached the national semifinals for the first time in school history.
"I'm going to stay motivated," Carr said. "I'm not going to get comfortable." Being hungry got me where I am, earning this scholarship today."

Texto completo: A pair of missing Millinocket women were found Tuesday morning after a pilot with the Maine Warden Service spotted them on a remote logging road in western Piscataquis County.
Aprylle Tapley, 40, and her friend Tammy Michaud, 44, were last seen Sunday near the Golden Road and Telos Road intersection by a game warden near Ripogenus Dam on Chesuncook Lake, west of Baxter State Park, according to Mark Latti, a spokesman for the Maine Warden Service.
Tapley and Michaud became stuck after their 2016 Kia Sportage SUV struck a rock and punctured their oil pan on Caucomgomoc Road near Caucomgomoc Lake in T6 R15, Latti said. T6 R15 is located in western Piscataquis County.
Jeff Beach, a pilot with the warden service, spotted the pair about 8:30 a.m. Tuesday while searching for them. Ten game wardens who were searching the area for the pair then drove to their location to assist them in getting out of the area, Latti said.
A tow truck retrieved the disabled Kia.
Latti said game wardens have responded to several broken-down vehicles on Maine backcountry roads in the past week, and urged anyone traveling on remote roads to use caution and be prepared with the proper gear. He said to let someone know where you are going and when you expect to return.

When it comes to upcycling pallets, Pinterest doesn't have all the answers

Texto completo: It's estimated there are 2 billion wooden shipping pallets moving merchandise every day in North America. That's billion with a "b."
And when these pallets are done being used as shipping platforms, they are increasingly being upcycled in projects that can be found on the social network Pinterest, which is like an online bulletin board where you can save -- or "pin" -- images, projects or videos to find them later. It differs from social media sites like Facebook or Instagram in that on Pinterest the focus is finding and organizing content generated by other people, not storing your own.
The projects you pin sure are tempting, but what should you know before you fall too deep into creating them in real life?
Where do I find pallets in the real world?
Local retailers are a great place to find pallets. Businesses such as motorcycle or snowmobile dealerships, small grocery stores, farm supply stores and furniture stores and constructions sites receive merchandise and materials that has been packed on pallets. And the owners may well be looking for a no-cost way to get rid of them.
Be sure to ask first and do not just help yourself to a pile of discarded pallets stacked outside a businesses or building site. Some businesses do have arrangements with outside recycling companies that come pick up the pallets.
But if the pallets are destined for the landfill, and if you approach that business owner or manager to politely ask if you can have one or more, there is a good possibility you will leave with the base material for your pallet project.
According to a 2018 study published by the National Wooden Pallet and Container Association, 95 percent of all pallets produced in the United States are also reused as shipping platforms or recycled into something else.
So many people are upcycling these used pallets that they are among the most recycled item in the country, according to Stuart Isaacson, sales manager at PalletOne, a pallet-manufacturing company based in Florida.
Isaacson is based at the company's Maine plant, where they make pallets out of raw lumber and used pallets.
"Over here most of our pallets are on their 10th or 20th life," Isaacson said. "We never give or sell any of our pallets to the public, we use them all here in-house."
How do I know if pallets are safe to use?
But just because something is free and available does not mean it's safe to use.
"People need to be aware of where a pallet came from and what was stored on it," Isaacson said. "If it was used to ship vegetables there's no problem with it, but if it was used to ship batteries it could have spilled battery acid on it and that is a problem."
Every pallet has a history and if you know where and what to look for, there can be a lot of information on that pallet.
Quentin Jeandel has written extensively about pallet safety on the site 1001pallets.com and stresses the importance of using only clean pallets and to not try and guess what suspicious stains on a pallet could be, as many are used to transport toxic materials.
Nearly all pallets, according to Isaacson, are stamped with what look like random letters and symbols. But once you know what those all mean, your pallet's provenance comes alive.
What are those stamps?
The first thing to look for is the IPPC stamp on the pallet. This means the pallet has meets the requirements of the International Plant Protection Convention and are safe for international shipping.
The IPPC standards require that pallets be constructed without chemicals and from materials that are free from invasive insects and plant diseases.
Next, you want to look for the stamps indicating how the pallet was treated: "HT" -- heat treatment; "KD" -- kiln dried; "DB" -- debarked; or "MB" -- methyl bromide.
"Never use a pallet if you see the 'MB' stamp," Isaacson said. "That means it was treated with the toxic and carcinogenic chemical methyl bromide."
The good news, according to Issacson, is that the industry pretty much stopped using that chemical about 30 years ago.
Rather, pallet manufacturers now use a treatment that heats pallets to 140 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes.
"That will kill any bugs or bug larvae in the wood," Isaacson said. "Heat treated pallets are perfectly safe to handle."
Also safe to handle are kiln dried pallets. These have been heated long enough to bring down the moisture content, prevent warping and kill off any fungus.
Pallets stamped "DB" for debarking means the lumber used to make that pallet had the bark removed and the pallet itself was likely not treated beyond that.
DB pallets, according to Jeandel, are chemical-free and safe to use.
Pallets may have other stamps or symbols indicating country of origin, manufacturers location and other industry information and if you are unsure of what any stamp means, it's a good idea to pass up that particular pallet.
On its website, 1001pallets.com has a detailed breakdown of what the different symbols mean.
Are colored pallets safe?
Most pallets that find their way into DIYers' talented hands are natural wood that has not been painted. But there are colored pallets out there and a pallet's color has an origin story to tell, according to 1001pallets.com.
Red pallets manufactured in the U.S. are made from high quality lumber, kiln dried, not chemically treated and undergo rigorous third-party inspections. They will be stamped with the letters "PECO" for the Pallet Exchange Co.
Red pallets from Europe will be stamped "LPR" for La Palette Rouge and are used for international shipping.
Blue pallets are stamped "CHEP" for Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool from Australia while brown pallets are stamped "IPP" for Logipal from Europe.
Of the colored pallets, only the PECO pallets are guaranteed to be completely safe and in compliance with IPPC standards.
How do I safely pull apart a pallet?
Once you have established your pallet is safe to work with, it's time to break it down into usable pieces, and that means taking some safety measures, Isaacson said.
"These are really basic precautions," he said. "Use safety glasses, gloves and wear sturdy boots."
Pallets are held together with blunt-ended nails, so a simple crowbar can be enough to pull one apart.
"Leverage is key when pulling apart a pallet," Isaacson said. "Some people use a 'pallet breaker,' which looks like a long, two-pronged fork."
Pallet breakers are available from hardware outlets. Or you can make one yourself using plans and tutorials available online. Head back to Pinterest and search "pallet breakers." From there, click on any of the hundreds of links that will take you to websites with tutorials or plans developed by individuals to make a pallet breaking tool.
"When you're pulling the pallet apart, it's all about body position," Isaacson said. "You never want to be pulling toward your face in case something comes unexpectedly loose and you hit yourself in your face."
Once you have a pile of lumber that used to be a pallet, it's time to get creating.
With a bit of pallet knowledge, some basic tools and elbow grease it would seem there is no end to what pallets can become.

Penobscot County wants a design firm for a new, 300-bed jail

Texto completo: Penobscot County commissioners are seeking bids for architectural and engineering design services for a new, 300-bed jail to be built in the parking lot near the current facility in downtown Bangor.
Commissioners voted 3-0 last week to place the advertisement for bids, County Administrator Bill Collins said Monday. The ad ran in the weekend edition of the Bangor Daily News.
Firms wanting to bid on designing the new jail, estimated to cost between $65 million and $70 million, are required to send a representative to a 9 a.m. meeting next Monday at the historic Penobscot County Courthouse at 97 Hammond St. in Bangor.
Bids are due May 20, according to Collins. The winning bid could be awarded the next day or the following week, he said.
The decision to seek design bids came two weeks after an ad hoc jail advisory committee recommended for the second time that the county build a new, 300-bed facility instead of a 150-bed addition to the current jail, which has capacity for 157 inmates but has been consistently overcrowded. The addition option was estimated to cost $20 million to $30 million, though a projection done for the county showed the addition option would cost $20 million more than the new, 300-bed option over the course of 30 years.
Before construction could begin on a new facility, Penobscot County voters would have to approve money for a bond issue, or commissioners would have to find another way to pay for it. The deadline for getting a bond issue on the Nov. 5 ballot this year is late July or early August, Collins said. Commissioners have yet to vote to put the 300-bed facility proposal before voters.
Commissioners did not immediately return a request for comment Monday morning.
The jail has been overcrowded for more than a decade. With an average daily population of about 190 during the past year, inmates have been sleeping in rooms designed for high school equivalency diploma, literacy and parenting programs. Another 40 to 50 inmates are boarded at facilities in other counties, and between 70 and 85 participate in a pre-trial release program.
A national expert on jail operations earlier this month said that jails have become treatment facilities because of a lack of mental health treatment in communities and the opioid crisis, even though they weren't designed for that.
Carrie Hill, director of the National Center for Jail Operations in Alexandria, Virginia, was in Bangor on April 18 for the Maine Sheriffs Association's annual conference.
"As we are looking at jails and building new facilities, jails are more and more having to consider the treatment aspect," she said. "Questions that must be asked include: How are we providing beds for our mental health inmates? How are we providing beds to address substance abuse use?
Beds are no longer security beds."
The working concept for the new facility is a four-story building with the first level containing a secure entrance, booking area, kitchen and beds for 48 inmates in the process of either being released or booked into the facility. Those areas would be larger than what's needed for a 300-bed facility so that in 20 to 30 years, the county could more easily add a 120-bed addition to the back of the proposed facility.
The other floors would function as "mini-jails" with each floor having cells, recreation areas, rooms for programming and a control room for correctional officers.

A version of the "Medicare for all" bill championed by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, several of his rivals for the nomination and the two Democrats in Maine's congressional delegation is getting its first committee hearing on Tuesday.
It won't happen without full Democratic control of Washington, D.C., but the party is increasingly rallying around the concept -- alongside less sweeping ones such as public options -- as it tries to map a movement that will oust President Donald Trump in 2020.
Such a plan would ostensibly cover the 28.5 million estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau to be uninsured at cost estimates that vary widely but are generally above $3 trillion per year, though tax increases for many could be offset by reductions in premiums and other health care expenses.
Lost in some of the debate is the impact on the health care system. Maine's economy is the most reliant on hospitals among U.S. states, according to the American Hospital Association, and a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association predicted a negative revenue impact on hospitals from Medicare for All plans.
The impact of a Medicare for all plan would likely vary because of the different proportions of government and private insurance payors. The JAMA study, released earlier this month, found that hospital profit margins could go from 9 percent to 7 percent in the negative under a Medicare-for-all plan, assuming that the Medicare fee schedule was extended to all people. Currently, the fees paid by Medicare and Medicaid are less than the services cost to deliver, so patients with private insurers pay higher prices to subsidize that care.
The American Hospital Association opposes the Medicare for all concept, with a top official saying in February it would "disrupt coverage for the more than 180 million Americans who are covered by employer-sponsored health plans." The Maine Hospital Association has been quieter on it, but Jeff Austin, a lobbyist for the group, said it agrees with the national group.
Austin's group said in 2017 that Medicare and Medicaid paid about 53 percent of hospital bills then, while private insurers and self-pay patients paid 47 percent, though the latter group only constitutes about 39 percent of utilization. That payer mix was roughly in line with national estimates from 2014. However, those figures vary widely by region.
The payer mix in Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington was 80 percent governmental and 20 percent commercial and self-pay, according to a 2013 review. Maine Medical Center in Portland got 37 percent of payments from private payers in that fiscal year. The ones with more commercial payers have more to lose, though it's also probably unlikely that a plan would pass without accounting for that move in funding.
Austin said that phenomenon is largely why Maine hospitals "have big concerns moving from payers who more than cover their costs," though he said "cleaning up" the numbers of uninsured people would have positive impacts for hospitals. Hospitals also could offset some of this impact with administrative efficiencies. All of this underscores the future nuance of the debate over Medicaid for all as it gets more serious.
The two Democrats in Maine's congressional delegation are supporting the 'Medicare for all' bill, though they have taken slightly different paths. In a statement, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of the reliably liberal 1st District said her boss is "focused on solutions that will both reduce costs and ensure quality coverage for all Americans." She is a longtime supporter of a Medicare for all concept and joined a caucus aimed at promoting it last year.
U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of the more conservative 2nd District, is also sponsoring the bill and has released a "roadmap" for health care that gets to Medicare for all after steps including Medicaid expansion and a Medicare buy-in option for people between the ages of 50 and 64. His spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment on Monday.
Mills talks climate change
Gov. Janet Mills has scheduled a media event at noon today to talk about the Maine Climate Council. The Democrat has made combating climate change a priority of her administration since she was sworn in.
To date, most of that focus has been talking about how her administration will approach the issue, although she did commit the state to the U.S. Climate Alliance in February. Mills also used her second executive order to end a moratorium on many new wind projects that was put into place last year by former Gov. Paul LePage, her Republican predecessor who essentially put a state response to climate change on hold during his tenure.
We expect to hear more details from Mills today, as she takes questions on the Maine Climate Council a week after progressive Democrats had their day in the sun with a legislative hearing on Maine's version of the Green New Deal.
Today in A-town
The House and Senate convene this morning, and legislative committees will take up bills to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products and increase state oversight of opioid manufacturers. Proposals to control brown tail moth and other pest infestations are also ready for votes in the agriculture committee, and a handful of property tax relief bills for veterans could be voted on by the taxation committee.
The Judiciary Committee could vote on a bill from Senate President Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, that would bar prescription opioid manufacturers and distributors from falsely advertising a medication without abuse liability, distributing a quantity of medication or failing to report orders that are "not medically reasonable," according to the bill language. Failing to abide by these terms would result in a civil violation that the attorney general could investigate and applies retroactively to January of 1985. Tune in here.
The Health and Human Services Committee could vote on several bills, including one from Sen. Rebecca Millett, D-Cape Elizabeth, that would ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, including cigars, in Maine. Listen here.
The innovation and economic development committee could vote on a bill from Rep. Mattie Daughtry, D-Brunswick, to establish the Maine Workforce, Research and Development and Student Achievement Institute. Part of its role would be to provide recommendations to the Legislature on workforce development and economic advancement across the state. It sounds quite similar to a task force created in 2013, the last time Democrats controlled both chambers. Listen here.
Daughtry and Rep. Maureen Terry, D-Gorham, also have bills before the health coverage committee to allow women and children receiving supplemental food assistance to more easily purchase food from farmers markets. Listen here.
Reading list
-- In an effort to protect endangered whales, federal regulators proposed rules that would drastically affect lobster fishing. The Associated Press reports that a team organized by the federal government recommended last week that the number of vertical trap lines in the water be reduced by about half. The interstate Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission met Monday outside Washington to discuss the implementation of the new rules, which are designed to reduce serious injuries and deaths among whales by 60 percent. The effects of the rule changes are likely to be felt most heavily in Maine, which typically accounts for four-fifths of the total U.S. lobster catch.
-- Maine lawmakers again took a stance against limiting where people can bring their guns. Maine Public reports that the Legislature's State and Local Government Committee on Monday voted to recommend against passage of a bill that would allow cities and towns to ban guns at polling places and public meetings. The fact that some Democrats on the committee joined Republicans in opposing the measure signals that it's likely to fail when it moves to floor votes in the House and Senate.
-- A woman accused of killing a 4-year-old who was placed in her home by Maine child welfare authorities will learn her fate today. This afternoon, Superior Court Justice William Stokes is scheduled to hand down the verdict in the murder trial of Shawna Gatto, who is accused of killing Kendall Chick, 4, the grandaughter of her fiance, at home they shared in Wiscasset.
Salad days
Pasta salad is a staple dish at my family's cookouts, especially in the summer. It's usually prepared by my aunt Jane, who tosses fusilli, chopped onions, bell peppers, bits of salami, mild cheddar, celery and diced cherry tomatoes in a balsamic vinaigrette. It is not healthy, but its varied texture and flavor provides a welcome complement to grilled hamburgers and hot dogs, plain Lays potato chips, and my grandmother's deviled eggs. It is not uncommon to find me standing over the bowl with a fork after everyone has had their fill.
I broach this topic confidently because of a heated disagreement yesterday at the State House between myself, my colleague Mike Shepherd and our beloved boss, Robert Long. Part of acclimating to this beat, I've found, is mastering the ability to actually work while debating inconsequential topics in Slack, many of which are food related.
"Pasta salad is bad and should never be made," Mike said, admitting he's only now just coming around to potato salad, which he makes with sour cream, a bit of mayo, dill, mustard, celery, onion and lemon.
Robert quipped that the "only time pasta salad should ever be served is at large gatherings after funerals."
They're both wrong, and I told them in so many words, but the debate remained healthy and respectful. Here's your soundtrack. -- Alex Acquisto

Texto completo: Many turkey hunters spend much of their time sitting in one place -- either leaning up against a large tree or sitting on a stool in a ground blind -- while trying to call birds closer.
One veteran turkey hunter chooses to take the action to the toms, and doesn't spend much time in spots, such as hayfields, that are popular among other hunters.
Brhaun Parks of Glenburn has been turkey hunting for 24 years, and has helped countless friends and relatives fill their turkey tags. Parks often works a circuit of land parcels that he has permission to hunt, making a few calls to see if active toms are in the area, then moving in closer, if necessary, to set up an ambush.
"I like to do a lot of blind calling. I think it's just better than going and sitting in a field all day. I don't know how people can do that, sit in a blind and all that," Parks said on Monday, as he did the calling for friend Tom Boyd of Glenburn, along with BDN staffers Pete Warner and me.
Monday marked the opening day of wild turkey season for adult hunters in Maine. Youth hunters celebrated their own opener, Youth Turkey Day, on Saturday.
Parks has a pretty simple reason for his approach: Turkeys are easier to call in if they're in the woods than they are if they're out in the open in a field.

"You're already fighting nature when you're calling in a tom," Parks said. "The hen's supposed to go to the male. Not the other way around. So if you're in the woods you've got a really good chance of getting the tom to come up the ridge or down, or wherever you're at."
The key, of course, is to make sure you're taking the action to the toms safely. Every time a turkey hunter decides to move in order to get closer to a bird that they hear in the distance, there's a chance that they're actually moving closer to another hunter.
Knowing who else has permission to hunt on a piece of land can help. But being doubly sure of a potential target and what lies beyond it is essential for turkey hunters, who most often dress in camouflage clothing and try to blend in with the forest.
Parks said being flexible and learning from each bird is a key to success.
[Turkeys hunker down in steady rain, but young hunters still fill their tags]
"I think a mistake a lot of rookies make, people who are new to it, is they call too much. Or they read an article where it says, 'I've got to call every 15 minutes' and that's gonna bring a turkey in," he said. "But every bird is different. Some just want it nice and slow. We might have a bird coming up through so I've got to yelp every three or four minutes, and three sequences and he's here."
And here's a top trick that Parks said works quite often: Aggravate a female bird, and you might fill your tag on her potential mate.
"The most lethal way, I feel, to kill a turkey, believe it or not, if you can get a tom with a single hen, and you can get her mad, and she starts yelping back at you and cutting," he said. "You mimic her and she's going to come in looking for a fight with that hen and the tom's always right behind 'em."

Texto completo: Four stars: superior. Three stars: good. Two stars: average. One star: poor. D (drug use), L (language), N (nudity), S (sexual situations, references), V (violence). Ratings by Film Critic Dann Gire, unless otherwise noted.
Picks "Amazing Grace" — The long-lost Aretha Franklin concert film — which sat in a film vault for decades — finally sees the light. Filmed in 1972 by director Sydney Pollack, it gloriously captures Franklin at the absolute apex of her power. Reviewed by Jake Coyle, Associated Press. (G) 87 minutes. ? ? ? 1/2 "Avengers: Endgame" — Can Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) and Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) help the rest of the surviving Avengers — including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) — solve their intergalactic woes? "Endgame" picks up where "Infinity War" left off, delivering a satisfying, funny and emotional conclusion to 11 years of Marvel movies. Reviewed by Sean Stangland. L, V. 181 minutes. ? ? ? 1/2 "Diane" — Mary Kay Place offers an astonishing performance as a stoic widow and mother in near-constant motion doing for others in Kent Jones’ promising feature debut, a naturalistic portrait of service and self-sacrifice. Reviewed by Ann Hornaday, Washington Post. (NR) D, L. 96 minutes. ? ? ?
"High Life" — A man named Monte (Robert Pattinson) and a baby are the only survivors aboard a spaceship in Claire Denis’ provocative, difficult and bleak drama that slowly reveals what happened to them and their former shipmates. Reviewed by Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press. (R) L, N, S, V. 110 minutes. ? ? ?
"Hotel Mumbai" — Dev Patel and Armie Hammer star in a searingly realistic account of the three-day 2008 assault against India’s Taj Mahal Palace Hotel where terrorists killed defenseless, screaming people as Taj employees heroically tried to protect their guests. (R) L, V. 122 minutes. ? ? ?
"The Mustang" — Matthias Schoenaerts stars as a rage-filled inmate assigned to a prison horse training program in Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre’s feature debut, a powerful, emotional journey framed by gorgeous shots of the stark Nevada landscape. Reviewed by Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press. (R) D, L, V. 96 minutes. ? ? ?
"Penguins" — Ed Helms narrates the touching Disneynature feature, plus supplies the inner monologue for Steve, a bumbling, fumbling AdÃ©lie penguin just trying to be a good dad in the frigid, dangerous world of Antarctica. (PG) 76 minutes. ? ? ?
"Shazam!" — Smart writing and pitch-perfect casting power this charming origin tale about a jaded 14-year-old foster kid (Asher Angel) who gains superpowers and transforms into Shazam (a Spandex-clad Zachary Levi), who remains very much a kid despite his grown-up facade. Reviewed by Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press. (PG-13) L, S, V. 132 minutes. ? ? ? 1/2 "Teen Spirit" — A disarmingly irresistible Elle Fanning stars — and sings — in Max Minghella’s drama about a young woman’s dreams of music-making that avoids the cliched descent from pop stardom. With Croatian actor Zlatko Buric as her unlikely mentor. Reviewed by Michael O’Sullivan, Washington Post. (PG-13) D, S. 92 minutes. ? ? ?
"Us" — Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke play a married couple trying to protect their family from demented doppelgÃ¤ngers in Jordan Peele’s freaky and outrageously frightening horror/comedy, a parable about a divided America. (R) L, V. 116 minutes. ? ? ? ?
Passables "Breakthrough" — "This Is Us" star Chrissy Metz plays a mother who calls on prayer as her son (Marcel Ruiz) fights for his life in this mostly watchable and occasionally moving faith-based drama. With Josh Lucas and Topher Grace. Reviewed by Mark Jenkins, Washington Post. (PG) 116 minutes. ? ?
"Captain Marvel" — Brie Larson stars as a pilot discovering her superhero powers in this uneven origin story, the first female-led installment of Marvel’s Avengers franchise. While Larson shares an easygoing chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the visual effects underwhelm and the action seems clunky. Reviewed by Ann Hornaday, Washington Post. (PG-13) L, V. 124 minutes. ? ?
"The Chaperone" — An unhappily married woman (Elizabeth McGovern) volunteers to accompany 15-year-old silent screen actress Louise Brooks (Haley Lu Richardson) from Wichita to New York City in an intermittently effective but well-acted drama based on Laura Moriarty’s best-selling novel. Reviewed by Pat Padua, Washington Post. (NR) 108 minutes. ? ?
"The Curse of La Llorona" — The murderous "weeping woman" of Mexican legend goes after the children of a single mother (Patricia Velasquez) before turning her attentions to the family of her social worker (Linda Cardellini) in a so-so horror film that never lives up to its scary premise. Reviewed by Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press. (R) V. 93 minutes. ? ?
"Dumbo" — Tim Burton’s re-imagining of Walt Disney’s 1941 animated classic — about an elephant that can fly thanks to his massive ears — wows visually, but ultimately comes off as an emotionally challenged cautionary tale about evil capitalists. With Colin Farrell, Danny DeVito, Eva Green and Michael Keaton. (PG). 107 minutes. ? ? 1/2 "Five Feet Apart" — The chemistry between Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson covers a lot of dramatic potholes in the story of two teens with cystic fibrosis who fall for each other but can’t get physically close without putting their lives at risk. (PG-13) L, S. 120 minutes. ? ? 1/2 "Little" — Teen "black-ish" star Marsai Martin establishes herself as a comic force of nature in an otherwise conventional, screechy body-switch comedy starring Regina Hall as a bullying and belittling corporate CEO who wakes up in her 13-year-old body (Martin). With Issa Rae. (PG-13) S. 109 minutes. ? ?
"Missing Link" — A dashing explorer (voiced by Hugh Jackman) agrees to help a lonely, last-of-his-breed sasquatch (Zach Galifianakis) reach the Himalayas in a visually stunning but emotionally lacking animated adventure. Reviewed by Jane Horwitz, Washington Post. (PG) 95 minutes. ? ? 1/2 "Red Joan" — Judi Dench stars in a morally provocative — yet hardly pulse-pounding — spy tale, loosely based on a real woman in England. Sophie Cookson, meanwhile, plays the younger Joan in flashbacks, as she is radicalized by her Communist boyfriend and recruited by the KGB during World War II. Reviewed by Michael O’Sullivan, Washington Post. (R) N, S. 141 minutes. ? ? 1/2 "Pet Sematary" — The mean roads and mangy cats of Stephen King’s horror novel return from the dead in a vividly acted, blandly condensed remake revolving around a mysterious burial ground in rural Maine. With Jason Clarke and John Lithgow. Reviewed by Jake Coyle, Associated Press. (R) L, V. 101 minutes. ? ? 1/2 "Stockholm" — Robert Budreau’s film skews more toward a rom-com than a crime drama even though it’s billed as the "absurd but true" story of the 1973 crime that introduced Stockholm syndrome. Ethan Hawke charms as the swaggering robber whose hostage (Noomi Rapace) falls for him. Reviewed by Pat Padua, Washington Post. (R) L, S, V. 92 minutes. ? ? 1/2 Pits "Hellboy" — David Harbour takes over the title role in a gore-filled, flatly acted and incoherent reboot that features the demonic antihero facing off against the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich). Reviewed by Alan Zilberman, Washington Post. (R) L, V. 132 minutes. ? 1/2 Unpreviewed "After" — A guarded college freshman with a boyfriend meets a brooding rebel who makes her question her life and plans. (PG-13) S. 120 minutes.
"Family" — Taylor Schilling stars as an aunt who must go after her awkward niece, who has run off to join the Juggalos. (R) D, L, S. 83 minutes.

Texto completo: Sen. Duckworth returns to Iraq: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth has returned to Iraq for the first time since the helicopter she was piloting was shot down during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004. The Illinois Democrat said Friday that she led a bipartisan congressional delegation on a "whirlwind" trip last week. She says the delegation wanted to show its support for the people of Iraq and express "hope that Iraq will be an independent, strong country and a close ally of the United States for many years to come." Duckworth lost both legs when her Blackhawk was shot down. Joining her on the trip were Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine. They traveled to Baghdad, Taji, and Erbil, where they met with Iraq’s top leaders and received intelligence updates.
Shooting suspect alters plea: ANNAPOLIS, Md. — The man accused of killing five people at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, changed his plea Monday to not guilty by reason of insanity. Lawyers for Jarrod Ramos said in a court filing that the 39-year-old Ramos was not criminally responsible "because of a mental disorder." Monday’s filing in the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court also said he lacked the "capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct." Five people were fatally shot in June 2018 in the Capital Gazette newsroom. Ramos was indicted on 23 charges in the attack, including first-degree murder. Ramos had initially pleaded not guilty, and the change of plea maintains the not guilty plea.
Japan leader’s reign to end: TOKYO — Emperor Akihito is set to abdicate, as Japan embraces the end of his reign with an emotion mixed with reminiscence and hopes for a new era. Akihito, 85, in a palace ritual Tuesday, will announce his retirement before other members of the royal family and top government officials. He was to perform private palace rituals to report his retirement to Shinto gods ahead of the official ceremony. Akihito’s reign runs through midnight when his son Crown Prince Naruhito becomes new emperor and his era begins. Naruhito will ascend the Chrysanthemum throne in a separate ceremony on Wednesday.
Death toll rises after cyclones: PEMBA, Mozambique — More rain is forecast for northern Mozambique, where the death toll from Cyclone Kenneth jumped to 38, as flooding and pounding rains hampered efforts to deliver aid to badly hit communities several days after the storm. More flooding is expected in the northeastern port city of Pemba and the surrounding areas. An estimated 160,000 people are at risk from the second cyclone to hit the nation in just six weeks, officials said. It was the first time in recorded history that two cyclones had targeted Mozambique in a single season.
Police, FBI thwart rally attack: LOS ANGELES — An Army veteran who converted to Islam and discussed launching various terror attacks throughout Southern California was arrested as he plotted to bomb a white supremacist rally as retribution for the New Zealand mosque attacks, federal prosecutors said Monday. Mark Domingo, an infantryman who served a combat stint in Afghanistan, was arrested Friday after visiting a park where authorities said he planned to plant homemade explosive devices in advance of a Nazi rally scheduled Sunday. Domingo, 26, was arrested on a charge of providing material support to terrorists.

"Shazam!" — Smart writing and pitch-perfect casting power this charming origin tale about a jaded 14-year-old foster kid (Asher Angel) who gains superpowers and transforms into Shazam (a Spandex-clad Zachary Levi), who remains very much a kid despite his grown-up facade.

Marriott to expand further into home-sharing

Texto completo: Marriott is pushing more heavily into home-sharing, confident that its combination of luxury properties and loyalty points can lure travelers away from rivals like Airbnb.

The world's biggest hotel company will start taking reservations this week for 2,000 homes in 100 markets in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. It plans to expand its Homes and Villas program to other locations.

For its part, Airbnb is encroaching further into hotels. On Monday, the San Francisco-based company said it's working with a New York real estate developer to establish a 10-story hotel with 200 suites in Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan. The suites will only be available through Airbnb's web site.

Airbnb, which plans to go public but hasn't made clear when, also acquired Hotel Tonight, a last-minute booking service, in March.

Hospitality is one of several industries that's seeing traditional players and startups take tentative steps into each other's turf. Automakers are exploring ride-hailing. Ride-hailing companies are developing self-driving cars. Amazon is opening physical stores. Physical stores like Starbucks are experimenting with delivery.

Airbnb and Marriott will always have separate core strengths, but the convergence will continue, predicts Daniel Guttentag, an assistant professor of hospitality management at the College of Charleston School of Business

"Each of them wants to borrow some of the best elements of the other one's business," he said.

Marriott is targeting families and groups, and the homes skew toward luxury, with prices ranging from $200 per night for a one-bedroom apartment to $10,000 for a full Scottish castle. Nearly 40 of the markets are in places where Marriott doesn't currently have hotels, like Bar Harbor, Maine and Bordeaux, France.

Marriott is a long way from matching home-sharing behemoths like Airbnb, which boasts 6 million listings worldwide, or Booking.com, which has listings in 220 countries. The homes in its program aren't even exclusive Marriott properties. Marriott is partnering with rental management companies to handle the maintenance and cleaning.

But Marriott believes it has advantages. Unlike its home-sharing rivals, it has a loyalty program that lets travelers earn and use points on its hotels and homes. Business travelers can accumulate points at Courtyard hotels, for example, and use them for a week at a beach house. Airbnb is working on a loyalty program of its own, but the rollout has been delayed.

Marriott says it also guarantees hotel-like standards that are often missing in home-sharing, such as Wi-Fi, crisp white sheets, bath amenities, baby cribs and smoke alarms. Airbnb has tried to tackle that problem with user reviews and its Plus program, which highlights rentals that meet higher quality standards. But the sheer volume of properties makes it difficult to police them all.

"One of the challenges you see with home-sharing is there's too much inventory without quality filters or brand assurances," says Stephanie Linnartz, Marriott's global chief commercial officer.

Hotels have struggled to determine the right path into the home-sharing market. Hyatt invested in Oasis, a luxury home-sharing site, in 2017, but said regulatory hurdles hampered Oasis's growth. The companies parted ways last year.

AccorHotels bought home-sharing site Onefinestay in 2016 but has struggled to make money on it. Choice Hotels, like Marriott, partnered with property management company RedAwning and gets a cut of every property booked.

For now, the home-sharing unit won't be material to Marriott's earnings, Linnartz said.

Marriott's move is an acknowledgment that home-sharing -- which has boomed in the last decade since Airbnb's founding -- has fundamentally changed guests' expectations. People may be satisfied with a traditional hotel for a business trip or a soccer tournament, but sometimes they want something unique and memorable, Linnartz said.

At the same time, Airbnb is moving into hotels because there are customers -- particularly business travelers -- it's having a hard time reaching because of its couch-surfing reputation. But the risk is that it will lose its aura of coolness and authenticity and become just another big company offering hotel rooms, Guttentag said.

Marriott and Airbnb also have a shared vulnerability: They don't own the properties they're renting. That makes it easy to grow or shrink their offerings and insulates them financially. But it gives hosts the option to advertise on more than one site.

The biggest risk to Marriott, though, it probably its reputation, Guttentag said. If something bad happens at a rental property, Marriott may not be able to fix it quickly.

"Ultimately, in privately owned short term rentals, undesirable things are going to happen sometimes," Guttentag said. "They have to resolve to weather that storm."

Marriott began testing home-sharing with 200 homes in London last year and later expanded it to several other cities in Europe. The company found that most of its home-sharing guests were leisure travelers and they stayed an average of 5.1 nights, or double the length of a traditional hotel stay.

Marriott's research also showed that 30% of its customers had stayed in a shared home in the last year.

"When they were doing that, they weren't staying at an offering from us," Linnartz said. "This is a gap we want to close."

Texto completo: Stephen M. Silverman of West Hartford, beloved husband of Amy Lynn Silverman, passed away on Sunday, April 28, 2019 after a long and valiant struggle with Lewy Body Dementia and Parkinson's Disease. His kindness, gentleness and sense of humor helped him through the difficult years. Son of the late Irwin N. and Madeleine (Bob) Silverman, Steve was born May 11, 1938 in Brooklyn, NY, graduated from Classical High School in Providence, RI and from the University of Pennsylvania in 1960 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. Steve came to Hartford for a job at Pratt & Whitney and worked in the Turbo Power & Marine division for 23 years. He also worked for Combustion Engineering and International Systems. His work assignments took him to Israel on three occasions, twice to a gas platform in the North Sea, to Mexico and to various installations throughout the U.S. In retirement Steve worked as a contract Technical Writer and later drove for Enterprise Rent-A-Car. An avid sailor from the age of 12, Steve owned "Vector" (a 22' Ensign) and "Episode" (a 30' Catalina). He and Amy spent wonderful summers sailing to Maine, Block Island and Nantucket (their favorite place), the Cape, and all along the New England and New York coasts. An advocate of boating safety and education, Steve served as the Commander of the Hartford Power Squadron from 1997-99 and taught the Basic Boating and Piloting Courses for many years. Steve enjoyed a lively game of racquetball, both doubles and singles. A die-hard Yankee's fan, he rarely missed watching the team on TV. His other TV pleasure was watching the UConn Women play. For more than 25 years, Steve met for lunch at the Fernwood Restaurant with his former co-workers and friends from UTC and Turbo Power and Marine. Steve took great joy in his family and in his many friends and could find a smile when they visited.
Besides his loving wife, Amy, Steve is survived by his dearly loved and devoted step-daughters whom he considered his own daughters: Rachel Lynn Cohen of Gaithersburg, MD and Stephen Zack; Abbi Pollicita and her husband Vinny of West Hartford; and by his cherished granddaughters, Juliane Doscher and her partner Jon Abulencia, Raleigh Doscher, Halina and Meredie Cohen and Kaylee and Avery Pollicita. He was their much-loved Poppop. Steve is also survived by his brother-in-law George Cooke, his cousin Lisa Bob, MD, and Amy's brother and sister-in-law, Richard and Marcia Tretler and their children and grandchildren. Steve's dear sister Barbara Efrat predeceased him.
The family is grateful to the staff at Seabury Meadows and Seabury Brewer who provided Steve with excellent care during the years he resided there. His last days were made easier because of the compassionate care from McLean Hospice. His companion Jeff Weiser helped keep him active and engaged with others. Many caring and supportive friends including Miriam and Steve Miller, Judy and Stuart Levy, Carol and Burt Cunin and Ellen and Marty Abrams contributed to his well-being. The family can never thank them enough for their love and concern.
The funeral is scheduled for Tuesday, April 30, at 1pm, in the Chapel at Weinstein Mortuary, 640 Farmington Ave., Hartford, with Rabbi Debra Cantor officiating. Interment will follow in the B'nai Tikvoh-Sholom Cemetery, 10 Club House Rd., Windsor, CT. After the burial, mourners are invited to join the family and friends for a meal of consolation B'nai Tikvoh-Sholom Synagogue. Shiva will be observed at Amy's home from 7 to 9 pm Tuesday evening, with Minyan at 7:30. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Steve's memory may be made to the Stephen M. and Amy Lynn Silverman Family Fund at the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving, 10 Columbus Blvd., Hartford, CT 06106 or to the Lewy Body Dementia Association, 912 Killian Hill Road, S.W., Lilburn, GA 30047 or to a charity of the donor's choice.

Maryland Takes Step Toward Capping Drug Prices; Governor is poised to sign bill creating panel to review expensive prescription drugs and limit how much agencies will pay for them

Texto completo: Maryland is poised to become the first state to create a panel to review expensive prescription drugs and cap how much public agencies will pay for them.
The legislation, which cleared the state legislature in the waning moments of its session earlier in April, would be the first of its kind to allow prices for certain drugs to potentially be capped. The effort already has encouraged other states to take action, and lawmakers in Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts are considering legislation to create similar boards. The bill's backers say they are confident the measure can survive court challenges that have stalled other efforts in Maryland and elsewhere on drug-price reform.
Maryland's bill is the latest volley in a drug-pricing debate that has consumed state and federal lawmakers, who say high drug prices are hurting consumers and straining budgets for expenditures such as Medicaid and public-employee health insurance.
In the past few years, many states have tried to make drugs more affordable or increase transparency in how prices are determined as wholesale efforts to do so on the federal level have languished. Some have faltered, while others have been signed into law. In January, a new California law took effect requiring drug companies to provide 60 days' notice of significant increases to large purchasers of medicines.
Around 250,000 public employees and dependents, as well as state purchasers, such as prisons and hospitals, will be affected by the Maryland legislation, according to supporters. The state has had a hospital rate-review board for more than four decades, which proponents say validates the approach. Gov. Larry Hogan has until the end of May to sign the bill before it goes into effect automatically.
The new legislation creates a five-person board tasked with identifying drugs that may be too expensive for patients or governments, and then submitting an analysis and recommendations to the legislature. The board could begin setting payment caps in 2022.
The board will review, and potentially cap, drugs mainly in three categories: Those that launch at a list price of at least $30,000 for a year or for a course of treatment; branded drugs that increase by at least $3,000 over that same period; and some generic drugs that go up in price by at least 200%. In addition, the board has discretion to single out any prescription drugs that the board deems unaffordable for the state.
At least 25 prescription drugs were launched in 2018 at prices exceeding a list price of $30,000 annually or for the course of treatment, according to an analysis for The Wall Street Journal by GoodRx , a group that compares pharmacy prices for prescription drugs. Its analysis doesn't include hospital-administered drugs.
Maryland's last attempt to revamp drug pricing was defeated. A 2017 effort to prohibit "price gouging" of generic drugs failed after a court challenge from the generics trade group, the Association for Accessible Medicines.
This year, the AAM neither opposed nor supported the bill. The organization was neutral because the legislation wasn't trying to regulate drugs beyond the state's jurisdiction, includes branded drugs, and allows for a deliberative review process, said Jeff Francer, AAM's general counsel. He said most generic drugs will be unaffected.
The industry's biggest lobbying group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, opposed Maryland's legislation. In testimony to Maryland lawmakers, PhRMA's lobbyist Josh White said public workers would be a "guinea pig" for a health-care law that could lead to drug shortages and reduced access to lifesaving medicines.

A spokesman for PhRMA declined to say whether the organization would fight the policy in court should Gov. Hogan sign it, although the organization has challenged other efforts. In a statement, PhRMA said price controls are unconstitutional.
If Maryland's bill goes into law and survives legal challenges, more states will be inspired and potentially create a patchwork of different drug-pricing state commissions, which would be a "headache" for the industry, said Ronny Gal, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers drugmakers.
"I don't know why all states won't do it," he said.

How involved should the government be in determining drug prices? Join the conversation below.
The bill was pushed by the Maryland Citizens' Health Initiative, an advocacy group that is partially funded by organizations backed by John and Laura Arnold, billionaires who want to make drugs more affordable. Their efforts have been criticized by drugmakers as they have spent millions and raised their profiles in recent years.
Maryland's bill isn't designed to deprive pharmaceutical companies of revenue but rather increase sales by volume instead of price, said Jane Horvath, a consultant who helped design the bill and wants to expand its scope to commercial plans. She has worked with the National Academy for State Health Policy, which has received funds from Arnold entities.
Ms. Horvath said she doesn't believe patients wouldn't be able to access their drugs.

GM Keim's future tied to QB Murray

Texto completo: It might have been the most important draft pick the Cardinals have made in their entire 100-year history. There's no question it was the most critical pick in Steve Keim's seven-year tenure as general manager.
His job security, after all, was clearly on the line after three consecutive non-winning seasons, including last year's 3-13 debacle which resulted in the firing of first-year head coach Steve Wilks.
Although it's true his Cardinals teams averaged 11.3 wins during his first three years in charge of the front office, it's also true that 26 of Keim's 42 draft selections — and three former first-round picks — are no longer with the franchise.
Gone also is his entire draft class from 2013 and 2014.
So when it came to deciding what to do with the first overall pick in this year's draft, Keim and the Cardinals couldn't afford to miss. Time will tell if they got it right by taking former Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray instead of making the perceived safer choice by going with edge rusher Nick Bosa or defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, but it's interesting as to what won over Keim in the end.
After watching countless tapes on Murray, Keim shut his eyes and simply tried to imagine what Murray would look like in a Cardinals uniform.
"When I closed my eyes and visualized Kyler Murray running around State Farm Stadium in red and white, for whatever reason, all I saw was just fireworks, excitement, a must-see (environment) where fans have to go and show up and see this thing," Keim told Peter King for Football Morning in America.
It was, in a sense, scouting through visualization. More than anything, though, it was Keim knowing he had to go for broke after firing one coaching staff and bringing in another, including a head coach in Kliff Kingsbury who has been dreaming of having Murray run his offense for years.
Kingsbury never once interfered in the process, Keim told King. The coach certainly expressed his opinions, but he steered clear of trying to influence Keim or team President Michael Bidwill to pick Murray.
"The thing I respect the most about Kliff is he never once interrupted the process," Keim said. "He never once came down and put his fist on the table and said, 'I want Kyler. I have to have him.' I knew that he loved him as a player, but he allowed the process to take care of itself. To me, that was the only way we were going to get it right."
Keim said he didn't start watching tape on Murray exclusively until sometime in March, after the scouting combine. As he told Arizona reporters following Thursday night's selection of Murray, he said he was hesitant to even watch the tape for fear he would fall in love with the player. But there was another reason why he was uneasy about getting overwhelmed from watching tape on the Heisman Trophy winner.
"I was reluctant to study him because I knew what we had in Josh Rosen," Keim told King. "As I watched the first game, I watched the second game and I couldn't put down the controller. All I wanted to do was keep watching this kid on tape. I don't know if I wrote down 'wow' 100 times or 500 times, but my hand got tired of writing it.
"I haven't seen a guy who could throw like him and run like him. I've seen guys who could do one of each, but I've never evaluated a guy who possesses the skill set to do both things at such a high level. I was also studying guys that I was falling in love with, like Nick Bosa, Quinnen Williams, really having to really weigh which player makes the biggest impact for us. It became crystal clear in the end it was Kyler Murray."
Most NFL writers are applauding Keim and the Cardinals for their 2019 draft overall, pointing out many of the high-value talent players they were able to secure with their first six picks, specifically. And while it's true that Keim will be measured by how this year's entire draft class pans out, he knows he will be judged the harshest based not only on how Murray performs, but also by how Rosen will fare now that he's been traded to the Dolphins.
By ultimately being the swing vote in favor of choosing Murray over Rosen, Keim essentially put his job and reputation on the line. As he told King, once he closed his eyes and imagined how Murray would capture everyone's attention and catapult the franchise into something completely different, he realized he had to go all-in on the first quarterback under 6-feet tall in 50 years to be drafted in the first round.
"I either visualize them or I just have bigger balls than my brains," Keim said. "I'm not scared to make a mistake. That could cost me my career but at the same time, to be great and to have success you've got to be willing to take chances – one that you believe in."
Keim isn't the only person who will be under intense scrutiny. Kingsbury, hired by the Cardinals despite a losing record in his six seasons as coach at Texas Tech, is on the hot seat as well. So is Murray now that he's taking over for a likable quarterback that was drafted 10th overall just a year ago.
King asked Kingsbury about that very subject in his column and the coach said he and Murray have already talked about it.
"I think both of us are competitive and have a chip on our shoulder," Kingsbury said. "What's been said out there ... Now it's time to go. We've heard all the talk and talking is done now. It'd about what we do from this point forward. When (Murray) came in here (Friday), we both kind of had that conversation and that mindset. That was more what our meeting was about."
Upon meeting with Arizona reporters for the first time on Friday, Murray vowed to prove the Cardinals made the right decision, saying, "I'm here to change things up."
"I mean 3-13, obviously, is unacceptable," he said. "I don't know what I would do myself if I ever had a season where I was 3-13. That's not the plan. I don't intend on losing much."
Etc. The Cardinals on Monday also announced the signing of 12 undrafted free agents: Murray State quarterback Drew Anderson, Maine tight end Drew Belcher, Ohio State linebacker Dante Booker, Wofford defensive lineman Miles Brown, Rutgers offensive lineman Tariq Cole, Pittsburgh linebacker James Folston Jr., Arkansas cornerback Ryan Pulley, Boise State receiver A.J. Richardson, North Carolina offensive lineman William Sweet, Louisiana Tech defensive lineman Immanuel Turner, Tarleton State running back Xavier Turner and Rutgers tight end Jerome Washington.

Texto completo: As the airplane rolled down the runway, there was a considerable amount of nervousness and struggle. My last marathon was in June of 2016 in Orono, Maine. My training for the Kentucky Derby Marathon was not what I would have liked, but it was enough to get me to the starting line with no significant injuries and still having hope that I could run fast enough to qualify for Boston 2020.
Last year Mary Jean signed up for the half and I signed up for the full, joining friends Felton Wright and Nick Yonclas, both of whom signed up for the marathon. Injuries converted us from runners into spectators though and we joined Barbara Yonclas and got a close look at the race from the sideline.
Logistically, this race, with both a half and full marathon, is well organized and easy on participants.The race starts and finishes in downtown Louisville and it seems there are an adequate number of hotel rooms for runners within a short walk of the start and finish lines. The half and the full share the same start and finish lines.
The races run together for approximately 11 miles, then split after coming out of Churchill Downs. The start and finish lines are just a few blocks away, making it easy to get to the start line race morning. It took me just under 2 minutes to get to the start line from my corral, but I was running the pace I wanted to run for the first mile shortly after crossing the line.
The race history contained on the webpage notes that the half marathon race began in 1974, making this year run number 46. The full marathon debuted in 2002. The webpage goes on to report "the mini-Marathon attracts more than 12,000 entrants each year and is ranked among the nation's top 100 races by USA Track and Field. The Marathon, which debuted in 2002, draws nearly 3,000 entrants." I found these numbers a little surprising and perhaps overstated.
My research suggested there were approximately 8,500 finishers in the half marathon and 1,500 in the marathon this year. Searching all the way back to 2002, the largest number of marathon finishers was 2,093, with 1,500 being much closer to the average.
Obviously, more people enter than finish, but those differences cast some doubt on the race organizers numbers. But the numbers were good for the logistics. I never felt I was running a lone on the course and there were enough runners to support a nice expo. The mad rush and crush of many big marathon's was missing.
Louisville, Kentucky has an estimated 771,158 residents when counting the consolidated county area, 621,349 if limit it to the pre-consolidated city limits. It is a friendly place that locals genuinely seem to like and be proud of. The Ohio River flows through the city and has been an important driver of commerce. In 2015 the river received the Environmental Protection Agency's most unflattering title of "Most Polluted River in the Country."
While Louisville works hard to protect and clean up its environment, the river pollutants apparently start well before the river reaches Louisville. For example, steal plants in Indiana account for a very large percent of the Ohio River's toxic chemicals. Mercury seems to be a problem as well.
Despite some struggles with the river, the city is home to the Kentucky Derby and Churchill Downs, the Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory, the Muhammad Ali Center (Museum) a minor league baseball team, the University of Louisville and three fortune 500 companies, one of which is Humana, the major sponsor of the Kentucky Derby races. In general, I think it is safe to say that Louisville has an active racing schedule with another marathon on the list and a number of half marathons.
The Kentucky Derby Festival Minimarathon and Marathon are part of (as the name implies) the Kentucky Derby Festival and this year preceded the Kentucky Derby Race by one week. Among the unique opportunities created by this race is the opportunity to run through Churchill Downs. Runners do not run on the dirt track (a good thing) but they do run on pavement through the infield.
We explored the marathon course closely last year by car. It winds through the city taking the runners out to Iroquois Park which contain some tough hills. Runners enter the park around mile 12 and leave it as they pass the 15-mile mark happy to leave the hilly park behind. It is a good course for a fast effort, but it is certainly not flat.
The crowds along the way are good and supportive, especially the last half mile or so.
I certainly needed them as I got near the finish and, I am most thankful for the awesome guy pacing a group of runners to a 3:49 finish time. I connected with his group late in the race and hung on as tightly as possible.
My final time was 3:48:30, good enough most likely to get into Boston. MJ ran her half marathon well, finishing strong. As to that prerace doubt and struggle, it will make a good story another day.

Texto completo: A little more than a year from now, all Vermonters will be expected to have broken a time-worn habit: scraping after-meal leftovers into the household trash.
They are likely to pay a little bit more for Earth-friendlier alternatives.
Kitchen scraps in the Green Mountain State will be banned from landfills on July 1, 2020.
It's not all good news for composters who must ramp up operations to handle the anticipated tsunami of apple cores, cheese rinds and spurned spinach.
A major challenge: How to responsibly dispose of food without charging folks an arm and a leg to do it?
Green Mountain Compost in Williston is already struggling to process institutional-scale truckloads of food waste that have been, by law, delivered there since 2014, said Michele Morris, spokeswoman for Chittenden Solid Waste District.
"We're operating at capacity, and we're not as cost-effective as our board would like," Morris said.
Every year, the facility transforms about 5,000 tons of rotting fruit, vegetables and meat into clean, safe fertilizer, she added, and in its current form, there's no way it could handle the anticipated annual influx of 10,000 tons.
Green Mountain Compost has already downsized its retail presence, and plan to restrict sales to wholesale loads in July.
That challenge in Vermont's most populous county prompted the state's Department of Environmental Conservation this month to award CSWD $500,000 to help engineer a fix.
Can we compost ourselves out of the problem? Expanding the compost business into adjacent land, which is owned by CSWD, would be an expensive and probably ill-conceived solution, Morris said.
District experts peg the price around $4.5 million. Demand for garden compost would unlikely rise with increased supplies (and would yield less profit), they add.
Instead, the district is moving toward a shift in emphasis: It would still create about 5,000 tons of compost every year, but would divert the rising surplus of raw materials to be reduced to a slurry.
That nutrient-rich stew, which Morris describes as having the appearance of liquid Spam, is the perfect food for a bacteria-run, electricity-generating "digester."
Hannaford supermarkets serve as a working model, Morris said.
Company-wide, the Maine-based chain annually trucks 80 to 100 tons of spoiled or beyond sale-date food to bio-digesters, which extract combustible methane from the mixture, said spokeswoman Ericka Dodge.
Hannaford is on track to eliminate food waste from all its New England stores by the end of this year through its slurry supply lines — and also by reducing spoilage and donating near-sell-by-date food to local charities, Dodge added.
Following that template, planners in Chittenden County figure that adding a local facility where scraps could be transferred elsewhere would cost about $770,000.
Leftovers to the rescue? A third option open to CSWD would be to process food scraps — even those still in their packaging — into slurry, on-site, where it might attract investors to harvest its methane for power generation. That investment would cost about $1.9 million.
Green Mountain Power, which has developed several small digester/generating plants, has shown an interest, according to CSWD board minutes from March 18.
The utility has nothing on the drawing board, but "is open to exploring opportunities," GMP spokeswoman Kirsten Kelly wrote in an email.
The waste district's board, meanwhile, continues to work on a budget for the upcoming fiscal year.

Texto completo: Take a look at your driver's license.
Go ahead, we'll wait while you fish it out of your wallet.
If your driver's license doesn't have a star in the upper corner of the card, then your license is not Real ID compliant. And if you're planning to take a domestic commercial flight any time after Oct 1, 2020, you'll need to take action, make some decisions or wait for your state to get its act together.
New Jersey is one of those states.
If you've recently gotten your license renewed, you'll notice you still don't have that Real ID star. The NJ MVC has not started issuing Real IDs, but plans to start to in the spring, Sandy Grossman, a spokesperson for the MVC said.
In the meantime, here's what you need to know about the upcoming changes.
What's Real ID? The Real ID Act is legislation passed in 2005 (in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks) that set new and higher minimum security standards for the driver's licenses and identification cards that will be accepted at airports, other federally regulated facilities and nuclear power plants.
Debates and pushback from some states over the impact of Real ID have created confusion and delayed the official rollout of the act's enforcement, but Oct. 1, 2020, is now considered the firm date for enforcement at commercial airports.
"The main pushback on REAL ID is that it's too Big Brother," said Jeff Price, an aviation security expert with Leading Edge Strategies. "It's a move to make everyone in the U.S. have identification, which tends to upset those who enjoy life off the grid or don't like any more government intrusion into their lives than what is necessary."
But, Price notes, nearly every state has come into compliance. "And there hasn't been the Big Brother/illegal shakedown issues that some people predicted," he said.
How do you get a Real ID-compliant license, and when can you get it? Here's where things can get tricky.
The Department of Homeland Security has been phasing in enforcement of the Real ID Act in an effort to give states time to become compliant with the rules and to begin issuing enhanced driver's licenses and ID cards in time for the Oct. 1, 2020, deadline.
Most states are currently in compliance with the Real ID Act and are able to issue upgraded licenses and IDs. The DHS website has a map you can check to find out the status of your state.
Seven states (Oregon, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Maine), plus American Samoa, have been granted extensions with varying deadlines for meeting the rules. (Some have until Aug. 1, 2019, while others have until Oct. 10, 2019).
California's status regarding Real ID compliance is listed as "under review" with a much shorter deadline of May 24, 2019, for achieving compliance.
What this means:
If your current driver's license or ID card is from a compliant state, the Transportation Security Administration will accept it at airports until Sept. 30, 2020. Starting Oct. 1, 2020, though, licenses and IDs from these states will need to bear a star or special symbol that shows it has been upgraded to conform to the new minimum security standards.
If your current license is from one of the seven states that has been given an extension, or from California, then it is good until the date the extension expires. After that, if the state isn't given another extension, is it possible the TSA will require an additional or alternate form of ID (i.e., a passport) between the extension expiration date and Sept. 30, 2020.
Come Oct. 1, 2020, though, licenses from these extension states will also need to have the star or symbol that shows it has been upgraded to meet the new minimum security standards.
Getting ready for Oct. 1, 2020 Signs about the Real ID deadline are going up now in airports across the country.
Oct. 1, 2020, seems far off, but it is "just" a year and a half away. And there's sure to be continued confusion and delays in getting upgraded licenses and ID cards from state agencies.
For that reason, the TSA, the DHS, airports and travel agents are urging travelers to renew their driver's licenses or state IDs early and to be sure to opt for the "enhanced" or "compliant" versions which, we should warn you, require additional paperwork and may cost more than the "for driving only" or "unenhanced" versions in some states.
Or, you can decide if you are comfortable flying domestically with your passport (if you have one; only about 40% of Americans do) or with one of the other forms of approved identification on the TSA's list.

Beginning Oct. 1, 2020, you will need a Real ID-compliant license or another acceptable form of ID, such as a valid passport or U.S. military ID, to fly within the U.S.

Texto completo: Massachusetts' air quality has worsened over the past couple of years, according to a new report.
“Massachusetts residents should be aware that we're breathing unhealthy air, driven by emissions from power plants and extreme heat as a result of climate change, placing our health and lives at risk," said Elizabeth Hamlin-Berninger, American Lung Association director of advocacy in Massachusetts.
The 2019 “State of the Air" report, released by the association, found that Barnstable, Bristol, Hampden, and Hampshire counties all received F's for their amount of bad ozone level days. Dukes, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester counties all received C's and D's, lower grades than last year.
A total of 97 bad ozone days — either unhealthy for sensitive groups or unhealthy for everyone — were recorded around the state over the three-year period ending in 2017. That was higher than the 59 days found in the three-year period ending in 2016.
As temperatures rise, ozone is more likely to form and becomes harder to clean up, the report stated.
On the bright side, all but three of the counties for which data were available reported slight decreases in a different measure of air pollution, year-round particle levels. (Berkshire, Hampden, and Suffolk were the exceptions.)
“This follows the nationwide trend, showing progress in reducing year-round levels of particle pollution," the ALA said in a statement.
Nationally, four of 10 Americans were found to have lived in a county that had unhealthy air, the report stated.
Data for this year's report was collected between 2015 and 2017, the three hottest years ever recorded for global temperature, the ALA noted. The data showed that 141.1 million people across the country lived in counties that had “unhealthful levels" of ozone or particle pollution, soot or tiny particles, over that time period, an increase of more than 7.2 million from the 2018 report.
Both types of air pollution can be deadly, the ALA said, possibly increasing the risk of premature death and causing other serious health effects such as lung cancer, asthma attacks, cardiovascular damage, and developmental and reproductive harm.
“We're heading in the wrong direction when it comes to protecting public health," Hamlin-Berninger said.
Climate change-fueled forest fires and weather patterns contributed to the worsening air quality in the United States, the report stated.
The general increase in unhealthy air is “eye-opening," ALA president and CEO Harold Wimmer said in a statement. Something needs to be done to prevent people from serious harm from the air quality, he said.
“There is no clearer sign that we are facing new challenges than air pollution levels that have broken records tracked for the past twenty years, and the fact that we had more days than ever before when monitored air quality reached hazardous levels for anyone to breathe," Wimmer said.
Bangor, Maine, and the Burlington-South Burlington area in Vermont were named by the association as two of the six cleanest-air cities in the country.

Environment chief to leave Cabinet

Texto completo: Matthew Beaton, who has served as Governor Charlie Baker's only environmental affairs secretary since he first took office, is decamping for the private sector after more than four years of helping shape the administration's energy policy.
In his place, Baker tapped a former conservation consultant, Kathleen Theoharides, who has been his administration's point person on climate change — a sign, advocates say, of the governor's intent to underscore the issue.
Beaton, a former GOP state lawmaker, oversaw a sprawling state secretariat that includes parks, the Environmental Police, and the Department of Public Utilities — at a time when Baker has pursued massive clean-energy projects, tried to spur more solar energy production, and pushed addressing climate change to the top of his priorities.
But Beaton, 39, has also overseen agencies that, at times, became embroiled in embarrassing political scandals and faced calls from environmental activists to seek loftier goals.
He will join TRC Cos. as a senior vice president. The Lowell business does environmental consulting and engineering work and has been involved with the controversial Weymouth compressor station project, which earlier this year won key permits from the Baker administration.
Theoharides, who joined the administration in 2016, has helped lead Baker's initiatives to combat climate change, including working directly with cities and towns through the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program.
The state has also been focused on reducing carbon emissions, though Theoharides, 37, declined to comment Monday on her position on carbon pricing.
Her appointment won early plaudits from advocates.
“I tell people if she wasn't working [for the state], I could see her working at an advocacy group," said Emily Norton, executive director of the Charles River Watershed Association.
“She really gets into the weeds and clearly cares deeply about doing things the right way," she added. “For us in a science-based organization, that's really terrific."
Theoharides will take over for a secretary whom Baker has praised as the “ideal person" to run environmental affairs.
Beaton, an avid outdoorsman who had run a small green-building and energy-efficiency consulting company, helped lead the Baker administration's efforts to bring the nation's first large-scale offshore wind farm to the waters off Martha's Vineyard, as well as its pursuit of a 145-mile power line through western Maine to import hydropower.
The administration has also sought to float more incentives for solar projects under Beaton, who said the state has spurred more development in the last four years than in “the entire history of solar development in Massachusetts."
On climate change, Baker has proposed to increase the tax on Massachusetts real estate transfers by 50 percent, with a goal of funneling the more than $1 billion over 10 years toward local mitigation efforts.
“He mastered some pretty complicated issues, especially on the energy side," Bruce Berman, a spokesman for the group Save the Harbor/Save the Bay, said of Beaton. “He knew from experience that the natural environment requires protection and investment, and I think he's going to be remembered as a good secretary."
Beaton's tenure didn't come without spurts of turmoil within the state agencies that he led, however.
In 2016, Matthew Sisk,a longtime Republican operative and state committeeman, was forced to resign after he used the blue lights on his state vehicle to get through rush-hour traffic in Boston.
Weeks earlier, he and the commissioner of the Department of Conservation & Recreation, Leo Roy, were suspended for a week without pay for using golf carts assigned to the Fourth of July events on the Esplanade to ferry a handful of GOP partygoers.
The next month, Michael Valanzola, a former GOP state Senate nominee, resigned, and his cousin JaredValanzola lost his DCR job after officials determined that Jared had tried to force a co-worker to persuade her fiancé not to challenge a Republican state senator.
Beaton himself came under scrutiny in 2017, when he had to refund the state after he used taxpayer money to pay for a round-trip plane ticket during his Florida vacation earlier that year.
And in 2018, Colonel James McGinn, head of the Massachusetts Environmental Police and Baker's former driver, was fired after a state review found he had fixed two tickets, installed unauthorized surveillance cameras, and hired a private investigator to follow an officer.
Beaton is the third member of Baker's Cabinet to leave since Baker won reelection in November. Jay Ash, the economic development secretary, stepped down in December, just weeks after Daniel Bennett, the public safety secretary, decided to leave the administration.
In February, Lon Povich, who had been the only general counsel to serve under Baker, also left.

St. Mary's, Fenwick on rapid rise

Texto completo: Any athletic event between St. Mary's of Lynn and Bishop Fenwick can be contentious, but Saturday's boys' lacrosse battle for first place in the Catholic Central League took on a new meaning.
Neither school has won a league title, and both got off to program-best starts to open the 2019 season, adding fuel to the fire of an already heated rivalry.
No. 20 St. Mary's (7-1, 5-1 CCL) earned a 12-7 victory at Fenwick (8-1, 4-1) but suffered an 11-8 defeat to defending CCL champion Austin Prep Monday night, creating a logjam atop the league standings.
For St. Mary's coach Josh Field and Fenwick coach Steve Driscoll , both in their fourth seasons, even being in position to compete for a league title at the midway point of the season was an indication of the rapid rise of their programs.
“I have so much respect for Coach Driscoll and his program," said Field. “Before the game, we were saying, 'How great is this? Two teams in the CCL, battling it out at the halfway point, both undefeated.'
“There's a great heritage of athletics at St. Mary's and the gym is filled with state and league championships, but there's a missing banner on that wall and we're shooting for that."
The two programs have followed a similar blueprint.
The private schools draw students from across the North Shore, many of whom played lacrosse at the youth level.
Additionally, both coaches have helped their programs grow by integrating athletes who star in other sports, but have yet to play lacrosse.
St. Mary's features two stalwart defenders new to the game in Jack and Owen Maguire . With ample experience as rugby and hockey players, the brothers from Nahant are making a smooth transition, and have been an integral part of a defense that allowed just 3.7 goals per game leading into Monday's tilt.
“A lot of guys picked up the stick for the first time freshman or sophomore year, and they're key players now," St. Mary's senior captain Damon Maribito said of Jack, a senior, and Owen, a junior.
“A lot of that is because of coach's willingness to expand the program."
Field played varsity lacrosse at Newton North under legendary coach Bussy Adam , graduating in 1988. He spent eight years as the varsity lacrosse coach at Swampscott while remaining heavily involved in the town's youth lacrosse program.
When he was hired as boys' lacrosse coach at St. Mary's in 2016, players in the area took notice.
Senior attack Brendan Laundry (team-leading 21 goals, 16 assists) transferred from Swampscott to St. Mary's two years ago. And this season, the Spartans welcomed standout sophomore Zach Barden , who bulled his way through the Fenwick defense for three goals and an assist on Saturday.
Barden, an immovable 6-foot, 192-pound midfielder from Swampscott, transferred to St. Mary's after helping Austin Prep to a D3 North title last spring. Now he's relishing the challenge of supplanting his former school atop the CCL.
“Based on how [St. Mary's] did last season, it's definitely exceeded my expectations," Barden said of the hot start.
While the players enjoy their new status as contenders, the coaches are taking a wide-angle look at the growth of their respective programs.
Driscoll played high school lacrosse at Manchester-Essex when the program was in its infancy. After graduating from the University of Maine, he spent three years as an assistant at his alma mater, then took the head coaching job at Fenwick in 2016.
“It was nice to see what a program is like over the first four years [at Manchester-Essex]," said Driscoll. “We definitely had our growing pains. It was some tough sledding, but in the long run, in my coaching career and life in athletics, it was a good thing."
Driscoll, an admissions counselor at Fenwick, has helped shape several student-athletes into excellent lacrosse players with little prior experience in the sport.
Also, he has helped students with dreams of playing college football channel their ambitions toward playing lacrosse at the next level, an approach that has senior captains Derek DelVecchio (Emmanuel) and Garrett Ruszkowski (Maine Maritime) preparing to play in college.
“A lot these kids didn't think lax was their sport freshman year, but turns out by senior year, they're going to college for lacrosse," said Driscoll.
Whether drawing on a pool of students that specialize in other sports, or on the experienced lacrosse players from the 15-plus towns represented on their rosters, Driscoll and Field are getting the most out of their athletes.
“These guys are new to lacrosse, but they're not new to varsity sports," said Field. “They know what it takes to get better and by now, you can't tell that they're new to the game.
“Every year we're getting kids to come out," Field said. “We want kids to know that if you work hard, and you're a team player, you have a home on this field."
Quick sticks
■ Needham senior attack Jason Child became the third player in program history to record 300 career points with an assist during an 18-3 victory over Weymouth Tuesday . . . Reading senior Mike Tobin also topped 300 career points during an 8-7 loss to Concord-Carlisle Saturday . . . Braintree junior Matt Hemmert scored seven of his eight goals in the second half, including his 100th career goal, to lead the Wamps in an 11-9 comeback win over Walpole uesday . . . Westford Academy junior Cam Barisano also scored his 100th career goal in an 11-10 win over Central Catholic Saturday . . . Melrose coach Matt James recorded his 100th career win when his Raiders (5-3) defeated Woburn, 18-3, on Tuesday.
■ Franklin edged BC High, 10-9, in overtime on Friday for the program's first win over the defending D1 state champion Eagles . . . Mike McCutcheon scored the tying goal with 2.2 seconds remaining and netted the winner in overtime to propel Duxbury past Hingham 8-7, on Thursday night. The Dragons went on to upset Medfield, 12-7, Saturday and are primed to win a 19th Patriot League title in 20 years.
■ Top-ranked Lincoln-Sudbury hosted Manhasset (N.Y.), the No. 13 team in the nation per Inside Lacrosse, on Thursday and was dealt an 18-8 defeat for their first official loss of the season. The Warriors were also one of six premier programs selected to participate in the Geico High School Lacrosse Showcase at St. Anthony's in South Huntington, N.Y. over the weekend. The Warriors competed, but ultimately fell, 20-10, to No. 5 St. Anthony's, and 11-8 to No. 11 The Haverford School (PA).
■ St. Sebastian's edged Belmont Hill, 9-7, on Wednesday to take sole possession of first place in the ISL. The undefeated Arrows (10-0, 7-0 ISL) are ranked No. 17 nationally per Inside Lacrosse.
■ Reading alum Kevin Tobin and Billerica alum Jeff Trainor hooked up for the go-ahead goal in an 11-9 win for No. 15 UMass over Delaware Friday. The Minutemen (10-4) host Drexel (6-7) in the Colonial Athletic Association semifinals Thursday at 5 p.m.
Games to Watch
■ Tuesday, BC High at Xaverian, 7 p.m. — Xaverian ran away for a 16-7 victory earlier this month at BC High, the improving Eagles are capable of exacting revenge at the Hawks' Nest.
■ Thursday, Hingham at Needham, 7 p.m . — These D1 South hopefuls could meet in the later rounds of the state tournament, but first they will face off in a premier nonleague tilt at Needham's majestic Memorial Field.
■ Friday, Duxbury at Lincoln-Sudbury, 5 p.m. — The Dragons are soaring following defeats of rival Hingham and Medfield, while the Warriors look to use what they learned at the Geico National Lacrosse Showcase to survive this huge nonleague matchup.
■ Friday, Dover-Sherborn at Medfield, 6:30 p.m. — Medfield is back atop the Tri-Valley League and is looking like a state title contender once again, but the rival Raiders from Dover-Sherborn always provide a stiff test.
■ Saturday, Algonquin at Concord-Carlisle, 5 p.m. — After playing defending D1 state finalist Acton-Boxborough down to the wire in a 9-8 defeat last month, Algonquin comes back east to face defending D2 state finalist Concord-Carlisle.

Texto completo: A golden celebration of Sesame Street, another dive into the creepy world of the Dark Crystal, and theater for adults and for the very young. All these are on order for the new season at the Center for Puppetry Arts.
One of the few arts organizations in Atlanta with a seven-figure budget, the center continues its tradition of puppet theater, events, movies and exhibits in the extensive 15,000-square-foot Worlds of Puppetry Museum.
The center's connection with the late Jim Henson and his family makes it a natural location to celebrate this year's 50th anniversary of Sesame Street, and plans are in motion for a variety of events to salute that occasion.
"Jim was an early believer in the center," which opened in 1978, said founder Vince Anthony. "He and Kermit cut the ribbon. We could have some of the characters here. Big Bird's nest is in our lobby. We're creating those plans right now."
The center will also host another edition of its adult gathering, the Dark Crystal Ball, timed so that cosplay fans assembling in Atlanta for Dragon Con can try out their costumes at the Spring Street facility ahead of time.
"The Dark Crystal" was Henson's scary, all-pup-pet theatrical film from 1982 that intrigued adults and kept children awake at night.
An exhibit of artifacts from the film will remain on display at the center through the end of this year, as devotees eagerly anticipate a 10-episode Netflix series of prequels called "Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance," slated to be released sometime in 2019.
"We're waiting on tenterhooks," said the center's marketing director Therese Aun.
The Center for Puppetry Arts is at 1404 Spring St. in Midtown. Prices and times vary; go to puppet.org for information.

Texto completo: Marriott International Inc. is expanding its home-sharing business to the United States, becoming the latest hotel operator to challenge Airbnb at its own game and blurring the distinction between home sharing and the traditional hospitality companies.
Marriott, the world's largest hotel company, plans to expand the home-sharing pilot it launched in Europe last year, adding 2,000 home rentals in U.S. vacation destinations such as Lake Tahoe and Bar Harbor, Maine. The initiative is small -- the company has 1.3 million hotel rooms around the world -- but important for Marriott, because the people who stay at its hotels on business might want a rental house for a bachelor party or family vacation.
"For younger generations booking group travel, it's not 'Who's in charge of the hotel?' It's 'Who's in charge of the Airbnb?' " said Michael Bellisario, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. "Home sharing is here to stay. The best thing hotel companies can do is embrace it."

Established lodging companies have increasingly sought a response to Airbnb as the app-driven service has grown from scrappy upstart to a global giant with a private market valuation of $31 billion. Hyatt Hotels Corp. made a strategic investment in home-sharing start-up Oasis Collections in 2017, a year after Accor acquired luxury-rental company Onefinestay.
Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said Monday on CNBC that his company will be ready to sell shares to the public this year.
Marriott took an early step into the home-sharing business in May, when it launched the pilot program in London that Marriott Chief Executive Arne Sorenson said would offer a "better product" than existing options. The company expanded to a handful of other cities in a bid to combine the home-sharing format with its loyalty program and expertise in managing hotels.
"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and we welcome them to the party and wish them bon voyage," Airbnb spokesman Chris Lehane said.

Texto completo: Kirk Goldsberry's new book, "SprawlBall," is about the evolution of basketball and the analytics driving it, but it opens with this line: "Geography is destiny."
The idea, as old as Sun Tzu, is that space and the location of resources - water, hills, etc. - determine the outcome of war. Why is that thought in a basketball book by an ESPN writer whose previous employers include USA Basketball and the San Antonio Spurs? Because before all that, Goldsberry was a cartographer, mapping things such as food deserts and flood data.
Over the past several years, Goldsberry has applied his mapmaking skills to basketball. It is not hyperbole to suggest that he has changed the way the game is played by figuring out from where, how often and how well players shoot on the court - and then visualizing, or rather mapping, the data.
If early analytics, which were most famously used in baseball, focused on the outcomes of static one-on-one encounters, Goldsberry expanded the genre, hoping to better understand spacing on the basketball court.
What does that mean in practical terms?
When Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard made a 37-foot, series-clinching three-pointer last week, Goldsberry could confidently tell you (above the protestations of the Oklahoma City Thunder's Paul George) that the shot, despite the distance, was in fact a good one.
"SprawlBall," illustrated by Aaron Dana, is a visual tour through Goldsberry's work and the modern NBA game. It has meditations on players such as LeBron James and Stephen Curry but also detailed data and charts on how, for instance, the three-point line has changed the game. (The average three-point shot yields 1.07 points vs. 0.8 points for the average midrange shot.)
At its heart, "SprawlBall" is a book of maps. It's a geography book.
During his junior year at Penn State, Goldsberry took an introduction to cartography class on little more than a whim. "I remember the census data and this software [Graphic Information Systems] that basically links databases to maps," he said. "It was this perfect balance of art and science, and I devoted the next 15 years of my life to it."
He switched his major, got a cartography degree and then moved to Washington to make flood maps for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. After a stint working for a software mapping company in Maine, Goldsberry got his master's and PhD at UC Santa Barbara, focused on the intersection of computer graphics data visualization and cartography.
Set on the path of academia, he took a job at Michigan State, where his research focused on mapping food deserts and public health facilities. In 2011, Goldsberry accepted a visiting professorship at Harvard, and with a lighter teaching load he suddenly had time to think about another love: basketball.
Goldsberry, 42, had played recreationally his entire life, and the spark of an idea had long flickered somewhere in his brain. "I knew that some players hung out on one side of the court - and in my own game, I'm 13 years old and I'm better in the right post than the left post," he said. "And no one had ever been able to quantify that."
The issue, he realized, was a mapping question. Each shot had an X and a Y coordinate.
He scraped the Internet for shot chart information from ESPN box scores and a few other places and was able to cobble together data for more than a million shots taken in the NBA from 2006 to 2011. Then he mapped it, the first effort at such research.
Goldsberry presented a paper at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in 2012 titled "CourtVision: New Visual and Spatial Analytics for the NBA." For the first time, you could see how NBA players - and the league at large - performed from different locations on the court. The reaction from the league community was overwhelming, and it began an odyssey that took Goldsberry from writing for Grantland to working for the Spurs to USA Basketball and now ESPN.
Still, to his former geography colleagues, the origins are clear: "It's spatial data; more shots from one location or a distribution across the court change with the color scale. It's a different scale from mapping a county or a country or the world, but the principles are the same," said Cindy Brewer, one of Goldsberry's professors at Penn State.
Added Morris Thomas, a former colleague at Michigan State: "We'd go to basketball games in Detroit, and he'd say things to me like, 'Don't you notice this guy is always shooting from that same spot?' I think the wheels were turning then."
A quick aside here: Goldsberry will never be the most famous geographer in basketball because a guy named Michael Jordan majored in geography at North Carolina. Early in Jordan's career, Thomas found himself in the Chicago Bulls' visiting locker room in Detroit and struck up a conversation with Jordan by telling him that he, too, studied geography.
"Jordan kind of looks at me, surprised - I'm a black guy; not too many black guys major in geography - and he lights up a little bit," Thomas said. "And he asks me, 'How many counties you been to?' Turned out he had a geography professor at North Carolina who was trying to visit all 3,141 counties in the United States."
The last chapter of "SprawlBall" is about the aesthetic of the game, and in it Goldsberry considers a different lens for the utility of analytics. Since the 2004 publication of "Moneyball," the seminal book about the Oakland Athletics by Michael Lewis, analytics has been thought of as a strategy for how teams can gain an advantage against each other.
And that evolution has created an analytics backlash among fans who don't favor the defensive shift in baseball, for example, or the isolation-themed basketball of the Houston Rockets. Goldsberry is sympathetic, which he credits to his time working with the Spurs, Coach Gregg Popovich and General Manager R.C. Buford.
"I would say the analytics aesthetic right now isn't optimal," Goldsberry said. "The aesthetics that it's helped create are threatening some of the fabric of the game, and the product isn't as good."
If basketball's inventor, James Naismith, could engineer social values into basketball - the game was created to help Christian boys blow off steam in the winter - then analytics ought to be able to engineer a better game and not just better teams.
"In our post-'Moneyball' landscape, I think analysts tend to look at the game and try to find market inefficiency and competitive advantage, but folks like Coach Pop and R.C. see the sport as something much less trivial," Goldsberry said. "It's a living, breathing masterpiece to be celebrated, stewarded and improved along the way."
In the book, Goldsberry throws out a few thought experiments, including adjusting the three-point line, eliminating the shorter three-point shot from the corner or even allowing goaltending on three-point shots. The specifics, though, are almost less important than the idea of what analytics should be.
"If the basketball ideal is to have guys shoot 33 percent from three-point range, we can do that," Goldsberry said. "That's the frame we should be thinking about - how do we engineer a better basketball game?"
The way to do it is by manipulating the court, which is just another mapping problem.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine — The tradition of releasing balloons at weddings, birthdays and memorials may soon get deflated by lawmakers in more than half a dozen states.
Critics say the helium-filled balloons pollute the environment, and threaten birds and other wildlife when they fall to earth.
“People don’t really realize that it’s littering. That’s why we want to bring attention to this,” said state Rep. Lydia Blume, who’s supporting a balloon bill in Maine. “It’s a common sense thing.”
Nationwide, there’s a growing awareness of the problem, and it has energized legislation in state governments.
Bills to limit the intentional release of large numbers of balloons are being aired in legislatures in Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, in addition to Maine, said Jennifer Schultz of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Texas is also considering a study on windblown and waterborne litter that would include helium balloons, she said. A similar proposal was terminated while in committee in the Kentucky legislature last month.
These states would join California, Connecticut, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia — all of which already have laws that ban or restrict launches. California’s law applies only to foil balloons, while Connecticut is currently considering a stricter law, said Danielle Vosburgh, a Florida environmental activist who helped launch a nonprofit organization, Balloons Blow.
Maine’s proposal to ban mass balloon releases took flight at a town meeting last month in Unity. Penny Sampson, chairwoman of the Select Board, said she had witnessed a couple releases in person. Once was in 2000 when triplet boys died in a fire in Unity.
Another time, balloons were released at the Wiscasset Raceway to memorialize someone who died.
“To pollute the environment and cause marine and wildlife issues is really not a good way to memorialize someone. There are plenty of other ways to do it,” Sampson said.
In Rhode Island, commercial lobsterman John Peabody said he’s generally anti-government but he supports limits on balloon releases based on what he sees from his boat.
“You see tons of those things. You see them floating on the surface, you find them in the traps below. You wouldn’t believe how many of them are out there,” he said.
Eric Sparks, coastal ecology specialist at Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium, said he sees balloons and other plastic debris in the decaying carcasses of pelicans and other birds.
He used to be shocked, and took note of them. Now it’s a common sight, he said.
Shorebirds can get entangled. In the ocean, turtles mistake them for jellyfish and eat them.
Critics are having some recent success in battling the feel-good tradition of releasing balloons. Clemson University stopped releasing balloons at its football games. The Indianapolis 500 and the Nebraska Cornhuskers have faced pressure to do the same.
And a growing number of communities are tackling the issue, too.
The New Jersey-based Balloon Council, which represents manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers, used to be opposed to bans on balloon releases because of the impact on small businesses. These days, the council still prefers education over legislation, but it is not opposing any of the legislative efforts to stop balloon releases.
“The balloon council feels that all balloons should be deflated and properly disposed of,” said spokeswoman Lorna O’Hara. “There is a heightened attention across the globe. We’re rising to what’s happening in the United States and globally.”
Some folks are getting the message — with or without legislative intervention.
At Fort Leavenworth, Kan., officials at the Army installation quickly decreed there will be no more balloon releases after children released balloons on April 1 to mark the “month of the military child.” The balloon launch caused an uproar in the community.
“We’ve been beaten up on social media,” said base spokesman Jeffrey Wingo.
But the outrage sparked a discussion about environmental stewardship. “Is this the right thing to do? Is this environmentally sound, or not?” he said. “It is not.”

Marriott to expand further into home-sharing

Texto completo: Marriott is pushing more heavily into home-sharing, confident that its combination of luxury properties and loyalty points can lure travelers away from rivals like Airbnb.
The world's biggest hotel company will start taking reservations this week for 2,000 homes in 100 markets in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. It plans to expand its Homes and Villas program to other locations.
For its part, Airbnb is encroaching further into hotels. On Monday, the San Francisco-based company said it's working with a New York real estate developer to establish a 10-story hotel with 200 suites in Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan. The suites will only be available through Airbnb's web site.
Airbnb, which plans to go public but hasn't made clear when, also acquired Hotel Tonight, a last-minute booking service, in March.
Hospitality is one of several industries that's seeing traditional players and startups take tentative steps into each other's turf. Automakers are exploring ride-hailing. Ride-hailing companies are developing self-driving cars. Amazon is opening physical stores. Physical stores like Starbucks are experimenting with delivery.
Airbnb and Marriott will always have separate core strengths, but the convergence will continue, predicts Daniel Guttentag, an assistant professor of hospitality management at the College of Charleston School of Business
"Each of them wants to borrow some of the best elements of the other one's business," he said.
Marriott is targeting families and groups, and the homes skew toward luxury, with prices ranging from $200 per night for a one-bedroom apartment to $10,000 for a full Scottish castle. Nearly 40 of the markets are in places where Marriott doesn't currently have hotels, like Bar Harbor, Maine and Bordeaux, France.
Marriott is a long way from matching home-sharing behemoths like Airbnb, which boasts 6 million listings worldwide, or Booking.com, which has listings in 220 countries. The homes in its program aren't even exclusive Marriott properties. Marriott is partnering with rental management companies to handle the maintenance and cleaning.
But Marriott believes it has advantages. Unlike its home-sharing rivals, it has a loyalty program that lets travelers earn and use points on its hotels and homes. Business travelers can accumulate points at Courtyard hotels, for example, and use them for a week at a beach house. Airbnb is working on a loyalty program of its own, but the rollout has been delayed.
Marriott says it also guarantees hotel-like standards that are often missing in home-sharing, such as Wi-Fi, crisp white sheets, bath amenities, baby cribs and smoke alarms. Airbnb has tried to tackle that problem with user reviews and its Plus program, which highlights rentals that meet higher quality standards. But the sheer volume of properties makes it difficult to police them all.
"One of the challenges you see with home-sharing is there's too much inventory without quality filters or brand assurances," says Stephanie Linnartz, Marriott's global chief commercial officer.
Hotels have struggled to determine the right path into the home-sharing market. Hyatt invested in Oasis, a luxury home-sharing site, in 2017, but said regulatory hurdles hampered Oasis's growth. The companies parted ways last year.
AccorHotels bought home-sharing site Onefinestay in 2016 but has struggled to make money on it. Choice Hotels, like Marriott, partnered with property management company RedAwning and gets a cut of every property booked.
For now, the home-sharing unit won't be material to Marriott's earnings, Linnartz said.
Marriott's move is an acknowledgment that home-sharing — which has boomed in the last decade since Airbnb's founding — has fundamentally changed guests' expectations. People may be satisfied with a traditional hotel for a business trip or a soccer tournament, but sometimes they want something unique and memorable, Linnartz said.
At the same time, Airbnb is moving into hotels because there are customers — particularly business travelers — it's having a hard time reaching because of its couch-surfing reputation. But the risk is that it will lose its aura of coolness and authenticity and become just another big company offering hotel rooms, Guttentag said.
Marriott and Airbnb also have a shared vulnerability: They don't own the properties they're renting. That makes it easy to grow or shrink their offerings and insulates them financially. But it gives hosts the option to advertise on more than one site.
The biggest risk to Marriott, though, it probably its reputation, Guttentag said. If something bad happens at a rental property, Marriott may not be able to fix it quickly.
"Ultimately, in privately owned short term rentals, undesirable things are going to happen sometimes," Guttentag said. "They have to resolve to weather that storm."
Marriott began testing home-sharing with 200 homes in London last year and later expanded it to several other cities in Europe. The company found that most of its home-sharing guests were leisure travelers and they stayed an average of 5.1 nights, or double the length of a traditional hotel stay.
Marriott's research also showed that 30% of its customers had stayed in a shared home in the last year.
"When they were doing that, they weren't staying at an offering from us," Linnartz said. "This is a gap we want to close."

Texto completo: BY STEPHEN HAWKINS
The Associated Press
Jim Montgomery is a rookie NHL coach with a championship background.
With Montgomery, their third coach in three seasons after grizzled and somewhat different veterans Ken Hitchcock and Lindy Ruff, the Dallas Stars have gained home-ice advantage in the second round of their Western Conference playoff series against the St. Louis Blues.
"Monty's been awesome this year. He's really put everything together," Stars top-line center Tyler Seguin said. "We kind of had an offensive coach (Ruff), then we had a really defensive coach (Hitch). It took us a while to figure out what our identity was."
The Stars and Blues certainly both found their way with new coaches this season, with St. Louis surging under interim coach Craig Berube since he took over in the 20th game of the season.
Montgomery made the jump from college to the NHL last offseason after five seasons at the University of Denver, including a national title two years ago. He was part of a national championship as a college player at Maine in 1993. Before Denver, he was head coach and general manager for the Dubuque Fighting Saints of the United States Hockey League.He won two Clark Cup titles in three seasons.
Montgomery acknowledged that his first NHL experience was challenging.
"I didn't know what the unexpected was going to be," Montgomery said. "And the unexpected ended up being some big moments. All those things have made us tougher. And if you're tougher now, you've got to be tough going into playoffs or you have no chance.
"We've been able to change our mentality and our idea of what work ethic is.We've done that all together. That's the growth you want to see because that's how you get everyone believing in it. Players have had ownership in it and so has the coaching staff."
After the Stars won, 4-2, in Game 2 to earn a split of the first two games played in St. Louis, Game 3 of the second-round series is tonight in Dallas.
Things are getting a bit chippy between the familiar rivals - Hitchcock coached both teams, Blues general manager Doug Armstrong used to have that same role in Dallas and Stars goalie Ben Bishop grew up in the St. Louis area before being drafted by the Blues and making his NHL debut for them.
"Playoffs tend to get chippy. It's about holding your composure and finding the right times to do what you want to do," Blues goalie Jordan Binnington said. "Yeah, it's heating up here in round two."
There was a 72-second span in the first period of Game 2 on Saturday with three goals scored (two for Dallas) while skating 4-on-4 during concurrent roughing penalties against both teams.
St. Louis was 0-for-5 on power plays, including twice with two-skater advantages. The Blues had a 5-on-3 for 24 seconds in the first period, and had a 6-on-4 for nearly a minute late after pulling Binnington off the ice for an extra skater while on the power play.
Berube became interim coach for the Blues on Nov. 19, replacing fired coach Mike Yeo after a 7-9-3 start. They finished the regular season 38-19-6, including a franchise-record 11-game winning streak snapped by Dallas in February, and beat the Winnipeg Jets in six games to open the playoffs.
This is the second time Berube has led a team to the playoffs after taking over as interim coach. But the 2013-14 Philadelphia Flyers didn't make it past the first round.
While not quite as drastic as the in-season turnaround by St. Louis, the Stars had a five-game winning streak that bridged the All-Star break and avoided a late-season collapse like last year that kept them out of the playoffs. In a four-game stretch through Canada late this season, they picked up seven of a possible eight points.
"We trusted the process. It took awhile," Benn said. "We figured out what our identity was kind of around the All-Star break ... we haven't looked back and been playing some good hockey."

Judge denies Swanville farmer's request to throw out search warrant in pig massacre case

Texto completo: A Swanville farmer's animal cruelty case will move forward after a judge last week denied the farmer's request to suppress the search warrant that led to finding the corpses of about a dozen heritage pigs on his farm.
Jerry Ireland was charged with 13 counts of cruelty toward animals after the March 2018 raid by Maine Animal Welfare Program agents at Ireland Hill Farms in Swanville allegedly turned up the dead Mangalitsa pigs and one live, emaciated one, according to court documents.
At the time, the farmer also was the head of the United Farmer Veterans of Maine, a nonprofit group that supports veterans who want to farm. But two months after the animal cruelty charges were filed against him, the embattled Ireland resigned as president of that group.
Defense attorney Hunter Tzovarras argued last fall at Waldo County Superior Court that the search warrant was defective and that the evidence turned up after it was executed should be suppressed. Efforts to speak to Tzovarras on Monday were not immediately successful.
Last October, he said at the motion to suppress hearing that he had found several problems with the search warrant, including that it gave limited information about exactly where to search and what to search for.
"Warrants have to be specific," he said at that time. "A hunch, or a feeling, by an animal welfare agent is not probable cause. There's simply no evidence to suggest there's probable cause of a crime."
At that hearing, prosecutors said that animal welfare agents had been probable cause of criminality before they obtained the search warrant.
Justice Robert Murray's decision to deny Ireland's and Tzovarras' request to throw out the evidence obtained through the search warrant was good news for Waldo County Assistant District Attorney Bill Entwisle.
"Obviously, we're happy about it," he said. "These are serious allegations, and it gives us the opportunity to go forward and try to come up with a just result."
Ireland is scheduled to have a dispositional conference on Tuesday, May 14. If the two sides cannot come to an agreement at that time, the case could go to trial as soon as June, the prosecutor said.

Texto completo: A dump truck driver swerved and lost control of the vehicle on Main Street in downtown Winterport on Monday morning in an effort to avoid hitting a vehicle that had stopped for pedestrians in the crosswalk.
Driver Mark Ellis, 56, of Alton missed the vehicle, but did hit propane tanks and wrecked a set of stairs with the heavy truck before he could bring it to a halt right next to the brick building at 115 Main St., according to Cpl. Jeremy Wesbrock of the Maine State Police.
Ellis suffered minor injuries as a result of the incident, which happened at about 10:30 a.m., and did not need to be transported by ambulance for further care.
Wesbrock said that Ellis didn't hit the building with the truck. He said there could have been a much worse outcome for any of the parties involved -- Ellis, the other vehicle, the pedestrians, the building and anyone inside it.
"I think it's definitely one of those things," Wesbrock said. "Not only the driver, but those in the building definitely lucked out."
The propane tanks were not punctured, but because diesel fuel leaked from the truck, officials from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection were called to the scene. The dump truck needed to be towed away, Wesbrock said.

Texto completo: One month after prosecutors told Superior Court Justice William Stokes that Shawna L. Gatto murdered her fiance's 4-year-old granddaughter in the Wiscasset home the family shared, Stokes is scheduled to deliver his verdict Tuesday afternoon.
Gatto, 44, is charged with depraved indifference murder for the Dec. 8, 2017, death of Kendall Chick, the granddaughter of Gatto's fiance, Stephen Hood. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services removed Chick from her mother's custody and placed her with Gatto and Hood three years before her death.
Gatto pleaded not guilty to the crime and waived her right to a jury trial.
During a weeklong bench trial earlier this month at the Capitol Judicial Center, experts from the Maine State Police crime lab testified that Chick's DNA and what they surmised to be her blood stains had been found throughout the Wiscasset home, and the state's medical examiner testified that Chick died from blunt force trauma to her head, a "catastrophic" traumatic injury to her abdomen and chronic "child abuse syndrome," or multiple injuries to many parts of her body over time.
Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber opened his case by introducing nearly 50 photographs of Chick's bruise-covered corpse and photographs of the home's bathtub and bunk bed that Luminol showed to be blood-stained.
He played recorded interviews with Gatto in which she described Chick as "very accident-prone" and said she "wondered a few times if she could feel pain because she never cried."
Hood, who testified for the prosecution, told the court that he saw bruises and other injuries on his granddaughter throughout her life. He added that when he questioned Gatto about them, she said the child "would be fine."
Prior to his testimony, Stokes offered Hood an attorney, warning him that any statements he made could be used against him if charges such as endangering the welfare of a child, assault "or possibly more serious charges" are pursued, but Hood said, "I think I'm OK."
But Gatto's defense attorneys, Jeremy Pratt and Philip Cohen, said too much remains unknown about Chick's death to convict Gatto, and then focused on Hood as a potential alternative suspect in the murder.
Witnesses pointed to Hood's "temper" and said they would not let him care for their own children. Cohen read from text messages Hood sent Gatto in which he wrote, "I don't know what to do. Get rid of her? How? But then we'd have to carry the guilt."
Hood said he'd written the message because Chick had special needs, and he wondered about having her returned to state custody.
Hood said DHHS had only checked on Chick once during the more than three years she was in the couple's custody.
Gatto did not take the stand in her own defense.
If convicted of depraved indifference murder, Gatto could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

Texto completo: Story: A Belfast resident's death has added stress to the city's budget
$200K per annum for transporting a single patient twice weekly? Wow. No wonder health care is one of the biggest economic engines in our state (our tax dollars at work) ...
-- Forrest Gilmore
Every town and every kitchen table is going through this type of discussion. The cost of living is going up while revenues are flat or going down. Just look at the price of groceries, gas, insurance, taxes, rent, etc. People are being squeezed. And it's not just one thing or one person to blame, it's multiple things: demographics, lack of large employers, high ratio of land area to population, cost of education and services, and energy. You can only cut so much before things start to deteriorate, and you can't continue to pass the costs to people. The only way forward that makes sense is for Maine and towns to use zero-based budgeting every budget cycle, diversify revenue sources (sales tax, hotel tax, seasonal gas tax, local tax, etc.) and, finally, set expectations that everyone can't have everything
-- John Parker
Seems like Belfast is going though what most of us are. Increasing costs while living on a fixed income. At least they can increase taxes.
-- StuckinNorthCarolinaMainer
Belfast -- I hate to break it to you, but people get sick. They will require serious care. It will happen. So, to act like this one individual is the bogeyman responsible for your fiscal ills is ridiculous. Now, get serious and plan for all reasonable contingencies and have a reserve. Options exist.
-- jack bauer
School budget needs to go down, not up -- too many assistants to the assistants, stop school buses from transporting kids all over the state to sports events. The parents of the kids should be covering those costs if they want them in sports, not taxpayers.
-- Tommycat
Participation in sports is an important part of the middle and high school experience. For what it's worth, I have no problem with teams traveling as they do, and using my property taxes to do it.
-- Thom

Texto completo: Ireland Webb thought she was going to be raped. It was Aug. 12, 2016, and a male student from Thomas College in Waterville, where she was starting as a freshman, had asked her to wear a dress. It was their first date and first time meeting after talking online, and he had told her he wanted the date to be a surprise. But when he picked her up at the college, he didn't have a plan, Webb said. After driving to a couple places, including Walmart, where he bought frosted animal crackers with sprinkles, he took her to his family's home in a nearby town.
She was OK kissing him, but when he felt under and over her clothes, and tried to get her to do sexual things, she repeatedly told him no and moved his hands away, she said. She told him he was pressuring her and started to cry, and he got angry. He tried to take off her clothes, so she grabbed his wrists and attempted to push him off her, but he resorted to pulling at her dress with his teeth, she said.
He continued to try to have sex with her, asking what the difference was between having sex then or later, telling her to let him prove to her that she would like it, and guilting her by saying he had put his trust in her, she said. A couple times he bit and flicked her nipples over her clothes.
One time, when he physically put her hand on his genitals, she told him she didn't want to touch him. "He said, 'Wow, you have a lot of respect for yourself,' as if I shouldn't have a lot of respect for myself,'" Webb said. "I told him to stop so many times both physically with my hands and my words." At the same time, she didn't want to upset him. He was her ride home. All the while, "I thought I was going to get raped," she said. After several hours, he let her go.
Rape on college campuses has drawn a considerable amount of attention in recent years, but there are many other forms of sexual misconduct, such as unwanted sexual touching and sexual harassment, that are even more prevalent. Many schools struggle with how to respond.
At Thomas College, four current female students, including Webb, described experiencing unwanted sexual contact and were surprised when administrators didn't take initiative to investigate their complaints, instead leaving it up to the women to decide how to proceed.
Each of the women expected a swift, clear response that would include an investigation and possible consequences for the male students. Instead, they came away disenchanted, fearful and depressed after reporting the misconduct.
Webb, it turned out, would report a total of five male students' unwanted sexual conduct to the school. But even though she pushed for an investigation in one of the cases, the outcome appeared to be the same.
The women's experiences show how a range of sexual misconduct can make victims fear for their safety and interfere with their education. They also raise legal questions about one college's normally confidential handling of cases.
When students do come forward, the U.S. Department of Education, under the federal gender anti-discrimination law Title IX, mandates that colleges "must take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate or otherwise determine what occurred." The department did not respond to questions.
The women who spoke to the Bangor Daily News, however, said Thomas College did not conduct investigations unless they specifically requested one. The school put the burden of its campus judicial response on their shoulders at a vulnerable time in their lives, they said, and they were unsure of what to do.
Laurie Lachance, the president of Thomas College, said that unless the reported offense is "so egregious" that school officials need to protect the campus as a whole or protect the reporting student from major harm, "we would allow the student to pick the course of action that they want to take in the time that they want to take it."
That's because "it can often retraumatize them if we try to force them in one direction or another with a speed that they might regret upon further inspection," she said. Lachance does not personally get involved in Title IX cases. She said the college complies with all legal obligations to address and respond to sexual misconduct.
Asked if a report of rape would trigger an investigation, Lachance said, "The person would be given on-campus options for resolution, including no action, informal or formal review. There is no timeline for the person to decide on the course of action that is right for them, and the person can change their mind later." A formal review results in an investigation and hearing.
It appears that few students choose the formal process, pursuing it in just 9 percent of sexual misconduct cases reported to the school over the past three years.
Outside the disciplinary process, Thomas College offers alleged victims what they need to heal, Lachance said, such as counselors or academic support. Administrators also make sure students know of their right to go to police and will arrange that connection if students want, she said.
In addition to Webb, the BDN spoke to three other female students who all reported that the same male student had groped them and were outraged at the lack of repercussions for him.
One of the three women, who got a court-ordered protection from abuse order against the male student, questioned why obtaining it didn't automatically trigger a school investigation.
"I don't know what I'm supposed to choose. All I know is I want him to stop, and I don't want anyone else to be victimized," said the woman, who agreed to go by her middle name, Alexis. The BDN is not naming her because she still attends school with the alleged offender. "If a rule is alleged to be violated you should do some investigating to see if it was, how it was and why. You don't put this burden of evidence and burden of proof on the victim. I felt it was all pushed onto my plate."
Outside attorneys familiar with Title IX said schools should look into reports of misconduct.
"The standards that govern whether something constitutes sexual harassment, you can only determine whether something meets that standard once you've investigated. Schools can't just assume that harassment won't meet that standard without launching any kind of investigation," said Emma Roth, an attorney with the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.
Schools shouldn't force alleged victims to participate in an investigation, said Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, which provides free legal help to sexual assault victims in Massachusetts and Oregon. But "the school does have to evaluate whether or not it's still safe for other people on campus," she said.
If she were the general counsel for Thomas College, she said, she would "100 percent" tell the school to investigate. That's because if an alleged offender escalates his behavior, "the school is going to have been on notice that he's a problem. Whoever brings a civil lawsuit who gets raped by the person is going to have a very good civil lawsuit," she said.
A school's internal investigation to determine if a student violated the student conduct code may take place at the same time as a police investigation, but the two are different. Under Title IX, if a school's investigation reveals that sexual harassment created a hostile environment, the school is required to "take prompt and effective steps" to end the harassment, and prevent it from happening again.
Schools use a lower bar of evidence in adjudicating cases than a criminal court, which gives them greater leeway to punish offenders, such as through suspension or expulsion, to protect other students' right to an education. Just as workplaces can fire someone for conduct that doesn't rise to the level of a crime, schools can remove students for bad behavior.
The students who spoke to the BDN, most of whom are majoring in criminal justice, were familiar with the school's definition of consent and Title IX before coming forward. That's because Thomas College requires students to learn about the issues through an online training, a session during orientation and at a full campus meeting. It also weaves the issues of Title IX and sexual misconduct into a required first-year seminar.
But none of the women said they were told what the Title IX process specifically entailed or that they would have to decide whether the school should investigate. Instead, they all remembered conversations about consent -- that a lack of a no doesn't mean a yes -- and being told whom they should talk to in the Title IX office if they needed help.
Given all the attention on sexual misconduct on campus, the women said they expected the school to automatically take action on their reports, rather than leave the decision up to them.'I was scared'
A few days after the evening with the male student in 2016, Webb decided to message him on Facebook to say she didn't want to get together with him again. She shared their exchange with the BDN, which is not naming the male student because he wasn't charged with a crime. He didn't respond to a request for comment.
"I told you to stop and you continued trying to do more sexual acts with me," she wrote.
He wrote back, "That's fair. I'm really messed up right now Ireland, and I'm sorry."
That didn't mean everything was OK, she said. "What you did the other night is a form of sexual assault," she wrote. "Being messed up isn't an excuse to hurt women, or anyone for that matter, in any form."
He told her he was genuinely interested in her and was trying to "rebuild" himself after struggling with his mental health.
"I'm not and will not be a victim of your self destructive life," she replied.
Even as she tried to take control of the situation, she felt different. She started to distrust people. She found it harder to concentrate. Always the "front-row center nerd," she said, her grades began to slip.
Webb emailed a professor Sept. 11, 2016, to apologize for her academics, saying she had been sexually assaulted. He reported the incident to the school's office responsible for handling sexual misconduct complaints under Title IX. Hannah Gladstone, the Title IX deputy coordinator, met with Webb on Sept. 16.
Gladstone handed Webb the school's sexual misconduct policy and circled one of the page numbers, 11, where local resources were listed, said Webb, who still has the pages in a binder. Then she circled another page number, 16, where her three options began.
Webb's first option was to take no action. Her second option was to pursue an "informal" route where a school official could meet with the male student to "discuss the concern." Her third option was the "formal" route where there could be an investigation and hearing before a panel of trained faculty and staff.
If the school had investigated, it may have seen the messages between Webb and the male student or additional messages between Webb and one of her friends in which she described what had happened. It's possible the panel would have determined that it was more likely than not that the male student had violated the student conduct code and punished him in some way, such as with a warning, probation or suspension.
"I wanted something to be done," Webb said, but she got the impression that Gladstone didn't. "She said, 'So, this didn't happen on campus,' and things like that, making it sound like it wasn't her problem," Webb said. "I just figured an informal approach was the only way. I was afraid to hurt his reputation, and I was scared."
Webb emailed Gladstone Sept. 20 to say she would take the informal approach. It took more than two months to reach a resolution. On Nov. 22, Vice President for Student Affairs Lisa Desautels-Poliquin followed up to say she'd met with the male student.
Lachance couldn't comment on individual cases but said Gladstone had experienced a family emergency in the fall of 2016 and was unexpectedly called out of state for several weeks. Now, the school has revised its procedures to make sure cases get handed off to other staff members quickly when someone is away.
"We did learn from that. We'd never had that happen before," Lachance said.
She also said that it's not the role of Title IX staff members to push students to pursue a particular course of action. "We empower our students and work to provide them with the support they need to make the decision that is right for them," Lachance said.
Webb wanted to know how the male student had responded, but Desautels-Poliquin told her she couldn't elaborate. She could only say that, as part of the informal process, "we make sure that the person has our Sexual Misconduct Policy and understands the definitions outlined," she told Webb in an email.
Webb didn't understand how he was allowed to harm her, and then they were supposed to continue attending the same college together, with his only consequence being a reminder that sexual misconduct was prohibited, she said.
Looking back, Webb said she had been too afraid to push for an investigation that might get the male student in trouble, especially since she often saw him on the small campus. It's unfair to put the responsibility on victims, who may blame themselves and not want to be a burden, she said.
She fell into despair. She found it difficult to concentrate in class and avoided the library in case the male student showed up there, she said. She altered the time she left for one of her classes because his schedule overlapped with hers. She avoided events she knew his friends would attend. For a while she couldn't explain what had happened without crying. Now a third-year student, she plans to graduate early, in December, "so I don't have to deal with any more trauma here," she said.
She realized later she wanted to take action, in part for her own mental health, and in March 2017 reported the unwanted sexual touching to the Waterville Police Department, who gave her case to the Maine State Police. To her surprise, they made her feel reassured, she said.
A detective had her call the male student to see if she could elicit a confession, but the male student didn't admit what happened. According to an email from the detective, there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute.
It is difficult to judge from the outside how a school handles reports of sexual misconduct because the process is confidential. But experts say it's a positive sign when the number of sexual misconduct reports increase because it usually means more students are OK coming forward, as opposed to actual rates of sexual violence increasing.
But at Thomas College, the number of reports has decreased over the past three school years.
Because the college is private, it did not have to release the total number of sexual misconduct cases it deals with, but it agreed to share those statistics for this story. The numbers were not broken out by type of incident, but they include any potential Title IX or sexual misconduct incident brought to the school's attention, including reports by third parties who were not involved.
Of the 57 reports over those years, five cases resulted in the school taking formal action under Title IX, which involves an investigation and hearing. Of those five cases, three -- or 5 percent of the total reports -- resulted in a student being found responsible for the violation.
The vast majority of reports, 41, resulted in no action. In 11 cases, students wanted to pursue the informal process, which involves an administrator speaking to the alleged offender but doesn't result in an official finding of fault or exoneration.
Federal law requires schools to publish statistics on some specific reported sexual offenses. (They do not include sexual harassment.) Thomas College had one report of rape and one report of fondling in 2015, and zero reports of either offense in 2016 and 2017, according to its public campus safety report.
Zero is not necessarily a positive sign. "Any time you have a zero, I think you have a problem," said Bruno, with the Victim Rights Law Center. "Because it's not zero. It's not."
Misconduct is more likely to happen in places that are perceived to not hold offenders accountable, according to research. A meta-analysis that combined data from 41 studies found perception of organizational tolerance to be the strongest predictor of sexual harassment in workplaces.
One current female student at Thomas College didn't report her alleged attack because she didn't believe the school would take action.
The woman said a male student, whom she didn't know well, grabbed her so hard it left bruises, pushed her against a closed door in a dorm hallway, and kissed her without her permission in September 2017. When she mentioned potentially going to Title IX officials, she said an upperclassman dissuaded her by telling her it was unlikely to make a difference.'They were so random'
Most students will never report sexual misconduct to their college's Title IX officer once, let alone multiple times, but Webb did.
On Nov. 28, 2017, Webb sat in a classroom where someone had taped brown paper over the windows where there weren't curtains. A secretary took people's phones and backpacks, according to Webb and another student who was present. She was going to have to make her case to a panel that she had been sexually harassed, this time by her resident assistant.
Starting around July 25, 2017, and continuing into the school year, she estimated the resident assistant had sent her about 10 photos over Snapchat that showed him in his boxers with an erection. Resident assistants are live-in student staff members on residence hall floors who are compensated, and they are supposed to be role models for other students.
"I didn't ask for them at all. They were so random," she said of the photos.
The male student declined to comment.
Snapchat photos disappear, but she kept copies of his text messages, which consisted of eggplant and peach emojis, common sexual innuendo, and shared them with the BDN. She didn't tell him to stop sending the messages, she said, and she continued to be courteous to him, but they made her uncomfortable. As a resident assistant, he had authority over her, and she lived near him, she said. She didn't want a confrontation.
She described how he became more physical. Once, knowing she was coming over after he invited her, he opened the door in his boxer briefs. A couple times, she said he wanted to cuddle, something she described as awkward. After one time, he said, "'Now I'm done [cuddling]. You ever get that feeling where you just need to hold someone?'" she recalled.
She was so uncomfortable that she stopped going to a club because he would be there, she said, and decided to switch residence halls, which she did on Oct. 9, 2017. She told a different resident assistant what had happened, and that woman told the Title IX office, which reached out to Webb on Oct. 11, 2017. Webb dreaded returning to Title IX, she said, but she didn't think she should let the male student's behavior continue because he was technically a staff member.
Faced again with the decision of whether the school should investigate, she decided to go a different route and pursue the formal process.
She didn't think he should be suspended or expelled, she said. She just thought he shouldn't be a resident assistant anymore. Resident assistants are instructed to conduct themselves "in a professional manner at all times" and to "avoid intimate relationships with students who live in the same hall," according to a school description of the role.
The school's sexual misconduct policy defines sexual harassment as "subjecting an individual to unwelcome sexual conduct/behavior," which may occur electronically.
During the hearing on Nov. 28, 2017, the resident assistant admitted to all his behavior, according to the school's decision letter.
But the school said it wasn't clear that Webb didn't want his apparent advances.
Based on a preponderance of the evidence, the incidents "did not appear to be unwanted by either party," according to the decision letter.
Webb said she was dumbfounded because she understood that consent must be active. Many schools, including Thomas College, now only consider sexual acts consensual if students "freely and actively" indicate they want sexual contact. "Silence, in and of itself, cannot be interpreted as consent," states Thomas College's sexual misconduct policy.
While Lachance couldn't comment on Webb's specific case, citing privacy law, she said it's possible for incidents to also be handled through human resources, which would be confidential.
"The RAs are employees of the college and thus are treated like every other employee through the HR office through appropriate processes," Lachance said.
If the male student was punished in some way through separate proceedings, Webb never heard about it, she said. All she knew was that the Title IX process had failed her again. It's particularly important for alleged victims to know the outcome of cases, she said, so they can regain feelings of safety.
That same fall she reported three other male students to Title IX. She did it because, at the very least, telling someone else would help her in her healing process.
"Oftentimes people ignore the fact that something happened to them, and it eats them inside. By speaking up and speaking out, it helps you realize what happened to you, and it's just a way of closure," she said.
One man she didn't know summoned her over and asked if she was a virgin in front of his friends. "I was just wondering what you were looking for," she recalled him saying. Another called her nearly 20 times in a two-week period, even though she told him to stop; she still has the phone records. A third felt her butt.
After the man touched her, Webb ran into a study room where her friends were. "She didn't want to do anything but stand in a corner behind all of us, put the three of us between her and the door," one of her friends recalled.
At the time she wanted the school to focus on the case involving the resident assistant and agreed to an informal resolution with the three men.
But even though none of her cases resulted in a finding of responsibility, she was determined to not let the matter end. In October 2018 she met with the Title IX staff to suggest ways they could improve.
Lachance said that the school has made improvements "when appropriate" in response to student recommendations on handling reports of sexual misconduct. She is "open to convening a broader conversation about how we deal with it," she said, "and how we can get better at it."
Staff should receive further training on how to speak to victims, Webb said, so they can ask questions that are not violating or blaming. They should stay up to date on technology, so students don't have to explain to them how apps work, and so they know that blocking someone online can delete important information, such as photographic evidence, threats and confessions.
They should make themselves seen around campus, so students recognize them and feel more comfortable talking to them, she said, and she recommended putting a criminal justice professor on the sexual misconduct hearing panel. In addition, the school should have mandatory refresher meetings for students about what counts as sexual misconduct -- it's not just rape, she said -- beyond the first month of freshman year. Otherwise, it seemed they were liable to forget.

Texto completo: Alexis was walking to her car at Thomas College in Waterville in January when she stopped suddenly. A fellow student whom she said repeatedly touched her without her consent sat in the car next to hers, his engine idling. She had obtained a protection from abuse order against him nearly three months ago, but there he was. He appeared to be waiting.
"His car was already cleared off. He could have left at any moment," said Alexis, which is her middle name. Instead, she estimated, he stayed 20 minutes, while she stayed outside, nearly in tears, on the other side of her vehicle, seemingly paralyzed. She didn't have her phone. She was unsure whether to run back inside, fearing he might run her over, she said.
Eventually, another student noticed she was in distress, called the school's Public Safety Department, and the male student drove away, she said. The experience caused her to have a panic attack, and she missed a class, she said.
The male student, whom the Bangor Daily News is not naming because he hasn't been charged with a crime, often appeared when Alexis didn't expect it, she said, ever since she reported him to the school for inappropriately touching her two times and cozying up to her a third time without her permission, during her first few days as a freshman. After she received the no-contact order from the court, he walked toward and past her outside, sat near her in the dining center, and lingered near her in a crowded common area, according to videos she took.
Two other female students also told the school that he touched them on their butt or thighs, according to interviews and documents the students shared with the BDN. But their reports didn't result in a school investigation or punishment. Instead, similar to Alexis' experience, one of the women, who will go by the name Crystal, said she continued to be a target, sometimes with him following her in the dark.
Each encounter with the male student seemed potentially minor, perhaps a mistake. But together they created a pattern, said the women, who are studying criminal justice and psychology, and understand criminal thinking and rules of law. That's one reason why experts say schools should usually investigate reports of sexual misconduct, rather than leaving it up to alleged victims to decide the course of action. Sometimes, the misconduct is not isolated to one, two or even three incidents. Sometimes it interrupts the lives and education of multiple students.
But Thomas College does not automatically investigate cases unless they are egregious or a student specifically requests an investigation. The approach is intended to give alleged victims a choice, but several female students who spoke to the BDN said they were confused, felt burdened by the decision and didn't know what to do. Perhaps one of their reports wouldn't be considered egregious, they said, but what about all of their experiences together?
In addition, schools are supposed to follow federal guidelines, laid out under the federal gender anti-discrimination law Title IX. They say that colleges "must take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate or otherwise determine what occurred" if they know -- or even just "reasonably should know of" -- sex-based harassment that limits students' ability to participate in their education. Laurie Lachance, the president of Thomas College, said the school follows federal requirements.
Schools across the nation often struggle with how to hold students accountable for allegations of rape, said Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, with offices in Massachusetts and Oregon. They are even more likely to struggle with other forms of sex discrimination that may be more subtle but that are also more common -- and can have significant long-term effects.
"I don't think that people understand that sexual harassment is often the gateway to sexual assault," Bruno said.
About 60 percent of female undergraduate students reported being sexually harassed, and 33 percent reported experiencing unwanted sexual contact, in a 2015 survey of more than 150,000 students across 27 institutions in the United States. (Nearly 11 percent of undergraduate women reported experiences that would meet the legal definition of rape.)
The rate of sexual harassment -- which the study defined as behavior that interfered with people's academic performance, limited their ability to participate in academic programs, or created an intimidating or hostile environment -- is estimated to be higher at smaller private schools than at larger public schools.
At Thomas College, a small, private school with about 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students, that would mean a significant number of women are likely to be victims of some type of sexual misconduct during their college career. Most won't report it.
They especially won't report it if they don't think there will be repercussions for the alleged offender or if they don't think school officials will take them seriously.
School administrators might say, "'It doesn't rise to the level,' or 'I'm not really sure he meant that,' or 'Were you clear about what your boundaries were?' They will often put it on the victim," Bruno said.
Lachance, the college president, said that each case "has its own unique facts and circumstances, and we treat them that way. We want to ensure that all students are supported, treated fairly and feel safe, while also protecting the privacy and rights of all involved."
Thomas College students who report sexual misconduct have a choice between taking no action, pursuing an informal process that results in an administrator speaking with the alleged offender but not an official finding of responsibility, or pursuing a formal process that results in an investigation and hearing.
"Thomas College supports the notion that individuals should have decision-making power of their own, access to information and resources to enable them to make informed decisions for themselves," Lachance said. The school honors a student's decision about how he or she wants to proceed "in almost every case, unless circumstances present that pose a serious safety risk or threat to the community."
The school also reviews reports of sexual misconduct against prior reported incidents to determine if there is a pattern of behavior that would warrant an investigation and hearing under the formal disciplinary process, Lachance said.
But, to the female students' knowledge, the school has not opened an investigation into the patterns that they see among the three of them.
The male student first touched Alexis on Aug. 26, 2018, two days after they met during freshman orientation, she said. They were on an L-shaped couch in a residential hall common area, watching a movie. She wasn't feeling well and, thinking they were friends, put her head on his lap. He started rubbing her shoulder and then moved his hand lower to feel her back and butt, she said.
She didn't want him to touch her, but she didn't want to cause an uproar, she said, so she moved farther down her side of the couch. But he slid down, too, and continued to touch her. She moved two more times, she said, and each time he followed and kept touching her.
"I didn't know what to do. I internally panicked," she said.
Her friend Crystal said she witnessed what happened on the couch and saw the male student squeezing and rubbing Alexis' butt.
After the movie, the male student walked Alexis to her dorm room, even though she told him not to, hugged her and whispered into her ear that maybe next time he could give her a full-body massage. The male student did not respond to a request for comment.
It was creepy, Alexis said, but if that's all that happened, maybe she would have left it at that.
The next day, Aug. 27, he did it again while she lay on the same couch, waiting for a class, she said. Unable to sleep the night before, she dozed lightly and awoke to him feeling her back and shoulders, moving his hands toward her butt. She jumped up and said she had to go, she said.
Crystal, Alexis' friend who witnessed the first incident, said the male student also put his hand in the back pocket of her own jeans on Aug. 30 without her permission. The next day, Aug. 31, as he drove Crystal to her home off campus, he moved his hand off the steering wheel and placed it on her left thigh, she said. As he drove, he slowly moved his hand closer and closer to her crotch. The BDN is using a pseudonym because she is an alleged victim of sexual misconduct.
"I didn't know what to do or say, or how to defend myself," Crystal said. "All I could think was, 'What is going on?'"
On Sept. 4, the male student moved closer and closer to Alexis a third time, until his hand was next to her butt, on a couch in the fireplace room of Spann Student Commons, Alexis said. Crystal, who was also present, said she saw how close he had gotten and made up an excuse to leave with Alexis.
The two female students, who had just sat through presentations on Title IX as part of their first-year orientation, knew whom to talk to, and both met with Lisa Desautels-Poliquin, the vice president for student affairs, the following day, Sept. 5.
They both recalled Desautels-Poliquin asking them several times if they ever told the male student "no." They had not and questioned why it should matter.
"If I'm moving away, and you're trying to touch me, that's a 'no,'" Alexis said.
Like many other schools, Thomas College now considers sexual acts consensual only if students "freely and actively" indicate they want sexual contact. A lack of objection isn't enough. "Silence, in and of itself, cannot be interpreted as consent," states Thomas College's sexual misconduct policy.
Outside experts said schools need to investigate reports of sexual touching not just to protect the alleged victim but because they may find that others have been harmed. Title IX officers have to determine whether reported conduct is severe enough to create a hostile environment. A report of rape, for instance, is usually enough to meet that standard. Similarly, a pattern of less physically aggressive behavior could also create a hostile environment.
"Once a school has notice that there is sexual harassment occurring on the campus that's creating a hostile environment, they're obligated to act," said Emma Roth, an attorney with the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. "Under the relevant standards, when you have multiple incidents of sexual harassment there is less of a need to show that any individual incident is very severe."
A third female student said the same male student put his hand on her thigh as they sat in a crowded auditorium in the fall, and continued to rub her leg after she told him loudly to stop. She told a resident assistant, who reported it to the Title IX office. The Title IX staff person she spoke to suggested she should make friends with him and talk to him about it, she said.
Fed up, she walked away. "They weren't going to do anything for me," the woman said.
The three women said they are concerned the male student's inappropriate advances will worsen. "If nothing happens, it's going to escalate," Alexis said.
As of the spring, following months of reporting him to the Title IX office and public safety, none of the female students is convinced the school will act.
When Alexis and Crystal met with Desautels-Poliquin on Sept. 5, they both left thinking she would put an administrative no-contact order in place to prohibit the male student from coming near them. Indeed, Desautels-Poliquin told them in a Sept. 7 email that she had met with the male student that day.
"He is aware of your request to not have any contact with either of you," she wrote.
But after Desautels-Poliquin met with him, he started following Alexis and Crystal, they said.
"I feel like it escalated it," Alexis said. "I felt like I was in danger."
On Sept. 13, Alexis couldn't go into her room because she learned he was there with her roommate, according to Alexis and a person who was with her at the time. She began to panic and had an anxiety attack.
Crystal also saw the male student following her on campus around midnight one night in September, she said. Even when she tested him by taking a zig-zag route, he continued to follow her. He followed Crystal again, this time into the library, on Sept. 23, she said. He turned around and left when she fled up the stairs. Then, on Oct. 2, as Crystal sat in a booth in Spann Commons, he sat down on a nearby chair and waited for her to look up. When she did, he "smirked" at her, she said, before quickly getting up and leaving.
On Oct. 3, the man made Alexis feel unsafe by blocking her exit in Spann Commons, and mutual friends called public safety, which told him to return to his dorm, according to Alexis and Crystal. But Crystal said she saw him again that night.
On Oct. 11, Alexis walked into Gaming Club, and he was there, she said. So she walked out and went to Art Club instead. He followed her, she said, and sat at a table facing her. Two students who were present confirmed seeing him staring at her in an intimidating way, describing Alexis as "obviously shaken," "scared" and "clearly uncomfortable."
This time when she called public safety, however, she learned there wasn't a formal no-contact order on file, which would have likely triggered further sanctions when he violated it. Desautels-Poliquin had only verbally told him not to contact the women.
Lachance said Title IX staff attempt to meet students' individualized requests for protection while balancing the rights of students alleged to have violated the student conduct code. In doing so, the school "has an obligation not to place unnecessary burdens or limitations on either student's access to their educational opportunities and programs," she said.
So Alexis started the process of getting a protection from abuse order with Waterville District Court and, when she met with Desautels-Poliquin on Oct. 17, she decided to secretly record their conversation so she would have evidence of what was said.
For students to make a decision on whether the school should investigate, they should ideally understand their various options, but Alexis said the school didn't fully walk her through what she could expect from the formal process.
To show how the school dealt with her case, she agreed to have her Oct. 17 conversation with Desautels-Poliquin published. In the meeting, Desautels-Poliquin told Alexis that, previously, there wasn't enough to pursue a Title IX case, but now maybe there would be, and she would check with Michelle Joler-Labbe, the chief human resources officer. At the same time, she said it was up to Alexis what she wanted to do.
Desautels-Poliquin shared various avenues for adjudicating the case -- under the sexual misconduct policy or the more general code of conduct -- in such confusing terms, even describing the process as "vague" and "gray," that Alexis said she felt like she was "being thrown in circles."
The BDN shared a transcription of the recording with Lachance, the college president, who said she couldn't comment on it because it was specific to an individual case. However, she said, Title IX staff always make sure students know their options and have ongoing conversations with them about how they want to proceed.
If inappropriate behavior isn't gender-based or sexual in nature, it may not meet the standard for sexual harassment or fall under Title IX rules, but it may violate other standards set out in the school's code of conduct and be dealt with through a different process, Lachance said.
Alexis said the male student continued to intimidate her even though she obtained a court-ordered protection from abuse order Nov. 1 that prohibited him from having "direct or indirect" contact with her. On Nov. 26 he sat by the exit of the dining center so she'd have to walk by him to get out, she said, prompting her to call public safety and, later, Waterville police. He wasn't punished to her knowledge, Alexis said.
So, that day, months after the first incidents, she emailed Desautels-Poliquin to say she'd like to pursue the school's formal process under Title IX.
But neither the investigation nor the protection from abuse order appeared to change the male student's behavior. On Jan. 22, Alexis went outside to clear her car of snow and move it to a different lot so the school could plow, she said. That's when she saw the male student in the vehicle directly next to her, with the engine running, facing out.
Crystal, who had lived off campus, decided to try living in a dorm in January. But she found the man, who lived in a different dorm, frequently in her lobby or on her floor. He never said a word to her, she said, but his presence was frightening. After six weeks, she moved back off campus solely because of him, she said.
When she lived on campus, Crystal frequently found herself walking outside at night because she felt safer out in the open, even though it was freezing cold. One night, a public safety officer found her, she said. She'd been crying and told the officer the male student had been hanging around her dorm. Then the officer asked a question she'd heard before: Did she want to make an official report?
She said no. "I was so tired and exhausted and done with the entire situation. I didn't want to write another report," she said.
Alexis still sees him nearly every day, she said, and keeps track of all the times he stays near her or walks toward her. She took three videos of him remaining in her vicinity in February and March, which the BDN reviewed. In one, he continued walking toward her and past her outside, as she moved over to get away from him. She didn't show the videos to the Title IX office, she said, because she didn't have faith anything would be done.
"It's become a thing of him not caring and me going the other way," she said. He doesn't seem to bother Alexis and Crystal when they are with male friends, they said. Other friends have spoken to him to no avail.
Thomas College didn't investigate the male student for stalking or violating the protection from abuse order, but it did look into the allegations of "non-consensual sexual contact." The man denied touching Alexis' butt.
During the Title IX hearing March 1, Alexis said the panel called one witness: Crystal, who had seen the man feeling her butt on Aug. 26 and Sept. 4. During the hearing, Crystal described saying what she told the BDN. But the statements apparently didn't match what the investigator wrote down in his records, which, according to Alexis and Crystal, appeared to confuse the details and dates of Sept. 4 and 5.
Crystal said she believes the investigator got it wrong, but she had signed his summary, not realizing the error. The school found the male student not in violation of unwanted sexual contact because "information provided by the witness who was present was not found to be consistent to support the allegations."
Alexis appealed the decision, citing the potential error. On April 5, Hannah Gladstone, the Title IX deputy coordinator, notified her that she was denying Alexis' request for appeal "based on insufficient grounds." No further appeals were permitted. Gladstone did not say why there were insufficient grounds for appeal.
Alexis is a criminal justice major and said she believes in the importance of having rules, evidence and a system of justice. Investigations may be tough on victims, she said, but she believes colleges have a duty to investigate.
"If they can get away with it once, they can get away with it four times," she said of alleged offenders. "If someone is assaulted, you shouldn't just let it go."
To her, the school's approach under Title IX -- to be "vague" and "gray" -- did not result in her feeling safer. Instead, it allowed the male student's behavior to drag on. She believes that he shouldn't be allowed to live on campus because he hasn't obeyed the no-contact order.
But the college has assigned Alexis and her alleged offender to the same class next semester. The college declined to remove him from the class without an amendment to Alexis' court-issued protection from abuse order, according to a recording Alexis took of a meeting she had with administrators.
Instead, she was the one to move into a new dorm room because he continued to visit her former roommate, she said. She doesn't go to certain places where she knows he spends time. She avoids certain activities on campus, she said, and will leave a campus event if she sees he's there.
Initially she had stress-related migraines, she said, and a nurse told her she wasn't regulating her blood sugar, even though she's not diabetic. Her anxiety spiked. She always tries to walk on campus with a friend, she said. Even then she finds herself looking over her shoulder.

Texto completo: Leyton Bickford has played somewhat under the radar of Maine's high school basketball world for the last three years while starring for a Sanford High School program that went 20-34 during that span.
But the rugged 6-foot-6-inch junior forward has become well-known in college basketball recruiting circles -- a stage of his career that concluded Sunday with his verbal commitment to accept a full athletic scholarship from the University of Maine beginning in the fall of 2020.
"I'm pretty excited," he said.
Bickford was further motivated to attend UMaine by his interest in the school's mechanical engineering program, as his father is an engineer.
"My strong suit is math and science, and as I've been going through high school I've developed an interest in engineering by myself and not just because of my dad," he said. "But I think it all began with my dad."
Bickford's sister, Gabrielle, is a sophomore at UMaine.
"I feel like I was able to make my commitment early because this my home state, they had my major and I have family close by," he said. "It seemed like the perfect fit for me, especially after I went up and visited. It was a pretty easy decision."
UMaine head coach Richard Barron is prohibited by NCAA rules from commenting on a recruit until the university has received a signed NLI.
Bickford is set to sign his National Letter of Intent officially accepting the scholarship offer in November.
Bickford is a three-year starter at Sanford and ranked among the Class AA leaders statewide last winter with averages of 17.8 points and 11.2 rebounds per game while earning All-Southwestern Activities Association first-team status.
Sanford (6-13) finished sixth in the Heal Points and lost to No. 3 South Portland 65-39 in the Class AA South quarterfinals.
Bickford was named to the SMAA All-Rookie team as a freshman at Sanford, then earned All-SMAA honorable mention recognition after averaging 14.4 points and 9.1 rebounds as a sophomore.
"I decided to focus on basketball after my sophomore year and this year I've actually been working on it every day, sometimes three times a day, to get my shots down and my moves right," he said. "I want to develop into more of a wing player who can shoot and get to the rim rather than a big man like I've been known in Maine because I've been the tallest player on my team."
Bickford also has played football at Sanford, where last fall he caught 20 passes for 329 yards and four touchdowns as a tight end on offense and registered 21 solo tackles, 16 assists and a quarterback sack at defensive end. The Spartans reached the Class A South semifinals before falling to eventual state champion Thornton Academy of Saco 47-7.
Bickford visited the UMaine campus in early April and left impressed by what he experienced.
"I think they embrace the point of being a family and growing as a team instead of someone being the superstar of the team," he said. "It's really like a family relationship."
The Black Bears finished the 2018-2019 season 5-27 overall and 3-13 in America East play. UMaine's season ended with a 73-57 loss at top-seeded Vermont in the conference quarterfinals.
Bickford is the eighth-rated prospect in the Maine class of 2020 by New England Recruiting Report but is the top-ranked interscholastic player in his class. The top seven Maine players in those ratings are prep school players at Hyde School of Bath, Lee Academy, Gould Academy in Bethel and Bridgton Academy.
"I don't think a lot of people really know him because he plays at Sanford," said Robert Pillsbury, director of basketball operations for Bickford's AAU program, Blue Wave Basketball. "He doesn't get as much recognition as he should but he can shoot it, he can put it on the floor and he plays above the rim. He's a big 6-6 kid who can do everything."
Pillsbury said other schools that expressed recent interest in Bickford included McNeese State and Massachusetts.
"If he would have left his recruitment open he would have been in a mid-major school or higher," Pillsbury said.
"The thing with Leyton is that his motor doesn't stop, he just goes after everything. He gets loose rebounds and he's able to push people around a little bit because of his size. I think he's got a bright future at Maine."

Texto completo: This is the second of two stories. Read the first here.
Alexis was walking to her car at Thomas College in Waterville in January when she stopped suddenly. A fellow student whom she said repeatedly touched her without her consent sat in the car next to hers, his engine idling. She had gotten a protection from abuse order against him nearly three months ago, but there he was. He appeared to be waiting.
"His car was already cleared off. He could have left at any moment," said Alexis, which is her middle name. Instead she estimated he stayed 20 minutes, while she stayed outside, nearly in tears, on the other side of her vehicle, seemingly paralyzed. She didn't have her phone. She was unsure whether to run back inside, fearing he might run her over, she said.
Eventually, another student noticed she was in distress, called the school's Public Safety Department, and the male student drove away, she said. The experience caused her to have a panic attack, and she missed a class, she said.
The male student, whom the Bangor Daily News is not naming because he hasn't been charged with a crime, often appeared when Alexis didn't expect it, she said, ever since she reported him to the school for inappropriately touching her two times and cozying up to her a third time without her permission, during her first few days as a freshman. After she got the no-contact order from the court, he walked toward and past her outside, sat near her in the dining center, and lingered near her in a crowded common area, according to videos she took.
Two other female students also told the school that he touched them on their butt or thighs, according to interviews and documents the students shared with the BDN. But their reports didn't result in a school investigation or punishment. Instead, similar to Alexis' experience, one of the women, who will go by the name Crystal, said she continued to be a target, sometimes with him following her in the dark.
Each encounter with the male student seemed potentially minor, perhaps a mistake. But together they created a pattern, said the women, who are studying criminal justice and psychology, and understand criminal thinking and rules of law. That's one reason why experts say schools should usually investigate reports of sexual misconduct, rather than leaving it up to alleged victims to decide the course of action. Sometimes, the misconduct is not isolated to one, or two or even three incidents. Sometimes it interrupts the lives and education of multiple students.
But Thomas College does not automatically investigate cases unless they are egregious or a student specifically requests an investigation. The approach is intended to give alleged victims a choice, but several female students who spoke to the BDN said they were confused, felt burdened by the decision and didn't know what to do. Perhaps one of their reports wouldn't be considered egregious, they said, but what about all of their experiences together?
In addition, schools are supposed to follow federal guidelines, laid out under the federal gender anti-discrimination law Title IX. They say that colleges "must take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate or otherwise determine what occurred" if they know -- or even just "reasonably should know of" -- sex-based harassment that limits students' ability to participate in their education. Laurie Lachance, the president of Thomas College, said the school follows federal requirements.
Schools across the nation often struggle with how to hold students accountable for allegations of rape, said Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, with offices in Massachusetts and Oregon. They are even more likely to struggle with other forms of sex discrimination that may be more subtle but that are also more common -- and can have significant long-term effects.
"I don't think that people understand that sexual harassment is often the gateway to sexual assault," Bruno said.
[image id="2802465"]
About 60 percent of female undergraduate students reported being sexually harassed, and 33 percent reported experiencing unwanted sexual contact, in a 2015 survey of more than 150,000 students across 27 institutions in the United States. (Nearly 11 percent of undergraduate women reported experiences that would meet the legal definition of rape.)
The rate of sexual harassment -- which the study defined as behavior that interfered with people's academic performance, limited their ability to participate in academic programs, or created an intimidating or hostile environment -- is estimated to be higher at smaller private schools than at larger public schools.
At Thomas College, a small, private school with about 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students, that would mean a significant number of women are likely to be victims of some type of sexual misconduct during their college career. Most won't report it.
They especially won't report it if they don't think there will be repercussions for the alleged offender or if they don't think school officials will take them seriously.
School administrators might say, "'It doesn't rise to the level,' or 'I'm not really sure he meant that,' or 'Were you clear about what your boundaries were?' They will often put it on the victim," Bruno said.
Lachance, the college president, said that each case "has its own unique facts and circumstances, and we treat them that way. We want to ensure that all students are supported, treated fairly and feel safe, while also protecting the privacy and rights of all involved."
Thomas College students who report sexual misconduct have a choice between taking no action, pursuing an informal process that results in an administrator speaking with the alleged offender but not an official finding of responsibility, or pursuing a formal process that results in an investigation and hearing.
"Thomas College supports the notion that individuals should have decision making power of their own, access to information and resources to enable them to make informed decisions for themselves," Lachance said. The school honors a student's decision about how he or she wants to proceed "in almost every case, unless circumstances present that pose a serious safety risk or threat to the community."
The school also reviews reports of sexual misconduct against prior reported incidents to determine if there is a pattern of behavior that would warrant an investigation and hearing under the formal disciplinary process, Lachance said.
But, to the female students' knowledge, the school has not opened an investigation into the patterns that they see between the three of them.
The male student first touched Alexis on Aug. 26, 2018, two days after they met during freshman orientation, she said. They were on an L-shaped couch in a residential hall common area, watching a movie. She wasn't feeling well and, thinking they were friends, put her head on his lap. He started rubbing her shoulder and then moved his hand lower to feel her back and butt, she said. The BDN is not naming her because she is an alleged victim of sexual misconduct.
She didn't want him to touch her, but she didn't want to cause an uproar, she said, so she moved farther down her side of the couch. But he slid down, too, and continued to touch her. She moved two more times, she said, and each time he followed and kept touching her.
"I didn't know what to do. I internally panicked," she said.
Her friend Crystal said she witnessed what happened on the couch and saw the male student squeezing and rubbing Alexis' butt.
After the movie, the male student walked Alexis to her dorm room, even though she told him not to, hugged her and whispered into her ear that maybe next time he could give her a full-body massage. The male student did not respond to a request for comment.
It was creepy, Alexis said, but if that's all that happened, maybe she would have left it at that.
The next day, Aug. 27, he did it again while she lay on the same couch, waiting for a class, she said. Unable to sleep the night before, she dozed lightly and awoke to him feeling her back and shoulders, moving his hands toward her butt. She jumped up and said she had to go, she said.
Crystal, Alexis' friend who witnessed the first incident, said the male student also put his hand in the back pocket of her own jeans on Aug. 30 without her permission. The next day, Aug. 31, as he drove Crystal to her home off campus, he moved his hand off the steering wheel and placed it on her left thigh, she said. As he drove, he slowly moved his hand closer and closer to her crotch. The BDN is using a pseudonym because she is an alleged victim of sexual misconduct.
"I didn't know what to do or say, or how to defend myself," Crystal said. "All I could think was, 'What is going on?'"
On Sept. 4, the male student moved closer and closer to Alexis a third time, until his hand was next to her butt, on a couch in the fireplace room of Spann Student Commons, Alexis said. Crystal, who was also present, said she saw how close he had gotten and made up an excuse to leave with Alexis.
The two female students, who had just sat through presentations on Title IX as part of their first-year orientation, knew who to talk to, and both met with Lisa Desautels-Poliquin, the vice president for student affairs, the following day, Sept. 5.

They both recalled Desautels-Poliquin asking them several times if they ever told the male student "no." They had not and questioned why it should matter.
"If I'm moving away, and you're trying to touch me, that's a 'no,'" Alexis said.
Like many other schools, Thomas College now only considers sexual acts consensual if students "freely and actively" indicate they want sexual contact. A lack of objection isn't enough. "Silence, in and of itself, cannot be interpreted as consent," states Thomas College's sexual misconduct policy.
Outside experts said schools need to investigate reports of sexual touching not just to protect the alleged victim but because they may find that others have been harmed. Title IX officers have to determine whether reported conduct is severe enough to create a hostile environment. A report of rape, for instance, is usually enough to meet that standard. Similarly, a pattern of less physically aggressive behavior could also create a hostile environment.
"Once a school has notice that there is sexual harassment occurring on the campus that's creating a hostile environment, they're obligated to act," said Emma Roth, an attorney with the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. "Under the relevant standards, when you have multiple incidents of sexual harassment there is less of a need to show that any individual incident is very severe."
A third female student said the same male student put his hand on her thigh, as they sat in a crowded auditorium in the fall, and continued to rub her leg after she told him loudly to stop. She told a resident assistant, who reported it to the Title IX office. The Title IX staff person she spoke to suggested she should make friends with him and talk to him about it, she said.
Fed up, she walked away. "They weren't going to do anything for me," the woman said.
The three women said they are concerned the male student's inappropriate advances will worsen. "If nothing happens, it's going to escalate," Alexis said.
As of the spring, following months of reporting him to the Title IX office and public safety, none of the female students are convinced the school will act.
When Alexis and Crystal met with Desautels-Poliquin on Sept. 5, they both left thinking she would put an administrative no-contact order in place to prohibit the male student from coming near them. Indeed, Desautels-Poliquin told them in a Sept. 7 email that she had met with the male student that day.
"He is aware of your request to not have any contact with either of you," she wrote.
But after Desautels-Poliquin met with him, he started following Alexis and Crystal, they said.
"I feel like it escalated it," Alexis said. "I felt like I was in danger."
On Sept. 13, Alexis couldn't go into her room because she learned he was there with her roommate, according to Alexis and a person who was with her at the time. She began to panic and had an anxiety attack.
Crystal also saw the male student following her on campus around midnight one day in September, she said. Even when she tested him by taking a zig-zag route, he continued to follow her. He followed Crystal again, this time into the library, on Sept. 23, she said. He turned around and left when she fled up the stairs. Then, on Oct. 2, as Crystal sat in a booth in Spann Commons, he sat down on a nearby chair and waited for her to look up. When she did, he "smirked" at her, she said, before quickly getting up and leaving.
On Oct. 3, the man made Alexis feel unsafe by blocking her exit in Spann Commons, and mutual friends called public safety, which told him to return to his dorm, according to Alexis and Crystal. But Crystal said she saw him again that night.
On Oct. 11, Alexis walked into Gaming Club, and he was there, she said. So she walked out and went to Art Club instead. He followed her, she said, and sat at a table facing her. Two students who were present confirmed seeing him staring at her in an intimidating way, describing Alexis as "obviously shaken," "scared" and "clearly uncomfortable."
This time when she called public safety, however, she learned there wasn't a formal no-contact order on file, which would have likely triggered further sanctions when he violated it. Desautels-Poliquin had only verbally told him not to contact the women.
Lachance said Title IX staff attempt to meet students' individualized requests for protection while balancing the rights of students alleged to have violated the student conduct code. In doing so, the school "has an obligation not to place unnecessary burdens or limitations on either student's access to their educational opportunities and programs," she said.
So Alexis started the process of getting a protection from abuse order with Waterville District Court, and, when she met with Desautels-Poliquin on Oct. 17, she decided to secretly record their conversation, so she would have evidence of what was said.
For students to make a decision on whether the school should investigate, they should ideally understand their various options, but Alexis said the school didn't fully walk her through what she could expect from the formal process.
To show how the school dealt with her case, she agreed to have her Oct. 17 conversation with Desautels-Poliquin published. In the meeting, Desautels-Poliquin told Alexis that, previously, there wasn't enough to pursue a Title IX case, but now maybe there would be, and she would check with Michelle Joler-Labbe, the chief human resources officer. At the same time, she said it was up to Alexis what she wanted to do.
Desautels-Poliquin shared various avenues for adjudicating the case -- under the sexual misconduct policy or the more general code of conduct -- in such confusing terms, even describing the process as "vague" and "gray," that Alexis said she felt like she was "being thrown in circles."
[bdnvideo id="2802523"]
The BDN shared a transcription of the recording with Lachance, the college president, who said she couldn't comment on it because it was specific to an individual case. However, she said, Title IX staff always make sure students know their options and have ongoing conversations with them about how they want to proceed.
If inappropriate behavior isn't gender based or sexual in nature, it may not meet the standard for sexual harassment or fall under Title IX rules, but it may violate other standards set out in the school's code of conduct and be dealt with through a different process, Lachance said.
Alexis said the male student continued to intimidate her even though she got a court-ordered protection from abuse order Nov. 1 that prohibited him from having "direct or indirect" contact with her. On Nov. 26 he sat by the exit of the dining center, so she'd have to walk by him to get out, she said, prompting her to call public safety and, later, Waterville police. He wasn't punished to her knowledge, Alexis said.
So, that day, months after the first incidents, she emailed Desautels-Poliquin to say she'd like to pursue the school's formal process under Title IX.
But neither the investigation nor the protection from abuse order appeared to change the male student's behavior. On Jan. 22, Alexis went outside to clear her car of snow and move it to a different lot, so the school could plow, she said. That's when she saw the male student in the vehicle directly next to her, with the engine running, facing out.
Crystal, who had lived off campus, decided to try living in a dorm in January. But she found the man, who lived in a different dorm, frequently in her lobby or on her floor. He never said a word to her, she said, but his presence was frightening. After six weeks, she moved back off campus solely because of him, she said.
When she lived on campus, Crystal frequently found herself walking outside at night because she felt safer out in the open, even though it was freezing cold. One night, a public safety officer found her, she said. She'd been crying and told the officer the male student had been hanging around her dorm. Then the officer asked a question she'd heard before: Did she want to make an official report?
She said no. "I was so tired and exhausted and done with the entire situation. I didn't want to write another report," she said.
Alexis still sees him nearly every day, she said, and keeps track of all the times he stays near her or walks toward her. She took three videos of him remaining in her vicinity in February and March, which the BDN reviewed. In one, he continued walking toward her and past her outside, as she moved over to get away from him. She didn't show the videos to the Title IX office, she said, because she didn't have faith anything would be done.
"It's become a thing of him not caring and me going the other way," she said. He doesn't seem to bother Alexis and Crystal when they are with male friends, they said. Other friends have spoken to him to no avail.
Thomas College didn't investigate the male student for stalking or violating the protection from abuse order, but it did look into the allegations of "non-consensual sexual contact." The man denied touching Alexis' butt.
During the Title IX hearing March 1, Alexis said the panel called one witness: Crystal, who had seen the man feeling her butt on Aug. 26 and Sept. 4. During the hearing, Crystal described saying what she told the BDN. But the statements apparently didn't match what the investigator wrote down in his records, which, according to Alexis and Crystal, appeared to confuse the details and dates of Sept. 4 and 5.
Crystal said she believes the investigator got it wrong, but she had signed his summary, not realizing the error. The school found the male student not in violation of unwanted sexual contact because "information provided by the witness who was present was not found to be consistent to support the allegations."
Alexis appealed the decision, citing the potential error. On April 5, Hannah Gladstone, the Title IX deputy coordinator, notified her that she was denying Alexis' request for appeal "based on insufficient grounds." No further appeals were permitted. Gladstone did not say why there were insufficient grounds for appeal.
Alexis is a criminal justice major and said she believes in the importance of having rules, evidence and a system of justice. Investigations may be tough on victims, she said, but she believes colleges have a duty to investigate.
"If they can get away with it once, they can get away with it four times," she said of alleged offenders. "If someone is assaulted, you shouldn't just let it go."
To her, the school's approach under Title IX -- to be "vague" and "gray" -- did not result in her feeling safer. Instead, it allowed the male student's behavior to drag on. She believes that he shouldn't be allowed to live on campus because he hasn't obeyed the no-contact order.
But the college has assigned Alexis and her alleged offender to the same class next semester. The college declined to remove him from the class without an amendment to Alexis' court-issued protection from abuse order, according to a recording Alexis took of a meeting she had with administrators.
Instead, she was the one to move into a new dorm room because he continued to visit her former roommate, she said. She doesn't go to certain places where she knows he spends time. She avoids certain activities on campus, she said, and will leave a campus event if she sees he's there.
Initially she had stress-related migraines, she said, and a nurse told her she wasn't regulating her blood sugar, even though she's not diabetic. Her anxiety spiked. She always tries to walk on campus with a friend, she said. Even then she finds herself looking over her shoulder.

ELHS, UMA to team up for two-year aviation program in September

Texto completo: AUBURN — Edward Little High School and the University of Maine at Augusta are teaming up in September to offer a two-year aviation program to juniors and seniors from nine area high schools.
The class is being offered in response to a shortage of pilots in Maine, according to Daniel Leclair, who teaches Unmanned Aircraft Systems at the University of Maine at Augusta and is a colonel in the Civil Air Patrol.
Leclair said by 2035 there will be a shortage of 500,000 pilots worldwide. He said it’s attributable to a number of reasons, including changes in how pilots get their certification and that many pilots are being forced to retire at age 65 due to a law change enacted by Congress in 2009.
“Airlines are adding new routes, but there aren’t enough pilots to cover them,” Leclair said. “There’s also a shortage of pilots in the Air Force. People aren’t joining the military the way they used to, which means less pilots in the military.”
The new program seeks to boost local students’ interest in careers in aviation.
Rachael Magill, director of Early College Programs at UMA, said the high schools are Edward Little, Lewiston, Oxford Hills Comprehensive in Paris, Buckfield Junior-Senior, Oak Hill in Wales, Poland Regional, Lisbon, Telstar in Bethel and Saint Dominic Academy in Auburn.
The first year will offer a class on unmanned aircraft systems, or drones, while the second year offers a class on private pilot licenses.
Students will receive college credit for completing each class, which can transfer to any University of Maine school, Leclair said.
“If the students participating in the program take some summer school classes before heading into their first year at UMA, they could technically be sophomores in their first year,” Leclair added.
Magill said she wishes the classes could be offered to students as early as eighth grade.
“It’d be nice to get these classes available to students as early as middle school,” she said, “because it’s important for high school students to know what they want to do so they can set up their classes for the next four years.
“If they start their junior year and decide that aviation is the route they want to go, it’s harder to catch up to where they need to be,” she said.
The University of Maine at Augusta’s aviation program has been in place for five years, according to Gregory Jolda, aviation program coordinator for UMA.
He said courses offering certificates in unmanned aircraft systems started two years ago.
Leclair, Jolda and Magill visited Edward Little High School on April 24 to explain the program to sophomores and juniors.
“We decided to include sophomores in the presentation because by the time the program starts, they’ll be juniors and available to participate,” Leclair said.
