Texto completo: President Donald Trump pushed the Australian prime minister during a recent telephone call to help Attorney General William Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Trump hopes will discredit the Mueller investigation, according to two U.S. officials with knowledge of the call.
The White House restricted access to the call’s transcript to a small group of the president’s aides, one of the officials said, an unusual decision that is similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president that is at the heart of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into Trump. Like that call, the discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia shows the extent to which Trump sees the attorney general as a critical partner in his goal to show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt and partisan origins and the extent that Trump sees the Justice Department inquiry as a potential way to gain leverage over America’s closest allies.
And like the call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the discussion with Morrison shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.
Trump initiated the discussion in recent weeks with Morrison explicitly for the purpose of requesting Australia’s help in the Justice Department review of the Russia investigation, according to the two people with knowledge of the discussion. Barr requested that Trump speak to Morrison, one of the people said. It came only weeks after Trump seemed to make military aid to Ukraine contingent on Zelenskiy doing him the “favor” of helping Barr with his work.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment nor did a spokesperson for the Australian prime minister.
In making the request, Trump was in effect asking the Australian government to investigate itself. The FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election began after Australian officials told the bureau that the Russian government had made overtures to the Trump campaign about releasing political damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
Australian officials shared that information after its top official in Britain met in London in May 2016 with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who told the Australian about the Russian dirt on Clinton.
Papadopoulos also said that he had heard that the Russians had “thousands” of Clinton’s emails from Joseph Mifsud, an academic. Mifsud, who was last seen working as a visiting professor in Rome, has disappeared. Trump allies, like the president’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have put forth an unsubstantiated claim that Western intelligence agencies planted Mifsud to trap Papadopoulos.
Barr flew to Italy last week and met with Italian government officials Friday. The Justice Department spokeswoman would not say whether he discussed the election inquiry in those meetings, but former Justice Department officials said that Barr would need to ask foreign countries for cooperation in turning over documents pertaining to the 2016 election.
Barr began a review of the Russia investigation this year with the stated goal of determining whether law enforcement or intelligence officials acted inappropriately in their decision during the height of the 2016 presidential campaign to begin investigating whether the Trump campaign was conspiring with Russia’s election interference. But the president has made no secret he sees a larger purpose: to validate his victory and to settle scores with his perceived “deep state” enemies.
The Justice Department said last week that it is exploring the extent to which other countries, including Ukraine, “played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign.” At the very least, Barr has made it clear that he sees his work treading into sensitive territory: how the law enforcement and intelligence agencies of the United States’ closest allies share information with U.S. officials.
Mueller’s investigation confirmed that Australia played a central role in the origins of the original FBI investigation, even if his final report does not mention the country by name. It said that information from a “foreign government” prompted the FBI to “open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities.”
But like so much about the preelection period, the episode has been the subject of a counternarrative marbled with conspiracy: that the Obama administration had dispatched the Australian official, Alexander Downer, to spy on the Trump campaign as part of a broader effort to help Clinton get elected. There is no evidence to support this, but the conspiracy has been advanced by some of the president’s allies in Congress, by some Fox News commentators and in frequent tweets by Papadopoulos.

IT’S NOT EASYBEING GREEN

Texto completo: On Jan. 1 of this year, I began cooking as a vegetarian. Not because I became vegetarian - that would be professionally untenable - but because my younger child did, thus upending most of my hard-won weeknight cooking strategies.
I didn’t think of myself as an animal-centric cook, just your basic modern omnivore. Steaks and lamb chops were an occasional treat, not a routine dinner. But I soon realized that I’d been relying on shortcuts like bacon, anchovy paste, pancetta and fish sauce.
At the same time, I began research on a project about how to cook and eat with less impact on the environment. What I learned made me want to eat not only less meat but also less dairy, which can be just as harmful. It didn’t seem right to simply replace recipes that call for a pound of meat with recipes that call for a pound of cheese, so vegan cooking was also newly intriguing.
It didn’t seem impossible. I knew about putting vegetables at the center of the plate, I had mastered “put an egg on it,” and we already ate salad most nights. So I collected a fresh batch of recipes, laid in a supply of legumes and embarked on my new kitchen life.
The first few weeks, I did what felt normal: I cooked a couple of different things on the nights we all sat down to eat together. But dinner was never on the table before 9 p.m., the food was strangely unsatisfying and the kitchen was absolutely wrecked.
I tacked toward one-dish and one-pot meals. This worked for a while. We had penne with tomatoes and eggplant, followed by pad Thai, followed by macaroni and cheese, at which point there was a mutiny. Noodles every night were not the solution.
So I reached out to my trusted plant-based sources to find out why my omnivore’s skills produced vegetarian fails, and to reteach me how to cook. Here are their critiques:
To make sure dinner was filling, I was stuffing everyone with starch
“A plant-based diet is not going to work exactly like a meat-based one,” said Rich Landau, chef and co-owner of Vedge and other vegetarian restaurants in Philadelphia and Washington. “It’s just not going to fill you up the same way.” In other words, it’s likely that a plant-based dinner at 7 p.m. may not carry everyone over until breakfast the next day. “Herbivores are grazers,” he added.
The fact that my kids were peckish at 9:30 p.m. didn’t mean that I had failed at dinner. It simply meant that I needed to lay in more substantial snacks and let go.
I needed to push more flavor into everything
For meat eaters, the natural umami in meat and fish is satiating; even if the roasted potatoes alongside are plain and the salad dressing is basic, the savoriness brings satisfaction. Without that to lean on, everything on the plate wants to be thoroughly and thoughtfully seasoned, including basics like grains and beans.
“Just using enough salt will get you halfway there,” said Raquel Pelzel, author of “Umami Bomb” (Workman, 2019), a new book of vegetarian recipes built around umami-rich ingredients: cooked tomatoes, mushrooms and Parmesan cheese. Then, she said, build elements like sweetness, heat, acid and smoke. (Smoked paprika is vegan sorcery, used in everything that I once flavored with bacon. I picked up a new trick for the spice from “Sababa,” a new cookbook of Israel-inspired food: The author, Adeena Sussman, recommends stirring it in the end of cooking, to preserve its bright taste.)
Marinate everything that can be marinated, garnish everything that can be garnished (preferably with crunchy things like nuts and croutons) and season your cooking liquids (when you’re pressed for time, throw in a vegetable bouillon cube).
I was avoiding meat and dairy substitutes for no good reason
Growing up among hippies made me perpetually suspicious of anything offered as a healthier substitute for something good. The fact is that there are many products on the market that are delicious on their own terms, and more and more foods that are doing a good job of pretending to be meat and dairy. Go out and try them. Thanks to the recipes in “I Can Cook Vegan,” a new book from chef Isa Chandra Moskowitz, coconut oil is my new best friend.
I was trying to cook too many things
I phoned a fiendishly good home cook of my acquaintance, whose children have been through vegan, vegetarian and pescatarian stages. She spoke some hard truths. “The thing about a vegetable is that you can’t just unwrap it, salt it, sear it and put it in the middle of the plate,” she said. Washing, peeling, cutting and sometimes even blanching must be done before you get to the cooking. “Vegetables just take more work,” she said.
We can’t let that dissuade us from cooking them, but we can remember that one or two vegetables to work with on a weeknight is plenty for most home cooks. A bunch of roasted carrots with yogurt and the nutty spice mix dukkah is dinner; a pile of lemony broccoli or broccoli raab on grilled bread is dinner; spicy tomato soup with bread and cheese is most definitely dinner.
I was being snobbish about frozen vegetables
Pulling off a weeknight vegetarian dinner with variety, like a sheet-pan dinner, a vegetable stew or a stir-fry, means having some parcooked vegetables on hand. New vegetarians are often advised to do a big vegetable shop once a week and prep everything at once. I did it, but was discouraged by the fact that at the end of all that labor, I still had to cook everything as the week went on.
Bhavna Patel, a home cook in Lake City, Florida, with a popular YouTube channel, grew up in Gujarat, India, where a majority of people are vegetarian or vegan. She has streamlined her family’s recipes, she said, and often relies on homemade frozen vegetables. If you are peeling and cutting them anyway, it’s just as easy to boil them in salted water and freeze them in resealable bags. Or, find a brand you like and buy them. The route to dinner is much faster. Her go-to meal for her sons, pav bhaji, is a vegetable curry served on toasted buttered buns.
I also needed to read recipes differently.
Even if a vegetarian recipe has a manageable number of ingredients and a short cooking time (like a stir-fry), it may take a while to get it on the table. That’s because many food publications, including NYT Cooking, measure the cook time starting at the point where the ingredients are already assembled and prepped. (There’s such a wide range of kitchen skills, it wouldn’t be possible to say how long it takes a given cook to do that work.) So a recipe that begins with a pound of washed, stemmed and sliced kale, two cups of chopped onions and six minced garlic cloves is always going to take longer than the estimated time.
I had to stop living in fear.
I felt guilty when my eyes strayed toward the stash of chicken stock in the freezer, and worried about adding fish sauce to a vegan recipe. But your kitchen is not a restaurant, and you are not a giant corporation subject to labeling laws. If everyone decides that the Caesar salad dressing needs anchovies this week, no one will break down your door or take away your membership card. You still get to decide how to cook in your home.

Impeachment is a mistake

Texto completo: Donald Trump committed an impeachable offense on that call with the Ukrainian president. But that doesn't mean Democrats are right to start an impeachment process.
Remember, impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. There is no obligation to prosecute. Congress is supposed to do what is in the best interest of the country. And this process could be very bad for America:
This will probably achieve nothing. To actually remove Trump from office, at least 20 Republican senators would have to vote to convict him. If you think that will happen because of this incident, you haven't been paying attention to the Senate Republicans over the past 2½ years.
Usually when a leader takes a big risk, it's because there's a big upside. But Nancy Pelosi is taking a giant risk and there is little upside. At the end of this process, Trump will probably be acquitted by the Senate. He will declare himself vindicated and victorious in his battle against The Swamp. An ugly backlash could ensue - in both parties.
This is completely elitist. We're in the middle of an election campaign. If Democrats proceed with the impeachment process, it will happen amid candidate debates, primaries and caucuses. Elections give millions and millions of Americans a voice in selecting the president. This process gives 100 mostly millionaire senators a voice in selecting the president.
As these two processes unfold simultaneously, the contrast will be obvious. People will conclude that Democrats are going ahead with impeachment in an election year because they don't trust the democratic process to yield the right outcome. Democratic elites to voters: We don't trust you. Too many of you are racists!
This is not what the country wants to talk about. Pelosi said she would not proceed with impeachment unless there was a bipartisan groundswell of support. There is no bipartisan groundswell, and yet she's proceeding. According to a Quinnipiac University poll, only 37% of Americans support impeachment.
The presidential candidates all report the same phenomenon. Voters are asking them about health care and jobs and climate change, not impeachment. This week, while all this was unfolding, I was in Waco, Nantucket and Kansas City. I had conversations or encounters with hundreds of people. Only one even mentioned impeachment, a fellow journalist.
There is a big difference between the conversation Twitter wants to have and the conversation the broader populace wants to have.
Democrats are playing Trump's game. Trump has no policy agenda. He's incompetent at improving the lives of American citizens, even his own voters. But he's good at one thing: waging reality TV personality wars against coastal elites. So now over the next few months he gets to have a personality war against Nancy Pelosi and Jerrold Nadler.
The Democrats are having a pretty exciting and substantive presidential primary season. This is what democracy is supposed to look like. Why they would want to distract from that is beyond reason. Trump vs. Nadler is exactly the contrast Trump wants to elevate.
This process will increase public cynicism. Impeachment would be an uplifting exercise if we had sober leaders who could put party affiliation aside and impartially weigh the evidence. It would be workable if Congress enjoyed broad public affection and legitimacy. We don't live in that world. This process is already devolving into the sort of mindless partisan war that causes Americans to be disgusted with Washington. Impeachment is no longer a rare and grave crisis in American life; it's becoming a device parties use when the House and the presidency are in the hands of different parties. Democratic House members have already introduced impeachment articles against Trump on at least four occasions. It's just another partisan thing.
This could embed Trumpism within the GOP. If Trump suffers a withering loss in a straight-up election campaign, then his populist tendency might shrink and mainstream Republicans might regain primacy. An election defeat would mean the people don't like Trumpism. But the impeachment process reinforces the core Trumpist deep-state message: The liberal elites screw people like us. If Trump's most visible opponents are D.C. lawyers, Trumpism becomes permanent.
This could distort the Democratic primary process. It's already obvious that impeachment upstages the Democratic primaries. In the months ahead, the Democratic candidates are going to have a harder time getting attention. Democratic policy debates are going to be obscured. Congressional Democrats will become the most visible party leaders.
Impeachment will doubtless roil the Democratic primary race in unpredictable ways. The most bellicose candidates may profit as the impeachment wars grow more vitriolic. The moderates may be further marginalized.
Democrats are running against a man whose approval rating never gets above 45%. They just have to be normal to win. Instead, they're rolling the dice in a very risky way. I get the need to remove this unfit man from office. But this process will not produce that outcome.
An election can save the country. An inside-the-Beltway political brawl will not.

Texto completo: The 12th annual Fox Cities Book Festival, running Oct. 7-13, is right around the corner and will be featuring New York Times best-selling author Elizabeth Letts.
Letts is known for her most recent book "Finding Dorothy." Her richly imagined novel tells the story behind "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz," the book that inspired the iconic film, through the eyes of author L. Frank Baum's intrepid wife Maud.
Fans of "The Wizard of Oz" will delight in this novel. The New York Times wrote, "As with all great historical fiction, the allure of Finding Dorothy is the curiosity it inspires. Readers will find themselves wanting to know more, wondering what is fact and what is Letts's imagination. In this case, Letts has brought an unknown woman to life in an engaging and thorough novel."
Some facts about "The Wizard of Oz":
Oconomowoc's Strand Theater hosted the world premiere of "The Wizard of Oz" on Aug. 12, 1939 — three days before the big Hollywood premiere.
The "horse of a different color" was actually more than one horse. They used powdered Jell-O to create the colors, and the most difficult part of filming the scene was that the horses wanted to lick the Jell-O off their coats.
Judy Garland's closest relationship on the set was with Margaret Hamilton — in real life, the Wicked Witch was kind and got along well with children.
In the famous scene when the house is sucked up into the vortex of the tornado, the set designers made a miniature scale model of the house and filmed it falling — and then reversed it.
The song, "Over the Rainbow," was almost cut from the film. The reprise, originally sung during a scene in the witch's castle, was actually cut. Film of that scene has never been found.
These fun facts, along with a set of discussion questions are available on the author's website, elizabethletts.com. Letts will be presenting at 1 p.m. Oct. 13 at the Lawrence Memorial Chapel during the festival. Books will be available for purchase during the event, and the author will be signing after.
There are 56 other presenters at nine additional venues the other six days of the festival, including Newbery-award-winning author Avi. Avi will be presenting to students at six area school districts and will be signing books from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. Oct. 12 at Elisha D. Smith Public Library in Menasha.
All Fox Cities Book Festival events are free and open to the public and do not require tickets or registration. The Fox Cities Book Festival works closely with area public libraries and schools on the festival and the Fox Cities Reads. The full schedule of events can be viewed at foxcitiesbookfestival.org, or grab a booklet from your local public library.
Following the festival this year, the organization is planning a Lunch & Launch from noon to 1 p.m. Oct. 15 at Long Cheng Marketplace in Appleton to announce the NEA Big Read: Fox Cities Reads 2020 titles. The event will include a brief presentation by Dr. Pafoua Her, Appleton's first Diversity & Inclusion Coordinator, a poetry reading courtesy of local poet, Gaochi Vang, and live music. Participants are encouraged to purchase lunch from one of the marketplace vendors while they enjoy the announcement program.

Texto completo: The Los Angeles Police Department has opened an inquiry after a recruitment ad went up on the right-wing website Breitbart, saying such a job listing would conflict with the department's "core values."
After being peppered with questions on social media, Police Chief Michel Moore said Saturday on Twitter that the LAPD did not purchase ad space from the site and is trying to determine whether the posting was meant to "discredit" the department. The LAPD's official Twitter account said in a separate set of messages that the department is looking for ways to ensure that the situation doesn't happen again.
"We are aware that a recruitment advertisement has been circulated on a website that creates a negative juxtaposition to our core values," department officials said in a separate Twitter message.

Critics have repeatedly accused Breitbart of running racist and sexist content over the past decade, pointing to articles with such headlines as "The Smartest People in the World Are All Men," "Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy" and "Data: Young Muslims Are a Ticking Time Bomb in the West."
Asked about the LAPD tweets, Breitbart spokeswoman Elizabeth Moore issued a statement saying the company is "one of the most pro-police, pro-law-enforcement news organizations in America."
"We have been cited by the New York Times Magazine as having one of the most diverse newsrooms in the nation, with a history of promoting women and minorities into leadership positions. We also know we have strong readership among the rank-and-file in the LAPD," the spokeswoman said.
Hours after the police chief raised concerns about the job listing -- which says "Choose your future! LAPD is hiring!" -- officials with the city's personnel department issued their own statement saying their recruitment ad had wound up on "sites that do not reflect the city's values."
In an interview, personnel department spokesman Bruce Whidden confirmed that his agency purchases job ads through Google on behalf of the LAPD and other city departments. The department is now reexamining its ad filters, he said.
"We have suspended all Google ad placements while we review and make sure that they are going to the places we want them to go to," Whidden said Saturday. "We had no intention of having an ad placed on that site."
City officials made their remarks a day after Noah Shachtman, editor-in-chief of the Daily Beast, used his Twitter account to ask why LAPD recruitment ads were appearing on Breitbart, which has seen a number of advertisers flee the site in recent years.
Companies that purchase online advertising typically rely on Google, Facebook or other third parties and frequently don't know where their messages are appearing, said Matt Rivitz, founder of Sleeping Giants, a volunteer-driven campaign aimed at targeting racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry in the media -- and a frequent Breitbart antagonist.
If those companies don't want their ads on a website, they need to actively opt out, said Rivitz, who works professionally as an advertising copy writer.
Sleeping Giants, which has more than 200,000 followers on Twitter, has waged a concentrated messaging campaign against Breitbart, regularly asking advertisers on the site whether they want their products to be associated with the site's articles.
According to Politico, the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke ejected a Breitbart News reporter from a campaign event last month, saying the website "walks the line between being news and a perpetrator of hate speech."
Breitbart objected to those statements, telling Politico: "The false accusation that Breitbart is racist, or that its award winning reporter -- an Orthodox Jew, married to a black woman who serves in the military -- is either racist or would make anyone at a black university uncomfortable is absurd."
Rivitz said he would be surprised if LAPD brass knew its ad had been running on Breitbart. If L.A. drops Breitbart as a venue for its advertising, it would join 4,300 other companies, nonprofit groups and others that have publicly pulled their advertising from the site, he said.
"It means that advertisers are starting to take more control over where they show up online," Rivitz said.
The people posting on the LAPD's official Twitter account said they had not figured out whether the job posting was connected to the department.

I'd Love a Dining Car

Texto completo: I'd love a dining car on the train. Or any chance to slow down.
I was covered in a layer of sweat, and my iPhone charger was dangling out of a bag that contained the after-hours work I still needed to do along with a Lara bar, crushed under the weight of my laptop. It should have been obvious: I'd been stressed, and moving way too fast. But, as usual, I didn't realize it until I was on the train. I poked my head out of my inbox long enough to play peek-a-boo with a toddler clutching her snack, and chat with an older couple en route to vacation. I felt joy, and a familiar pang of shame that comes from realizing you've moved too fast to cherish what's in front of you.
Riding the train is always a reminder of the things I don't do enough: sit and talk with strangers. Spend time in a space designated for one thing instead of a multitasking hub designed to be everything all at once. Slow down. While the train is often the fastest way to my destination, it's also the most leisurely. And these days, leisure can feel like an afterthought.
Amtrak announced in late September that it would halt its dining service on long-distance trains, trading traditional dining cars -- the more luxurious version of the cafe car I sat in as I traveled home that harried evening -- for "flexible" and "contemporary" dining options. While the change will only affect certain East Coast one-night routes, it ignited a conversation about all that is lost in an attempt to have more: more privacy instead of sitting next to fellow travelers, more time to do things more productive than waiting for a meal, more quickness and ease. The desire to "lure a younger generation of riders," cited as part of the reason for the change, is an example of what feels like a message from society to millennials in particular: We're going to offer less and expect you to get more out of it.
The suggestion that, as a 26-year-old, I should find meaning in something that's sparse, impersonal and temporary feels all too familiar. Millennials work more jobs for less money, and have fewer assets and wealth than previous generations did at the same age. (It's not lost on me that Amtrak's decision to cut the dining car, pitched as a way to appeal to younger riders, will eliminate the jobs of a variety of union workers.) On top of that is an added tsk-tsking that we should always be operating more efficiently. There's furniture millennials can rent to temporarily furnish the apartments and homes we don't own, because, in case you haven't heard, an entire generation has been accused of spending our down payments on avocado toast and coffee. There's date night subscription boxes intended to take the guesswork out of planning and romance, and meal prep services aimed at helping us spend less time in the grocery store.
"Who doesn't want that?" I wonder as I fire off emails for one job on one device, while skimming a document for a second job on another. "Who doesn't want more ease?" I think, as I look around my apartment bedroom, with its efficient closet organization system and a nightstand purchased from Facebook Marketplace -- perfectly practical. Nothing is excessive and everything is purposeful, but it's a sterile place to exist, where function trumps comfort.
The truth is, I don't always want this kind of life.
Just like Amtrak citing prepackaged meals as a chic and contemporary workaround to a prepared meal, the emphasis on ease -- on maximizing every second -- is supposed to be sexy. But it can feel exhausting.
The idea that young people like me are always on the go, always in transition and always on masks that we might actually desire slowness, want to relish an experience, or enjoy taking a moment to feel comfortable and human instead of curated and optimized.
Our experiences at work, in our homes and even in transit can be chopped up into pieces of purpose and service. Anything else -- any lingering, any humanity -- can feel superfluous, or even wasteful, especially for a generation scapegoated as entitled for wanting things that used to be considered basic. It's as though doing more (even when we're doing something as simple and sedentary as riding a train) with less is always the ultimate goal.
It's not difficult to see why, when an advertisement highlighting convenience and quickness pops up, we believe maybe this really is the thing that will make life better. Maybe this is what "contemporary" looks like. But I wish small things -- meals on a train, unplanned moments that can't be logged as self-improvement or furniture that is owned -- didn't feel old-fashioned. I wish people knew that my generation wants more than to optimize our lives, or to feel trendy because of how fast we're hustling. I wish slowing down didn't feel like a luxury.

FBI reportedly investigating NJ tax breaks

Texto completo: FBI agents in Philadelphia are investigating New Jersey's tax-break policies, which are also the center of a task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy formed earlier this year, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
The Inquirer cited multiple anonymous sources but reported that interviews of witnesses started a month ago and focused on development in Camden.
The revelations of federal agents investigating the tax breaks, which were used heavily under former former Gov. Chris Christie, also follow a steady stream of news reports raising questions about how the programs were administered and how companies took advantage of them.
The New York Times reported earlier in the week that a dozen companies had threatened to leave New Jersey for the same building complex in New York if they did not receive tax breaks.
But they never did, and many of them never seriously considered moving to the Blue Hill Plaza in Pearl River, New York, located just a half-mile from the New Jersey border in Bergen County.
New Jersey's two major tax credit programs were designed to encourage businesses to create jobs and to invest in the Garden State, and Christie, a Republican, and many Democrats who supported the incentives have defended them as essential tools to compete with neighboring states.
The programs expired in July, but were already at the center of scrutiny before Philadelphia authorities reportedly joined the fray.
The Attorney General's office in New Jersey has also been looking into the incentives, and the state comptroller issued a damning audit of the incentives at the beginning of the year, saying that they lacked proper controls and there was no way for the state to check if jobs were created.
Murphy's task force, led by a small team of white-collar attorneys, found in an initial report that special interests were overly influential on the creation and implementation of the credits, and that the agency doling out the awards didn't have the proper procedures in place to confirm the validity of applications worth millions of dollars in forfeited taxes.
The task force's biggest targets so far have been companies connected to George E. Norcross III, the heavily influential Democrat from South Jersey who worked closely with longtime friend Stephen Sweeney, the Democratic Senate president, and Christie on a range of policies over the years. Of nearly $11 billion in awarded tax breaks, about $1.1 billion in incentives went to those companies, all located in Camden.
One of the organizations connected to Norcross, Cooper University Hospital, has hired the high-profile attorney Abbe Lowell, according to Politico New Jersey. The hiring of Lowell, who represented U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez in his corruption trial and White House adviser Jared Kushner in the special counsel's investigation of the Donald Trump presidential campaign, could be a sign that Cooper is facing a serious legal challenge.
For his part, Christie, a former federal prosecutor, said he is "not concerned" about the investigations and that they could be a reaction to media coverage and "the circus that's been created at the State House."
Christie, whose institute is founded on civility in politics, blasted his Democratic successor, Murphy, for putting such heavy focus on the tax incentives.
"It's political theater by a guy who understands theater and who needs a show to distract from the fact that the major things that he ran on, he simply hasn't accomplished even though he has a Legislature of his own party," Christie said.
As much as $500 million in tax incentives were subject to being suspended by the state or have been voluntarily terminated already, the task force said in its 75-page report, issued in June. But that money has since been released, according to NJ Advance Media.

Revelan que Trump insinuaría ejecutar a quienes filtraron información en su contra

Texto completo: El presidente, Donald Trump, le dijo este jueves a un grupo de funcionarios que quiere saber quién suministró la información sobre su llamada al presidente de Ucrania, lo que provocó que la Cámara de Representantes haya iniciado un juicio político en su contra.
El presidente insinuó que les castigaría con la pena de muerte, según ha reportado el diario The New York Times, lo que sorprendió a algunos en la audiencia.
“Quiero saber quién es la persona que le dio la información al informante porque eso se acerca a un espía”, dijo Trump. “¿Sabes qué solíamos hacer en los viejos tiempos cuando éramos inteligentes con los espías y la traición, cierto? Solíamos manejarlo un poco diferente de lo que hacemos ahora”, agregó.
Asimsimo, Trump indicó que el informante no había escuchado la llamada en cuestión y que había obtenido detalles a través de los comentarios de varios oficiales.
El informante, que aún no ha sido identificado, lo reconoció aunque citó cuentas de la Casa Blanca relacionadas con “negocios interagenciales oficiales”, reportó Los Angeles Times.
El mandatario ha hecho las declaraciones en una reunión con representantes estadounidenses ante la Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU).
El mismo diario ha reportado que una persona presente en el evento le compartió una grabación de los comentarios del presidente.
Algunos asistentes rieron, como si se tratara de una broma.
Durante el evento al que no tuvo acceso la prensa, Trump se quejó varias veces del informante y criticó a los medios por haber reportado la denuncia, la cual describió como “deshonesta”.
Trump ha dicho también que la prensa es “escoria”.
La Comisión de Inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes ha hecho pública esta mañana la denuncia del informante.
El documento ha sido divulgado dos días después de que la presidenta la Cámara, la demócrata Nancy Pelosi, anunciara el inicio de una investigación de juicio político en contra de Trump debido a los hechos vinculados a la llamada entre él y el presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, el 25 de julio.
“El presidente de Estados Unidos está usando el poder de su cargo para solicitar interferencia de un país extranjero en las elecciones de Estados Unidos en 2020” , ha dicho el informante.
En la denuncia, con fecha del 12 de agosto, el informante indica: “en los últimos cuatro meses, más de media docena de funcionarios de Estados Unidos me han informado de varios hechos relaciones con este esfuerzo”.
El informante dice que el abogado personal de Trump, Rudolph Giuliani, es una “figura central” en las acciones y que el procurador general, William Bar, “parece estar involucrado también” en la trama.
“La interferencia incluye, entre otras cosas, presionar a un país extranjero para investigar los principales rivales internos del presidente ”, señala el reporte.
Luego del evento en las Naciones Unidas, Trump participó en un evento de campaña para recoger fondos, de donde salió diciendo que la llamada es la “cosa más grandiosa” que le ha pasado al Partido Republicano porque había recaudado mucho dinero luego de la polémica.
El portavoz de la Casa Blanca no ha respondido a una solicitud de comentarios sobre el tema, ha señalado el diario.
Sobre el documento del informante, Stephanie Grisham, directora de comunicaciones de la Casa Blanca, ha respondido diciendo que “no es más que una colección de relatos de eventos de terceros y recortes de prensa improvisados” .
La presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, olvidó en un avión el discurso con el que iba a anunciar el inicio de una investigación de juicio político en contra de Trump, ha informado la agencia de noticias Reuters.
Pelosi había pasado el fin de semana analizando las acusaciones en contra de Trump y empezó a redactar su discurso en un vuelo de Nueva York a Washington, pero lo dejo en un avión, ha dicho una persona familiarizada con el incidente
Sin embargo, no todo se perdió. “Al menos lo había organizado en su cabeza”, ha agregado la fuente.
Fue así como Pelosi reconstruyó el discurso de memoria, en el que dijo que las acciones de Trump ponían en peligro la seguridad nacional y violaban la Constitución.

Texto completo: El presidente, Donald Trump, le dijo este jueves a un grupo de funcionarios que quiere saber quién suministró la información sobre su llamada al presidente de Ucrania, lo que provocó que la Cámara de Representantes haya iniciado un juicio político en su contra.
El presidente insinuó que les castigaría con la pena de muerte, según ha reportado el diario The New York Times, lo que sorprendió a algunos en la audiencia.
“Quiero saber quién es la persona que le dio la información al informante porque eso se acerca a un espía”, dijo Trump. “¿Sabes qué solíamos hacer en los viejos tiempos cuando éramos inteligentes con los espías y la traición, cierto? Solíamos manejarlo un poco diferente de lo que hacemos ahora”, agregó.
Asimsimo, Trump indicó que el informante no había escuchado la llamada en cuestión y que había obtenido detalles a través de los comentarios de varios oficiales.
El informante, que aún no ha sido identificado, lo reconoció aunque citó cuentas de la Casa Blanca relacionadas con “negocios interagenciales oficiales”, reportó Los Angeles Times.
El mandatario ha hecho las declaraciones en una reunión con representantes estadounidenses ante la Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU).
El mismo diario ha reportado que una persona presente en el evento le compartió una grabación de los comentarios del presidente.
Algunos asistentes rieron, como si se tratara de una broma.
Durante el evento al que no tuvo acceso la prensa, Trump se quejó varias veces del informante y criticó a los medios por haber reportado la denuncia, la cual describió como “deshonesta”.
Trump ha dicho también que la prensa es “escoria”.
La Comisión de Inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes ha hecho pública esta mañana la denuncia del informante.
El documento ha sido divulgado dos días después de que la presidenta la Cámara, la demócrata Nancy Pelosi, anunciara el inicio de una investigación de juicio político en contra de Trump debido a los hechos vinculados a la llamada entre él y el presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, el 25 de julio.
“El presidente de Estados Unidos está usando el poder de su cargo para solicitar interferencia de un país extranjero en las elecciones de Estados Unidos en 2020” , ha dicho el informante.
En la denuncia, con fecha del 12 de agosto, el informante indica: “en los últimos cuatro meses, más de media docena de funcionarios de Estados Unidos me han informado de varios hechos relaciones con este esfuerzo”.
El informante dice que el abogado personal de Trump, Rudolph Giuliani, es una “figura central” en las acciones y que el procurador general, William Bar, “parece estar involucrado también” en la trama.
“La interferencia incluye, entre otras cosas, presionar a un país extranjero para investigar los principales rivales internos del presidente ”, señala el reporte.
Luego del evento en las Naciones Unidas, Trump participó en un evento de campaña para recoger fondos, de donde salió diciendo que la llamada es la “cosa más grandiosa” que le ha pasado al Partido Republicano porque había recaudado mucho dinero luego de la polémica.
El portavoz de la Casa Blanca no ha respondido a una solicitud de comentarios sobre el tema, ha señalado el diario.
Sobre el documento del informante, Stephanie Grisham, directora de comunicaciones de la Casa Blanca, ha respondido diciendo que “no es más que una colección de relatos de eventos de terceros y recortes de prensa improvisados” .
La presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, olvidó en un avión el discurso con el que iba a anunciar el inicio de una investigación de juicio político en contra de Trump, ha informado la agencia de noticias Reuters.
Pelosi había pasado el fin de semana analizando las acusaciones en contra de Trump y empezó a redactar su discurso en un vuelo de Nueva York a Washington, pero lo dejo en un avión, ha dicho una persona familiarizada con el incidente
Sin embargo, no todo se perdió. “Al menos lo había organizado en su cabeza”, ha agregado la fuente.

Texto completo: Putting a focus on Trump’s reprehensible behavior
Republican leaders face a choice. Remaining silent is to be complicit in this administration’s negative impact on our democracy; their small surrenders will lead to larger ones until there is nothing left. For the sake of the country, publicly confronting President Donald Trump and his administration will expose their lies, violation of laws and incompetence. My intent here is to focus on Trump’s behavior, not his policies, and — for those still equivocating — to show how reprehensible this administration is.
Moral disengagement: Trump is tone-deaf to the unlawful or unseemly acts he, his associates and his administration have committed: banking and tax law violations by Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, payoffs to mistresses, separating migrant families and advocating racist politics.
Vilifying people: At rallies, Trump encourages supporters to rough up protesters. Migrants come from s---hole countries; U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff is “sleazy” and “totally biased”; four female members of Congress should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.”
Sabotaging the press: “Any negative polls are fake news,” Trump tweeted. He sent Gail Collins of The New York Times a letter calling her “a dog and a liar.” Gloating about a Republican congressional candidate who had assaulted a reporter, “Any guy that can do a body slam ... he’s my guy.”
Demeaning foreign leaders: He shames Andrea Merkel about refugees and calls the mayor of London a “stone cold loser” and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest & weak.”
Subverting standards of behavior: Trump flouts norms and rules governing nepotism, emoluments, the American electoral process, political civility and serial lying.
Distorting reality: At the United Nations, Trump, the “chosen one,” stated, “In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.” As the audience laughed, Trump added, “So true.” He later claimed, “They weren’t laughing at me, they were laughing with me.”
Misperceiving reality creates frightful consequences for the rest of us.

Political parties have become extreme, fail to compromise
I found Peter Hoe Burling’s recent Forum letter (“Focus of N.H. Republicans is winning, not governing,” Sept. 24) both interesting and disappointing.
His premise, that New Hampshire Republicans “do not strive to govern; they strive to win,” is just another example of how broken and ineffective our political system has become. His letter could have been easily written by a Republican suggesting the Democrats aren’t governing anymore and are just looking at ways to win.
Each party has come to believe it is better or superior to the other, and each has become more extreme. Both have forgotten that our process and success is based on our ability to compromise. When, if ever, will we get back to two political parties that understand our country was created on the premise of “we the people,” and not “we the party”?

Thanks to young writer for a relevant, inspirational poem
Thanks you for featuring Alaina Jarrett’s Pain vs. Hope (“A poem to be read in both directions”) in the most recent Young Writers Project column (“Students invent fanciful names for crayon colors,” Sept. 24).
What a sensitive piece that manages to capture both sides of the fence and gently leads the reader back to potential, a positive conviction and to inspiration. This is a lovely poem that has much relevance for individuals, groups and for social service organizations.
My hope is that Alaina keeps writing on. Her words are precious.
Many thanks for the introduction.

Texto completo: Young people like Greta Thunberg are participating in the culture wars while also managing to float above the fray.
The kids aren't just all right -- they're scrambling the brains of their political enemies.
Last Friday, millions of people, many of them children and teenagers, took to the streets during the Global Climate Strike, a protest inspired by Fridays for Future, the international youth effort started by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. The protesters' call for broad action to combat global warming was powerful, as was the message sent by their numbers: Dynamic, frustrated young people are instilling in the climate movement a new urgency.
Online, the climate kids' impact can be measured in a different way -- by how they're short-circuiting the right-wing media ecosystem that's partly responsible for the spread of climate skepticism. Since Friday's strike, pro-Trump media and conservative cable news pundits have devoted significant resources to turning the children of the climate movement into Public Enemy No. 1.
Over the weekend, Alan Jones, an Australian broadcaster for Sky News, delivered a monologue calling the climate-striking youth "selfish, badly educated, virtue-signaling little turds." Mr. Jones finished by reading a letter arguing that children concerned about climate change should "wake up, grow up and shut up until you're sure of the facts before protesting." The rant echoed other criticisms of the protest from the right. "I wish I could inject that letter into my veins," a blogger for the conservative site RedState wrote.
Ms. Thunberg has been the primary target of this vitriol. On Saturday, the pro-Trump media figure Dinesh D'Souza likened Ms. Thunberg to models in Nazi propaganda. Videos of her speeches have been edited to replace her voice with Adolf Hitler's. On Fox News on Monday evening, the Daily Wire pundit Michael Knowles called Ms. Thunberg -- who is open about being on the autism spectrum -- "a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents." (Fox News issued an apology and called the comment "disgraceful.")
A few hours later, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham likened her to children from the horror film "Children of the Corn." A Breitbart contributor wrote that she deserved "a spanking or a psychological intervention." And she's attracted the ire of President Trump on Twitter -- a jab with which Ms. Thunberg had some fun.
To be clear: battling Fox News and subtweeting the president are hardly the youth climate movement's main goal. Still, it's a notable case study in the limits of the right's ability to wage an information war across the media.

Much like the Parkland students, who proved to be a formidable opposition to the pro-Trump media apparatus that accused them of being crisis actors, Ms. Thunberg and the climate kids seem immune to the usual tactics of right-wing media. As newcomers, they're mostly impervious to the right's tool of personal attacks. They don't have the baggage of voting records or deep financial ties to political organizations.
This doesn't mean their enemies aren't trying -- this week, a pro-Trump blog feebly attempted to tie Ms. Thunberg to the billionaire George Soros, who has been the subject of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Online, far-right trolls are mounting an effort to harass the young women of the climate movement. Some of the onslaught is believed to be inauthentic -- 5,000 tweets by suspected bots have mentioned Ms. Thunberg, according to BuzzFeed News. Similarly, toxic pro-Trump communities have zeroed in on teenage climate protesters. As of this writing, three of the top 25 posts from Reddit's The_Donald forum in the last week were direct attacks on Ms. Thunberg. And yet, the usual smears don't seem to stick.
Growing up online doesn't hurt either. In 2018, I wrote that a strength of the Parkland students was being "effectively born onto the internet and innately capable of waging an information war." The activists of the climate youth movement are no different -- they're battle-hardened by the internet and they've found a way to turn online organizing into mobilization on the streets.
Perhaps most important is their instinctive understanding of attention and how to wield it as both a weapon and a tool. They understand how to attract attention: Their protests feature meme-able signs to capture interest across social media. Their events -- from global strikes to sit-ins in the House speaker's hallway -- are tailored to garner media coverage. They also know how to spot enemies looking to divert attention and to ignore or dismiss them.
Simply put, they don't seem to care what adults, skeptics, deniers and crusty politicians think of them. And they waste very little of their time, energy and focus work-shopping their message or bulletproofing it against criticism. They simply pay their enemies no attention. They're participating in the culture wars while also managing to float above the fray.
None in the movement embody this like Ms. Thunberg, who suffers no fools in her unsparing and blunt statements to diplomats and members of Congress alike. Some of this may be the result of age, what Robinson Meyer at The Atlantic describes as the "unique moral position of being a teenager," in which "she can see the world through an 'adult' moral lens" but "unlike an actual adult, she bears almost no conscious blame for this dismal state."
She does not allow her message -- that the youth of the world have been betrayed by past generations' inaction on climate change -- to be co-opted by fawning lawmakers, and she dismisses their praise for her as a tragic role reversal that forces her to be the adult in a room of well-dressed children. And she seems keenly aware that her rivals' critiques are merely efforts to divert her attention. "It seems they will cross every possible line to avert the focus, since they are so desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis," she wrote of her "haters" on Twitter on Wednesday.
The usual tactics of the right-wing media break down in the face of this type of resolve. While outrage campaigns intended to work the refs and appeal to fears of appearing partisan may work with lawmakers or companies in Silicon Valley, the youth climate movement appears wholly unmoved. While the levers for climate progress proposed by solutions like a Green New Deal are undoubtedly political, the broader movement's desire -- an inhabitable earth for all -- is far from partisan. The stakes, as the movement sees it, are too high to focus attention on the trolls. And the pressure, from conservative pundits and Breitbart contributors, doesn't just get dismissed, it goes unnoticed.
Faced with a political enemy that pays it no attention, the right is palpably frustrated. They argue that children have become, as a headline on an essay by Commentary's Noah Rothman put it, "Child Soldiers in the Culture wars," are insulated against criticism because of their age and innocence. "How do you respond to statements like that?" the Fox News host Tucker Carlson said recently of Ms. Thunberg's forthright speeches. "The truth is you can't respond. And of course, that's the point."
But as the past week shows, the right is perfectly willing to attack the children. Instead, the problem is that, as Mr. Carlson seems to realize, there's just not a very resonant counter message for a youth movement to protect the planet. Polling also suggests that there's an increasingly shrinking pool of conservative listeners for it, with a majority of Republicans under age 45 now identifying as concerned about climate change. And so it feels increasingly likely that, when it comes to climate, the right-wing media, which is skewed toward an aging Republican audience, may simply be obsolete.
In other words, it's not that the right can't attack the climate kids because of their age. Rather, it's that because of their age, the right's attacks feel especially feeble.

Democrats’ double standard on Ukraine

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — We don’t yet know whether President Trump delayed some military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get Ukraine’s president to reopen an investigation into Hunter Biden. But if we are concerned about U.S. officials inappropriately threatening aid to Ukraine, then there are others who have some explaining to do.
It got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote a letter to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as “strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,” the Democratic senators declared, “We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,” before demanding Lutsenko “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”
So, it’s okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it’s not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?
And then there is Joe Biden. In 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire the country’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. According to the New York Times, “Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden ... who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.” The Post reports that it is “unclear how seriously Shokin — who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall — was scrutinizing Burisma when he was forced out.” But what is clear is that Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: “I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b —. He got fired.”
This weekend, Biden told reporters, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.” That is flatly untrue. Hunter admitted in an interview with the New Yorker that his father expressed concern about the Burisma post at least once: “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’” Moreover, the New Yorker reports that, “In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden.”
So, Biden was fully aware of his son’s involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016. He should have known that his using U.S. aid as leverage to force the prosecutor’s dismissal would create, at a bare minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest.
On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced that Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, “It’s time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president.” Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Biden than the president. It will keep the story of Biden’s conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election. Senate Republicans can demand that Hunter Biden testify, and subpoena Obama White House aides to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it.
Put aside the prosecutor’s firing. Hunter took the position with a Ukrainian natural gas company just a few weeks after his father visited Ukraine in 2014 to urge its government to increase its natural gas production. He had no expertise in Ukraine or natural gas. It will not just be Republicans calling this suspicious; nonpartisan experts in ethics law will testify that this a major conflict of interest.
And the focus will not just be on Ukraine but also how, as The Post reported, “for more than two decades, [Hunter’s] professional work often tracked with his father’s life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China.”
While Senate Republicans will not remove Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide that Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need. The irony is the Democrats’ investigation might do more to deny Biden the presidency than Trump.

Texto completo: A $391 million military assistance package for Ukraine is at the center of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, with President Trump protesting that his predecessor sent "pillows and sheets" while he, after briefly delaying the aid, sent lethal weapons.
Trump allegedly told his staff to freeze the funds days before he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a congratulatory telephone call to investigate Democratic presidential contender and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who got a lucrative consulting gig in Ukraine soon after President Barack Obama made his father point man on Ukraine policy. The aid was held back for two months before being released last week, and Democrats contend Trump wanted a Biden investigation in exchange for the assistance.
Trump defended his support for Ukraine during a Wednesday meeting with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.
"Frankly, President Obama was sending you pillows and sheets, and I gave you anti-tank busters. And a lot of people didn't want to do that. But I did it," Trump told Zelensky.
The anti-tank busters are Javelin missile systems, which use advanced infrared technology to lock onto targets and destroy them from a distance of 1.6 miles. The Javelin is particularly deadly because it is a "fire and forget" system that allows a soldier to fire a missile and relocate to another position. Unlike other anti-tank weapons, Javelin missiles fire up into the air and strike a target from above, making them more difficult to counter.
Prior to the provision of the Javelins, Ukrainian forces were at a distinct disadvantage facing the tanks fielded by Russian-backed separatist forces in the country's eastern region.
In addition to Javelins, the Trump administration has sent sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and various other pieces of military equipment.
The United States provides around 90% of Ukraine's military aid and has committed more than $1.5 billion in help to Ukraine since 2014, when Russia invaded eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. The key difference in recent years has been lethal aid, which the Obama administration refused to provide — a decision that frustrated both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.
"We have an effective form of cooperation, but not with lethal weapons, with the United States, Canada, U.K.,” Ukraine's last president, Petro Poroshenko, told the New York Times in 2015. “We are very satisfied with the current level of cooperation but we would be happy if the level of this cooperation would be increased.”
The Obama administration did send defensive military aid, such as reconnaissance drones, communications equipment, night-vision goggles, body armor, medicine, ambulances, armored and unarmored Humvees. Obama also committed more than $200 million in 2016 to help Ukraine fight corruption and improve its energy security.
Many Democrats in the Obama years opposed the president's refusal to send lethal aid to Ukraine, including New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, and California Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who grilled Trump's acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire Thursday on a whistleblower complaint about Trump's telephone call.

Gail Collins: Rudy is the world’s worst best friend

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani is the Trump administration’s point man on Ukraine. Just remember that, and everything else will make a lot more sense.
“I think it’s incredible the way he’s done,” the president of the United States said Wednesday about his personal lawyer, who specializes in going on television and babbling incoherently.
We don’t know precisely what Giuliani’s diplomatic role is, given the fact that he’s not a government employee. His job seems mainly to be finding some proof that when Joe Biden was vice president, he was up to some shady Ukrainian business in order to help out his son, Hunter.
Rudy certainly has Donald Trump’s ear — and more clout than the beleaguered State Department. “Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man,” Trump told the president of Ukraine. “He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you.”
As mayor, Giuliani was most famous for his 9/11 performance, which was more impressive if you ignored the fact that he’d located the city’s emergency command at the World Trade Center, despite police warnings that the towers had previously been bombed by terrorists. In a way, he’s playing a similar role now — he’s assigned to deal with a crisis he’s helped create. How often did you worry about Ukraine before Rudy picked up the case?
Among other accomplishments, our person-without-portfolio managed to get rid of the respected U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Giuliani seems to believe she was in collusion with liberal megadonor George Soros in a plot to destroy Paul Manafort. Or something. Very hard to get inside the Rudy mind.
It’s a dark and winding territory. Remember that fabled appearance on CNN with Chris Cuomo?
“So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?”
“Of course I did!”
“You just said you didn’t!”
“No, I didn’t ask them to look into Joe Biden.”
People, if you had a pal who needed only two or three minutes of airtime to contradict himself, a pal who was deeply unphotogenic to the point of scary, a pal who had no formal relationship whatsoever to the federal government, would you encourage him to speak about foreign affairs on your behalf? A lot?
See, this is why Trump is president and you’re not.
The saga Giuliani is peddling is that when Joe Biden was vice president, he got a top Ukrainian prosecutor tossed out of office for investigating Hunter Biden’s business deals in that country. Actually, most of the Western world had loathed said prosecutor for his corruption. But Trump definitely likes Rudy’s story better.
Especially the part about Biden’s kid making large chunks of money from jobs he would never have gotten if his father had been, say, a high school principal in Ohio. We will pause here to recall that Eric and Donald Trump Jr. make their living by running around collecting millions in hotel business from Republican supporters. Rudy Giuliani’s son is serving as a public liaison assistant to the president. Moving forward.
During his unending march through TV interviews, Giuliani declared that Trump never threatened to withhold Ukrainian aid unless he was given the goods on Joe Biden. Then added that he couldn’t really “tell you if it’s 100%.” The president’s main confidant appeared to be saying there’s a chance — 10%? 30? 97? — that Trump actually did inform the head of a foreign government he wasn’t going to get the military funding Congress had authorized unless he came up with some dirt on a potential presidential opponent. Wow.
Rudy and Donald have a lot in common. They’ve both been married three times. Giuliani is now being sued for divorce by his latest spouse, who said he had turned into a “different man.” A presumably less reliable version than the one who, as mayor, held a news conference to announce he was breaking up with his then-wife without ever notifying the person in question.
Anyhow, current wife Judith Giuliani claimed that he had taken up with another woman and that she could testify to his failings as “a spouse and a nurse.” Some Rudy-watchers wondered if that was a reference to his drinking. All we know for sure is that this is a guy who must make Donald Trump feel as if he’s had an exceptionally righteous personal life.
There’s a lot Trump likes about his pal. Undoubtedly including the way he’ll yell “Shut up, moron!” at a fellow panelist — even on Fox News.
Trump forcefully defended Giuliani on Wednesday when he was meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a seemingly cheerful 41-year-old former TV star who very reasonably said he didn’t “want to be involved” in American politics. The two presidents seemed to get along very well. This was possibly because Zelenskiy has learned the importance at flattering Trump at every turn.
Or maybe it’s their joint show business background. Zelenskiy starred in a TV series about an idealistic teacher who winds up becoming — yes! — Ukrainian president. Our experiment with entertainers hasn’t been quite as successful. If only we’d elected, say, Homer Simpson instead. The First Pal would have been an underemployed barfly, and the whole world would have been much happier.

Robert Gehrke: House impeachment inquiry puts Utah’s Ben McAdams between a rock and a hard place

Texto completo: Given how willing the White House was to release the reconstruction of President Donald Trump’s controversial phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, I assumed it would be a dud.
Far from it.
What we got was the president asking a foreign leader to turn up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, right now the Democratic frontrunner for the 2020 nomination.
I suppose one could believe Trump is just really concerned about allegations of corruption anywhere in the world. Maybe he really thought Rudy Giuliani, his personal attorney, was better suited to represent American interests than the U.S. ambassador or State Department.
Perhaps it was pure coincidence that all this happened in the context of Trump withholding $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. It’s possible that suggesting Zelensky contact Attorney General William Barr about the probe was not at all political, but a gesture of goodwill.
But that is a lot to swallow, even for a zealous partisan like Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah. And yet most Republicans are swallowing it. Most.
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, reiterated Wednesday that the document released by the White House was “deeply troubling,” though he still didn’t go so far as to endorse an impeachment inquiry (which isn’t really the Senate’s job, anyway).
So far, 214 of 234 Democratic House members have voiced support for an impeachment process as of Wednesday evening, according to a New York Times tally.
All of this puts Utah Democratic House member Ben McAdams in an unenviable position, caught between competing political pressures.
If he doesn’t support the inquiry, he could face the wrath of activists in his own party, like the backlash that forced Rep. Jim Matheson into a primary with Claudia Wright in 2010.
If he jumps in on the side of the impeachment inquiry, he risks alienating some unaffiliated voters and moderate-leaning Republicans who always end up deciding the 4th District race.
His Republican opponents already seem to be predictably lining up against impeachment.
State Rep. Kim Coleman said that, even in a booming economy, all Democrats can do is “spin grandiose fairytale policies and hold impeachment pageants.”
Former radio host Jay McFarland said that what Trump did was wrong, but it was reviewed by the Department of Justice and was found to not violate campaign finance laws. In a partisan Washington, there is no hope of actually getting to the truth — Democrats in the House will impeach Trump and Republicans in the Senate will not vote to expel him. The proper course, he said, would be to let voters decide the issue next year.
Like Matheson in 2010, it would be easier for McAdams to overcome dissent in his own party, even if the Bernie Wing is more powerful than it was.
Raw political calculus says this would be the smart move for McAdams: Follow Romney’s lead and express furrowed-brow concern about the severity of the allegations, acknowledge the impeachment inquiry is underway and commit to following the facts where they lead.
It buys him a little breathing room without any real political risk, apart from having to weather some chirping on social media.
And that seems to be the direction McAdams is heading.
Wednesday evening, he voted with pretty much every member of the House — Republican and Democrat — to call for the release of the whistleblower complaint from the U.S. intelligence officer who sounded the alarm over the Ukraine dealings.
“The phone call summary released by the White House today suggests the president was improperly using his influence with a foreign power to damage a political opponent,” McAdams said in a statement. “On this and other matters we need to get all the facts on the table before deciding how to proceed.”
The problem with McAdams’ approach is that it misses the larger point. If Trump made military aid to Ukraine contingent on Zelensky digging up dirt on Biden, that is a bribe, which the Constitution explicitly says is grounds for impeachment, right after treason.
The Constitution also provides Congress with a path to investigate whether that occurred, and that is impeachment. Because, as I wrote back in June, impeachment is a process and the first step in that process is for the House to gather facts to determine if charges should be presented to the Senate.
A formal impeachment inquiry strengthens Congress’ hand in compelling the administration to comply with subpoenas. If the evidence doesn’t warrant charges, House members can vote that way when the time comes.
Voters, I think, are smart enough to understand that dynamic.
McAdams was right to reserve judgment until he saw the summary of Trump’s phone call with Zelensky. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, frankly, should have done the same. But now that ship has sailed. An impeachment inquiry is happening.
McAdams can (and probably will) try to keep straddling the fence. It’s safe. But soon — whether it’s after the testimony from the director of national intelligence Thursday, or the release of the whistleblower complaint he supported, or testimony from the intelligence official himself — he’s going to need to take a stand.
And if his mission is to really get to the bottom of what happened, the best way to do that is by supporting this impeachment inquiry. The sooner McAdams gets off the fence and on the right side of history, the better for his constituents.

Charles M. Blow: America begins the hard work of starting to defend and redeem itself

Texto completo: It is truly wondrous and arresting to see the Constitution in action, to see its ultimate tool — impeachment — employed, to see this mechanism that the drafters of the document must have considered an 11th-hour alternative be called up out of necessity.
It is not a thing to be celebrated. It is a thing to be soberly considered. It is a sign that the character and behavior of the target — in this case the president — are being searched for deficiency (in this case already demonstrated) and that the American electorate has been betrayed.
This is a funeral; it is not festive.
Still, it is awe-inspiring and reaffirming to see politicians put what is right above that which might be risky, to stand on principal in an area consumed by political expediency.
This step, whatever may flow from it, reinforced the public’s faith that the rich and powerful can, too, be subject to the law, that fairness and justice are still principles of primacy in this land.
Donald Trump has demonstrated on multiple fronts a contempt for his office and his oath, as well as the rule of law and the Constitution itself.
He has operated in a way that betrays an internal sensibility that he can and will live outside the rules and above the law. But, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put it, “No one is above the law.”
The inquiry Pelosi announced will seemingly not change, on a functional level, the investigation already underway in House committees. But on a constitutional and historical level it has supercharged the efforts to hold Trump accountable and move the effort to a higher plain.
As the Smithsonian magazine has pointed out about James Madison’s contributions to the debate over impeachment at the Constitutional Convention:
Madison argued that the Constitution needed a provision “for defending the community against the incapacity, negligence, or perfidy of the Chief Magistrate.” Waiting to vote him out of office in a general election wasn’t good enough. “He might pervert his administration into a scheme of peculation”— embezzlement — “or oppression,” Madison warned. “He might betray his trust to foreign powers.”
Madison’s concerns are so prescient it’s as if he’d had a premonition of Trump.
Even the inquiries now underway can only add to articles of impeachment. What we already know, what we have seen in plain sight and what Trump has openly admitted already form the basis for impeachment.
And this last incident, the president’s attempts to coerce the president of Ukraine to provide investigative help to damage a potential political opponent — Joe Biden — is so clear and brazen that Congress has no choice but to move for impeachment.
Trump was acting as if he were invincible; Congress has to remind him and the world that invincibility is not a principle that the law recognizes in this country. The president holds the highest political position, but the law holds the highest philosophical position.
And not only must the president be held accountable, but all of those around him, in the government and not, must also be held accountable for aiding and abetting any corruption and lawlessness.
Some people, including me, had come to worry that Trump might make a mockery of America’s ideals, that he would be allowed to get away with his abuses because of congressional timidity and hand wringing.
Some of that worry has now been relieved.
There is no way to know what we will come to know during this inquiry. There is no way to know whether the House will draw up articles of impeachment and vote to impeach (although I strongly believe that it is now almost irreversibly on that path). There is no way to know whether Mitch McConnell would even call a trial in the Senate, and if so, whether the Senate would convict and remove Trump (highly unlikely).
But I still contend that a vote for impeachment in the House alone is a historic chastisement, a scarlet letter that marks a presidency in memoriam.
If Donald Trump doesn’t deserve to be impeached, then no president before and henceforth deserved or will deserve to be impeached.
This is a moment when the true character of this country and its leaders is being challenged, and in the result of how this plays out, that character will be laid bare.
I choose to see the beginning of this process as the country’s finally taking the first steps out of the darkness and toward the light.
By seeking to hold Trump accountable, America begins the hard work of starting to defend and redeem itself.

Texto completo: Every good story needs a hero, and the saga of Brett Kavanaugh’s rise to the Supreme Court has provided one: Leland Keyser.
She also became a victim when her longtime friend, Christine Blasey Ford, decided to hit refresh on a decades-old high school incident that apparently only Ford remembers.
Keyser is the other female student whom Ford named as having been at the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly pinned her down on a bed and groped her. She is also the friend who swore under penalty of perjury that she doesn’t recall such a party or, in fact, ever having met Kavanaugh. Her comments echoed those of the other partygoers Ford named, none of whom remembered such a gathering.
This isn’t what places Keyser on the heroes’ roster. What earns her that distinction is her steadfastness, at great personal suffering, in refusing to change her story despite what she describes as pressure to she rethink her initial statement. According to a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" by New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, some of Keyser’s erstwhile friends and acquaintances tried to persuade her to say she didn’t remember the party, not that it didn’t happen.
Keyser, reportedly a registered Democrat, has become increasingly convinced that Ford’s story isn’t true and doesn’t make sense, according to the book.
According to the book, Ford’s team of friends and advisers apparently saw Keyser as an obstacle to Ford’s narrative and brainstormed ways for her to get onboard. The book cites a group text among Ford’s acquaintances from soon after her testimony. Cheryl Amitay, who attended the same girls’ high school as Ford, wrote: "Maybe one of you guys who are friends with [Keyser] can have a heart-to-heart."
A man who had gone to a neighboring boys’ school chimed in: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is." To which Amitay responded, "Leland is a major stumbling block."
Keyser, a former professional golfer who has undergone numerous operations on her back and neck, has suffered addiction during her adult life. Although recovering, she told Kelly and Pogrebin she was concerned that this history would be used against her if she didn’t come up with a more-acceptable recollection of events. When pressed, however, she refused to take the easy route and protect herself.
For her integrity and valor under perceived pressure, she has been punished. Even Ford seemed to turn on her old friend, mentioning Keyser’s "significant health challenges," during her testimony, and seeming to suggest that her friend might have diminished capacities: "I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs."
This may have been one of the sweetest condemnations in the history of tossing inconvenient friends under the bus. But, importantly, Ford planted a seed of doubt about Keyser’s credibility, which has been cultivated by the Times writers. On CNN’s "Reliable Sources" Sunday, Kelly pointed to Keyser’s "memory issues ... because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges."
Oof. What a gut punch. If no one in recovery can ever be trusted again, then the world of rehabilitative addiction therapy may as well shutter its doors.
In fact, Keyser remembers very well the summer of 1982, when Ford believes the alleged incident occurred. It was the year after her grandmother introduced her to golf and Keyser became consumed with the sport, according to another book published this past summer, "Justice on Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Keyser worked full-time in the golf pro shop at a Washington-area country club and had little time for socializing. Her hard work at school and in sports paid off with stellar grades, seven varsity letters, and acceptance to the University of Virginia, followed by a professional golfing career and a coaching position at Georgetown University.
Today, Keyser keeps a low profile, as was always her preference. She is, indeed, in fragile health from her injuries and surgeries. But Keyser can stand tall for having remained true to her convictions despite being exposed and pressured by those who seemed to have used her struggles against her. In my book, that’s heroic.

Texto completo: Joshua Jack of Auckland, New Zealand, received an email from his bosses at an ad agency informing him that he was expected at a "redundancy meeting" to discuss his future at the company. Kindly, the New Zealand Herald reported, they suggested he was welcome to bring along a support person, such as a friend or family member. "Sensing the bad news, I decided I'd need the best support person available," Jack wrote on Facebook, "so I spent $200 ($127 U.S.) to hire a clown." As the co-workers discussed Jack's exit, the clown blew up balloons and folded them into animals. He mimed crying when Jack was handed his final paperwork. Jack said his bosses found the humor in the situation, and he has already landed another job.

It's springtime in Australia, which means if you're headed outside down under, you'll want to carry a big stick with you. September and October are the height of magpie swooping season, when nesting magpies are known to attack walkers, runners and bike riders in defense of their young. While they're only 12 inches long or so, 7News reported, the black-and-white birds can cause a lot of pain with their sharp beaks. Last year, a toddler was nearly blinded, and this year a man who was attacked as he rode his bike veered off the path and crashed, later dying of head injuries. "They're never trying to hurt anyone or be malicious," ornithologist Gisela Kaplan said. "It's all about risk assessment."
The Dog Did It
Thomas Barnes, 58, got an unpleasant surprise in his bill from DirectTV in August after his dog, Marino, jumped up on Barnes' bed and pressed a remote button that mistakenly ordered pay-per-view from the Hustler channel. Barnes called his service provider, and he was assured that charges would be removed. But the content remained, so after making a second call and getting no satisfaction, Barnes paid his next bill -- minus $70. Then his service was canceled altogether. Barnes complained to the Federal Communications Commission, which prompted a call from DirectTV, promising a credit on his next bill. "There's a problem when there's a mistake and you expect me to pay for the mistake," Barnes told the Raleigh News and Observer.
There's a Rule for Everything
Followers of Emily Post who are floundering with the rules for making toast ... er, getting toasted will want to pick up the new book from her great-great-granddaughter, Lizzie Post. According to The New York Times, "Higher Etiquette: A Guide to the World of Cannabis, From Dispensaries to Dinner Parties" offers tidbits of advice for a variety of situations, to wit: Don't eat all the munchies. Avoid words like "pothead" and "weed," which can have negative connotations. Tip your "budtender" well, as he or she probably makes minimum wage. "Etiquette," Post reminds us, "can be so easy."
Awesome!
Gerry Moore's goal with his latest project is "making people smile," and it's working. The Pensacola, Florida, man built a "boat car," a hybrid vehicle that looks like a boat on top but motors along the street on the chassis of a Ford Expedition. WEAR TV reported that the vehicle is a "permanent convertible," but Moore keeps a scuba mask and snorkel on board in case they get caught in the rain.

Texto completo: The final of three September art song recitals in honor of the centennial of the Korean American composer Earl Kim takes place Sunday, Sept. 29 at the Zoellner Arts Center in Bethlehem.
Featured soloist is the renowned Icelandic soprano Dísella Làrusdóttir, described by The New York Times as "reliably breathtaking," and by Opera News as having a voice of "bewitching beauty and presence."
Làrusdóttir will be joined by pianist Steven Beck and special guest violinist Michael Jorgensen, music faculty member at Lehigh University. Presented by the Lehigh University Very Modern Ensemble (LUVME), the program features settings by Lehigh music professor and composer Paul Salerni on poems by Irish poet Seamus Heany, along with music from Iceland, Germany, and other Northern climes.
If you want to get a flavor of Làrusdóttir's vocal prowess, not to mention her mesmerizing physical delivery, run her name through Google and check out her YouTube clip of her singing Bernstein's "Glitter and be Gay" in 2016. Want more? Watch the clip in which she sings a glitzy tango by Sveinn Runar Sigurdsson in the Icelandic semifinals of the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest.
Làrusdóttir is a relatively late starter as a classical vocalist, initially concentrating on buoyant European pop. But following her critically acclaimed performance in the Metropolitan Opera's 2007 National Council Auditions, Lárusdóttir began an important relationship with the opera world. In the Met's 2015-2016 season, she covered the title role of William Kentridge's new production of Berg's "Lulu," and made her European debut in the same production at Teatro dell'Opera di Roma in May 2017.
Equally in demand on the concert platform, Lárusdóttir gave her New York City recital debut at Merkin Concert Hall in 2008, where she was praised by The New York Times for "deploying her high, bright, and clear voice with a striking ease and consistency" and her "almost startling dramatic power." She has also performed in Philadelphia's Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, Stern Auditorium in Carnegie Hall in New York City, and Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, among others. Last season, Lárusdóttir participated in two productions at the Metropolitan Opera: Nico Muhly's new opera, "Marnie," as well as Mozart's "La Clemenza di Tito."
Although entitled "From Northern Climes," Sunday's program will definitely warm the heart - and yes, "Glitter and be Gay" is on the program. In addition to Danish and Norwegian songs by Grieg, and German lieder by Schubert, Schumann, and Strauss, there will be a trio of Icelandic songs, and a suite of five Irish songs Salerni set to the poems of Heany.
That cycle of five poems, "Arrivals," was first heard in public at a Memorial Tribute to Heaney at Emory University in 2014. '
"I first encountered the poetry of Seamus Heaney in the fall of 1977 in a four-person room in a pensione in Florence, Italy," Salerni says. "One of my roommates had studied with Heaney and introduced me to a poem of his called 'Rite of Spring.' I believe I wrote a preliminary setting of that poem during that fellowship year in Italy. It occurred to me to give that first-encounter Heaney poem another shot, this time scored for soprano, violin, and piano. That turned out well enough for me to search for other poems, poems that shared the sense of arrival that one gets from 'Rite of Spring.'"
Lehigh University Very Modern Ensemble, 3 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 29, Baker Hall, Zoellner Arts Center, Bethlehem. Tickets: $10. 610-758-2787, www.zoellnerartscenter.org
Allentown Band at St. John's Church
On Sunday, Sept. 29, the Allentown Band returns to St. John's Lutheran Church in Allentown for a high-spirited program of music for soprano, trumpet and organ. Featured is a trio of star soloists, who include mezzo-soprano Patricia Risley, trumpeter James Vaughen, and St. John's organist Eric Gombert in this opening concert of the Arts at St. John's fall series.
Vaughen attends the Curtis Institute of Music, where he is a student of David Bilger, Principal Trumpet of the Philadelphia Orchestra. He's performed as co-principal trumpet of the Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Youth Symphony Encore Chamber Orchestra, and the National Youth Orchestra. He has soloed with the East Central Illinois Youth Orchestra, the Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra, and the University of Illinois Sinfonia da Camera. In 2015, Vaughen was featured on NPR's nationally broadcast "From the Top" radio program, and in 2017 was chosen as a National Young Arts Winner in Classical Music.
Met Opera mezzo-soprano Patricia Risley, an Allentown native and Parkland High School graduate, is much beloved by local audiences, and a frequent performer with the band. She's sung at some of the most prestigious opera houses in the world, including Opera de Monte-Carlo, Innsbruck Opera, The Metropolitan Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Houston Grand Opera, New York City Opera, Dallas Opera, Los Angeles Opera, Santa Fe Opera, and Opera Philadelphia.
Noted for her performances on the concert stage, she has also joined The New York Philharmonic, Ravinia Festival in Chicago, Israeli Philharmonic, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Boston Baroque, Grant Park Music Festival, Carnegie Hall, Oregon Symphony, and Radio Filharmonisch Orkest at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.
Gombert, a Lehigh Valley native, joined St. John's as organist and director of music in 2017. He holds a degree in music from Westminster Choir College, and is a member of the American Guild of Organists and the Association of Lutheran Church Musicians. In addition to working at St. John's, Gombert is director of the Brittany Pointe Songsters, and teaches piano and organ.
We'll hear Vaughen solo in Hayden's Trumpet Concerto in E-Flat major. Risley will reveal her operatic side in arias from Franz Lehar's "The Merry Widow" and "O mio babbino caro" from Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi," then switch to pop for a stunning Barbra Streisand medley. "Singularly Streisand" will include "People," "Memories," "Don't Rain on My Parade," and "There's a Place for Us."
Gombert will rattle the rafters with everyone's favorite organ piece, J.S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, in addition to the Manx tone poem "Mannin Veen" (Dear Isle of Man) by Haydn Wood. Originally published in 1933, this dramatic piece, based on four folk songs from the Isle of Man, begins with a plaintive melody in the Dorian mode, then goes into a very lyrical "fiddle tune," and finally a solemn hymn.
Allentown Band, 3 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 29, St. John's Lutheran Church, 37 S 5th St, Allentown. Admission: free will offering. 610-435-1587, www.stjohnsallentown.org
PA Sinfonia opens its fall season with music by Mozart and Bach
The Pennsylvania Sinfonia begins its 2019-2020 season with works by Mozart and Bach at Christ Lutheran Church in Allentown. Mozart's Symphony No. 17 in G Major and Violin Concerto No. 4 in D Major will be paired with J.S. Bach's Solo Cantata 82, "Ich habe genug (I Have Enough)."
Featured soloists are violinist Rebecca Brown and bass baritone Anthony Sharp.
Brown performs regularly with the Sinfonia, in addition to the chamber ensemble SATORI, the Bach Festival Orchestra, and the Allentown Symphony. She is a frequent soloist with the Valley Vivaldi summer concert series and a regular performer on the Lehigh Valley's chamber music and orchestral stages.
The program marks the Sinfonia debut of bass baritone Sharp. An Allentown native, he was frequently heard as a soloist when an undergrad at Temple University's Boyer College of Music and Dance. Since graduating, he has joined the rosters of the Philadelphia Symphonic Choir and the Opera Philadelphia Chorus. Sharp sings in the Chancel Choir and serves as pastoral assistant at First Presbyterian Church in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Bach's Solo Cantata 82 for bass voice was first performed in Leipzig in 1727 for the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is one of five cantatas written for this now little-known feast day. Curiously, the anonymous text does not derive from a biblical source. The cantata contains three arias, all of which are cast in the operatic da capo form. The first is notable for its elaborate oboe obbligato, the second is a profound lullaby, and the third is reminiscent of an operatic triumph aria.
Mozart's five violin concertos were all products of a single year, 1775, when the composer was 19 years old. The last three of these are his earliest pieces now regularly heard in the concert hall. Opening with a mock-military fanfare, it moves into a moonlight-tender second movement that would not be out of place in an operatic love scene, and ends with a dance-like and outgoing finale.
Pennsylvania Sinfonia Orchestra, 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 28, Christ Lutheran Church, 1245 W. Hamilton St., Allentown. Tickets: $35, $25 adults; $30, $20 seniors over 62; free for students through college age. 610-434-7811, www.pasinfonia.org

Texto completo: Readers discuss how impeachment might play out, Boris Johnson's comeuppance, Hunter Biden and more.
This was originally published on Tuesday night and has been updated with new letters.
To the Editor:
Re "Pelosi Will Open Formal Impeachment Inquiry, Accusing President of 'Betrayal' of the Nation" (front page, Sept. 25):
For everyone calling for impeachment, I have a question: Do you want to remove President Trump from office? Yes? Let's recap three things we know:
1) Impeachment by the House does not remove a president. (Just ask Bill Clinton.) Only the Senate can do that, by convicting the president. The Senate can also acquit.
2) Policy is Mr. Trump's kryptonite. He cannot win an election on policy. When it comes to giving Americans a better life -- health care, education, working conditions and so on -- most Americans think Democrats do better. The only way Mr. Trump wins is by distracting people from policy.
3) Impeachment talk smothers policy talk. When impeachment is the talk of the town, no one hears Democrats' plans for health care, education or anything else. That's how Mr. Trump wins in 2020.
Imagine the Republicans after the Senate acquits Mr. Trump of all charges.
Cynthia Barr
Boston
To the Editor:
Better late than never, Nancy Pelosi! While I don't expect most Senate Republicans to do what's right, perhaps several will see enough indisputable evidence to side with the Democrats. Also, politics being what it is, if some Senate Republicans believe that abandoning the president will help their political careers ...
In addition, perceived exoneration by the Senate will be dismissed by those who are not willing to ignore what President Trump has done, so I see no risk in proceeding.
Finally, if the president manages to stay in office for his full term, Democratic and independent voters who believe that no one is above the law will turn out in droves next November and will vote accordingly.
Andrew Goldstein
Philadelphia
To the Editor:
You state that "Mr. Trump could become only the fourth president in American history to face impeachment." "Only"? Forty-four men have been president. That one out of 11 of them have been deemed sufficiently incompetent or criminal to generate procedural efforts for their removal illustrates that our electoral system has been seriously deficient in preventing people with serious flaws from attaining the most powerful job on earth. If one out of 11 airline pilots were routinely drunk on the job, would you use the word "only"?
David English
Acton, Mass.
To the Editor:
The election of Donald Trump as president created a crisis for Democrats and liberals and their allies in the news media. Now Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced a formal impeachment inquiry. This inquiry, of course, follows the anticlimactic investigation by Robert Mueller of alleged but unproven collusion between Russians and the 2016 Trump campaign.
Voters outside the liberal echo chamber of Manhattan and Washington are not amused and will punish the Democrats in 2020. The news media, starting with The New York Times, will again mistake the mood of the country, and Mr. Trump will be easily re-elected, a severe rebuke to the arrogance of the liberal elite who cannot and will not accept reality.
Dennis L. Breo
New Smyrna Beach, Fla.
To the Editor:
Re "Judiciary Intervention Into Political Dispute Remakes British Law" (news article, Sept. 25):
On Tuesday, before Nancy Pelosi's announcement of the impeachment investigation, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom put into focus how a normal operating democracy deals with unlawful conduct by curtailing Boris Johnson's abrogation of democratic norms in his suspension of Parliament. What was incredible was the speed with which the top court in England rightly acted as the guardian of the public's interest and corrected his blatant self-interest.
By contrast, what we have witnessed in the United States is the slowest and most cumbersome process, by the self-professed greatest democracy in the world.
Paul M. Fay
Kingston, Ontario
To the Editor:
Now that the House of Representatives has opened a formal impeachment inquiry, perhaps President Trump would like to consider proroguing Congress -- or whatever the American equivalent of suspending Parliament would be.
David P. Barash
Redmond, Wash.
To the Editor:
Deflecting attention from wrongdoing by accusing political opponents of the very same acts is a classic Trumpian tactic. The accusation that Joe Biden's son corruptly used his father's office to enrich himself is a masterful example of the genre: It creates the impression that complaining about President Trump's corrupt, family-enriching collaboration with his own children holds him to an unfair double standard.
As a committed Democrat, I do not, however, think we should react by reflexively circling the wagons to defend the Bidens. How could his father's name and power not have bought Hunter Biden access?
Let's put it to the Republicans: Washington should not work this way under either party. You stop defending Mr. Trump, and we'll not nominate Mr. Biden. We have several other very fine candidates without such baggage we can enthusiastically put forward in 2020.

To the Editor:
What if President Trump wants an impeachment threat so he has an excuse to resign and receive a full pardon from Vice President Mike Pence? A neat deal for both: Mr. Trump is then immunized from federal prosecution, and Mr. Pence gets his desired position.

To the Editor:
Re "Beware of Impeaching Trump" (Op-Ed, Sept. 25):
John Yoo seems to believe that the presidency was embodied with so much power by the framers that the president can engage in criminality with impunity, no matter what his actions. Not so. Congress retains oversight as proxies for the citizens, who otherwise lack the means to check an out-of-control executive, as we see now with President Trump. The president cannot act outside the law even with his vested powers.
The larger question is why oh why the august New York Times has given over its influential forum for the free debate of ideas to a man as disgraced as John Yoo, who famously wrote the deeply flawed and since reviled justification for torture during the dark times of the George W. Bush administration. Shame on you.

Texto completo: FRANKFURT -- Aivar Rehe was once one of Estonia's most prominent bankers, the chief executive of Danske Bank's unit in Tallinn and an integral part of the former Soviet state's transition to a free-market economy.
But when investigators revealed last year that customers from Russia and Eastern Europe had used the Danske subsidiary to launder billions of dollars in dirty money, Mr. Rehe inevitably shared the blame. The money laundering, from 2007 to 2015, took place on his watch.
On Wednesday, Mr. Rehe was found dead, an apparent suicide, in his backyard in Tallinn, the Estonian police said.
Mr. Rehe, 56, had been the focus of an intensive search since Monday when his family reported him missing from his home.
Mr. Rehe's death is another twist in the money-laundering scandal, which prompted a criminal investigation and forced Danske Bank, Denmark's largest lender, to withdraw from Estonia and other Baltic countries.
The police said there was no sign of foul play, and prosecutors said Mr. Rehe was not a suspect in their criminal investigation of the money laundering. Still, his death focused renewed attention on money-laundering allegations that have tainted the previously upright image of Scandinavian banking; led to official investigations in Sweden, Germany and the United States; and even threatened the economies of the Baltic countries.
The scope of the investigations widened Wednesday when prosecutors in Frankfurt confirmed that they were investigating Deutsche Bank's role as an intermediary that helped Danske Bank process transactions in United States dollars for suspect customers. The New York Times has reported that Danske Bank was part of a federal investigation of whether Deutsche Bank complied with laws meant to stop money laundering and other crimes.
A team of about a dozen investigators visited Deutsche Bank headquarters in Frankfurt on Wednesday and collected documents. "Deutsche Bank has comprehensively examined the facts of the matter and has voluntarily provided the requested documents as far as possible," the bank said in a statement. "The bank will continue to cooperate with the prosecutor."
The action in Frankfurt was not on the same scale as prominent raids in the past when the police arrived in dozens of vehicles unannounced and seized boxes full of documents. But it was a reminder that Deutsche Bank remained under close scrutiny for alleged lapses of the past, even as it tries to address chronically poor profits.
In Tallinn, as many as 50 police officers and volunteers had searched for Mr. Rehe before his body was found Wednesday morning, the authorities said. He had left his home without his cellphone or wallet, and the police considered him a suicide risk. Mr. Rehe's family had previously searched the area where he was found, said Marianne Ubaleht, senior press officer for the Estonian Police and Border Guard.
The police are not investigating Mr. Rehe's death further, according to a police statement. Ms. Ubaleht would not comment on how Mr. Rehe had died. The police were still investigating what he had done and where he had gone between Monday and Wednesday, she said.
Mr. Rehe was not considered a suspect in the criminal investigation, a spokeswoman for Estonian prosecutors said. However, he supervised the bank from 2006 to 2015, and from 2007 to 2015 there were "major deficiencies in controls and governance that made it possible to use Danske Bank's branch in Estonia for criminal activities such as money laundering," the bank said in a 2017 statement.
Previously, Mr. Rehe was director general of Estonia's Tax and Customs Board, according to the Postimees newspaper in Tallinn. He later worked for another Estonian lender, Bigbank, but had left in November, Postimees said.
He told the newspaper in an interview in March that he believed Danske Bank's money-laundering controls had been adequate.
Swedish banks, once considered to be some of the best managed in Europe, have since been swept up in the scandal. In April, the two highest-ranking executives of Swedbank resigned under pressure after Swedish television reported that the bank was under investigation by the New York State Department of Financial Services.
The New York regulators had questioned Swedbank's New York subsidiary about transactions involving Ukrainian politicians accused of corruption, Russian businessmen, offshore companies, and banks in Ukraine, Cyprus and other countries that have been considered money-laundering hubs.
Swedish regulators have disclosed that they are also investigating how SEB, another major Swedish bank, manages money-laundering risks in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. An SEB spokesman said the bank was being scrutinized because it had extensive operations in the Baltics, not because there were any specific allegations of wrongdoing.
Faced with intense regulatory scrutiny, many European and American banks have decided that Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are too risky and have cut ties. That is a problem for the Baltic economies, potentially raising the cost of credit and making it more difficult for local banks to conduct transactions in dollars.
Typically, the smaller local banks need a partner with international reach, a so-called correspondent bank, to handle dollar transactions. Correspondent banks that worked with Danske Bank's Estonian branch began raising questions about suspicious transactions as early as 2010, the bank's internal investigation said, but managers failed to take effective action.
At least one correspondent bank, which is not named in the report, stopped doing business with Danske in Estonia in 2013 because of concern about money laundering. Deutsche Bank did not terminate its relationship with Danske until 2015.

Texto completo: President Trump responded to an impassioned plea to global leaders at the United Nations by 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg with a sarcastic late-night tweet.
"She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!" Trump said on Twitter shortly after 11:30 p.m. on Monday.
He attached a news account of Thunberg's remarks to the gathering in New York earlier in the day that highlighted a deeply pessimistic quote: "People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth."
Appearing on a panel at the UN climate summit, Thunberg chastised leaders for praising young activists like herself while failing to deliver on drastic actions needed to avert the worst effects of climate change, and she warned that if the world continued with business as usual, her generation would face an insurmountable catastrophe.
"This is all wrong," said Thunberg who, with tears in her eyes and her face flushed, was visibly emotional as she spoke.
Cameras caught Thunberg giving Trump an icy stare as he arrived at the UN gathering earlier in the day.
Trump, who in the past has called climate change a "hoax," gave scant attention to the issue that dominated the day on Monday.
After scheduling one of his administration's marquee events — a forum on religious freedom — during the UN climate summit on Monday, he dropped by the climate event for 14 minutes in a surprise visit. He did not speak and left after listening to remarks from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Angela Merkel, the outgoing German chancellor.
Meanwhile, Fox News has apologized for a guest's "disgraceful" description of Thunberg as mentally ill but was silent Tuesday on Laura Ingraham likening her to a murderous cult of children from a Stephen King story.
The network responded swiftly to a news segment Monday where Michael Knowles of "The Daily Wire" said the 16-year-old environmentalist was a "mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left."
Thunberg has been open about being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, embracing it as her "superpower."
Knowles was immediately called out by a fellow guest, podcast host Chris Hahn, who said, "You're a grown man and you've attacked a child. Shame on you."
Hahn called on Knowles to immediately apologize. He didn't and won't get a chance again on Fox. The network later apologized to Thunberg and viewers for the comment and said it had no plans to book Knowles, who has no tie to the network, again.
A couple hours later Ingraham, one of the network's prime-time stars, said she found some of Thunberg's remarks before the United Nations that scolded officials for not acting on climate change to be chilling. She juxtaposed a portion of the speech with a clip from the 1984 horror film "Children of the Corn." Based on a King story, the film is about children in a Nebraska town being persuaded to kill the adults.
"I can't wait for Stephen King's sequel, 'Children of the Climate,' " Ingraham said.
Fox said it had no comment on Ingraham's segment.

Times says it asked Ireland to rescue reporter
NEW YORK — The New York Times said it turned to the Irish government to rescue a reporter threatened with arrest in Egypt two years ago out of concern that the Trump administration wouldn't help.
Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger revealed the incident during a speech at Brown University and in an op-ed published Tuesday. He criticized President Trump for seeding a "worldwide assault on journalists and journalism" and said it's time for the United States to again champion the rights of a free press.
There was no immediate response from the White House.
In August 2017, the Times was contacted by a US government official who warned that Declan Walsh, a reporter based in Egypt, was going to be arrested, Sulzberger said. The Times magazine had just published Walsh's story about Giulio Regini, an Italian student found dead in Cairo and the subject of a dispute between Italy and Egypt about whether the Egyptian government was involved.
The US official who contacted the Times operated on the belief that the Trump administration would sit on the information and not help the reporter, Sulzberger said. The official feared being punished for alerting the Times.
Walsh, who is an Irish citizen, tweeted that he called the US government press office in Cairo upon getting the warning and was directed to the Irish embassy. Within an hour, an Irish diplomat drove him to the airport and Walsh left for Europe. He has since returned to work in Egypt.
"I owe a belated thanks to [an] Irish diplomat who rushed to help in a tight spot," Walsh said. "He was cool, swift and fearless." He said he was also grateful to the Washington tipster.
Sulzberger said that 18 months later, Times reporter David Kirkpatrick was detained and deported in apparent retaliation for reporting information that embarrassed the Egyptian government.
When the Times protested, an official at the US embassy said, "What did you expect would happen to him? His reporting made the government look bad."
For years, when sending reporters into dangerous situations, the Times always felt that the US government, "the world's greatest champion of the free press," would have its back, the publisher said.
Now, the paper sees how Trump's favorite descriptor of stories he doesn't like, "fake news," has spread to governments beyond the United States, he said.

Comey: Trump shouldn't be impeached because the 'American people would be let off the hook'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Former FBI director James Comey said in an interview published Tuesday that he hopes President Donald Trump is not impeached because it means American voters would be “let off the hook. ”
However a day after the interview was released, Comey seemingly suggested that he is open to an impeachment inquiry.
"Some media are quoting me from last week about my hope that America will remove Donald Trump by an election, not Impeachment," he wrote on Twitter Wednesday. "But we may now be at the point where members of the House and Senate can’t uphold their own oaths to support and defend the Constitution without acting. "
Comey was fired by the Trump in 2017 and has since been a staunch critic of the president, but reiterated his view that removing Trump from office before his tenure is completed is the wrong move.
When asked about impeaching Trump Tuesday, Comey answered that “as a citizen, I hope not because I think the American people would be let off the hook. "
“A lot of his supporters would think some kind of coup had taken place," Comey said during the interview with California radio station KCRA. "We need to take responsibility for this and vote next November, and show we have a certain set of values and we insist that our leaders reflect those values. "
He reiterated he found Trump’s conduct detailed in the Mueller report “deeply concerning” and that he acknowledges that impeachment is ultimately up to Congress.
“We need an inflection point. An impeachment would deprive us of that. We need to show what we stand for,” he continued.
His comments come as House Democrats mull launching impeachment proceedings against Trump after several days of news related to a call the president had with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
On Wednesday, the White House released a memo of the call that showed Trump repeatedly pressed Zelenskiy to re-open an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company to focus on any involvement by then-vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Comey's tweet came several hours after the White House released the five-page memo.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced Trump's reported conduct, and she hinted that it could push her over the edge to support impeachment.
"I've said to people, 'As soon as we have the facts, we're ready. ' Now we have the facts. We're ready . . . for later today," Pelosi said at the Atlantic's Ideas Summit on Tuesday. She's scheduled to speak at 5 p. m. this evening.
Additionally, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , tweeted Tuesday that the whistleblower behind the report would “like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so. We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week. ”
Comey has made similar comments in the past and also wrote in a New York Times op-ed that his “one hope” was that the President not be impeached before the end of his term, wanting critics of Trump to focus on getting him out of office through the democratic process in 2020.
Comey has also said in the past that he believes Trump would have been charged with obstruction of justice if he was not a sitting president, based on the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe report.
At the United Nations in New York, Trump was asked about reports that Pelosi will announce the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday evening.
“If she does that, they all say that’s a positive for me in the election,” the president said.

Biden campaign to media: Focus on 'dishonest' Trump, not Hunter Biden

Texto completo: Joe Biden's campaign team on Monday accused President Trump and his allies of peddling “roundly debunked conspiracy theory” about the former vice president and his son's dealings in the Ukraine.
The campaign also called on the media to focus on whether Trump abused his authority by allegedly pressuring a foreign leader to dig up dirt on the former vice president and his son.
Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said some in the media “have allowed the most dishonest president in American history to function as their assignment editor" in the aftermath of reports that Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate the former vice president's son Hunter Biden.
“Quality reporting on this issue has made it increasingly clear that Trump did indeed attempt to bully a U. S. ally into disingenuously investigating the potential Democratic nominee he fears most,” Bates said in an email to reporters. “The second narrative that needs to be pointed out is that, unfortunately, not all coverage of this episode has responsibly highlighted the relevant facts that have been widely reported for months. ”
The Biden campaign raised its concerns as Trump insisted on Monday that he “put no pressure on them whatsoever” to investigate Hunter Biden. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky eight times in that call to investigate the younger Biden. Trump has acknowledged that he brought up Biden in the July phone conversation with the newly-elected Zelensky that Trump says served as a mostly congratulatory call.
Trump told reporters Monday while at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that “what Biden did was wrong” and suggested that he might eventually release a transcript of the call — something that the former vice president and Democratic lawmakers are demanding.
Trump said a transcript would show that he did nothing wrong, but he also said he is concerned about the precedent of releasing details of a call with a foreign leader.
Trump on alleged Ukraine pressure: 'I didn't do it. ' Trump denies he threatened to hold back Ukraine's foreign aid over Biden
Ukraine scandal explained: What's going on with Trump and Ukraine? And how does it involve Biden and a whistleblower complaint?
The back-and-forth comes as scrutiny of Trump’s actions during the call is mounting amid renewed calls among House Democrats to impeach Trump.
The issue came to a head after a multiple news reports about a whistleblower complaint brought by a member of the intelligence community raised concerns about Trump’s comments to a foreign leader. The whistleblower complaint remains secret, and Democrats and the Trump administration are in a standoff over demands that the report be turned over to Congress.
Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani for months have pushed uncorroborated claims that Biden as vice president sought the 2016 ouster of Ukraine’s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to stop an investigation into Burisma Group, a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board of directors.
Giuliani alleged in an interview on Fox News Sunday that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin, because “Biden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter and he went over there and got [Shokin] fired. ”
The push by the former vice president, however, came alongside calls for Ukraine to get rid of Shokin from both European diplomats and the U. S State Department, because international leaders felt Shokin was doing too little to fight corruption in the Eastern European country.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while still serving as vice president , threatened to withhold $1 billion in U. S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind Burisma.
Shokin was accused by U. S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out.
But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
The Biden campaign says that Trump his allies are trying to muddy the waters about the former vice president's actions in Ukraine because they see Biden as the most potent potential 2020 Democratic rival.
“The president and his lackeys are so terrified of that prospect — and have abandoned any pretense of having an iota of truth on their side as they flail and try to distract from what may be the greatest presidential malfeasance since Watergate — that they fell all over themselves lying on the Sunday shows,” Biden’s deputy campaign manager Kate Beddingfield said in a memo to interested parties that was titled “Correcting the Record on Rudy Giuliani's Lies. ”
Biden told reporters while campaigning in Iowa on Saturday that he has never spoken to Hunter Biden about his overseas business dealings, but the younger Biden told the New Yorker magazine in an article published in July that two had one brief exchange about Burisma around December 2015.
Around the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue of Hunter's work with Burisma with the Vice President, according to the article.
“‘Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you’re doing,” and I said, ‘I do,’ ” the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article.

Texto completo: Just as the aftershocks of the special counsel's Russia investigation seemed to have settled, the latest tremblor out of the Oval Office is whether the president used the levers of his foreign policy toward Ukraine for political gain.
A confidential whistleblower report might provide an answer. But once again, the nation's democratic processes are falling short of providing Americans what they need to decide whether Donald Trump did something wrong.
Short of someone violating the law by leaking that whistleblower complaint, or the whistleblower risking retaliation by bravely going to Congress, there's no quick or certain process for the public to learn its contents.
There is, however, a steady drip of news media reports, and a few admissions by Trump himself on Sunday.
According to The Washington Post and The New York Times, a whistleblower complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general focused on a promise Trump made during a phone call on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
During that conversation, Trump asked the Kiev leader to investigate a key political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter, regarding the younger Biden's past business dealings in Ukraine.
Still unclear is whether there's any connection between Trump's desire for dirt on the Bidens and $250 million in U.S. military aid for Ukraine, which is engaged in a five-year conflict with pro-Russian separatists. The aid was inexplicably delayed, then released a day after Congress raised concerns about the whistleblower complaint.
Was a meeting with Zelensky or the promise of Ukrainian assistance somehow, by inference or otherwise, made contingent on Kiev investigating Biden? If true, that would be a gross abuse of presidential power.
Trump acknowledged Sunday that he spoke with Zelensky about Biden, defending the conversation as appropriate and "perfect." If that's the case, why not make everything public?
The intelligence community's inspector general, Trump appointee Michael Atkinson, was so troubled by the whistleblower's report that he deemed it of "urgent concern."
The law requires that an urgent-concern whistleblower complaint "shall" be turned over to Congress. But the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, blocked this on the grounds that the alleged target of the complaint — presumably Trump himself — is not a member of the intelligence community.
A system of checks and balances guaranteed by the Constitution should inform the American people when their president violates the law or commits an impeachable offense. That system is being stretched to the breaking point.
Now it's up to members of Congress — not just Democrats but also Republicans who claim to believe in the rule of law — to get to the bottom of this latest tawdry tale by holding hearings, obtaining transcripts, and finding a way to gain access to the whistleblower complaint or that person's testimony.

Thanks to Trump, 7 million have quit food stamps

Texto completo: According to recently released government data, exactly 36,029,506 Americans (18,230,968 households) are currently enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Although it may seem as though a rather large number of Americans receive government subsidies for their groceries, the current SNAP figure should be celebrated.
Why? Because in 2016, the last year of the Obama administration, 42,972,692 Americans (21,232,456 households) received SNAP. That's a drop of roughly 7 million people and 4 million households.
Although there are many reasons for the major drop in enrollment, one cannot dispute that the booming economy is the primary driver of the dramatic decrease. In less than three years, the Trump administration’s free-market policies have helped almost seven million Americans become self-reliant when it comes to paying for their groceries.
How could this be? Well, it does not take an economic genius to understand that lower taxes and fewer regulations result in more jobs in the economy. Employed people can afford their own groceries, and there is now more money in people’s pockets to buy them.
Despite the Left and fake news media constantly decrying the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a “tax cut for the rich,” the truth is that low- and middle-income Americans benefited big time from the Trump administration’s tax cut.
Even The New York Times, notably not a fan of President Trump, had to admit in an article this April, “If you’re an American taxpayer, you probably got a tax cut last year," and blamed perceptions to the contrary on "a sustained—and misleading—effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase.”
Wow, did someone inject truth serum into the water supply at The New York Times offices?
Although it is still too early to judge the long-term impact of the tax cut, the Tax Foundation “estimates that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase long-run GDP by 1.7%, create 339,000 jobs, and raise wages by 1.5%.”
In short, the tax bill reduced the need to redistribute taxes via SNAP because more Americans now keep more of their money in the first place.
No wonder the Left opposes tax cuts. Tax cuts negate the need for their redistributionist policies, a keystone of their misguided agenda of promoting government dependency.
Although the tax cuts produced larger paychecks — hence more discretionary income for individual Americans — the Trump administration’s war on pointless regulations has made the economic situation better for all Americans. According to Trump’s Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow, “Deregulation started everywhere across the board...and I think that started this push and started the small business push and the blue collar hiring. … Then comes the tax rate reduction, which adds to it on the incentive front, so they’re working very much together.”
The combination of tax cuts and regulatory rollback has produced a much-needed American job renaissance. According to the most recent employment snapshot from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “In August, the unemployment rate was 3.7% for the third month in a row.” This is excellent. Even more excellent, the unemployment rates for women (3.3%), blacks (5.5%), Hispanics (4.2%), and Asians (2.8%) are near or at all-time record lows.
Even better, “The labor force participation rate edged up to 63.2% in August … The employment-population ratio, at 60.9%, also edged up over the month and is up by 0.6 percentage point over the year.”
No wonder wages (especially for those at the bottom rung of the economic ladder) are finally increasing after years of stagnation.
The current economic narrative is quite easy to grasp. President Obama’s administration raised taxes and regulations for eight years, which stifled business investment, expansion, and hiring. People had less income and there were fewer good-paying jobs. No wonder millions of Americans relied on the government for help buying their groceries.
Under Trump, the exact opposite has happened. In three short years, the Trump administration has cut taxes and regulations. Therefore, people have more money to spend, and businesses (finally) have incentive to create lots of good-paying jobs.
It should come as no surprise that seven million fewer Americans are counting on Uncle Sam to help foot their grocery bills.

UMass to get trove of Ellsberg's papers

Texto completo: AMHERST — The historic records have lost none of their tectonic punch over the last half century. Dark memos of war. Details of deception.
A porthole into a time when there were marches in the streets and the United States seemed on the verge of a national nervous breakdown.
“Secrecy is very dangerous to our democracy and to human survival," Daniel Ellsberg said. “Officials in any country want to keep their secrets. What defines a democracy is that they don't get to."
And now Ellsberg, a top-rated war analyst who in 1971 leaked a massive, top-secret history of the American involvement in Vietnam — the so-called Pentagon Papers that exposed deception and mistakes by five US presidents — has chosen a home for his massive archive.
The papers are going to the University of Massachusetts' flagship campus here, where researchers will be able to pore over a catastrophic conflict in Southeast Asia, where 58,000 American lives were lost in a foreign war whose fateful lessons have echoed now across two generations.
The university has acquired the papers for $2.2 million, most of which — $1.35 million — was provided by an anonymous donor, the university said Monday.
The rest of the money will come from the university's special collections fund.
Ellsberg's papers include his evolving assessment of the Vietnam War, documentation from his criminal trial for leaking the Pentagon Papers, and records from his work in the antiwar and antinuclear movements.
“The focus of our archive is social change," said Robert S. Cox, head of special collections and university archives at ­UMass. “People, organizations, and individuals who go about trying to change the world consciously for the better. And so social change becomes what we do. And Dan fits that."
He certainly does.
When I caught up with him by telephone late last week, he was just leaving a climate change protest in California on a day when marches and rallies reverberated across the globe, crafting this message for world leaders headed to a summit at the United Nations: The world is warming. Act now.
He's 88 years old now. But the fire within him has not diminished.
“Both the Democrats and the Republicans are giving more money to the Pentagon than the Pentagon asked for," Ellsberg said. “It's keeping the danger alive. I'd say the world is not more dangerous than it was in the past, but it's not less dangerous."
Cox said any archive that measures more than 100 linear feet usually is considered large. Ellsberg's measures about 600 linear feet, or more than 500 boxes. The university estimates it will take the equivalent of two years of a full-time archivist's time to process and catalogue the collection.
“That's huge," Cox said.
Huge. And fascinating. And historic.
There is a 1969 onion-skin letter to Ellsberg from Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who had served as ambassador to South Vietnam and who, at the time the letter was written, served as delegate to the Vietnam peace talks in Paris.
There's a letter to Ellsberg written by Henry Kissinger when Kissinger was serving as Richard Nixon's national security adviser.
There's a formal invitation to a wedding reception hosted by Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy and his wife at their home in Washington, D.C.
“In the course of eight days in Vietnam I talked to a great many people," Philip A. Hart, then a Democratic senator from Michigan, writes to Ellsberg's father in a 1967 letter in the archive. “From no one did I learn more than from your son."
That letter was written four years before Ellsberg was to take his place in American history after he opened his safe at the Rand Corp., a nonprofit research institution where he worked, and began copying a 7,000-page, top-secret report.
The Globe's Thomas Oliphant broke a story that said the few people who had reviewed the papers copied by Ellsberg supported withdrawing from Vietnam. Oliphant had interviewed Ellsberg and learned of the documents' backstory.
But Neil Sheehan's front-page story in The New York Times on June 13, 1971, was a genuine journalistic bombshell.
“A massive study of how the United States went to war in Indochina, conducted by the Pentagon three years ago, demonstrates that four administrations progressively developed a sense of commitment to a non-Communist Vietnam, a readiness to fight the North to protect the South, and an ultimate frustration with this effort — to a much greater extent than their public statements acknowledged at the time," Sheehan wrote.
The Nixon administration asked the Times to stop publication. The Times refused. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order barring further publication. But then The Washington Post obtained the papers and began publishing. As the two national papers went to court to oppose Nixon's efforts to stop them, Ellsberg reached out to other newspapers, including The Boston Globe.
“It was a huge coup for the Globe," former Globe editor Matt Storin told me. “Much like today, The New York Times and The Washington Post were considered the top papers in the country. So when we got [the papers], we were quite pleased with ourselves — and quite excited."
At UMass, Cox said Ellsberg's papers will be rich material for scholars who are examining warfare or nuclear power or governmental secrecy — or ethics and morality.
“He could have stayed in his lane," Cox said when I visited with him in his 25th-floor office at the library here. “He could have been a guy sitting up in the highest echelons of war planning, and if he had been one of those guys who was willing to live with that, we wouldn't know him today."
Ellsberg faced 115 years in prison, but his case ended in a mistrial because the government gathered its evidence against him illegally, including burgling the office of his psychiatrist.
Ellsberg, who has a PhD in economics, will join UMass as a distinguished researcher and will become a fellow at UMass's Political Economy Research Institute.
He is scheduled to visit UMass's campuses here and in Boston for a series of events in late October.
He considered placing his papers with the University of California Santa Cruz. But decided on UMass after meeting with officials from the school. “They really wanted it," Ellsberg said. “And they got it."
It's clear from talking to Ellsberg that age has not dimmed the fire that burns within him.
“I would say I'm still at it," he said. “I continue to be at it. But who's winning? The secret keepers are winning."

Texto completo: In the Trump era, a columnist risks appearing like the boy (or girl) who cried wolf. Time and time again, we say this scandal is the big one.
But in our ill-fated version of the story, the wolf comes every time. The violations of morality and law have become progressively bolder and more dangerous to the constitutional order. And they have culminated in an abuse of power both highly serious and totally unconcealed.
By his own admission, the president of the United States urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open a criminal investigation of the son of a political rival. Trump denies that this request involved a quid pro quo. But with Ukraine engaged in conflict with Russian-backed separatists, and with $250 million in U.S. military aid being held up (at the time) for "review," the threat did not need to be explicit to be palpable and powerful. A mob boss doesn't need to issue threats personally to be feared and obeyed. And that is what the Trump presidency increasingly resembles - a criminal family sending out their slimy factotum (a part played enthusiastically by Rudolph W. Giuliani) to "fix" what needs fixing.
This groundbreaking form of political corruption shocked everyone with a conscience who was privy to it. U.S. Embassy staff in Kiev expressed alarm about Giuliani's contacts with Ukrainian officials. A whistleblower in the intelligence community risked his or her career to report it. The intelligence community's inspector general found the matter of "urgent concern." But acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Justice Department - playing the role of political enforcers - have blocked the transmission of the whistleblower's report to Congress. They are pursuing a coverup in plain sight.
The Constitution assumes that the president will interact with foreign governments to seek the interests and express the values of the United States. With Trump, nothing decent can be assumed. By making corrupt personal requests of a foreign power, the president is not only misusing $250 million in leverage, he is misusing the presidency itself. His actions may constitute bribery, extortion and/or the violation of campaign-finance laws. But his breach of public trust is ultimately a more serious matter. Trump has violated his oath of office by using his office for selfish gain.
Here, we need to be clear. Treating the presidency in this fashion is not only corrupt but unpatriotic. Trump is not only a preening, prating fool; he has set his own interests above the interests of the nation. He has replaced love of country with a kind of self-love that dishonors the institution he leads.
And Trump might have lost the ability to distinguish between patriotism and egotism. He might regard his crass political needs as the definition of his nation's good. In this case, he is both bent and delusional.
The U.S. criminal justice system was created to deal with normal types of political corruption, not with a rogue president, testing the limits of executive power. That form of warped ambition must be checked and balanced by the equal branches of government. But many members of Congress - mostly Republicans but also some Democrats - appear to have lost their taste for that role.
The political risk to elected Republicans when they oppose Trump appears very real - though it is hard to be sure when so few test the proposition. But the moral hazard is far greater. When they use their office to shield shady political dealings, they become a party to public corruption. When they ignore or excuse Trump's use of the nation's power and influence for private reasons, they have chosen Trump above their country and deserve to be defeated. Every one of them. Worst of all, they are teaching their political supporters that the rule of law is a small and expendable thing.
In the scarier regions of the Trump right, the problem is far advanced. Every revelation of the president's abuse of power is met with a sentence beginning: "But Biden . . ." Their tolerance for corruption seems limitless - and frightening. By what firm political principle would they condemn Trump if he closed down the New York Times (an "enemy of the people") or arrested a few whistleblowers (part of the "deep state" that is conducting a "coup")?
None of this seems possible. But too many impossibilities have recently become realities. Opposing Trump's corrupt abuse of power - here, now, before it goes further - is the calling of patriotism in our time.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden again called for President Donald Trump to release the transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky amid reports that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden.
Trump tweeted Monday that the media "says I 'pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him. ' This supposedly comes from a so-called "whistleblower" who they say doesn’t even have a first hand account of what was said. "
Biden's account responded: "So release the transcript of the call then. ”
At issue are two developments that have come to a head in the last week.
Trump's tweet is a reference to a Wall Street Journal report that stated Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son, and to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on the matter.
That phone call is reportedly the subject of a whistleblower complaint by a U. S. intelligence official, according to both the Washington Post and The New York Times.
Lawmakers are separately investigating whether Trump pushed for Zelensky to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country.
On Sunday, Trump confirmed that he discussed Biden during a phone call on July 25 with Zelensky, saying the "The conversation I had was largely congratulatory. "
However, during a meeting Monday at the United Nations, Trump claimed that he, "didn’t do it” and that he hoped people would see a transcript of the call because they would be “very disappointed. ”
“We’ll make a determination about how to release it, releasing it, saying what we said,” Trump also said Sunday, while defending his conversation as “perfect. ”
Biden told reporters on Saturday, “He’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum. And he’s using an abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to smear me. "
The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions about whether Biden, as vice president, pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma.
But Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News Service in May that "Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws — at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing. ”
Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn’t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president in March 2016 called on Ukraine’s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times. Shokin was eventually voted out by parliament, but no evidence showing Biden intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced.
Some moderate Republicans and Democrats have raised the alarm over the reports that Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate his political rival.
Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said Sunday that it "would be troubling in the extreme" in a tweet if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden.
"At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior," Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Sunday, "it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it. "

Electric car rebates may go to automakers cooperating with state

Texto completo: California is considering a plan that would reward automakers that have signed onto a pact with the state to cut pollution — and punish those that haven't — by restricting which companies' clean cars are eligible for millions of dollars in government rebates to the consumers who purchase them.
The plan is still in formation and has not been formally announced. But there are signs it's emerging as California's next salvo in an ongoing feud with the Trump administration over greenhouse gas and fuel efficiency standards.
Legislation written earlier this month would direct clean vehicle rebates only to cars made by companies that have entered an agreement with the state to abide by emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government seeks. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom declined to comment on the proposal but indicated an announcement is coming soon.
"Stay tuned," he said last week when asked whether he thinks the state's clean vehicle rebates should be restricted to car manufacturers that have entered California's pact.
"Give me a few days. And you'll get a very specific answer to that question."
It's all fallout from Trump administration plans to repeal emissions standards that began in California decades ago and were adopted nationwide during Obama's presidency. Those standards call for carmakers to cut tailpipe emissions and increase the fuel efficiency of their fleets to an average of about 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.
The Trump administration wants to cap fuel economy standards at an average of 37 miles per gallon starting with model year 2021 — and yank a waiver that lets California make its own clean air rules. It is likely to formally rescind that waiver this week, The New York Times reported Tuesday, prompting Newsom to issue a statement saying California will keep fighting for its clean car standards.
Part of that fight includes an unusual pact that California reached with four major automakers in July. Under the agreement with Honda, Ford, Volkswagen and BMW, the state will give the companies an extra year and more flexibility to reduce greenhouse gases in vehicle exhaust, and the car companies agreed to recognize California's authority to make the rules and follow California's standards across the country. The federal government has called the deal "unlawful and invalid" and opened an antitrust investigation.
"California should not incentivize the purchase of vehicles manufactured by companies that are not helping to achieve the state's public health and climate goals by refusing to join the state's framework," says the bill proposing to limit which companies can receive the rebates.
Among the currently eligible electric car makers who would be excluded if they don't play ball: Chevrolet (manufacturer of the Chevy Bolt EV), Fiat (the Fiat 500e) and Hyundai (the and Hyundai Ioniq Electric). The bill, as currently drafted, would also exclude plug-in hybrids (which would mean two strikes against Toyota, which manufactures the popular Prius). A Toyota spokesperson declined a request for comment. Other car makers did not respond.
The bill's author, Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting of San Francisco, declined to be interviewed but said in a prepared statement that he's "always looking for ways to spur greater adoption of clean cars in California."
The state's Air Resources Board, which is part of Newsom's administration, provided some input in drafting the bill, which air board spokesperson Melanie Turner described as "impartial technical assistance" on only some aspects.
The Legislature has adjourned for the year, so action on the bill couldn't come until at least January 2020. If it advances, it wouldn't be the first time lawmakers used the clean vehicle program to exert political pressure on carmakers.
Two years ago, they passed a law saying car companies can only get clean vehicle rebates if they have "fair and responsible" labor practices. It was broadly seen as an act of retribution against Tesla, the electric car maker where workers were trying to form a union.
California has paid out $720.3 million in clean vehicle rebates since the program began nine years ago, according to data from the state's Clean Vehicle Rebate Project. Rebates in 2018 amounted to about $171 million.
For consumers, rebates range between $900 and $9,000 depending on the type of car and the buyer's income.
The proposal to direct rebates to automakers that cut a deal with California would give those companies a leg up in doing business in the state, according to Colin Murphy, deputy director of the UC Davis Policy Institute for Energy, Environment, and the Economy.
"It is too early to say what the long-term impact of the change would be," Murphy said, "but it's certainly something that the manufacturers would have to consider."
The proposal could also entice car companies that haven't yet agreed to California's greenhouse gas reduction plan to join the agreement.
That's probably the point, according to Daniel Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis and a member of California's air board:
"One can speculate — which is not a good thing to do usually — the motivation is to reward companies that are committed to reducing the carbon footprints of their vehicles," Sperling said.
The proposal is likely to raise constitutional and political questions: Would the targeted incentives interfere with interstate commerce by providing a benefit to one car company over another? And would the plan backfire and anger those Californians who won't qualify for rebates for their desired cars?
Erwin Chemerinksy, a constitutional law expert and dean of the UC Berkeley law school, said the proposal does not violate interstate commerce doctrines because it doesn't favor businesses based on which state they're in. Instead, he said, it favors businesses that are adhering to the state's legitimate goals to improve air quality and slow climate change.
"I don't think it's bribery. I think it's giving an incentive to do something that's enormously important," Chemerinsky said.
Rebates go to car buyers, not sellers. So the most immediate losers if a car maker chooses not to play ball with California would be the middle class consumers who don't purchase the excluded manufacturers' cars.
But it's not much different from other ways the government uses taxpayer money to, for example, offer tax breaks to companies that film in California, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
"It feels like this is largely what we do with the public purse," she said. "We say we like your behavior, we don't like your behavior, we want to change your behavior."

Don't rush to judgment on Kavanaugh

Texto completo: My best middle-school teacher liked to use an exercise he called "Contradictions," giving us two statements and asking us to identify the inconsistencies between them. So let's try an example from recent news reports:
1. Charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh were not sufficiently investigated before he was confirmed for the U.S. Supreme Court.
2. Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached because he engaged in sexual misconduct and lied about it in his confirmation hearing.
So what's the contradiction? Even a middle-schooler would recognize it: the first statement says that we don't know enough about Kavanaugh's actions, and the second assumes that we do.
That's a problem for Democrats calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment, including presidential candidates Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke and Elizabeth Warren. "We know he lied under oath," O'Rourke recently tweeted about Kavanaugh. "He should be impeached."
But we don't know that, because federal officials failed to properly investigate claims against Kavanaugh before he was confirmed. The GOP-controlled Senate acted in haste, approving Kavanaugh before the facts were in. And Democrats echo that mistake by demanding his impeachment before they actually know what he did.
During Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, most of the controversy focused on accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her in high school. There was much less attention to claims about his sexual misbehavior at Yale, where he allegedly thrust his penis at two women during drunken parties.
Lawyers representing one of the women, Deborah Ramirez, provided the FBI with a list of at least 25 people who might have possessed evidence supporting her claim. The FBI interviewed none of them, even after several of the witnesses tried to contact the agency. Still, it concluded there was not enough evidence to corroborate her allegations.
The second woman's accusations have raised more hackles in recent days, especially among Kavanaugh's supporters, because of a New York Times article that failed to mention that she does not remember the alleged episode. But the same article reported that a classmate of the woman, Max Stier, had notified the FBI about the alleged assault on her. So did U.S. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who wrote the agency urging it to investigate.
As best we know, it didn't. And that's why Congress should hold hearings to figure out who knew about the claims, and what they did - or did not do - to probe the allegations. If Kavanaugh assaulted any woman, we should know; if he lied about his behavior, we should know; and if the FBI or Department of Justice covered it up, we should know.
But until we have the facts, we shouldn't rush to judgment. That's what the Senate did in confirming Kavanaugh. It would be sad - and ironic - if his foes did the same thing, by prematurely demanding his impeachment.
"Sexual predators do not deserve a seat on the nation's highest court," Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said on Tuesday, introducing an impeachment resolution against Kavanaugh. She's right about that. But she's wrong to assume that Kavanaugh is a sexual predator. How could she now that, given that the FBI did so little to investigate?
To be fair, several prominent Democrats have denounced the move to impeach Kavanaugh. "We seem to have a habit of wanting to get to the verdict before we've gathered the evidence," warned Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Yes, we do. That habit was on ugly display last fall, when Kavanaugh's Republican allies rammed through his confirmation. Shame on the Democrats, if they repeat the same error now.

Democrats should look to Yang: We need nuclear power

Texto completo: Want to do something about climate change by reducing carbon emissions? If you're serious, that "something" has to include a massive commitment to the construction of new nuclear power plants worldwide, as well as making sure that existing nuclear power plants don't go offline until they can be replaced by new ones.
Nuclear power is the only major, established, proven source of power that has zero carbon emissions. Of the carbon-free alternatives, only hydroelectric has a long track record as a major power source, and you can only dam so many rivers; solar and wind are still in the teething stages and are unlikely to carry the load any time soon.
Nuclear power is reliable, safe and well understood. If you oppose nuclear power but call climate change a crisis, then you're speaking nonsense, unless you simply want to reduce energy consumption in America to something like what's seen in current day Venezuela, in which case you're just speaking a different kind of nonsense.
Most, but not all, of the Democratic candidates for president are vague on the subject, silent or opposed to nuclear power. But not all. Cory Booker has been a "full-throated" supporter of nuclear power, and nuclear power gets a big boost from Andrew Yang's 2020 climate change plan.
According to Yang's plan, "Nuclear power is a crucial component in the move towards creating sustainable, carbon-free energy for the United States. However, many people – including some other candidates – dismiss it out of hand. Why does it have such a bad reputation? ... First, the public's perception of its safety has been skewed by TV shows like Chernobyl and The Simpsons."
Yang continues: "When the OECD (11), NEA (11), and NASA (12) analyzed the actual danger of nuclear energy compared to other sources, they found that it caused orders of magnitude fewer deaths than fossil fuel-based energy. And that's not even considering the long-term impact of climate change from burning fossil fuels. With modern reactors, safety is drastically increased, and nuclear waste is drastically decreased."
That's exactly right. Yang is particularly interested in reactors powered by thorium instead of uranium, because thorium is more efficient, and more plentiful, and because thorium reactors can't produce materials suitable for use in nuclear weapons. Plus: "Thorium reactors produce less waste than uranium reactors. Thorium waste remains radioactive for several hundred years instead of several thousand years. Thorium-based molten salt reactors are safer than earlier-generation nuclear reactors, and the potential for a catastrophic event is negligible, due to the design of the reactor and the fact that thorium is not, by itself, fissile."
Yang is absolutely right to make these points, and he's gotten some well-deserved attention. But it's surprising that he hasn't gotten more, given how much we're hearing about the crisis nature of climate change. Because if you take climate change seriously, you have to take nuclear power seriously. As Mike Shellenberger writes in Forbes, if Germany and California had based their emissions plans on nuclear instead of "renewables" like solar and wind, they'd have 100% clean power now.
But they didn't, and they don't, and the question is whether the rest of us will learn from their mistake. The International Energy Agency reports that planned nuclear retirements will already lead to 4 billion metric tons of extra carbon dioxide emissions. If it makes sense to keep functioning reactors online longer rather than replacing them with fossil fuels, then surely it makes sense to replace existing fossil fuel plants with new nuclear reactors.
There's something of a renaissance going on in nuclear technology, with small "inherently safe" reactors being put forward to fill gaps in supply. These reactors could be mass-produced on assembly lines for much lower costs (current reactors are custom-built on site) and because of their small size could more easily be placed where needed.
Sure, people are scared and invoke things like Chernobyl or Three Mile Island, but when they do, they're mostly thinking about the absurdly dramatized fictional versions of those incidents. (As Shellenberger writes, "The reason they fictionalize nuclear disasters like Chernobyl is because they kill so few people"). Yang's plan specifically recognizes that, noting that nuclear power causes orders of magnitudes fewer deaths than fossil fuels.
And the change could be done quickly. As Joshua Goldstein, Staffan Qvist and Steven Pinker note in The New York Times, France and Sweden "decarbonized their grids decades ago and now emit less than a tenth of the world average of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. They remain among the world's most pleasant places to live and enjoy much cheaper electricity than Germany to boot. They did this with nuclear power. And they did it fast, taking advantage of nuclear power's intense concentration of energy per pound of fuel. France replaced almost all of its fossil-fueled electricity with nuclear power nationwide in just 15 years; Sweden, in about 20 years. In fact, most of the fastest additions of clean electricity historically are countries rolling out nuclear power."
Andrew Yang's right. So why wait?
It's time for our leaders to get their heads out of thriller movies and start supporting a massive shift to nuclear power. Because it's a crisis, and in a crisis, you do things you haven't done before.

CNN tries to blame Trump for Obama administration's leaks

Texto completo: Here's some advice for the media covering President Trump: If you don't want to be accused of reporting fake news, don't report fake news.
Case in point: On Monday, CNN correspondent Jim Sciutto reported that a highly-placed U.S. intelligence source inside the Kremlin was pulled "in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy." Sciutto continued, "The decision to carry out the extraction occurred soon after a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump discussed highly classified intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. ... [that] had been provided by Israel."
Sorry, the decision to extract the source was first made before Trump took office, and the reason was mishandling of classified intelligence not by Trump, but by the Obama administration. As The New York Times reports this week, "C.I.A. officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia."
What prompted that decision? Leaks to the media about the covert source's reporting that Russian president Vladimir Putin personally ordered and orchestrated Russia's election interference campaign.
The impetus for the extraction decision was a December 14, 2016 NBC News report that "Two senior officials with direct access to the information" said Putin personally directed Russia's election interference and that "the intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies, the officials said."
NBC added that this new intelligence showing Putin's direct involvement went much further than the information the U.S. was relying when all 17 intelligence agencies issued a report in October holding Russia responsible for the DNC hack, and that "now the U.S has solid information tying Putin to the operation."
This leak exposed the fact that the CIA had a spy in Putin's orbit who was passing on intelligence about the Russian president's decision making. Who leaked the information? Two senior Obama administration officials.
The Times reports that Obama CIA director John Brennan considered the Kremlin source's reporting "so delicate, and the need to protect the source's identity so important," that he kept his reports out of the President's Daily Brief (PDB) sent them to Obama in "special sealed envelopes to the Oval Office."
The PDB is already one of the most restricted U.S. government documents, so the sealed reports were restricted to an even smaller circle of senior Obama aides. Yet the leak, according to NBC, came from officials "with direct access to the information." Which Obama aide leaked it? That is for U.S. attorney John Durham to find out, but this much is certain: It was not Donald Trump.
It was after this Obama administration leak that the CIA decided to pull the source. The reason he was not actually pulled at the time is that he initially refused -- a decision the Times reports raised concerns that "the informant had been turned and had become a double agent." Eventually, the source changed his mind. But the decision was made before Trump came to office.
That's not all.
CNN falsely reported that the source was pulled after Trump's meeting with Russia officials in which he shared intelligence on Syria that was "provided by Israel." But as I pointed out in May 2017, Trump did not reveal to that Israel was the source of the intelligence. That classified information was revealed to the Times by what the paper described "a current and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information."
Any former official familiar with that intelligence was from the Obama administration. So this leak also came from Team Obama. Even Brennan, the Obama CIA director and virulent Trump critic, admitted that Trump was not to blame and said that "the real damage to national security is ... what was leaked in the aftermath, what was put in the media."
So, CNN tried to blame Trump for the loss of Kremlin source, when it was really the Obama administration that was responsible for the catastrophic leaks that burned him -- and did so citing a leak that did not come from Trump at all, but most likely from a former Obama official. Talk about fake news!
Yet despite all this, CNN has not pulled its "fake news" story. Indeed, Sciutto still has it proudly pinned at the top of the Twitter feed. What a disgrace.

Parsing Claims From President About NASA And Iran Deal

Texto completo: What Trump Said
If you look at our facilities, they were virtually closed up. There was crabgrass growing on the runways. And now they're vital and we're -- we're doing -- we're going to Mars. We're stopping at the moon.
False.
President Trump, like some of his predecessors, has retooled the government's space program. But space exploration had not grinded to a halt before he took office in 2017. In fact, NASA for years has been aiming for a trip to Mars.
Casey Dreier of the Planetary Society, a nonprofit that promotes space exploration, said that the Trump administration "has been unusually attentive to space" but noted that it has "generally continued policies established over the past 15 years, and benefited from a rapidly maturing commercial space industry that has taken decades to develop."
In 2004, President George W. Bush proposed a return to the moon as a springboard to Mars. President Barack Obama canceled that moon program in 2010, choosing to focus instead on reaching an asteroid and then Mars, while encouraging government financing of commercial spaceflight.
Mr. Trump has since scrapped the asteroid idea and refocused on the moon, eyeing a 2024 landing (however unlikely) as the interim step before reaching Mars. He also restored the National Space Council, "which has taken significant steps to propose updates to regulations around the commercial use of space and space traffic management," Mr. Dreier said. And most recently, Mr. Trump authorized the creation of the United States Space Command, a precursor to the military Space Force he often champions.
Beyond these changes in mission, NASA has continued to operate and reach milestones.
During the Obama administration, the Curiosity Rover landed on Mars, the New Horizons spacecraft captured images of Pluto and the Juno spacecraft successfully entered Jupiter's orbit.
While NASA's annual budget is a fraction of what it was during the heyday of the space race, it has hovered between $ 16 billion and $ 21 billion for the past decade. Mr. Trump proposed cutting NASA's funding in his budgets for the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, though Congress ignored those suggestions.
What Trump Said
"Germany, France, Russia, many other countries made a lot of money with Iran. And we didn't make money with Iran, which that was just one of the many bad parts about the deal."
This is misleading.
As part of the Iran nuclear deal, the United States and European nations lifted economic sanctions on the country in early 2016, after international inspectors concluded that it had followed through on promises to dismantle large sections of its nuclear program.
The deal also loosened barriers to international trade with Iran. Mr. Trump was likely referring to trade surpluses when he claimed that other countries had "made a lot of money with" the country. (Though, as The New York Times has explained, trade balances are not inherently good or bad.)
In 2016, the three countries listed by Mr. Trump all had trade surpluses in goods with Iran -- $ 2.2 billion for Germany, $ 1.3 billion for Russia and $ 918 million for France, according to data from the United Nations.
The United States also ran a trade surplus in goods with Iran that year, but a much smaller one of $ 183 million. That disparity existed in large part because the United States lifted nuclear-related sanctions on Iran only as part of the agreement, leaving intact other economic restrictions related to terrorism, human rights and missile technology that were "much more extensive than those of other countries," according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. In addition, about two dozen states have their own punitive measures on commercial dealings with Iran, on top of federal policies.
Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.

Democrats want to impeach Kavanaugh? Go for it!

Texto completo: The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates.
No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's impeachment. "These newest revelations are disturbing," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached." Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's "place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached." Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former congressman Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former vice president Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and "follow the evidence to wherever it leads." That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field.
Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see Kavanaugh impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see.
Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of his party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to "get real." "We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'" Durbin said. "It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families."
Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. The Washington Post reports that in 2016, "26% of Trump voters told pollsters that Supreme Court nominees were the most important factor in their voting, compared with only 18% of Hillary Clinton voters who said the same." As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.
In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin.

Opinion: What NY Times’ Kavanaugh essay left out

Texto completo: Sitting in my Bridgeport home on Sunday morning, Sept. 15, I pulled out the Sunday Review section of The New York Times.
On Page 2, I saw a big spread about past sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh when his nomination to the U.S Supreme Court was under consideration by the Senate.
It was by Times staffers Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. An editors’ note said, “They are authors of the forthcoming book ‘The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,’ from which this essay is adapted.”
After reading it, I thought the essay was missing something important.
The first 10 paragraphs were devoted mostly to Deborah Ramirez, who grew up in Shelton and went to Yale when Kavanaugh was a student there, and also to Christine Blassey Ford, who attended a Washington-area secondary school near his.
Both had accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct years before. Ford testified on television before the Senate’s Judicial Committee. Ramirez was interviewed by the FBI.
What did the essay tell me that I had not already read or heard? Not much until the 11th paragraph, which said:
“We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez’s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. (We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier.)”
Whoa! Another woman who may make an accusation against Kavanaugh? Did the authors interview the female student? I read the essay to the end, but it did not say.
In Washington, where the essay was seen by most on nytimes.com, the reference to “a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh” made a big splash.
Leading Democrats called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment.
President Donald Trump tweeted, “Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel.”
Commentators critical of The Times essay learned that the new book provides more information about the “previously unreported story.”
In the book, the authors say the woman declined to be interviewed about any incident with Kavanaugh and that “several of her friends said she does not recall it.”
When I was a newspaper reporter and an editor, I made sure crucial information like this was in the story.
After the essay was posted on nytimes.com and published in the newspaper’s early print edition, The Times finally corrected its mistake.
A sentence was added to the paragraph about the “previously unreported story.” It says, “The female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode.”
An editors’ note is attached to the end of the revised story.
“An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book’s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate,” it says, repeating what Stier claimed he witnessed.
The editors’ note goes on to say: “The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.”
Am I satisfied? No.
The “earlier version of this article” never should have appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: In September 2018, I warned about the abbreviated FBI investigation into allegations that Brett Kavanaugh engaged in sexually aggressive behavior: "If Democrats retake one or both houses in November, they will be able to investigate, subpoena witnesses and conduct their own inquiry. The result will be a cloud over the Supreme Court and possible impeachment hearings. ... Kavanaugh has not cleared himself but rather undermined faith in the judicial system that presumes that facts matter."
And sure enough, two New York Times reporters have found multiple witnesses to the allegations from Deborah Ramirez that Kavanaugh exposed himself during a dorm party at Yale. One newly discovered witness had information concerning yet another, similar event. That witness, Max Stier, is chief executive of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that, among other things, tracks nominations and confirmations. According to the Times report, he brought the information to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the FBI. (I've relied on him for expertise about the federal government and found him to be scrupulously nonpartisan and honest.) He might have been a compelling witness. The Times now reports that the woman involved in the incident Stier witnessed does not remember it.
Democratic candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, as well as JuliÃ¡n Castro, are arguing for impeachment on the theory that Kavanaugh lied about his past conduct and engaged in sexually abusive behavior. There is certainly merit in the idea that regardless of the Senate's unwillingness to remove him, the American people should understand just who this justice is, how the investigation of him was rigged and how his elevation to the Supreme Court has sullied the institution. That might figure prominently if and when a Democratic president has the chance to reshape the court.
Ilyse Hogue, head of NARAL Pro-Choice America, told me, "Americans should be appalled that GOP senators are complicit in the coverup of Brett M. Kavanaugh's abuses rather than demanding all evidence be brought (to) light before confirmation." She continued, "We can't undo the wrongs that have been done to these women, but we can and will make those who refused them justice pay at the polls next year. We're hearing from voters from Maine to Colorado who are committed to make this count."
And speaking of Maine, it's Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who will once more receive the lion's share of the anger. She not only cast the last holdout vote but also accepted an obviously fraudulent investigation. Had she demanded a real inquiry, including witnesses we now know about, the truth might have come out before Kavanaugh was elevated to the court. The Supreme Court might not have been grievously diminished. Collins was already high on the list of progressives' targets for 2020. This will be one more reminder that she utterly failed in her role to render advice and consent on judicial nominees.
The latest Kavanaugh revelations, as we predicted, were inevitable. The artificially restricted FBI investigation was a Kabuki dance to give Republicans cover to vote for him. When a Democratic majority in the House and a Democratic president (if they prevail in 2020) decide to waive privileges, open the investigation up to scrutiny and demand that FBI Director Christopher Wray testify, more evidence will tumble out. And then what? We'll revisit the same fight we had in the Kavanaugh hearing. While a Democratic House might conceivably impeach him for lying under oath, the Senate would never obtain a two-thirds majority that would leave the "Kennedy seat" to be filled by a Democratic president.
Kavanaugh already is tainted in the eyes of those who believe he lied when he denied any and all allegations of sexual conduct as well as excessive drinking. A cloud hangs over the Supreme Court as things stand, and perhaps it would get darker with some investigation. Nevertheless, Kavanaugh would remain - given that Republicans would never vote to remove him and Kavanaugh would never resign. The credibility, fairness and honesty of the court will be in doubt for as long as he sits on the court.
If Democrats do win the White House, they may pursue this, or worse, ratchet up the Supreme Court wars by adding seats ("Well, Kavanaugh's vote shouldn't count! And the Gorsuch seat was illegitimate, too!").
The court will continue to hemorrhage respect. And the pattern will continue, another institutional casualty in the Trump era. If only Collins had displayed the courage to demand a legitimate investigation, both parties, the Senate and the Supreme Court might have avoided this debacle.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
To get into the minds and notebooks of Times journalists, look no further than Instagram.
The app allows many reporters, editors and photographers based in New York and around the world to show how their professional and personal lives intersect. Their feeds become a repository for unpublished details and visuals, and serve as a creative outlet for their journalism-related interests.
Here are 12 Instagram accounts from journalists who span The Times's report and take readers behind the scenes.
Kathy Ryan, @kathyryan
Director of photography for The New York Times Magazine
Follow for: Artistic scenes from the New York Times headquarters, in black, white and red
In 2012, a shaft of light falling across some stairs in the Times Building caught Kathy Ryan's eye. She posted a photo of it on Instagram, and from there evolved a series she dubbed "Office Romance."
"It's overwhelmingly about the light for me," says Kathy, who captures The Times through the people and objects in its Renzo Piano-designed building -- "the greatest studio in the world."
Her subjects, often bathed in soft sunlight punctuated by stripes of shadow, appear ethereal in her posts -- a conscious contrast to the chaos of working at a news organization. She shoots them mainly in black and white, with the occasional pop of cherry red, in a style that evokes film noir.
Each post, she says, captioned with the time and date she took the photo, allows her followers "for a split second to be in this remarkable building in this remarkable city."
But if the Times Building looks like the Garden of Eden on Kathy's feed, its sins can be seen on @dont_tell_renzo, a humorous account she recommends.
Pete Wells, @pete_wells
Restaurant critic
Follow for: A slice (often literally) of New York's dining scene
Pete Wells has a disclaimer in his Instagram bio: "sloppy with lighting; struggling with focus."
"I'm kind of picking the least bad photo from my three visits to a restaurant," Pete says of his approach to posting. "And sometimes it's still pretty bad."
While he makes no claims to high art, his feed brings followers to tables across New York City, from slice shops to high-end sushi counters. They can also see his review process, which often involves comparing meals at similar restaurants.
Pete credits Instagram for "one of the biggest subtle changes in restaurant design" in recent years: lighting fixtures that act as spotlights for your plate, chosen with amateur food photographers in mind. But when the lighting isn't ideal, he admits he uses his iPhone's flash, "even though it's the biggest no-no in food photography."
"If you do it right," he advises, "you can get really great high-contrast, shadow-filled dramatic pictures."
Sebastian Modak, @sebmodak
52 Places correspondent
Follow for: Armchair travels around the world at a breakneck pace
Unlike most Times journalists, Sebastian Modak actually has Instagram in his job description. As the 52 Places Traveler, he uses the platform daily to bring along his followers on his yearlong adventure.
Sebastian's feed brims with his best shots from each destination and gives a sneak peak of his weekly columns. But his Instagram Stories are, well, another story. The often humorous slide shows of photos, text and videos reveal the "not fun part of travel" -- flight cancellations, exhaustion, middle-of-the-night driving -- and everyday moments, like a haircut in Croatia, that don't make it into his articles.
Followers have sent Sebastian a plethora of recommendations, and he has taken them up on offers to be his tour guide. "It's a really nice way to meet people," he says, "and I never even thought of Instagram as a tool for that."
Pamela Paul, @pamelapaul2018
Editor of the Book Review
Follow for: Reflections on books and illustrators, occasionally interrupted by three beguiling cats
The focus of Pamela Paul's Instagram feed is, unsurprisingly, books -- "both in terms of my life here at The Times and, on a more personal level, my life as a reader and also an author."
But her "gold standard" for a post is when her family's cats -- Zoomer, Loki and Octavian -- intrude upon her more purely literary posts.
In a rather meta photo, she recently documented her progress on a forthcoming children's book -- about a cat that gets in the way of a boy's reading -- with Zoomer lounging on some early illustrations. "It is not purely fiction," says Pamela, who has two sons and a daughter.
Farther from home, Pamela likes to post photos of foreign-language books and bookshops she stumbles across: "It's a lot of what I'm doing when I'm abroad, and I think it's part of what people are looking to me for." Mindful of her own aversion to Instagram posts of idyllic vacations, she adds, "But it doesn't make anyone feel bad."
Eve Lyons, @lyonse
A Styles photo editor
Follow for: Photographers to have on your radar, with a dash of mustard yellow
For Eve Lyons, what started as a practical concern last year -- finding meeting spaces after a recent renovation of The Times's newsroom -- turned into "a happy accident."
When photographers came in for portfolio reviews, she started using the diner-style yellow booths installed during the office makeover. As an experiment, she began doing short shoots at the end of each meeting to feature the artists on her Instagram.
"The yellow is such a good visual signifier," says Eve, who likes the playfulness that the colorful booths elicit.
As the series evolved, she added more photos to highlight not only the photographers, but also pieces from their portfolios. It has turned into "a destination for people to explore new work, new stories, new projects," not to mention her own visual Rolodex of freelancers.
On a temporary assignment, Eve has decamped to Los Angeles, where actual diner booths are serving as her stand-in.
Dionne Searcey, @dionnesearcey
Politics reporter
Follow for: Snapshots of life in West Africa , and election coverage from across the United States
Dionne Searcey joined Instagram four years ago, after becoming The Times's West Africa bureau chief. She saw the platform as a way to document everyday life in a part of the world that remains off the radar for many.
"I always tried to show things that were unexpected," she says, and "to bust stereotypes of the continent in general being a place that was full of bad things."
Her Instagram posts, often short vignettes drawn from the stories she writes, have featured cow herders in Nigeria, athletes in Senegal and her own life as a correspondent.
Dionne, who is from Nebraska and recently joined the Politics team to cover the 2020 election, has already started posting photos from her new beat.
"I'm hoping to travel to parts of rural America that people on the coasts call 'flyover country,"' she says, comparing her work in the United States to her work abroad. "I think that is a similar approach and a similar philosophy, of showing parts of America that a lot of people in big cities don't see."
Hannah Wise, @sewmanycomments
A social media editor
Follow for: Crafting #inspo and amusing news commentary
After covering a police shooting for The Dallas Morning News in 2016, Hannah Wise wanted a tactile, screen-free activity to do in her free time. The solution came when she saw a "really bizarre" comment on one of her reporting partner's stories and decided to embroider it.
With that, her new hobby and new Instagram account were born. Hannah, who has a background in graphic design, compares it to drawing in thread. She stitches quotes and comments that amuse her, or that touch a nerve in journalism.
Most of her hoops end up as gifts. A 12-inch one memorializing the journalists who were killed at the Capital Gazette last year was included in The Dallas Morning News's care package for the Maryland newspaper.
Fittingly, she used embroidery to announce her new job at The Times last month.
Gia Kourlas, @giadk
Dance critic
Follow for: Mesmerizing short videos of dancers in the studio
For nearly three years, Gia Kourlas has written the weekly #SpeakingInDance column, which explores the world of dance through videos posted on Instagram.
The sessions are filmed by professional videographers and appear on The Times's main Instagram account, but Gia also takes her own videos and edits them for her personal feed. She hopes her followers feel "like you're in a room with me, seeing a different perspective."
Growing up in Ohio, Gia, who trained as a dancer, didn't get to see many performances. Now, with Instagram, she can bring dance to more people around the country, and the world.
"I just want to get more eyes on dance," she says, "in any way I can."
Mujib Mashal, @mujmash
Senior correspondent in Afghanistan
Follow for: Poignant scenes from a changing Afghanistan
Mujib Mashal's reporting has taken him across Afghanistan, where he was born and raised, and South Asia. He likes to take photos as part of his notes, documenting the remote, visually stunning areas where his work takes him.
"Those are places that sometimes I don't get back to," he explains, "so I want to make a record for my own memories and archives."
From that collection, he chooses photos for his Instagram feed to illustrate the news he covers, or simply to show life in Kabul, where he lives -- a stop at a park, a cafe, an ice cream shop.
Mujib uses Instagram Stories to present highlights from his bigger projects. He thinks of them as trailers to draw readers in through the videos, sounds, photos and quotes he gathers during his reporting.
Melissa Clark, @clarkbar
NYT Cooking reporter
Follow for: Cooking ideas and tutorials, and vicarious global eating
Melissa Clark wants her Instagram feed to feel inviting, and to inspire home cooks. That means mostly informal shots of the new dishes she tests in her Brooklyn kitchen -- no filters or food styling involved.
"I like to show people how I really do it," she says.
Melissa also sees the platform as an educational tool. She has created in-depth guides to techniques such as yogurt making with Instagram Stories. And when she travels, she uses her food photos to share what she learns, like how it's actually O.K. to eat oysters in the summer.
In addition to pictures of cooking and eating, you'll see Melissa's daughter, husband and friends. "Each post tells a story, but the whole entire group tells a story, too," she notes. And if you look closely, that story follows a pattern, which Melissa boils down to "cake, child, sardine or anchovy, cocktail."
Chang W. Lee, @nytchangster
Photographer
Follow for: Visual stories told in up to 10 photos
Photojournalists may take hundreds, even thousands, of shots for a single story, but only a fraction will end up online -- and even fewer in print.
For Chang W. Lee, Instagram is a way not only to publish more work from his Times assignments, but also to express himself through the photo selection and edits. In his posts, he often arranges multiple images to tell a complete visual story.
"It's like my own publication," he says.
Chang, who has traveled around the world for The Times, favors human interest stories. He has shot young basketball players in the Philippines, impoverished families in the United States, and the aftermath of natural disasters. He also has an eye for capturing the artistry and physical feats of athletes in motion at major events like the Olympics and the United States Open.
Nick Casey, @caseysalbum
Andes bureau chief
Follow for: Reporting outtakes from Latin America
Nick Casey's Instagram -- a play on his Twitter account, @caseysjournal -- acts as an extension of his notebook. Details that don't make it into his stories, behind-the-scenes reporting shots and glimpses of daily life in Latin America fill his feed.
"If you look at my Instagram account and the reporting," Nick says, "they kind of put together one piece."
You can see photos from Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Easter Island and Colombia, where he lives. But perhaps his most photographed country is Venezuela, where he was based until 2016, when he was banned for his reporting on the country's economic collapse.
Now, whenever Nick returns to Venezuela, he posts as much as he can. He says his photos of trying to pay for things -- with stacks of bills and wire transactions, necessitated by the country's hyperinflation -- have particularly captured his followers' attention.

Did you know Max Stier is ‘well-respected?'

Texto completo: Did you know attorney Max Stier is well-respected? Did you know he heads a well-respected, non-partisan outfit in the nation’s capital? Did you know Stier, who is well-respected, is above political activism?
Did you know Max Stier can also walk on water?
I did not know any of these things until members of the press decided this week that it was especially important to vouch for Stier’s apparently impeccable character. This comes after New York Times reporters revealed he accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh privately last year of drunkenly abusing a female classmate when they were all students at Yale.
For many major newsrooms, it more important to stress Stier’s good character than the fact that he is a Democratic consultant. His good character is more important than addressing the fact that he served as Bill Clinton’s attorney in the 1990s, opposite Kavanaugh, who worked for the special prosecutor going after Clinton. Stier's good character is also a more important detail than the supposed victim in his accusation against Kavanaugh saying she has no recollection of the thing he alleges.
He is well-respected and non-partisan. So say our fearless and objective news media. I hope that settles things for everyone.
Steir is the “president of the thoroughly bipartisan and widely respected Partnership for Public Service,” Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne Jr. wrote in an article published Sept. 15. Dionne’s Post colleague Karen Tumulty wrote two days later that Stier “heads a well-respected, nonpartisan organization in Washington.”
“He's well-respected,” CNN’s Alyssa Camerota said Sept. 17 during a discussion of the allegation Stier brought privately to Deleware Sen. Chris Coons during the 2018 Kavanaugh confirmation hearings.
Elsewhere that same day, Kate Kelly, who is one of the two New York Times reporters who revealed the attorney’s behind-the-scenes involvement in the Kavanaugh hearings, said also on CNN that the Democratic consultant is “very respected, good governance advocate in Washington,” adding further that, “Because of Stier's respected stature in Washington, and because he runs this bipartisan group, we deem it to be credible information.”
USA Today's Washington Bureau chief Susan Page said later during a Fox News panel discussion that Stier is “a respected person” and a “respected bipartisan person,” who she “didn’t realize [worked] for a Democratic president.” Oops!
“Eyewitnesses often get attacked by supporters of the one whose conduct was witnessed,” tweeted former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and frequent MSNBC contributor Walter Shaub. “[A]nd Before that happens, I'd like to add that Max Stier is well respected by both sides of the aisle, nonpartisan, smart and absolutely devoted to good government without regard to who's in power.”
The New Yorker’s notoriously unreliable Jane Mayer also noted on social media that Stier “is no slouch of a witness — he is a Rhodes Scholar, Stanford Law grad, fmr. Supreme Court Clerk, runs a bipartisan center for public service and is the star of Michael Lewis’ last book.” True to form, Mayer had to add in a follow-up note, “Evidently Max Stier was in Kavanaugh’s class at Yale, clerked for Justice David Souter but isn’t a Rhodes Scholar, so correcting and updating.”
Philadelphia Daily News columnist Will Bunch complained also that federal agents did not question “the respected head of a D.C.-area non-profit, Max Stier.”
"I know Max Stier. He is scrupulously honest and nonpartisan,” tweeted Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin.
What these commentaries all have in common, aside from hero worship, is that they are curiously silent regarding Stier’s professional background.
Meanwhile, Kelly and her Times colleague, Robin Pogrebin, describe Stier in their new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, as “a respected thought leader on federal government management issues in Washington as the founding president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service.” An excerpt from their book published last weekend in the Times’ Sunday Review section describes Stier merely as an individual who “runs a nonprofit organization in Washington.” A follow-up Times report characterizes him only as a man “who now runs a nonprofit organization in Washington.”
This effort to hide the ball from the reader is itself an indication that something is wrong with the reporting.
The fact that the man has a long track record of serving Democrats, even working opposite the very man he now accuses of misconduct, is somehow just a minor detail we are supposed to ignore or overlook. After all, would a well-respected man ever lie to you?

Texto completo: The dire state of our politics is evident on the pages of the New York Times every day.
The front page of the Sunday Review section carried a third-hand accusation of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh. The piece omitted that the source was a Democratic operative and that the alleged victim has no memory of an assault. It was a total abandonment of journalistic standards in pursuit of an agenda.
Two days later, the New York Times’ opinion section parlayed the anger ginned up by its own irresponsible attack into a piece calling on Democrats to pack the Supreme Court. “Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed last September under clouds of suspicion that stemmed from accusations of sexual assault and sexual misconduct,” columnist Jamelle Bouie wrote, as if the accusations had not been demolished by months of investigations that found no corroboration. Then, Bouie concluded that Kavanaugh’s confirmation, and that of Neil Gorsuch, “cry out for Democratic hardball.”
Why do they need to play hardball?
Bouie explains, “It’s entirely possible that a future Democratic agenda would be circumscribed and unraveled by” the Supreme Court. In other words, when Democrats try to do things that the Constitution doesn’t allow, they could be derailed if there are judges on the court who believe the Constitution limits what majorities can do.
And we don’t have to guess what they will try to do.
“Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15s,” presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke declared to many cheers at the most recent Democratic debate and no resistance from other Democrats on the stage. When Joe Biden in that same debate noted that the Constitution doesn't allow the executive to simply implement whatever gun control it wants, ruthless prosecutor Kamala Harris laughed and declared, “Yes, we can!”
Fittingly, the New York Times on Wednesday ran an op-ed defending O’Rourke’s gun confiscation plan and attacking the Bill of Rights for subordinating majority opinion to the “political preferences of a shrinking minority of citizens.”
The writer said of gun owners, “They think democracy’s coming for their power, and they’re right."
The pattern here is clear: All rules and restraints need to go out the window in pursuit of the Left’s aims. Journalistic standards interfere with the ability to smear conservative justices, which must be done in order to justify packing the court, which must be done in order to shelve the Constitution, which, after all, stands in the way of what the Left imagines the majority wants. Got that?
The Left, believing it has the majority of the country behind it, wants to mow down all obstacles to majority rule. And further, it wants to impose what it sees as the majority morality on those it views as the retrograde minority.
Gun owners may not continue to be gun owners. Christian cake bakers may not continue to be Christian cake bakers. Catholic nuns must play by the rules that the Times wants them to play by. The small spheres of personal freedom guaranteed by the Bill of Rights are obstacles to the supposed majority enforcing its will on the minority.
Even stipulating for the sake of argument that the Left and the Times are correct about what the majority believes, the Left and the Times are dead wrong about what the federal government ought to do.
First, the United States is founded on the idea of individual liberty, an idea the Left preaches half the time, but not when it comes to political speech, the exercise of religion, or the right to bear arms. They demand diversity of all types except diversity of opinion.
Second, the Bill of Rights is by its nature anti-majoritarian. At times, most Americans have wanted to ban blasphemy, communist ideas, or other unpopular speech. The First Amendment tells most Americans in such cases to shove it. At times, most Americans have wanted to suspend the rights of suspected terrorists or criminals. The Bill of Rights doesn’t allow the majority to have its way.
Normally, the American Left argues that minorities need protection. Now that they think they’re becoming the majority, they want to clear out obstacles to majoritarian rule.

Texto completo: Vicki Schmidt and Suzanne Lindberg remember the day Brett Kavanaugh became a Supreme Court Justice like it was yesterday.
But how the Wisconsin women remember the events leading to his confirmation a year ago are starkly different.
As President Donald Trump's nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh's confirmation was cruising for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee only to be rocked by allegations of sexual assault made by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford.
Outrage blew up across the political spectrum in the heightened climate of the #MeToo movement, protests flooded outside of the hearings and emotional testimonies were given by Ford followed by Kavanaugh, who forcefully denied any wrongdoing.
The events surrounding Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court manifested an already divided nation with protests lasting for weeks after the Senate narrowly voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh, who was sworn in as the court's 114th Justice on Oct. 6, 2018.
Schmidt of Oshkosh remembers the time as a low point for women's credibility.
"I am still unhappy with the results and feel that Kavanaugh's confirmation only reinforced the idea that women are not to be believed," Schmidt said. "It really horrifies me to a certain degree that we would be willing to treat women like that who are coming forward with those kind of stories."
Lindberg of De Pere had a vastly different viewpoint, saying it was a political smear campaign against an innocent man.
"I have never witnessed such a totally corrupt group that would have no limits on the lack of morals and decency that I observed during the hearings," Lindberg said. "Watching the needless suffering of his family (is) forever cemented in my mind."
Earlier this week, the New York Times published new information about sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh reigniting the feud about him. Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have called for his impeachment from the Supreme Court. Trump and several prominent Republicans came to Kavanaugh's defense.
The newspaper later ran an update to the story saying the alleged victim in the story said she did not recall the events described and refused to be interviewed.
The Women's March plans to hold a protest against Kavanaugh on the one year anniversary of his confirmation.
In the aftermath of Kavanaugh's confirmation, studies show public opinion of the Supreme Court dropped. The Pew Research Center found partisan views of the court have reached its widest gap in more than two decades.
An unscientific survey by The Post-Crescent and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin asked people how they feel about Kavanaugh's confirmation process a year out. It generated more than 400 responses from across the country.
The survey showed an even split between those who support Kavanaugh and those who oppose him.
Yet a majority shared concerns about the Supreme Court becoming too politicized in a heightened climate of partisan politics.
"Kavanaugh may or may not vote the way I would like him to, but that is beside the point," said Steve Hermes of Kimberly. "His confirmation destroyed forever the integrity of the process and thus, the integrity of an unbiased, honorable Supreme Court."
Battle heightened worries about high court's independence Ed Skerke of Neenah said the hearings made him change his personal political views and he's lost faith in the Republican Party for sticking by Kavanaugh.
"I would consider myself an independent with conservative leaning up until the Kavanaugh hearing," Skerke said. "I was so disgusted by what I saw during the hearing. The Republican Party will have to work very hard to get my vote."
Roger Vander Logt of Manitowoc County said despite being a Democrat, he was offended by the way Kavanaugh and his family were treated in the midst of the allegations.
"I will never, ever support people that do that to another human being and his or her family," Vander Logt said. "I'll never vote for another Democrat ever."
Ryan Owens, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said putting the court on party lines threatens its legitimacy.
"These hyper-partisan confirmation battles we have these days certainly are not good for the court (and) for peoples' perceptions of the court," Owens said.
Unlike other political institutions, the Supreme Court functions as an independent branch of government. With nine justices on the court appointed for life, it acts as the final arbiter of the law through interpretation of the Constitution.
Owens said when members of Congress and the president attack the court, it undermines its independence and that it's dangerous for presidential candidates to promise to appoint certain types of judges.
"Judging is supremely different than regular politicking and I think when our politicians dumb it down to us vs. them dynamic, that does the court a disservice and frankly, it does the rule of law in this country a disservice," Owens said.
Many women struck by Kavanaugh's confirmation In the wake of the allegations against Kavanaugh, women across the country took to social media platforms, revisiting their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, and using hashtags like #WhyIdidntreport to support Ford. Following Ford's allegations claiming the judge had sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school, two other women accused Kavanaugh of misconduct.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed nine people and found "no corroboration of the allegations" of sexual misconduct against him.
Jane Hayes of Oshkosh said she wished an investigation into Kavanaugh's past went further than it had and called his confirmation an "insult to women everywhere."
"An appointment to the Supreme Court is for life, and should be treated more seriously than this," Hayes said.
Schmidt said she felt Ford was treated unfairly in her testimony and her own personal experiences helped her empathize with her.
"Anybody that has been a victim of sexual assault at any point at their lives and I can tell you this from my personal experience as well, it never goes away. It's there with you forever," Schmidt said. "For her to be willing to come to Washington and speak in front of the Judiciary Committee, I thought she was very brave to do so and just thought she was very poorly received."
Many women also stood by Kavanaugh and worried about what the #MeToo climate could mean for their sons and husbands.
A letter in defense of Kavanaugh's character rejecting the allegations was signed by 65 women who knew him and sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee almost immediately after the first accusation came to light.
Janice Huguet of Green Bay said the debacle reminded her of Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation who was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill in 1991.
"Disgraceful on many levels," Huguet said. "The Democrats had a mob mentality to persecute for political partisanship that any parent that has a son should be frightened of."
Cynthia Koffman of Eden, who supports Kavanaugh, noted that the justice has made hiring women on his staff a priority.
"I'm even happier that he is on the court especially since he is the first ever to have an all-female staff," Koffman said.
Where the Supreme Court stands today Alongside Kavanaugh and Thomas, members of the Supreme Court include Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. It has a 5-4 conservative majority.
This year, the court struck down the Trump administration's plan to ask a citizenship question in the 2020 census and ruled that partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts can't be limited by federal courts, both of which fell along ideological lines.
Owens said Roberts acts as the median justice in the current court, but as a 5-4 conservative court, he doesn't expect it to function very differently than it did with Kennedy. Kavanaugh has also been more moderate than expected in his first year on the court.
"He's joined with the liberals in some cases, he's joined with the conservatives in others, but he hasn't pushed doctrine far to the right or anything at this point," Owens said. "A lot of folks, they get on the court their first year, they're a little bit quieter."
The structure of the court has also been talked about on the 2020 campaign trail with some Democratic candidates saying they would be open to expanding the number of justices on the court or proposing term limits on judges.
Whether the future of the court will play a role for voters in 2020, Owens thinks the election will more likely act as a referendum on Trump's presidency than on the makeup of the court.
"I'd say it's probably not going to be the key factor but we'll see what happens," he said.

Protests erupted across Washington, D.C., last year in opposition and support of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, and views have changed little a year later.

What do Trump’s Obama-era tweets on Iran tell us about his thinking?

Texto completo: During the Obama years, when most of us were paying little attention to the tweeted thoughts of civilian reality TV character Donald Trump, President Barack Obama engaged in a tense standoff with the government of Iran over Iran’s project that U.S. intelligence agencies believed was designed to acquire a nuclear weapons capability.
You probably recall this. It ended with Iran accepting limitations on its nuclear program, and pledges to cooperate with an inspections regime designed to assure compliance, in exchange for which the Obama administration and a large coalition of U.S. allies agreed to lift some sanctions on Iran to secure the deal. In my view, it was a triumph of wisdom over nationalism and ego, and a tribute to the importance of the longstanding U.S.-led coalition of allies.
Donald Trump hated and criticized the deal, and when he took over the tenancy of the Oval Office he decided not to live up to it. The other signatories have tried to keep it together. But if it falls apart, and if Iran decides to resume its pursuit of a nuclear arsenal, and if there is a war over that, it will be (in my view) because self-proclaimed master dealmaker Donald Trump doesn’t understand that, at least in this realm, a deal has to be win-win in order to work and to last. Trump is not good at win-win. He specializes in I-win-you-lose.
Trump is presumably pretty worried at present about his poll numbers heading into an election year. Although I am not predicting this, I worry that if he gets worried enough he might start a small war or two to see if that might cause the electorate to rally around him. But that’s pure conjecture, from someone who dislikes and distrusts him.
A bit of Twitter evidence
Well, maybe not pure conjecture. There’s one bit of evidence that recently came to my notice from the bowels of the historical twitterverse, suggesting that this is exactly how Donald Trump thinks about things. He assumes that any smart politician, worried about his re-election chances, would be cynical enough to start a war to rally the electorate behind him, maybe even a war with Iran over the same nuclear deal that he has done so much to undermine.
I refer to a series of tweets that most of us didn’t notice because Trump tweeted them before most of us were paying attention to what his thumbs were trying to tell us about how cynical he is. Here are four of the Trumpian tweets that inspired this piece, from the years 2011-2013. That was before, during and after the year Obama, much to Trump’s disappointment, was re-elected by a solid margin in both the popular and electoral vote, over Republican nominee (and now Trump-skeptical U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah).
I suspect there were more tweets along these lines. But here are the four upon which I happened, which set off this brief worry about what Trump might be capable of, based on what he erroneously thought Obama would be capable of).
Tweet 1: Nov. 29, 2011, a year before Obama’s re-election, Donald Trump tweeted: “In order to get elected, Barack Obama will start a war with Iran.” (He meant re-elected.)
‘Watch for him to launch a strike’
Tweet 2: Oct. 6, 2012, just a month before Election Day, Donald Trump tweeted: “Now that Obama’s numbers are in a tailspin [obviously wishful Trumpian thinking] watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.”
Tweet 3: Oct. 22, 2012, two weeks pre-election, Trump’s thumbs said: “Don’t let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected – be careful Republicans!”
(In fact, as this New York Times piece details, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu considered an attack on Iran, inspired in part by a desire to hurt Obama’s re-election chances. But, under pressure from Washington, the Israeli strike plan was dropped.)
Tweet 4: Nov. 12, 2012, with Obama re-elected but Trump the negotiating expert now predicting that Obama will do it even without any political benefit: “Remember that I predicted a long time ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly – not skilled!”
Remember, Trump considers himself the master negotiator/dealmaker. So far, his Iran/nukes deal making has resulted mostly in uniting America’s traditional allies against him to try to keep the Iran deal alive.

New York Times kills Spanish offshoot after three years

Texto completo: The New York Times has killed a Spanish-language news site after the offshoot failed to become "financially successful."
The Old Gray Lady launched its Spanish spin off in 2016 to expand its coverage and audience in Latin American countries, but the venture failed to build a sustainable subscriber base, according to a statement the Times put out Tuesday.
The project, called New York Times en Español, reported original stories in Spanish-speaking countries as well as translated about 10 news stories into Spanish each day.
"We launched NYT in Spanish as part of an experiment that expanded our coverage to different languages, in an attempt to reach and attract more international readers," the Times statement said. "Although the Spanish site attracted a considerable new audience towards our journalism, and regularly produced articles of which we are proud, it did not prove to be financially successful."
About nine positions will close along with the venture. The newspaper will continue to produce content for Spanish speakers, translating stories into Spanish that will then be posted on www.nytimes.com/es.
New York Times en Español's closure comes days after the Washington Post closed its free Washington, D.C., commuter newspaper, Washington Post Express. The Express shuttered and all staff were laid off after 16 years in operation.

Trump prepara duro derechazo para inmigrantes que enfrentan deportación

Texto completo: La Administración Trump está sopesando la posibilidad de aumentar drásticamente los precios que los migrantes pagan en las cortes para apelar sus casos de deportación o para solicitar la ayuda de un juez que reconsidere sus reclamos en los tribunales.
Los mayores afectados serían los migrantes que se encuentran detenidos por el Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE , en inglés) y los que fueron devueltos a México para esperar por la resolución de sus peticiones de asilo en tribunales estadounidenses.
Según documentos obtenidos por la web informativa BuzzFeed News, los oficiales solicitaron que los migrantes paguen $975 dólares por la apelación de un fallo de un juez de inmigración y $875 dólares para solicitar que un caso sea reabierto o reconsiderado por la Junta de Apelaciones de Inmigración.
Actualmente, el precio para ambos procesos está instituido en $110 dólares cada uno. La nueva medida podría influir sustancialmente en la manera en que los inmigrantes apelan la decisión de los jueces en los casos de deportación .
Algunos expertos también consideran que un gran número de migrantes verían reducidas sus opciones para solicitar protección o un estatus legal.
“Están esencialmente privando a las personas del derecho a apelar, eso es mucho dinero. Es un aumento sustancial de las tarifas que está fuera del alcance de las personas “, explicó la ex jueza de inmigración en San Francisco, Rebecca Jamil.
De acuerdo con BuzzFeed News, el Departamento de Justicia no quiso hacer comentarios al respecto, pero varios oficiales señalaron que los costos de los procesos no habían aumentado desde 1986 y que, si lo hacían era, se debía a un abarrotamiento en las cortes del país.
“La administración no ha puesto énfasis en el debido proceso de los inmigrantes: estas tarifas parecen estar a la luz de ese patrón. Creo absolutamente que esto disuadirá a las personas de tomar decisiones atractivas, incluso si son injustas “, señaló Sarah Pierce, analista de políticas del Instituto de Política Migratoria.
Bajo la actual administración de Donald Trump, los casos de apelación se incrementaron hasta 30,000 durante el año fiscal 2018 .
Un artículo de The New York Times reveló que en el mes de las cortes de inmigración tenían más de 800,000 casos pendientes, lo que significaba que se necesitaba un promedio de 700 días para procesar cada uno de ellos.
Si se aprueba, la medida no se haría efectiva de inmediato, puesto que las regulaciones requieren de un periodo de discusión de 60 días.

Texto completo: An upstate New York town judge resigned after he shared a racially charged Facebook post that featured a noose and President Donald Trump's campaign slogan "Make America Great Again. "
The New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct announced Tuesday that Altona Town Court Justice Kyle R. Canning resigned from the $8,700-a-year-job June 27.
A formal written complaint from the commission said Canning appeared "to convey racial and/or political bias" and "failed to act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. "
The text on the posted image read in large capitalized letters: "IF WE WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE EVIL PEOPLE FEAR PUNISHMENT AGAIN. "
Commission administrator Robert H. Tembeckjian issued a statement saying it undermined the judiciary's integrity, along with public confidence in the courts, for a judge to use "the image of the noose in making a political point. "
Controversy in comedy: 'SNL' fires Shane Gillis over racist comments, four days after hiring him
"The noose is an incendiary image with repugnant racial connotations," he said in the statement. "It is the very antithesis of law and justice. "
In an interview with the New York Times, Canning described himself as a registered Democrat and said he did not consider the post's racial symbolism.
"There is not a man that I could despise more than Donald Trump," said Canning.
He added that his Facebook post was meant to convey his stance on the death penalty and capital punishment, of which he's in favor.
It didn't need to have been a noose, Canning told the newspaper.
"It could have been a gas chamber," he said. "It could have been an electric chair. "
Canning, who is not an attorney, agreed never to hold judicial office again. He had been a justice in the town located near the Canadian border since 2018.
It's not required to be attorney to take the bench, according to the Justice Court Manual, however interested parties must undergo some training in introductory law, which is provided by the OCA's Office of Justice Court Support.
Andrew Yang steps in, plans to sit down with Shane Gillis after the comedian was fired from 'SNL'
The Times reports that Canning delivered bread for a living.
In his resignation letter, Canning said he felt coerced into resigning due to his financial situation and family obligations.
He acknowledged the complaint from the commission and wrote "they have presented me with several different options in resolving what they claim to be a serious offense. "

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Another outside political group is spending six figures on television ads in Maine, this time supporting incumbent Republican Sen. Susan Collins as she faces what could be her toughest reelection battle.
A financial disclosure report filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission shows that a group called 1820 PAC spent $276,780 on "media placement" in support of Collins. That is roughly one-third of the money that 1820 PAC - presumably named for the year Maine attained statehood - has collected from a handful of wealthy donors around the country, with $500,000 alone coming from New York billionaire Stephen Schwarzman.
1820 PAC is just the latest in a likely blizzard of outside or independent groups - many funded with "dark money" from unnamed donors - as well as out-of-state donors, who will try to sway Maine voters headed into the 2020 elections. Federal law prohibits independent groups from coordinating with candidates. But 1820 PAC's entire website is devoted to supporting Collins - who has yet to officially announce her reelection bid - and a 30-second ad posted on YouTube talks about her bipartisan ratings and work on issues important to the elderly, veterans and Maine's defense industry.
"Susan Collins: Effective. Independent. In the Maine tradition," says the ad, which uses stock footage of Collins made available by her office several months ago.
The six-figure, pro-Collins media blitz comes at a time when opponents of Collins are seizing on a new sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to remind Maine voters about her pivotal vote to support his nomination. The vote prompted several progressive groups to raise more than $4 million for an as-yet-undetermined Democratic opponent in 2020. But Collins also experienced a massive surge in donations to her would-be campaign after the Kavanaugh vote.
Collins' opponents are trying to chip away at her reputation as a moderate Republican by tying her to President Trump - who is unpopular with independents and moderates who have supported her in the past - and to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
"At the time of his confirmation, there was plenty of evidence that put into question Brett Kavanaugh's fitness for the Supreme Court," Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon, a Democrat who is running for Collins' seat, said in a tweet on Tuesday. "Senator Collins cast a critical vote to confirm him anyway, and she said she doesn't regret it. It's time for a senator who puts Mainers first."
Collins' supporters and Republicans have been highly critical of Gideon's out-of-state fundraising - even as Collins courts non-Maine donors as well - and of several other organizations that have not disclosed their donors. One of those "dark money" organizations, the 16 Counties Coalition, was set up as a nonprofit to pressure Collins on issues important to moderates and is staffed by several longtime Democratic operatives, including a recent spokesman for Gideon.
A spokesman for the Maine Democratic Party, in turn, seized on 1820 PAC's spending as a suggestion that Collins' supporters are worried.
"We're 14 months out from election day and the 22-year senior senator's numbers have cratered so much that six-figure positive ads are coming out to prop her up," party spokesman Alex Stack said.
Collins' campaign spokesman, Kevin Kelley, pointed to an AARP poll over the summer showing the senator leading Gideon by 17 percentage points in a head-to-head matchup, although several independents are also hoping to be on the November ballot.
"A dark money group operated by Sara Gideon's former staffer has already spent more than $1 million attacking Senator Collins' record, and yet they refuse to tell anyone who is funding them," Kelley said. "What are they hiding?"
Spending on Maine's Senate race is widely expected to set new records for the state. Five people have filed paperwork with the FEC to seek the Democratic nomination: Gideon of Freeport, progressive advocate and lobbyist Betsy Sweet of Hallowell, attorney Bre Kidman of Saco, retired Air Force major general Jonathan "Tracer" Treacy of Oxford and Michael Bunker of Bangor.
1820 PAC formed in March and lists a Washington, D.C., post office box as its address, which is common for political action committees and super PACs. The treasurer of the organization, Thomas Datwyler, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Financial reports filed by the PAC show that seven individuals or entities donated $776,000 to 1820 PAC.
The largest donor, by far, was Schwarzman, a close Trump ally who serves as CEO and co-founder of the private equity firm Blackstone Group. The campaign finance watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, said the $12.9 million donated by Schwarzman and his wife, Christine, during the 2018 election cycle ranked him ninth overall among individual political donors. All of that money flowed to Republican or conservative candidates and organizations.
Schwarzman's Blackstone Group also owns one of the health care organizations that has bankrolled a national ad campaign seeking to pressure members of Congress, including Collins, on legislation dealing with unexpected medical bills. The political action group Doctor Patient Unity reportedly reserved more than six-figures worth of airtime in Maine - part of a national ad campaign that The New York Times recently pegged at $28 million - for ads that tell listeners to "ask Senator Collins to protect patients."
Blackstone Group owns TeamHealth, an organization that owns physician practices and helps staff emergency rooms. The company and another private equity-backed physicians' practice group is fighting to defeat legislation that aims to end so-called "surprise billing," which is when patients receive unexpected invoices from doctors or ER facilities that do not participate in their insurance coverage, The New York Times reported.

CULTURE MONSTER; A second shot; Bill Irwin channels Samuel Beckett, an idol he once met, in a show at the Kirk Douglas Theatre

Texto completo: Samuel Beckett is widely revered as the master playwright of the theater of the absurd, as well as a fearless chronicler of the human condition. Bill Irwin adds another accolade: Author of some of the best stage directions ever.
"Take this one from 'Waiting for Godot': 'They stand motionless, arms dangling, heads sunk, sagging at the knees,'" the veteran performer said with childlike enthusiasm.
Indeed, the sentence is quintessential Beckett: Highly specific, and yet ambiguous in terms of its effect. It's up to the performer, and the audience, as to whether the resulting stage image is depressing, amusing or both.

Irwin is an acclaimed dramatic actor (he won a Tony Award for "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") and an astonishingly agile physical comedian. Irwin has been haunted by Beckett's writing for most of his adult life. Over the years, he has performed in two high-profile New York productions of "Godot" -- one featuring Steve Martin and Robin Williams, and another opposite Nathan Lane.
Nearing his 70th birthday, Irwin has channeled his obsession into the one-man show "On Beckett," which began previews Friday and opens Wednesday at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City. "It grew out of a nagging impulse," he said. "I analogize it to a pearl -- an irritant that becomes a beautiful gem -- although I won't make that claim for it!"
No need; others have remarked on its illuminating polish. The New York Times called it "a reminder of a crucial paradox of great art, in which precise craft becomes a vehicle for profound mystery." Lane put it more simply: "He's so brilliant in the show. His fascination with Beckett is infectious."
That intense interest was piqued just a few miles from the venue he'll be performing in -- at UCLA, where the Santa Monica native began his college education. (He went on to CalArts, which he attended the year it opened, and ultimately Oberlin College, where he earned his degree in theater.) He recalls coming across Beckett's "Act Without Words" in a literary anthology -- a dialogue-free one-act play that consists entirely of stage directions.
At CalArts, he had the good fortune of studying with Ruby Cohn, who was a friend of Beckett's and a scholar of his work. In those days, Irwin said ruefully, his attitude toward the playwright's work was one of youthful arrogance.
"I remember looking at 'Godot' and thinking, 'You could save this,' " he recalled.
His attitude had shifted enormously by the 1980s, when director Joseph Chaikin, another Beckett collaborator, invited him to perform the prose pieces "Texts for Nothing." "Ever since then, I have not been able to get that language out of my head," Irwin said. "Other things I memorize are gone as soon as I don't need them anymore. This stuff has stayed with me to an amazing degree.
"I asked myself, 'Why is that?' Well, theater people have a coping mechanism. We take something we're trying to work through and make a theater piece out of it."
That process began roughly three years ago, when Irwin brought the idea to Carey Perloff, then the longtime artistic director of San Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre. "She gave me a space to work in, and some students to work with," he said. He premiered the show in San Francisco in 2017 but continued to refine it in subsequent stagings, including an off-Broadway run in 2018. It reached its more or less final form -- he is still tinkering with certain sections -- at the Irish Repertory Theatre in New York last year.
"It's as much about Bill as it is about Beckett," Lane said.
Indeed, between readings from the plays and various prose works -- and inevitable forays into baggy-pants comedy -- Irwin discusses his journey through the writing, delving into the intricacies of Beckett's language, which somehow manages to be simultaneously precise and ambiguous. "It's a very particular voice," he said. "His pronouns are very slippery."
Irwin finds Beckett's remarkable use of language something of a balm at a time when the use of words has grown so imprecise. "Our culture runs away from words," he bemoaned. "It seems to me one of the things this language can do is help us reconnect with human intelligence, as distinct from artificial intelligence. A lot of Beckett's language is a portrait of consciousness -- of how the mind works."
Irwin met Beckett once, in 1988, and feels he squandered that encounter.
"He was so shy, and I was so shy, we both looked at the Formica table more than each other," Irwin said. "If I knew then what I know now, I would have asked him so many questions!"
Instead, they remained in his brain, ultimately taking the shape of a one-man show. "In part, that's what 'On Beckett' is," he said. "A do-over."

The Autoworkers' Strike Is Bigger Than G.M.

Texto completo: Successful strikes beget more strikes. When nearly 50,000 General Motors workers walked out at 11:59 p.m. Sunday, it was just the latest in the largest burst of strikes in decades. Last year's victorious teachers' strike in West Virginia was the initial spark, helping inspire statewide walkouts in Oklahoma and Arizona as well as strikes in Kentucky, Colorado and Los Angeles.
The G.M. strikers could taste labor's newfound successes and momentum.
The teachers' unions felt unusually robust public support, as parents and students marched with them. Union leaders and union members felt a new boldness from the surge of good will. This helped inspire a strike last fall by 7,700 Marriott workers in eight cities, and those workers trumpeted a message that resonated far beyond their industry: that their pay increases were not nearly keeping up with soaring housing costs, so they could not survive on one job.
The hotel workers' success in turn helped inspire the strike by 30,000 Stop & Shop workers in New England in April. Union leaders there were surprised by the deep community support the grocery workers received -- supermarket cashiers have never been as beloved as public-school teachers. Politicians stepped up, too. Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren marched alongside them. The G.M. strikers are no doubt counting on similar political backing.
The strong public opinion behind these strikes can be tied to Americans' widespread dismay with wage stagnation and income inequality, even as corporate profits are flying high. While job numbers and economic growth are strong, many American are barely getting by: 40 percent of households say they don't have the money to pay an unanticipated $ 400 expense, according to a recent report from the Federal Reserve Board.
All this might help explain why a recent Gallup poll found that public approval for unions has climbed to 64 percent, up from 48 percent a decade ago and near its highest level in 50 years. An M.I.T. study last year found that nearly 50 percent of nonunion workers say they would vote to join a union if they could, up from 32 percent in 1995.
From the moment the G.M. walkout started, union leaders said the strike was bigger than just G.M. "Today, we stand strong and say with one voice, we are standing up for our members and for the fundamental rights of working-class people in this nation," Terry Dittes, a United Automobile Workers vice president, said. The autoworkers are taking a page from the teachers, who made it clear that they were striking not just because they were tired of pay freezes but also to help their students, by increasing education budgets, reducing class sizes and replacing obsolete textbooks.
With many Americans angry about factories moving overseas, the autoworkers union also wants G.M. to reopen its giant plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The company closed the plant because demand for Chevy Cruzes had declined, even as it has kept open its plant in Mexico that makes the same car. And with many workers upset about the increased instability and precariousness of their jobs, the union is also pressing G.M. to stop using so many temps -- they represent 7 percent of the company's work force and make just $ 15 an hour.
Donald Trump won the 2016 election partly because many workers thought the system was rigged against them. That sentiment is also fueling the G.M. strike. The company had $ 8.1 billion in profits worldwide last year and $ 35 billion in North America over the last three years, so workers are resentful that the company nonetheless wants to close plants -- especially when union members made major concessions, like creating a two-tier wage structure at some plants, to help lift the company out of bankruptcy.
But General Motors insists that it has already made a generous offer, saying it offered to add 5,400 jobs and make more than $ 7 billion in new investments in plants in the United States. "We have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency," G.M. said. "Our goal remains to build a strong future for our employees and our business."
G. M. strikes have often been signal events in American history. The 1936-37 Flint sit-down strike by 2,000 workers led to the unionization of General Motors, then the world's largest automaker, and in turn spurred a wave of mass unionization across the country. The 113-day strike by 175,000 G.M. workers in 1945-46 led to an agreement, known as the Treaty of Detroit, that provided breakthroughs on wages, health coverage and pensions, and became a model for other unions and corporations. In 1970, when the U.A.W. was near its peak membership, 400,000 of its members went on strike for two months against G.M., which was still one of the world's largest companies. The union emerged victorious, winning a significant pay increase.
Both G.M. and the autoworkers union are diminished. G.M. is about half the size of Volkswagen, and the union has shrunk from a peak of 1.5 million members to just over 430,000.
But with so many workers feeling unfairly squeezed by their employers, and labor leaders emboldened by recent successes, more strikes look likely.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - The first day of rehearsal on Broadway usually goes like this: Circle up. Make introductions. Offer thanks, express optimism, maybe crack a joke. Clear the room of onlookers, and off you go.
But Robert O'Hara had a more pointed agenda in mind when he found himself in a ring of 75 actors and designers and producers one midsummer morning, in a studio lined by a wheelbarrow, a four-poster bed, and refreshments labeled "dildo cornbread" and "nuts cake."
O'Hara is the director of "Slave Play," Jeremy O. Harris' raunchy, riveting and risky new work, whose many provocations begin with its double-entendre title. O'Hara, like Harris and many members of the cast and crew, is black. So with just four weeks to go until the first preview, he ignored the naughtily named snacks and invoked his forebears.
"For many years of my life, I've had random white people come to me and ask me about where my last name came from, and I would just look them in the face and say, very politely: 'Slavery'," O'Hara told the rapt gathering at New 42nd Street Studios, quieting the lingering chitchat. "I just want us all to be mindful that it's because of what our ancestors endured - and survived, and abolished - that we have the audacity to be in this room."
Upping the ante, he turned to the show's producers, most of whom are white, and threw down a challenge. "I want you to be mindful of the responsibility that you have, to put the marquee with the name 'Slave' on it in Times Square," he said. "And I would ask you, with every decision that you make, are you upholding the legacy of that name?"
Broadway is a perilous place: Even amid an overall boom, most shows fail financially. But "Slave Play," which is costing up to S3.9 million to capitalize, is chancy in new ways.
Arriving 400 years after American slavery began, the play, often funny and pervasively unsettling, examines that lingering wound through the frustrated sex lives, and raboo sexual fantasies, of three contemporary interracial couples.
Set on the grounds of a Virginia plantation, its racially charged sex talk and simulated cominance and sub-mission are potentially so triggering that a pre-Broad-way production supplied post-show lobby counselors. An internet-based backlash, seemingly fueled by people who had not seen the play, was threatening enough to require stepped-up security, and online vitriol directed at the Broadway production prompted the show's social media team to disable Face-book and Instagram comments
The eight-week cif-Broadway run at New York Theater Workshop was hailed by numerous critics - in The New York Times, Jesse Green called it "will-fully provocative, gaudily transgressive and altogether staggering," while Wesley Morris deemed it "the single most daring thing I've seen in a theater it a long time."
Among those packing into the 199-seat East Village theater to find out what the fuss was about: Madonna, Whoopi Goldberg, Scarlett Johansson and Stephen Sondheim.
The Broadway production is in previews and is scheduled to run for 17 weeks at the 800-seat John Golden Theater. The producers - a team that includes actor Jake Gyllenhaal, music manager Troy Carter and documentarian Abigail Disney (a great-niece of Walt) - need to harness the enthusiasm and, yes, the edginess as they seek to persuade ricket buyers that they will miss out if they don't catch 'Slave Play."
"This is going to burn fast and bright and hot," predicted Greg Nobile, the 27-year-old lead producer. "If you want to be part of the cultural conversation, you must see it."
Many of the participants still can't quite believe this play, on Broadway, is happening.
"Absolutely, I'm amazed," said Joaquina Kalukango, the actress playing Kaneisha, a black woman from the American South married to a white man from Britain. "They really said yes to this?"
Courting curiosity, not controversy
Solange's "Almeda" streamed over a laptop in a capacious photo studio in Koreatown. There were hair people and makeup people and a tailor at a sewing machine; a stylist and a publicist and ad reps and talent managers and who knows how many assistants, one of whom spent the morning steaming racks of clothing that might never be worn.
It was the day of Kalukango's portrait shoot, and a lot was at stake.
Online objections to the off-Broadway run had been set off, at least in part, by a photograph in The New York Times, showing Kaneisha, dressed like a slave, twerking for her husband, costumed as an overseer. A hashtag was born - #Shut-DownSlavePlay - as well as an online petition, objecting to the play as degrading black women and dishonoring enslaved people.
The criticism, as happens these days, got ugly. Some of it alluded to Harris' sexuality - he describes himself as queer - and some featured "homophobia, anti-Semitism and threats of violence," according to Jeremy Blocker, the managing director of New York Theater Workshop. The nonprofit called the police, beefed up security and offered car service home for those feeling unsafe.
Cast members, although not surprised that the play was not to everyone's liking, were troubled by the hostility. "I hope that people will have an eye toward the complexity of Blackness, and that Blackness is not monolithic," said Ato Blankson-Wood, a Black actor who portrays one half of a gay couple. "Why can't we just make space for all these experiences?"
But word-of-mouth was excellent, the production was sold out, and the show has another run. This time, the creative team is determined to control the visuals.
Press photographers are being barred from shooting sex, nudity or the scene in which Kaneisha wears slave garb. "We want to be extraordinarily careful about howwe use the images of the play," Nobile said. "In the current state of the world, it's very easy for things to be pulled out of context."
So there Kalukango was in that photo studio, perched on a stool, wearing an oversized dress shirt cinched by a vintage corset, and displaying the fleshy interior of a halved cantaloupe. Behind the camera: Deun Ivory, a photographer hired by the production who said, "My goal is to visually document all the things that make black women powerful and beautiful."
The shirt, said stylist Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, "speaks to the way that strength in black women is often mischaracterized as 'masculinity,'" and the corset represents sexual freedom but also bondage. The melon, a prop in the show, adds mystery.
"So much of our campaign is about generating curiosity," said Steven Tartick, the executive creative director at the play's marketing agency, RPM. "What we need people to do is to want to learn more."
Kalukango got the role after her friend Teyonah Parris, who played Kaneisha downtown and weathered much of the animus, decided not to join the Broadway production. (Paul Alexander Nolan has remained in the cast as the character's husband.)
Parris' publicist, citing her filming schedule - she is starring in Jordan Peele's "Candyman" - said she would not be available to speak for this story. But she has supported Kalukango, who said she decided to audition after being "shocked and excited" by the script, and after Parris "gave me the green light."
Kalukango was warned about likely blowback. "I told her that they will come for us, and they will come hard, and several of them will look like us," O'Harasaid.
But she said she believes that her character - twerking and all - is honored by the play. "She's on a journey to own her sexuality, while dealing with the traumas of her past, and she's very much navigating what it's like to be a dark-skinned black woman in this society," she said. "It's really empowering."
Her photo has become the heart of the show's "key art," featured on websites and posters, as the producers and their marketing team seek to make clear that "Slave Play," despite a title that might suggest a period piece, is character driven, contemporary - and centered on a strong woman.
"I'm taking back the narrative of what this play is," Kalukango said. "You think you know, but you have no idea."
A student provocateur
"Slave Play" was conceived at a party.
Harris, then an aspiring playwright in his late 20s who was about to start graduate school, was listening to a fellow reveler describe a kink-fueled sexual encounter. Ever the provocateur, Harris asked whether the man, who was white, would have felt as comfortable making party chatter about his experimentation if the woman he had been having sex with was Black.
Squirming partygoers tried to change the subject. Harris decided to turn it into a play.
"I wanted to make a play that is difficult for an audience to dismiss," he said. He noted that, during his childhood in Martinsville, Virginia, he routinely saw Confederate flags and visited plantations on school trips.
"I'm from a place where I saw the ruins of chattel slave trade everywhere around me," he said. "Its presence is part of my present all the time."
He wrote the intermissionless three-act work while in his first year at the Yale School of Drama, and from the beginning it was both successful and shocking (he asked for an intimacy director to safeguard the performers during sex scenes). New York Theater Workshop, the birthplace of "Rent," asked to stage a production and sent O'Hara the script.
"I remember reading the first act and going, 'This play is crazy - why are they always sending me the crazy plays?'" recalled O'Hara, himself the writer of scabrous, boundary-pushing plays about race and sexuality. "And then I read the second act and became very excited."
Even before the downtown production began, the play attracted interest from commercial producers - albeit theatrical adventurers with limited Broadway experience and a hunger to highlight new voices.
Nobile and his producing partner, Jana Shea, read the script, raised $150,000 to support the off-Broadway run, and with that obtained the commercial rights.
The two are an unusual pair - he is a college dropout who runs a seasonal tiki bar in coastal Branford, Connecticut, and she is a resident of the same town and the mother of one of his childhood friends. Their company, Seaview Productions (named after a street in their hometown) has invested in multiple productions; here they have top billing.
So what will it take for "Slave Play" to succeed?
In financial terms, it needs to gross at least 60% of its potential to make a profit, and Nobile is determined to do just that.
But for many of the participants, profit is only one metric.
Carter argued that the play has already made a difference by boosting the careers of the artists involved, many of whom are working on Broadway for the first time. Harris said he wants to spark conversation. "This play will be successful if it becomes something that people talk about outside of the space of theater," he said.
As for O'Hara, the director, he said there are many ways to measure achievement.
"In a marketplace with 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King' and 'Ain't Too Proud,' I don't know what success looks like," he said. "Is it that you made it here and you opened? Is it lasting all 17 weeks? To me it is a success because there is a group of people who have asked us to do it again, and more people can see it and form their own opinions. It's already a success."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House Oversight and Reform Committee asked Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Monday to turn over documents related to communication with her family's shipping company as the panel stepped up an investigation into whether any actions taken by Ms. Chao amount to a conflict of interest.
The request by the committee in the Democrat-controlled House relates to actions Ms. Chao has taken that potentially benefited Foremost Group, a New York-based shipping company owned by her family. Foremost has received hundreds of millions of dollars in loan commitments from a bank run by the Chinese government to help build ships that Foremost has purchased from government-owned shipyards there.
The actions by Ms. Chao -- including joint public appearances since she became transportation secretary in 2017 with her father, James Chao, who founded the company, and a planned trip to China to meet with government officials there along with her father -- have led House investigators to question if she is using her office to try to benefit her family's financial interests.
"Federal regulations prohibit federal employees from using their public offices for the 'private gain"' of friends or relatives, said the letter sent on Monday to Ms. Chao by the House investigators, who cited articles that appeared in The New York Times in June and Politico in 2018 that detailed continued ties between Ms. Chao and her family's company. "Several reports indicate that you have used your official position to benefit Foremost Group, a shipping company owned by your father and sisters that is headquartered in New York and operates a fleet that transports materials to and from China."
The Times investigation found numerous instances in which Ms. Chao, as transportation secretary, may have boosted Foremost's image. In addition to inviting her father to the department in 2017, she also appeared at a signing ceremony that August at the Harvard Club in New York involving Foremost and the Sumitomo Group, a Japanese company with mass transit projects in the United States that fell under her oversight.
The letter to Ms. Chao cites moves by the department to cut specific grant programs intended to help support the United States maritime industry. They include cuts proposed, but rejected by Congress, in 2017 and 2018 for the Maritime Security Program, which subsidizes American-flagged cargo ships so they are available, when necessary, to help the Pentagon move supplies to war zones. Cutting those grants could have undermined the American maritime industry at the same time her family's company was receiving support from the Chinese maritime industry.
The committee also asked Ms. Chao about her failure in 2018 to sell off her holdings in Vulcan Materials Company, a manufacturer of road construction materials, despite a promise to do so in an ethics agreement that Ms. Chao signed in early 2017 before her confirmation as transportation secretary.
The letter is signed by Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the committee's chairman, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, who is the chairman of the panel's economic and consumer policy subcommittee.
The Transportation Department, in a statement on Monday, said it intended to respond to the request from House investigators, but suggested that the allegations of any conflict of interest were unjustified.
The agency also pointed out that while it did advocate cuts to certain maritime grant programs, overall it has increased maritime spending, particularly on ships used by maritime academies.
"We look forward to responding to the committee's request," the statement said. "Media attacks targeting the secretary's family are stale and only attempt to undermine her long career of public service."
The agency has also said that Ms. Chao's failure to sell the Vulcan stock was an oversight that occurred when the company paid her out on stock options she earned while serving on the Vulcan board by issuing her shares of stock in the company instead of paying her cash. Ms. Chao subsequently sold the Vulcan stock, after it was reported, at first by The Wall Street Journal, that she still had financial ties to the company, even while she helps oversee federal highway building efforts.
The department said in a statement on Monday that the stock Ms. Chao held in Vulcan did not create a conflict of interest and that Ms. Chao's "decision to divest entirely demonstrates her commitment to going above and beyond what is required in terms of compliance."
Ms. Chao's family wealth has also benefited her husband, Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is the Senate majority leader. In 2008, the couple received a gift from Ms. Chao's father valued between $ 5 million and $ 25 million, according to federal disclosures.
The House Oversight Committee sent Ms. Chao 18 different document and information requests related to the two matters, including requests for copies of any communication since January 2017 between Ms. Chao or any employee at the Transportation Department with her father or her sister Angela Chao, who is now the chief executive of Foremost.
The committee also asked for copies by the end of this month of all documents related to a trip that Ms. Chao planned to take to China in October 2017. The trip was canceled after State Department officials raised ethics concerns about her plan to include members of her family in meetings with Chinese government officials, as was reported in June by The Times.
House investigators have sent out many letters like this since Democrats took control in 2019, requests that in many cases the Trump administration has resisted, leading to subpoenas, and growing friction between the House Democrats and the administration.
A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee said this request to Ms. Chao was the "initial inquiry to Secretary Chao about these specific issues," suggesting that this is not a matter that the committee has already spent a large amount of time investigating.

Ayanna Pressley to submit resolution calling for an impeachment inquiry of Brett Kavanaugh

Texto completo: US Representative Ayanna Pressley plans to introduce a House resolution Tuesday calling for an impeachment inquiry of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in the wake of a New York Times story that detailed an allegation of sexual impropriety when he was in college.
Kavanaugh was confirmed last October after emotional hearings in the Senate over a sexual assault allegation from his high school years. During those hearings, Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychologist, told a Senate committee that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Over the weekend, a Times piece reported that Kavanaugh faced a separate allegation from his time at Yale University and that the FBI did not investigate the claim, which mirrors one offered during his confirmation process by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate who claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party.
In an editor's note after initial publication, the Times said the book on which the report was based noted that "the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident."
Kavanaugh has denied all allegations of impropriety.
Now, Pressley, a Massachusetts Democrat, plans to introduce a proposal that would allow a committee to take affidavits and depositions and issue subpoenas in connection with an impeachment inquiry of Kavanaugh.
“I believe Christine Blasey Ford," said Pressley in a Monday statement. “I believe Deborah Ramirez. It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors."
She continued, “Sexual predators do not deserve a seat on the nation's highest court and Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process set a dangerous precedent. We must demand justice for survivors and hold Kavanaugh accountable for his actions."
Pressley, a former Boston city councilor, spoke at an anti-Kavanaugh rally last fall, and penned a Globe op-ed saying Kavanaugh's confirmation process “has been plagued by a lack of transparency."
Pressley's Monday comments came after some Democratic presidential candidates called for Kavanaugh's impeachment in recent days.
Some calling for his impeachment, like Senator Kamala Harris, speculated that he lied under oath during the confirmation process.
“Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people," she said.
Julian Castro, a former US housing secretary, said in a Saturday tweet, "It's more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter."
Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a Sunday tweet that “Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him."
She continued, “Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."
On Twitter Sunday, President Trump defended Kavanaugh, saying the judge is the “one who is actually being assaulted."
“The lies being told about him are unbelievable," said the president in a tweet. “False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!"
Earlier this summer, prominent author and advice columnist E. Jean Carrollaccused Trump of sexual assault during the 1990s. The White House denied the claim.

Texto completo: What do three of the Democratic presidential candidates all have in common? They were all once fervent supporters of school choice.
Elizabeth Warren wrote a detailed section in a book about the promise and benefits of school vouchers, especially for those in struggling schools. Joe Biden spoke movingly on the Senate floor about the life-saving impact school choice could have on children living in the inner-city. Cory Booker was even on the board of the largest school choice organizations in the country alongside now-Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.
Now that they’re all running for president, these candidates have flip-flopped on the issue while they attack DeVos, an ardent supporter of educational options for low-income families. These candidates are doing this at the behest of teachers' unions while turning their backs on their own Democratic constituents who support educational choice.
New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote a piece this month titled, "When Elizabeth Warren Agreed With Betsy DeVos," where he quoted passages from Warren's 2003 book, The Two-Income Trap. Warren wrote, “Fully funded vouchers would relieve parents from the terrible choice of leaving their kids in lousy schools or bankrupting themselves to escape those schools."
Brooks concluded, "This is exactly the argument that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos uses to support school choice." At the time, Warren was a professor at Harvard, a private university which accepts students on federal voucher programs like Pell Grants and the G.I. Bill.
As the Washington Post reported in June 2019, then-Sen. Biden said in 1997, "When you have an area of the country — and most often here we are talking about inner cities — where the public schools are abysmal or dysfunctional or not working and where most of the children have no way out, it is legitimate to ask what would happen to the public schools with increased competition from private schools,” he said. “Is it not possible that giving poor kids a way out will force the public schools to improve and result in more people coming back?”
Biden, who grew up attending private Catholic schools, recently attacked DeVos.
Tweet
Booker served on the board of my employer's predecessor organization, the Alliance for School Choice, from 2003-2007. He was a keynote speaker at our annual summit in 2012, and in 2016 as a senator. This was just a few months before his friend and former fellow board member, Betsy DeVos, was nominated to be secretary of Education.
Booker was in Iowa earlier this year attacking state leaders who expanded the successful school choice tax credit scholarship program — a program signed into law by then-Gov. Tom Vilsack (a Democrat) — as just a Republican “scheme” that offends him.
Curiously, Booker was a vocal supporter of the same type of tax credit scholarship "scheme" proposed in New Jersey while he was mayor of Newark.
Booker's parents were IBM executives and he spoke often about how they bought a house in a school district that better served his needs. Booker wanted the same educational opportunities for all kids, which is why he served on the Alliance for School Choice board with DeVos to support these options for children in lower-income families. Now he avoids questions about this service including at a CNN town hall earlier this year.
So why did these three Democrats flip-flop on school choice? Did DeVos or President Trump shift the headwinds against school choice? Just the opposite. According to polling from Harvard’s Education Next, support for school vouchers and tax-credit scholarships is up 10 percentage points and 12 percentage points since 2016.
According to the poll, Hispanics and African Americans register the highest levels of support for school choice. Vouchers for low-income families gets 66% support from African Americans and 69% support from Hispanics.
This further demonstrates the schism within the Democratic party on this issue, as this newfound opposition to private school choice and even public charter schools is top-heavy in the party. There are many courageous Democrats across the country who stand with their constituents and against the will of the teachers' unions. Dozens of Democratic state legislators are supporting expanded educational options for families and children.
As more teachers are choosing to flee unions after the Janus Supreme Court ruling, Democrats running for president should stand with their constituents in support of school choice, the civil rights issue of our time, rather than be beholden to teachers’ unions.

Texto completo: President Trump called for the resignations of everyone involved in the New York Times story about a previously unknown allegation of sexual misconduct by Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
"I call for the Resignation of everybody at The New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh SMEAR story," Trump tweeted Monday, "and while you’re at it, the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, which is just as phony! They’ve taken the Old Grey Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation. She can never recover, and will never return to Greatness, under current Management."
Tweet
The Times ran a preview of a book about the allegations against Kavanaugh on Saturday. In their initial story, Max Stier, a Yale University classmate, claimed he witnessed Kavanaugh make inappropriate sexual contact with a female student. Stier said he informed the FBI, but they did not investigate it.
The Times later added an editor's note saying they "did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident."
The initial story resulted in many Democratic presidential candidates to call for Kavanaugh's impeachment from the nation's highest court.

'Oopsies': New York Times excoriated for omitting bombshell Kavanaugh details

Texto completo: The New York Times has been excoriated after publishing new allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh only to later add a bombshell update that undercuts the entire piece.
The Saturday evening report was adapted from an upcoming book by reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly titled The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, due out this week.
Their report details an alleged incident that occurred during Kavanaugh's time at Yale University. One of his classmates, Max Stier, said he witnessed Kavanaugh make inappropriate sexual contact with a female student.
In the updated version of the article, the following passage was added, "The female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode."
"An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article," it continued.
The update, which many viewed as evidence that exonerates Kavanaugh, caused significant blowback for the outlet.
Kavanaugh faced similar allegations during the lead up to his confirmation to the Supreme Court. Three separate allegations became public during that time period. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982, testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as did Kavanaugh.TweetTweetTweetTweetTweetTweetTweetTweetTweet

Democrats will regret their latest Brett Kavanaugh smear

Texto completo: When the New York Times published a book excerpt this weekend from The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, the Left went bonkers reenacting the confirmation battle of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The article, though focused on Deborah Ramirez’s uncorroborated claim that while undergraduates at Yale, Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her, added a new charge: “A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hands of a female student.”
The story prompted at least five Democratic presidential candidates to demand Kavanaugh's impeachment, including Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.TweetTweetSince the story broke, the media and left-leaning politicians have been caught up in a self-congratulatory smirk-fest over the relitigation of the the Kavanaugh controversy. But, for several reasons, the Left will likely rue the day the New York Times published the hit piece on Kavanaugh.
First, the article omitted several facts relevant to the new charge against Kavanaugh. While the writers identified then-Yale student Max Stier as the witness to Kavanaugh’s supposed misconduct, they failed to mention that Stier had previously butted heads with Kavanaugh when he served on Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr’s team, with Stier representing Bill Clinton during the impeachment proceedings.
Even more damning to Stier’s claim are the additional details included in the book but (initially) excluded from the Times article. "The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident," reads an Editor's Note from the Times, added after conservative media exposed the omission.
By omitting these facts initially and then being forced to correct the record, the Times has lost much of its credibility, especially on the Kavanaugh controversy. The Times just reminded the country how shaky its reporting is as the country prepares for the 2020 election.
The hit piece on Kavanaugh has also served to remind Republicans of what the Left put the man and his family through during the confirmation hearings. That righteous indignation propelled conservatives to the polls in the 2018 midterm elections, helping Republicans to make gains in the Senate.
The Senate results established that voting against Kavanaugh was a losing proposition, as many red-state Democratic senators who voted against Kavanaugh’s confirmation lost reelection. The losers included Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Bill Nelson of Florida, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. Riling up the Republican base when we are just a year out from the 2020 presidential election does not seem like the brightest strategy.
Not only are the Left’s renewed attacks on Kavanaugh angering the Right and likely boosting turnout next November, they are quieting internal conservative squabbling. The schism on the Republican side between the MAGA and Never Trump folks seemed near-absolute, except when it came to Kavanaugh. A united Republican Party cannot be defeated.
The continuous flogging of Kavanaugh also risks forcing the hand of Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham. Since he replaced Sen. Chuck Grassley as chair, he has done nothing in response to the bogus claims presented to the committee against Kavanaugh. The New York Times hit piece might just be the impetus Graham needs to act.
Finally, the renewed attacks on Kavanaugh are likely to gird him for the legal battles to come. Had liberals left things as they were, there was a chance Kavanaugh might try to redeem himself in the eyes of liberals. Kavanaugh’s showcasing of his hiring of an all-female staff of law clerks reeked of virtue signaling and suggested he might feel the need to prove himself. How better to prove to liberals you aren’t a misogynist than to uphold Roe v. Wade? However, Kavanaugh likely now realizes he will always be the bad guy in their eyes, so he might as well stick to his principles rather than pander to the Left for an unattainable acceptance.
The longer the press pushes the Kavanaugh story, the more damage done to the Democratic Party — but also the more damage done to the justice’s wife and young daughters. So, for the sake of the Kavanaugh family, here’s to hoping the media realizes its political miscalculation imminently.

8 years of Trump tax returns are subpoenaed by Manhattan DA

Texto completo: New York • State prosecutors in Manhattan have subpoenaed President Donald Trump’s accounting firm to demand eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.
The subpoena opens a new front in a wide-ranging effort to obtain copies of the president’s tax returns, which Trump initially said he would make public during the 2016 campaign but has since refused to disclose.
The subpoena was issued by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office late last month, soon after it opened a criminal investigation into the role that the president and his family business played in hush-money payments made in the run-up to the election.
Both Trump and his company reimbursed Michael D. Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and fixer, for money Cohen paid to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress who said she had an affair with Trump. The president has denied the affair.
It was unclear if the broad scope of the subpoena indicated that the office had expanded its investigation beyond actions taken during the 2016 campaign. A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., declined to comment.
State prosecutors are seeking a range of tax documents from the accounting firm, Mazars USA, including Trump’s personal returns and those of his business, the Trump Organization. The subpoena seeks federal and state returns for both the president and the company dating back to 2011, the people said.
The investigation by Vance has been focused on $130,000 that Cohen paid Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, just before the election. Cohen pleaded guilty last year to breaking federal campaign finance laws and received a three-year prison sentence.
While the federal prosecutors who charged Cohen stated in a court filing in July that they had “effectively concluded” their inquiry into possible crimes committed by the company or its executives, Vance’s office is exploring whether the reimbursements violated any New York state laws.

Trump says Kavanaugh is the one 'actually being assaulted' after new allegation of sexual assault

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump again defended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday, assailing a news report over the weekend that prompted calls for a renewed investigation and even impeachment of the jurist.
"The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh," Trump tweeted. "Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems. "
Citing a report on the morning program "Fox & Friends," Trump tweeted, "'The New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim. '"
The Times clarified a part of a story about a new book, what the newspaper called "an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. "
In an editor's note attached to the story, the Times said, "The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article. "
The article, an essay adapted from a forthcoming book called “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," dealt with allegations from Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party.
The authors said there is more corroboration for Ramirez's story than there was at the time of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings last year.
"During his Senate testimony, Mr. Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms. Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been 'the talk of campus,' " authors Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly wrote.
"Our reporting suggests that it was," they said. "At least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez’s mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge. "
Some Democrats, including presidential candidates, said they believe Kavanaugh lied at his confirmation hearings, and they called for impeachment proceedings.
"I sat through those hearings," tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , one of the presidential candidates. "Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U. S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached. "
Aides to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chaired the Kavanaugh hearings, said Ramirez's allegations were investigated and found to be wanting.
"The committee's review found no verifiable evidence to support the claims," said a tweet from Grassley's staff.
Trump said Sunday that the man he nominated to the nation's highest court should sue for libel, a suggestion he repeated Monday.
"DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY," Trump tweeted. "They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions – but played the game badly. They should be sued!"

Texto completo: Nina Kavin has been planning this trip for two years.
Ever since she read, in August 2017, that plans were in place to build the Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration and, with it, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, she knew she wanted to visit. And she knew she wanted to bring members of her Evanston community with her.
Dozens, maybe. A hundred, if she could.
The work of public interest lawyer and author Bryan Stevenson, the museum's founder, has always spoken to Kavin. Particularly this quote: "There is no path to justice that is only comfortable and convenient. We will not create justice until we're sometimes able to position ourselves in uncomfortable places and be a witness."
"As a South African and a Jew," Kavin told me, "I'm keenly aware of the fact that, until very recently, there's never been a real truth and reconciliation effort in the United States like there was in South Africa after apartheid, or any kind of monument to slavery, lynching, Jim Crow.
"In South Africa," she said, "there's the Apartheid Museum. In Germany, and around the world, there are many markers, memorials and museums to acknowledge and remember the Holocaust. Germany continues to pay reparations to victims of the Holocaust. I believe that as a country, especially now, we must look back to the past, acknowledge it, wrestle with it, struggle with it and then move forward to make amends."
The Legacy Museum, opened in 2018 in Montgomery, Alabama, a block from a former slave auction site where tens of thousands of humans were bought and sold, felt like that opportunity.
On Friday night, Kavin and two busloads of 105 Evanston residents -- black, white, Asian and Latino, Jewish and Christian, doctors, teachers, social workers, police officers, ages 18 to 80 -- pulled out of the Evanston Township High School parking lot and headed south.
They're calling it their "uncomfortable journey."
They arrived in Montgomery on Saturday morning, checked into their hotel and walked, as a group, to the Legacy Museum, followed by the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, where they gathered for a group activity in remembrance of Americans who were lynched.
After dinner, they returned to their hotel rooms and rested for Sunday's trip to Selma, Alabama, where they walked together across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to honor the civil rights movement demonstrators who were attacked and beaten as they advocated for voting rights in 1965.
It's a symbolic commitment, Kavin said, to building bridges in their own community.
They drove home Sunday afternoon.
"It's really been an incredibly positive thing for me to see how many people want to do this together," Kavin said. "To get off Facebook, to go and confront something in real time, in real life, with real people and face really difficult truths, that to me is amazing."
Before boarding the bus Friday, every participant was required to attend one of two pre-trip meetings to get to know one another, and establish some goals and ground rules. Corrie Wallace, an Evanston resident who works as a diversity and inclusion trainer, facilitated the meetings.
"It's uncomfortable," Wallace said. "The truth is uncomfortable. But in order for us to move forward, we have to know where we've come from. We have to have a deep understanding of our past so we can really get grounded in where we are now. And that will inform our steps moving forward."
I spoke with some of the participants before they left.
Bruce King is a chef and lifelong Evanston resident. He said he expected the trip to be an awakening.
"I am a 66-year-old black man," King said. "My grandfather was run out of Abbeville, South Carolina, in 1910 or he was to be lynched. My other grandfather was African American and Native American, and his family was run out of Oklahoma.
"I want to go and peel the scab off," he said. "I want to open this wound so I can free flow and cry like a baby and go deeper than I've ever imagined possible in the healing process that needs to take place in America."
He thinks experiencing the trip as a group will be tense but powerful.
"I want to feel the energy of people coming awake," he said. "Something tells me we've got a great possibility of a movement taking place from within the community, with a mixture of older and younger folks. I'll help anyone. I'm there for anyone if need be."
Kimberly Holmes-Ross is also Evanston-born and -raised. Her mother is Delores Holmes, the former alderman of Evanston's historically black 5th Ward, formed as a result of segregation and redlining. Holmes-Ross is a social worker and serves as the community engagement coordinator for Cradle to Career, a group that works to make sure all Evanston residents have equal access to resources and opportunities.
"I have been to the National Museum of African American History in D.C., and I have to tell you," Holmes-Ross said, "it took the wind out of my soul.
"For me, and maybe for the other black people going on the trip, it's to memorialize and honor those lives that were lost," she said. "All those ancestors who stood in the gap for us and whose lives were sacrificed. For me, it gives those people a voice and names and humanizes them. For me, it's a time to honor, it's a time to cry, it's a time to memorialize, it's a time to hurt. But it's also a time to say, 'We're still here.' And whatever injustices I can make right or be a part of making right, we'll do that. Our ancestors deserve that."
In a pre-trip meeting, Holmes-Ross said, a fellow attendee put it this way: "She said, 'This is American history. It's not black history. It's American history.'"
And for that reason, Holmes-Ross is glad to be experiencing the trip with a multiracial, multi-ethnic, interfaith group.
"I anticipate it being an emotional journey," she said. "It feels like the beginning of something."
Jane Grover chairs Evanston's Equity and Empowerment Commission, a group pushing the Evanston City Council to pass a reparations resolution. Grover is white.
"For me, this is a trip that I hope will be a corrective reframing of the American history I was taught," Grover said. "And the opportunity to make this pilgrimage with other Evanstonians seemed like the best way to take in the museum and the memorial."
She and her husband have been listening to the "1619" podcast, part of The 1619 Project from The New York Times, in preparation for the trip. She read "White Fragility" by Robin DiAngelo and Stevenson's 2014 book, "Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption," about the wrongful murder conviction of a young black man named Walter McMillian.
"It's one of those things that requires a lot of homework because, sadly, this is not history that has been a part of our education," Grover said. "So here I am, at age 56, catching up."
She, too, thinks of the trip as a beginning, not a conclusion.
"We can't let it be a one-and-done," Grover said. "It's part of a process."
Kavin said she plans to invite the group to gather for post-trip meetings. She hopes they can build on the work and the relationships that start to form on the bus, in the quiet of the museum, around the dinner table, across the bridge.
King said he's optimistic.
"I know there's going to be an impact," King said. "We're not going to come back the same people."
Particularly, he said, if they spend time listening and reflecting.
"A still tongue makes a wise head," he said. "I want to witness what's going on so I can be in a position to carry it forward. I want to feel the energy of change."

Texto completo: Several Democratic presidential candidates called for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh on Sunday after The New York Times published new information about allegations of sexual misconduct against him, while Republican leaders condemned the reporting as irresponsible and defended him.
President Trump on Twitter accused news outlets of trying to pressure the justice into taking more liberal positions and suggested, without elaborating, that the "Justice Department should come to his rescue."
On Saturday, The Times published an essay in its Opinion section adapted from a forthcoming book "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation," by two Times reporters, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, who helped cover his confirmation hearings.
The reporters wrote that they spent 10 months investigating the allegations of sexual misconduct and assault at the center of the hearings, including one by a former Yale classmate, Deborah Ramirez. She recalled being at a dorm party where participants were drinking heavily, and Mr. Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it.
While Senate investigators concluded at the time that Ms. Ramirez's account lacked corroboration, the authors said at least seven people "heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge," including Ms. Ramirez's mother and two classmates who learned of it just days after the party.
The book also reports that Ms. Ramirez's lawyers gave the F.B.I. a list of at least 25 people who may have had corroborating evidence, but that the bureau interviewed none of them. The two agents who interviewed Ms. Ramirez told her they found her "credible," the excerpt said.
The authors also said they uncovered a second, previously unreported incident involving similar behavior by Mr. Kavanaugh at a different party in his freshman year.
The excerpt said a classmate, Max Stier, who now runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about what he had witnessed but that the bureau did not investigate.
The excerpt cites two unnamed officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier, who has declined to discuss the episode publicly. Justice Kavanaugh has declined to answer questions about it, according to the excerpt.
At the center of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing was the testimony of sexual misconduct allegations by Christine Blasey Ford, a California university professor who had attended a Washington-area high school near his.
She testified that when they were teenagers, he pinned her to a bed, groped her and tried to remove her clothes while covering her mouth. He has denied the allegations from both women.
Several of the Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination weighed in on the new allegations.
"These newest revelations are disturbing," Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts wrote on Twitter about The Times essay. "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."
Kamala Harris, a Democratic senator from California and a member of the Senate committee that presided over his confirmation hearings, on Twitter echoed the call for impeachment.
"He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice," she wrote.
Former Vice President Joe Biden called the revelations "profoundly troubling." In a statement on Twitter, he called for an investigation into "whether the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans pressured the F.B.I. to ignore evidence."
Julián Castro, who was housing secretary under President Barack Obama, and Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont, also called for his impeachment.
Mr. Trump, who nominated Justice Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, defended him on Twitter on Sunday.
"He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY," he wrote. "Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!"
In another tweet, the president suggested that Justice Kavanaugh should "start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue."
The Senate Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Twitter, that the "far left's willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year's confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate."
Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, wrote on Twitter that "The New York Times should be ashamed of this smear on Justice Kavanaugh."
James Dao, deputy editorial page editor for The Times, said in a statement that the essay was "a well-reported and newsworthy account that sheds new light on a matter that provoked significant national debate."
The Times was roundly criticized for a tweet -- which was later deleted -- made on its Opinion account on Saturday about the essay that read: "Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn't belong at Yale in the first place."
Mr. Dao said the tweet "was clearly offensive and never should have gone out and we sincerely apologize."

Texto completo: This week's question: With debate No. 3 in the books and the crowded field of Democratic presidential hopefuls about to dwindle, we convened a panel of political junkies from both sides of the aisle and asked: What campaign advice would you give the candidates if asked?

For the whole field

* Former Chicago Mayor and White House Chief of Staff RAHM EMANUEL says: "Authentic, authentic, authentic. And if you can't do that, fake it."

* Democratic strategist DAVE HAMRICK, who ran Martin O'Malley's 2016 presidential campaign, says: "Tell voters more about your life story, the people you met on the campaign trail and your personal experiences. Voters don't just want to know the details of your policy proposals; they want to know who you are and if you share their values."

For fading frontrunner Joe Biden

* 1970 UI grad, best-selling author and Politico chief political columnist ROGER SIMON says: "In all honesty, I'd tell Joe Biden to hang up his spikes and retire with dignity. I have covered every one of his campaigns -- and I am including his primary campaigns -- and they are getting sadder and sadder.

"He has done some great things. People don't even remember some of the great things he has done, but that's not how politics is scored. Not only does the race not always go to the swift, it sometimes doesn't even go to the slow. It doesn't always go to the rich or the most charming or the best-looking. Much of the time, it goes to the most lucky. Ask Ted Kennedy.

"I know I should not feel sorry for a guy who has watered at the public trough since he was 29, but the hardest thing you can do is not win office but leave office before you make a fool of yourself.

"Biden is not there yet, but he is getting there.

"Say it ain't so, Joe. Give it up now."

* Former DNC chair, Secretary of Commerce and 2008 presidential candidate BILL RICHARDSON says: "I would tell Joe to show his prolific knowledge and experience in foreign affairs by asserting America's leadership in alliance building on climate change and human rights and, above all, protecting America's national security.

"We would build bridges, not destroy them."

For Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren

* Says CNN analyst JOE TRIPPI, who led the campaigns of Howard Dean for president (2004) and Doug Jones for Alabama's U.S. Senate seat (2017): "Elizabeth Warren is running the most disciplined and effective campaign of all the candidates to date. It has built a strong and energized base of support among upscale and college-educated white Democrats. Her campaign needs to expand and diversify her support if she is to become a real threat to win the nomination.

"My advice? Win Iowa."

* 3-time Emmy winner and best-selling author LARRY SABATO, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, says: "Momentum often begets more momentum, and the only candidate who is displaying any real forward momentum is Elizabeth Warren. She can continue to move forward by showing voters that her biggest problem really isn't a problem.

"What's Warren's biggest problem? Democrats are determined to defeat Donald Trump, but many believe Warren is not electable, either because of her schoolmarm-ish personality or because she's too far left. So, to use her favorite expression, what's her plan for that? Boil the solution down to a mantra, and repeat it endlessly, and say it first in her spiel, before she gets into her specific policy proposals.

"If she can come up with a truly convincing rationale for how she wins, boiled down to a short paragraph and phrased memorably, she might be able to turn -- in the immortal words of George H.W. Bush -- little 'mo' into big 'mo.'"

For Cory Booker, Andrew Yang and anyone else polling under 5 percent

* Cook Political Report Senior Editor JENNIFER DUFFY says: "Once the third-quarter fundraising numbers are in, sit down with your inner circle and discuss the following questions:

"Do I have a realistic path to the nomination? Have I accomplished anything I set out to do when I announced my candidacy? Will continuing my campaign improve the party's chances of defeating Donald Trump?

"If the answer to any of these questions is no, then it's time to fold your tent and live to fight another day."

For the two senators gaining ground on Biden

* Says former RNC national spokesman CHARLIE BLACK, chief strategist for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign: "(Bernie) Sanders and Warren have plenty of votes between them to beat Biden in the early primaries, but if they both compete, Biden may win them.

"I would tell them both to start drawing distinctions with each other to gain momentum among the more liberal voters. They have not laid a glove on each other yet, and that is helping Biden."

For Kamala Harris and any other candidate planning to be on stage Oct. 15 in Ohio for debate No. 4

* Says GOP strategist RICK WILSON, whose 2018 book, 'Everything Trump Touches Dies,' reached No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list: "Focus everything you have on making this election a referendum on Donald Trump, because that's what it is.

"All presidential re-elections are a referendum on the incumbent, and this one is no different. Policy doesn't win elections; Trump's policy fit on a trucker hat, and (Barack) Obama's was one word: hope."

* Obama cabinet member AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, says: "President Trump's budget literally proposes cutting hundreds of billions of dollars from Social Security and Medicare. Don't attack each other. Go attack that."

For every candidate still in the field who doesn't go by 'Mayor Pete'

* CNN host CHRIS CUOMO, son and brother of New York governors, says: "Politics is about connecting with people. Do more of what (Pete) Buttigieg did in his last answer Thursday night.

"People connect best on an emotional, visceral level. They don't vote for a plan most often; they vote for a person whom they relate to -- whom they believe gets who they are and what they are concerned about."

For Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar

* 1955 UI grad and Bancroft Prize-winning presidential historian BOB DALLEK says: "Drop out of the race for president and agree to serve as vice president."

* Says CNN commentator ALICE STEWART, former communications director for Ted Cruz for President: "With the party moving so far to the left, she is wise to portray herself as the moderate alternative. She is honest with voters about the fact that the progressive policies being discussed are simply not sustainable and was bold to say that Senator Sanders' Medicare for All is 'not just a bold idea, it's a bad idea.' That kind of realistic thinking does appeal to the more moderate voters out there."

* Historian MARY FRANCES BERRY, former chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, says: "She needs to say clearly what she would do as president in an engaging way. So far, we know what she's against -- Medicare for All -- and that she thinks she can carry the Midwest and beat Trump.

"Not much else is remembered minutes after she speaks."

For any candidate tempted to go low, as Julian Castro did to Biden on Thursday night in Houston

* BOB SHRUM, senior adviser to the 2004 Kerry-Edwards and 2000 Gore-Lieberman campaigns, says: "You can and should debate issues, but personal attacks will backfire.

"And even if one of them is effective, it's likely to help a candidate who didn't launch the attack in the first place."

For tough-talking Texan Beto O'Rourke

* Cable news show regular DAVID CORN, D.C. bureau chief for Mother Jones, says: "He had a strong moment at the latest debate with his call for banning military-style rifles in the wake of the terrible El Paso massacre. But he still needs to communicate a wider story of why he is running for president.

"He has been selling an attitudinal shift -- he's young, he's sharp, he lets loose -- without clearly conveying where he would lead the country. What's the foundation of his campaign? He needs to answer that."

* Hillary Clinton adviser NEERA TANDEN, president of the Center for American Progress, says: "Beto O'Rourke had a breakout performance focusing on the gun issue and the damage of the Trump presidency. The question for him: Can he capitalize on that by making the case amongst Democrats for a new generation of leadership?"

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein got away for years with raping underage girls, and the public is properly outraged that powerful people seemed to shrug and let him off easy.
But the problem isn’t one tycoon but many tens of thousands of men who pay for sex with underage girls across the country. And society as a whole reacts with the same indifference that authorities showed in the Epstein scandal.
“We see it as this singular narrative about this one guy,” said Rachel Lloyd, who wrote a superb book, “Girls Like Us,” about her own experience being sexually trafficked as a teenager. “There’s a much larger narrative out there about girls, often girls of color, who are commercially sexually exploited, often with impunity.
“It’s part of the same behavior, part of what we allow as a society,” Lloyd added. “He got away with it because society said he could, and that’s what other johns think as well.”
Lloyd now runs a first-rate program, GEMS, in New York for girls and young women who have been trafficked. The people she helps haven’t been whisked off to Caribbean islands on private jets, but the pattern is the same: sordid exploitation of vulnerable girls by older and more affluent men who get away with it.
Indeed, girls across the U.S. are often treated even worse than in the Epstein case: Some end up arrested for prostitution while their rapists get off scot-free.
If we want to channel our outrage at the Epstein case in a productive way, we could: A) ramp up prosecution of pimps who traffic children; B) prosecute johns who rape girls and boys; C) assist programs for survivors of trafficking; and D) support initiatives that help vulnerable youths avoid being victimized by predators.
“They’re not billionaires, but it happens all the time,” said Shelia Faye Simpkins, who ran away from home at 14 and into the arms of a pimp.
She was raised by an alcoholic who was addicted to drugs and taught her, when she was 6, how to perform oral sex on a man. Simpkins said intervention by social workers might have spared her a brutal career being beaten by a pimp when she didn’t earn a daily quota of $1,000.
She estimates that over the years she was arrested about 200 times for prostitution and other offenses; her pimp, never.
Eventually, Simpkins escaped that life and now works with an outstanding program in Tennessee called Thistle Farms that helps exploited women start new lives and find employment.
As world leaders prepare to gather at the United Nations, some 40 million people are effectively locked into modern forms of slavery, according to the Global Slavery Index. That includes sex trafficking but also child marriages and a great deal of forced labor.
In the United States, no one knows exactly how many children are sold for sex, but estimates have run between 10,000 and 100,000 in any given year. Whatever the number, it’s too many.
President Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump have both denounced sex trafficking, with the president saying he will leverage “every resource” to address this “urgent humanitarian issue.” Ivanka Trump has said that fighting trafficking is a major priority of her father’s administration.
But while the attention is welcome, it seems to be largely hot air — and Trump’s lurid descriptions of trafficking seem mostly to be a misleading rationale for his border wall. In fact, under Trump, the federal government is easing up on human traffickers.
Federal prosecutors initiated only 171 human trafficking cases last year, substantially fewer than the 241 in 2017 or the 223 in 2016, according to the Federal Human Trafficking Report series. Bradley Myles of Polaris, the organization that runs a human trafficking hotline, (888) 373-7888, notes that the number of T visas, which are given to trafficking victims, has also dropped, and a housing program for trafficking survivors has been canceled.
“I’m glad the issue has bipartisan support, but I don’t think enough is happening,” Myles said. “Epstein wasn’t this one bad apple; this is more of a systemic issue.”
If we could leverage outrage, there’s evidence of what works abroad and in the U.S. A group called the Freedom Fund has a report coming out this month showing that expanding grassroots initiatives could lead to huge reductions in forced labor in India.
Likewise, new studies of My Life My Choice, a Boston program for children who have been trafficked or are at risk of being trafficked, find that the girls become less likely to use drugs, engage in delinquent behavior or be arrested when provided counseling, mentoring and other support. The program’s participants on average were first sexually exploited at the age of 14 which should remind us that we need more help for vulnerable children, and less impunity for pimps and johns who exploit them.
“What was so painful about the Jeffrey Epstein case is that it wasn’t shocking,” Lisa Goldblatt Grace, co-founder of My Life My Choice, told me. “A wealthy white man leveraged his money, privilege and power to sexually abuse, to rape, young girls.”
Or, as Yiota Souras of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children put it: “Epstein is the tip of a very large iceberg.”

CNN blames Trump for Obama-era leak

Texto completo: Here's some advice for the media covering President Trump: If you don't want to be accused of reporting fake news, don't report fake news.
Case in point: On Monday, CNN correspondent Jim Sciutto reported that a highly placed U.S. intelligence source inside the Kremlin was pulled "in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy." Sciutto continued, "The decision to carry out the extraction occurred soon after a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump discussed highly classified intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. ... [that] had been provided by Israel."
Sorry, the decision to extract the source was first made before Trump took office, and the reason was mishandling of classified intelligence not by Trump, but by the Obama administration. As the New York Times reports this week, "C.I.A. officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia." What prompted that decision? Leaks to the media about the covert source's reporting that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered and orchestrated Russia's election interference campaign.
The impetus for the extraction decision was a Dec. 14, 2016, NBC News report that "Two senior officials with direct access to the information" said Putin personally directed Russia's election interference and that "the intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies, the officials said." NBC added that this new intelligence showing Putin's direct involvement went much further than the information the U.S. was relying when all 17 intelligence agencies issued a report in October holding Russia responsible for the DNC hack, and that "now the U.S has solid information tying Putin to the operation."
This leak exposed the fact that the CIA had a spy in Putin's orbit who was passing on intelligence about the Russian president's decision-making. Who leaked the information? Two senior Obama administration officials. The Times reports that Obama CIA Director John Brennan considered the Kremlin source's reporting "so delicate, and the need to protect the source's identity so important," that he kept his reports out of the President's Daily Brief and sent them to Obama in "special sealed envelopes to the Oval Office." The PDB is already one of the most restricted U.S. government documents, so the sealed reports were restricted to an even smaller circle of senior Obama aides. Yet the leak, according to NBC, came from officials "with direct access to the information." Which Obama aide leaked it? That is for U.S. attorney John Durham to find out, but this much is certain: It was not Donald Trump.
It was after this Obama administration leak that the CIA decided to pull the source. The reason he was not actually pulled at the time is that he initially refused - a decision the Times reports raised concerns that "the informant had been turned and had become a double agent." Eventually, the source changed his mind. But the decision was made before Trump came to office.
That's not all. CNN falsely reported that the source was pulled after Trump's meeting with Russia officials in which he shared intelligence on Syria that was "provided by Israel." But as I pointed out in May 2017, Trump did not reveal that Israel was the source of the intelligence. That classified information was revealed to the Times by what the paper described as "a current and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information." Any former official familiar with that intelligence was from the Obama administration. So this leak also came from Team Obama. Even Brennan, the Obama CIA director and virulent Trump critic, admitted that Trump was not to blame and said that "the real damage to national security is ... what was leaked in the aftermath, what was put in the media."
So, CNN tried to blame Trump for the loss of a Kremlin source, when it was really the Obama administration that was responsible for the catastrophic leaks that burned him - and did so citing a leak that did not come from Trump at all, but most likely from a former Obama official. Talk about fake news! Yet despite all this, CNN has not pulled its "fake news" story. Indeed, Sciutto still has it proudly pinned at the top of the Twitter feed. What a disgrace.

Texto completo: In our increasingly busy and scattered lives, getting clear and focused can feel like an insurmountable task.
We live in an era of distractions vying for our attention the way high-strung paparazzi try to capture that perfect celebrity photo.
Knowing that most of us can't take a three-month sabbatical to hang with monks in mountainous isolation, how can we cultivate focus and purpose?
It turns out, there is a lot of magic in the number five. Here are five clarifying questions to help you lock in your best-self game plan:
1. What are the five most important areas of your life? With so many competing interests, it's easy to diffuse our focus, achieving puny results in too many areas. The top performers in business, sports, and life put 95% of their energy into a very short list of pursuits. They focus hard on their top five and relentlessly remove all other distractions. Depth – not breadth – is the stuff of champions.
2. What are five things you're truly incredible at? You may be good in dozens of things, but what are your most poignant superpowers? Where do you shine as world-class? Once identified, pour every drop of your being into continuing to expand these skills or traits, at the deliberate expense of all others.
3. What are the five things that bring you pure joy? Maybe it's the smell of fresh air on a nature hike. Or the delight of helping a colleague overcome a challenge. Perhaps you find delight in reading a great novel, sipping dark roast coffee, or cheering for your favorite team, foam finger and all. Discovering the few things that recharge your batteries, activate your senses, and elevate your humanity can be a giant boost during those inevitable times of adversity.
4. What are the five things that drain your energy? You may be good at weeding the garden, building a spreadsheet, or making sales calls. But if these activities deplete you, they can generate a sinister spillover impact on the areas that matter most. Identify your five biggest buzz kills, and avoid them at all costs.
5. What are the five ways you want to be remembered? Not an easy question, but your answers will provide a powerful North Star as you make your daily decisions. Keep this list front and center and let it serve as the guidepost for how you spend your days and your talents.
Five questions, each with five answers. While they may take some reflection to codify, your output will create a roadmap to seize your full potential. The improved clarity and focus will enable you to stay on your best course and triumph greatly.
Ask, Answer, and Achieve.

Help for Bahamians

Texto completo: Two years ago, Southwest Florida was hit by Hurricane Irma, creating a large swath of destruction. People from all over rallied to help those who were affected.
Now in the Bahamas there is a catastrophe that makes Irma's impact look minor. I'm proud of the grass-roots support and donations by Floridians to mitigate what the residents of Abaco and Grand Bahama are going through.
But the Trump administration has gone from caging children to literally pushing victims of a natural disaster back into the sea. The policy of not granting temporary protected status to those fleeing the devastation of their islands is despicable. Telling them to attempt to rummage through the rubble to find or file for a passport to try to get sanctuary in the U.S. from an unimaginable tragedy is the embodiment of evil.
This is not a matter of "imagined" immigration loopholes. It is a humanitarian atrocity and crime, and silence on the part of our elected representatives makes them complicit.
Bob and Anita Oltmans, Fort Myers
Carp vs. lake grass In discussing the issue of Lake Kennedy and other area lakes, the term "tape grass" came up. The official name of tape grass is "vallisneria Americana." It's a common native aquatic weed in Florida. Agencies responsible for overseeing the issue of tape grass overrunning our lakes have indicated they will introduce grass-eating carp in the lakes.
This is not a blooming plant that adds beauty to the water, it's a weed, and each day it's spreading across more lake surfaces. Expecting carp to be a solution to the issue would be similar to a hurricane hitting Cape Coral and our city government offering rolls of scotch tape to fix the problem.
This issue wasn't addressed when it first started spreading across our lakes. Now much of our lakes have had yellowish-brown weeds across a large portion of the lakes. The stomach of a carp isn't large, and expecting carp fish to eat enough of this floating weed to improve the problem would probably take many months, or even years before much positive impact is noticed.
We need a better solution to correct this increasing problem.
Kenny Belford, Cape Coral
Aid to poor on taxes New data from the U.S. census show that in 2018, about 38 million Americans were below the poverty line. Sadly, the federal tax code is part of the problem.
Currently, the code taxes more than 5 million low-wage workers not raising children at home into — or deeper into — poverty. And millions of children in low-income families are left out of the full Child Tax Credit. Congress could have fixed these problems in the 2017 tax law but chose not to.
Congress is considering another tax bill this fall with lots of benefits for businesses. Workers and families must not be ignored again. The Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit are pro-work, pro-family tax credits for people working in low-wage jobs. Together, they lifted 7.9 million Americans above the poverty line in 2018. Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit would ensure our tax code supports low-income Americans struggling to make ends meet.
I urge our members of Congress to uphold the principle that no business tax breaks should be extended or expanded without also expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit in the same bill.
Alexis Maestre-Saborit, Fort Myers
Care for immigrants A letter writer complained about what he assumed was the cost to taxpayers for a young Guatemalan woman who has been treated for her incurable disease for many years in the U.S. and who was threatened with deportation, which would end her life, since there is no such treatment available in her country.
In fact, as reported by The New York Times, her care has been paid for by her family and their private health insurance.
There are at most a couple of thousand children getting lifesaving treatment in this country, who in most cases would die if unable to do so. I don't know how these cases are all funded, but I venture the letter writer didn't either.
I have to wonder what parents, faced with the likelihood of losing their child, wouldn't plead with doctors and facilities to help them, even if they weren't citizens of that country or able to pay. Are they supposed to just throw up their hands and plan a funeral?
Why are people so afraid of offering compassionate charitable care to people desperately in need, even if they have brown skin?
Sarah Ridgway, North Naples
Insight on religion The recently published opinion piece "How churches could win back young people like me" was amazing insight for someone so young to ponder. Although I do not agree with all that she wrote, I did find much of it enlightening and a starting point for churches to rekindle faith, considering the Gallup report on church membership decrease.
A response to this article indicated why she would feel as she does. The writer said the article was "guided" and challenged its publication. Later, the response referred to her views as "immature concepts of self" and an "animus of revealed truth."
The response also said the root of religion is "to bind" persons to a disciplined way of life. This is one translation interpretation of the word "religion" by some but by no means the only interpretation by theologians. I do agree that religion should help us transcend ourselves into something or someone greater, and this is where the article writer and response appear to agree.
Instead of focusing anger at a young messenger and silencing press, church organizations should look in the mirror and accept that the hypocrisy she refers to is not just church members, as the response piece implies, but the organizations themselves.
We must all work to become better than our current selves.
Mary Rogan, North Naples
Vaping vs. gun deaths I applaud President Trump and members of Congress for discussing working together on a proposed ban on flavored e-cigarettes, but there are important comparisons to be made.
According to NBC News, the number of deaths from e-cigarettes is six. As of Sept. 3, 2019, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 289 mass shootings in the U.S. this year, with 313 deaths.
" 'The right to bear arms' is a right of the states or state militias like the National Guard, not of individuals," former Chief Justice Warren Burger said, according to www.constitution.org.
Lets hope members of Congress and President Trump will work together to ban assault weapons from the public. They belong only in the hands of law enforcement and the military.

Texto completo: Mayor Marty Walsh has problems right now — the kind that could deny him a third term, if he seeks one.
The last time an incumbent Boston mayor lost a bid for reelection was in 1949, when James Michael Curley went down to John Hynes after spending five months in prison for mail fraud. Even then, it was close.
It seemed like Boston would always be a city where the mayor got to keep his job for as long as he wanted. But we might, just might, be headed into a new era here.
Walsh has had a brutal couple of months. In August, two of his aides were convicted of extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion for trying to strong-arm music festival organizers into hiring union labor. Those prosecutions pale compared to the gobsmacking news, three weeks ago, of a bribery scandal centered on the city's Zoning Board of Appeals. On Thursday, former Boston Planning and Development Agency official John Lynch pled guilty in federal court to accepting a $50,000 bribe from a developer to lobby a board member for approval on a South Boston condo project.
More shoes seem likely to drop; the feds don't tend to stop at one small fry crook. And Walsh has ordered an independent inquiry. The mayor hasn't been implicated. But two people close to him have stepped aside. Buddy Christopher, an architect who worked on the condo project, and a trusted aide who has been close with Walsh for decades, is taking an unpaid leave while investigations are underway. And Craig Galvin — a longtime Walsh supporter who hosted a fund-raiser for him in 2015, and whom the mayor appointed to the ZBA — has resigned his post.
It looks awful. And even if it's not as awful as it looks, the prosecutions won't help a mayor who strains to avoid seeming like a vestige of an old Boston where connections are all.
As the 2018 primaries showed, many Boston voters want to move on from that culture, and their voice is increasingly powerful.Then-City Councilor Ayanna Pressley's victory over incumbent congressman Mike Capuano revealed new electoral strength in the center of the city — in Roxbury, Dorchester, and Jamaica Plain — more diverse, left-leaning neighborhoods compared to traditional voter powerhouses like South Boston and West Roxbury. We're also seeing the rise of voters who worry more about bike lanes and better policing than about potholes.
Nobody seems to be scared of Walsh the way they were of his predecessor, Tom Menino. That's a good thing for the city. It's also a good thing for those who might want Walsh's job. City Councilor Michelle Wu, who won't yet say whether she'll run against him in 2021, has run rings around the mayor on transportation, an issue that is consistently among voters' top priorities. She also called for ZBA business to be suspended in the wake of the bribery scandal. Council President Andrea Campbell, also a possible challenger, called for the appointment of a city inspector general to root out corruption, a clear shot across Walsh's bow.
Now, 2021 is a long way off. And Walsh is hugely popular: A WBUR/MassINC poll in June revealed a 70 percent approval rating among Boston residents surveyed. We don't yet know if recent events, or a credible challenger, will dent that goodwill.
And it's not clear whether Walsh himself wants to test it. A few weeks ago, the mayor told The New York Times that he would consider running for the Senate if incumbent Ed Markey decided to bow out.
“This idea of being elected and thinking it's your seat until you leave, that game has changed," Walsh said.
After 20 years of Menino, who embodied the job and seemed incapable of imagining a life beyond it, the notion that a mayor might think like this is profoundly disorienting.
Of course, Walsh may have no choice. Either way, it's clear we're headed for a new day.

Texto completo: FOXBOROUGH — In one week, Antonio Brown has asked for and received his release from the Oakland Raiders, signed a deal with the Patriots, received an invitation to room at the Brady-Bundchen residence, been accused in a lawsuit of sexual assault and rape by a former trainer, denied the allegations through a lawyer and through his agent in an appearance on “SportsCenter," begun practicing with the Patriots, changed his jersey number, gone on Instagram Live with Alex Guerrero from the TB12 Center, noted gleefully that 17,000 people were watching that broadcast, been dropped by the helmet manufacturer Xenith, which had been sponsoring him since solving his helmet issues in Oakland this summer, and apparently has gotten the green light to play against the Dolphins Sunday.
The Patriots have discussed none of it.
“No," said Phillip Dorsett. “It's the Dolphins."
So, with each new story rising long before the sun each morning, spawning headlines, drawing reporters who might otherwise be covering government or world affairs to Foxborough, and furthering the uncertain circumstances around one of the best receivers in football, that was it. Inside Gillette Stadium, there was no big team meeting called, no edict given from Bill Belichick, according to multiple players. It did not come up in an official capacity.
It had taken a while for Belichick and the coaching staff to even acknowledge the signing of Brown. When they finally did Tuesday, their comments were comically understated.
“Well, we think he'll help our team, but until we start working with him . . . ," Belichick said.
“Just an overall solid player that has done a lot of good things in our league," added offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.
Among the good: 11,207 receiving yards in nine seasons. Four All-Pro selections. A league-leading 15 touchdowns just last season.
But then the bad came.
A little after 8 p.m. on Tuesday, the New York Times broke the news that a woman named Britney Taylor, who met Brown in college and trained him in 2017 and 2018, had alleged in a civil suit that Brown sexually assaulted her on three occasions, one of which was described as forcible rape. Included in the lawsuit are messages apparently from Brown to Taylor that describe one of the alleged assaults and contain disturbing, misogynistic language.
At 8:43 p.m., Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, released a statement on Twitter in which he claimed that Brown denies all the allegations and that all sexual activity between Brown and Taylor was consensual.
At 11:49 p.m., the Patriots made a statement in which they said that they were aware of the lawsuit and Brown's reaction, that they do not condone domestic violence, and that the league would be investigating.
Wednesday morning, Belichick walked out of his scheduled news conference after 3 minutes and 50 seconds of back-and-forth. He usually goes for 15-20 minutes. He spoke 151 words total. On Friday, he spoke 231 in one answer about offensive line depth.
He said Brown would be at practice but would not say if he knew Brown was about to be called a sexual abuser when he decided to make him a part of the team. The news conference ended after an exchange in which Belichick was asked what conversations he's had with Brown.
“Yeah, I mean I'm done with that, OK? Anything else on Miami? Any other questions?" Belichick said.
The reporter asked what Belichick meant by “done with it."
“Yeah, and I just answered that question," Belichick answered.
“Well, actually you didn't," the reporter said.
“Actually, I did," Belichick responded, then walked out.
Meanwhile, it was still Wednesday, a big day in Foxborough. The middle of the week is when the padded practices happen. Players are in full install mode getting ready for Sunday.
“It's been the same," said Stephon Gilmore. “Just trying to really break down our opponent. We've got a couple new guys, so we're trying to get to know the new guys. It's been a normal week, we're just going to try to get better. There hasn't been a change."
It went unspoken, but the message had come down from coaches to players that football was their only business. A few select veterans had the OK to speak about the allegations, but only to say that they were serious but people shouldn't rush to judgment.
“It's serious," said Devin McCourty. “I don't think anybody doesn't realize how serious that situation is and everything, but I think from a football standpoint, we've got to be prepared to go out and play against the Dolphins on Sunday because that's what our job calls on us to do."
“I don't want to minimize the serious nature of [the allegations], but I don't feel as though I'm qualified to really speak to it because I don't know anything about it," Matthew Slater said.
Slater, when asked what advice he'd give a new player, did offer one message for Brown that felt a bit pointed.
“No one is bigger than the team," he said.
When that's true, it works both ways. Patriots players tend to surrender some of their individualism and agree to strict rules to be part of the team. If they have a personal issue, they can count on their teammates mostly leaving them alone about it.
“We don't care about that stuff," Gilmore said. “We just try to focus on our job. Stuff happens, you've got to let the coach handle it. Players try to play our game the best that we can and go from there."
Dorsett said he couldn't think of a time when he felt like a teammate was distracted by another teammate's personal issue. If he saw that happening, he'd let coaches handle it.
Slater said he does think some players carry the responsibility of keeping everyone on track, but that the myopic focus in Foxborough mostly trickles down from coaches, namely Belichick.
So while the rest of the world agreed that the most important news was off the field, the Patriots were on to Miami. The task with Brown was to determine which of the plays he'd been taught over the course of the week would make their way into the final game plan.
“That's the question," Belichick said Friday morning. “That's the question we're asking ourselves, too. So, you go through the week like we've done. We've done different things. Now as we get to Friday, Saturday, we'll decide what things we feel comfortable with. We may eliminate some of the things that we've done and concentrate on a certain group. Whether that's five plays, 20 plays, I don't know."
The night before, Brown had gone on Instagram Live from the TB12 Center, where he was working out with Guerrero.
“No matter what they say. No matter what they hate, somebody's still gotta go to work," Brown said in the video.
Brown did not bring up the lawsuit specifically.
“Call God . . . In a time of crisis all I ask is love, dedication, and focus. Stay focused. The devil gonna try to bring you down when you get closer to your goals," Brown said. “The key is, don't let them."
On Friday, Belichick was asked if he had any comment on the video.
“Yeah, I'm just here to talk about the game," he said.
For the last two weeks, the NFL has been trying to keep the attention on its celebration of its 100th season. History, honor, triumph, those sorts of things. Brown has taken the microphone, though, and replaced them with drama and, now, serious scandal. It seems the only focus he hasn't swallowed up is that of his own team.

Justice Dept. to Laud Team That Propelled Kavanaugh

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department will present one of its most prestigious awards to the lawyers who worked on the highly contentious Supreme Court nomination process of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Next month, Attorney General William P. Barr will present the Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service to those who worked "to support the nomination" of the judge, according to an email reviewed by The New York Times.
Mr. Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh in July 2018 to replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who was retiring. Judge Kavanaugh was confirmed to the court last October.
That team being awarded includes prosecutors and lawyers from the department's tax division, the environment and natural resources division, the civil appellate section and several United States attorneys offices.
Lawyers who worked in the office of legal policy, which carries out significant policy initiatives, and in the federal programs branch, which defends the administration in court, were also part of the team.
The Justice Department declined to comment.
Typically, the distinguished service honor, the department's second highest, is given to employees who worked on significant prosecutions, rather than on judicial nomination processes. In addition to the award to the Kavanaugh nomination team, 10 other distinguished service honors will be presented this year. Those recipients include the prosecutors who worked to end a bid-rigging conspiracy against the Defense Department.
In July 2018, Rod J. Rosenstein, then the deputy attorney general, asked federal prosecutors to help review the many government documents involved in Justice Kavanaugh's nomination process.
After many years of public service -- including work for the independent counsel's investigation of President Bill Clinton and on the 2000 Florida recount -- Justice Kavanaugh had generated a lengthy paper trail that lawyers needed to comb through.
Mr. Rosenstein estimated that he would need about 100 lawyers working around the clock to review all of the documents. His broad request for volunteers from United States attorneys offices was seen by some former officials as a reflection of the huge amount of work required by Justice Kavanaugh's nomination; others saw it as an unusual insertion of politics into federal law enforcement.
Lawyers in the department's office of legal policy in Washington had helped with previous Supreme Court nominations.
Justice Kavanaugh's nomination was imperiled after a California university professor, Christine Blasey Ford, testified before Congress that he had sexually assaulted her while they were teenagers.
In his own testimony before lawmakers, Justice Kavanaugh denied the allegations, and sometimes shouted and teared up as he accused Democrats of persecuting him. His nomination became a touchstone battle in a country in the middle of its own reckoning with sexual harassment and assault, often referred to as the #MeToo movement.
Last year, the award was given to the prosecutors in the United States attorney's office in Washington and to the F.B.I. agents who investigated and prosecuted Ahmed Abu Khattala, a Libyan militia leader who played a key role in the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.
Four Americans died in the attacks, including the American ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens.
At the annual awards ceremony, Mr. Barr will also present the Justice Department's highest honor, the David Margolis Award for Exceptional Service, to the team of prosecutors and agents who successfully convicted Joaquín Guzmán Loera, a Mexican crime lord better known as El Chapo, on drug, murder and money laundering charges. Mr. Guzmán, 62, was sentenced in July to life in prison.

Resumen: Citing recent deadly mass shootings in Gilroy, El Paso, Dayton and elsewhere, more than 100 CEOs of U.S. companies including many well-known tech industry bosses on Thursday urged Senate leaders to take action on gun violence. In an exchange caught on video this week, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi shifted the focus to the Senate after a reporter asked her if she regretted not calling the House back into session early from summer recess after last month's mass shootings. Advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted Thursday that the CEOs' letter is "huge  These companies are standing up for public safety; it's time the Senate do the same."

Texto completo: Citing recent deadly mass shootings in Gilroy, El Paso, Dayton and elsewhere, more than 100 CEOs of U.S. companies including many well-known tech industry bosses on Thursday urged Senate leaders to take action on gun violence.
Among the tech CEOs who signed the letter were Twitter's Jack Dorsey, Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi and Lyft's Logan Green. Other big-name signatories from the Bay Area: Laurene Powell Jobs of Emerson Collective, Art Peck of Gap and Chip Bergh of Levi Strauss. Conspicuously missing from the list are the chief executives of Apple, Facebook, Google and YouTube, who have spoken out about politically charged issues before, such as immigration, the U.S. travel ban and LGBTQ issues.
"We are writing to you because we have a responsibility and obligation to stand up for the safety of our employees, customers and all Americans we serve across the country," said the 145 CEOs in the letter, a draft of which was obtained by the New York Times. They asked the Senate to pass a bill to require background checks on all gun sales, plus "a strong Red Flag law that would allow courts to issue life-saving extreme risk protection orders." Red-flag laws are meant to keep guns out of the hands of potentially violent people.
The majority-Democratic House already has introduced bills addressing gun violence. Now the executives are imploring the Republican-controlled Senate to do so.
"These proposals are common-sense, bipartisan and widely supported by the American public," the execs said. "It is time for the Senate to take action."
In an exchange caught on video this week, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi shifted the focus to the Senate after a reporter asked her if she regretted not calling the House back into session early from summer recess after last month's mass shootings.
"Don't ask me what we haven't done," Pelosi said. "We have done it." The U.S. House of Representatives in February passed a bill on background checks.
"Sen. McConnell hasn't acted," she added. "Why don't you go ask him if he has any regrets for all the people who died because he hasn't acted?"
McConnell reportedly said this week that the White House is drafting a proposal to address gun violence, and pointed out that President Donald Trump has said he would veto the gun control bill passed by the House. His office has not returned a request for comment about the letter.
The CEOs of other familiar names in tech also were among those who signed the letter: Airbnb, DoorDash, Eventbrite, Pinterest, Postmates, Reddit, Survey Monkey, Yelp and Nextdoor. While the CEOs of Google, Alphabet and YouTube did not sign, the CEO of Alphabet-owned Sidewalk Labs, Dan Doctoroff, did.
Apple, Facebook, Google and its subsidiary YouTube have not returned requests for comment Thursday. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was also missing from the signatories, and Amazon has not returned a request for comment, either.
"I have no hard evidence, but consider this: All four of these companies are currently under federal scrutiny," Larry Gerston, professor emeritus for San Jose State University's political science department, said Thursday. "They may have decided to lower their political profiles, at least for now." Facebook and Google are known to be under antitrust review by states, federal regulators or both. Amazon and Apple are said to be under review, too, although those investigations haven't been confirmed.
CEOs from other industries who signed Thursday's letter include those from Bain Capital, Bloomberg, Conde Nast, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Dick's Sporting Goods.
Advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted Thursday that the CEOs' letter is "huge  These companies are standing up for public safety; it's time the Senate do the same."

Texto completo: After ABC News hosted the third Democratic debate with 10 of the 2020 presidential candidates on Thursday, CNN announced the date and location of the next debate and revealed they will be co-hosting the event with the New York Times.
The debate will take place at Otterbein University on Oct. 15. Because billionaire Tom Steyer qualified for the debate, there is a chance it will be split into two nights. The moderators will be CNN anchors Anderson Cooper, Erin Burnett, and the New York Times' national editor Marc Lacey.
To qualify for the debate, candidates must meet a 2% polling threshold in four Democratic National Committee-approved polls and have at least 130,000 unique donors, including 400 donors per state from at least 20 states.
Other candidates who currently qualify for the debate include former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.iFrame Object

Marco Rubio: A red-flag law will reduce bloodshed and respect the rights of gun owners

Texto completo: After a string of mass shootings this summer, Americans are demanding a response to curtail the violence. If we are looking to deliver a solution that reduces bloodshed and respects the rights of responsible gun owners, the only realistic action must be bipartisan.
This is why the recent focus on red-flag proposals from our Senate colleagues and the president is welcome. The most effective step Congress can take right now to prevent tragedies like those in Parkland, Fla.; Newtown, Conn.; and Dayton, Ohio, is to enact red-flag laws, which give law enforcement the ability to restrict gun access for unstable, potentially violent people, without infringing on other Americans’ rights.
That’s why, on the first day of this Congress, I reintroduced bipartisan legislation with Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine; Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island; and Angus King, independent of Maine.
We can see the consensus around red-flag legislation developing in real time. I commend Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who have publicly voiced support for enacting a law that would provide financial incentives to states to adopt red-flag laws. Our bill does exactly that.
It’s no secret that you need a bipartisan coalition to pass legislation in the Senate, and we’ve already done the legwork. We can build off our proposal in order to put a law in place that can actually stop the next attack.
Red-flag laws empower law enforcement or family members to use the judicial system to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. In Florida, when a concerned family member contacts the police about a person determined to be a threat to himself or others, the police can petition a judge to have his guns taken away for two weeks. After an additional hearing, the risk protection order can be extended for up to a year.
The laws do not infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. In order for a state to be eligible for funding under our proposal, it would be required to enact strong due process protections and include a felony penalty for false reporting.
Red and blue states alike across the country are enacting red-flag laws, and a recent study showed these laws may be playing a role in preventing mass shootings. As of last month, state judges had signed off on over 2,400 risk protection orders in Florida since March 2018, undoubtedly pre-empting violence.
Far too often, we learn after a tragedy that the perpetrator displayed concerning and often repeated signs of deeply troubling behavior, including clear statements indicating their intent to cause harm to others. In the case of the Parkland shooting suspect, the police received at least 45 calls about him, and a woman close to him even communicated to the F.B.I. that she feared he would become a school shooter, listing specific examples of disturbing conduct — including holding a gun to the head of family members.
Despite these troubling indicators, the suspect was not prevented from owning or obtaining firearms because he had never been charged with a crime. Red-flag laws provide communities with a tool to prevent future tragedies.
I have spoken to families and other community members who have been hurt by senseless acts of violence. As we discuss ways to prevent attacks and keep our schools and communities safe, red-flag laws are consistently mentioned.
Bipartisan consensus is growing that this type of law would be a part of the solution, and we have the blueprint needed to put them in place. It’s time to act.
Marco Rubio is a Republican senator from Florida.

Texto completo: Triple Crown winner Justify tested positive for an illegal substance after winning a qualifying race for the Kentucky Derby, according to a New York Times report. Here's the complete timeline of events for Justify's banned substance scandal that has rocked the horse racing world.
April 7, 2018: After winning the Santa Anita Derby, Justify tested positive for the drug scopolamine, a banned substance that veterinarians say can enhance performance.
April 18, 2018: A lab at the University of California, Davis, sent a notice two and a half weeks before the Kentucky Derby, that Justify had tested positive for scopolamine.
April 20, 2018: Dr. Rick Arthur, the California Horse Racing Board's equine medical director, wrote in an email circulated to Rick Baedeker, the executive director of the CHRB, its lawyers and its interim chief investigator that the case would be "handled differently than usual."
April 26, 2018: Justify's trainer Bob Baffert received notification that the horse had tested positive for scopolamine. Baffert asked that another sample from that test be sent to an approved independent lab.
May 5, 2018: Justify wins the Kentucky Derby.
May 8, 2018: Independent lab confirms positive results of second test and Baedeker notifies CHRB members.
May 24, 2018: A New York Times report says that Justify's breeding rights were sold to Coolmore for $60 Million.
June 9, 2018: Justify becomes the 13th racehorse in the last 100 years to win the Triple Crown after winning the 150th running of the Belmont Stakes.
Aug. 23, 2018: Baedeker presents the Justify case directly to the commissioners of the CHRB in a private executive session. The board voted unanimously not to proceed with the case against Baffert.
October 2018: The CHRB changed the penalty for a scopolamine violation to the lesser penalty of a fine and possible suspension.
Sept 11, 2019: A New York Times reports that Justify failed a drug test after winning the Santa Anita Derby.
Sept. 12, 2019: Bob Baffert issues a statement denying that he intentionally administered scopolamine.
Present: Justify is in retirement in Australia where he mates as often as three times a day.

Texto completo: CHARLESTON, S.C. – Once upon a time, Mark Sanford might have been a contender, but there's too much water under the bridges that stretch from this city of steeples to his erstwhile home on Sullivan's Island.
The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he's running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The third challenger to toss his hat into the wishing well of magical thinking, Sanford says he plans to talk about the skyrocketing debt, tariffs, trade and tone. Perfect. That'll ignite the crowds and knock the grand poobah of pomp and propaganda off his game.
You can just see it: The boyish Sanford – an itinerant stranger in his own strange land – going toe to toe with the swamp-menacing Trump. It would be worth the price of a ticket. Trump's other two GOP opponents, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, may as well grab one while they last.
Nevertheless, the buzz does what buzz does. In the days following Sanford's announcement and a series of cable-TV appearances, you'd have thought the former governor were the deus ex machina of the GOP. Recent commentary from conservatives has been dripping with so much honey you don't know whether to build a hive or kill the drones.
The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that's about it so far. Also, BIG HEADLINE, he believes in climate change and legal immigration because, what life form other than Trump's most fervent supporters doesn't?
Further to Sanford's coronation as GOP savior, according to Republican strategist Liz Mair writing Monday in The New York Times, he's a bigger threat to Trump than his co-challengers because he was never a "Never Trumper." Unlike Walsh and Weld – a strong law firm name if things go awry, as surely they will – Sanford appears to be uninterested in making the race all about Trump, even though Trump's anti-endorsement in 2018 led to Sanford's congressional primary defeat.
Plus, wrote Mair, Sanford is more "nuanced." Perhaps she was thinking of the subtle differences between Argentina and the Appalachian Trail, where in 2009 the then-governor Sanford told everyone through a spokesperson that he'd be hiking for a few days but instead found himself in South America with his mistress?
Mair insists that the tryst that ended Sanford's governorship, as well as his marriage, was "the least-scandalous scandal in modern political history" because, after all, he only had an "extramarital affair because he fell in love and got engaged to the woman."
This confection would be news to South Carolinians who were appalled by his deceit and repulsed by his weepy news conference to confess his sins. Such a cavalier dismissal of a family betrayal would also be news to ex-wife Jenny Sanford, who wrote a book, "Staying True" about it. While you're browsing, by all means pick up "The Speechwriter," by Barton Swaim, Sanford's speechwriter for the latter part of his administration. It's hilariously funny and a poignant memoir of a tenure of absurdity.
It is absolutely true that Sanford, 59, is a time-tested conservative on budgetary matters, as my Washington Post colleague Jennifer Rubin argued under the banner headline "Mark Sanford might be the Republicans' last chance." No one can accuse him of being a fake conservative, she wrote.
Indeed, not. As governor, Sanford was such a budget cruncher that he brought two baby pigs, one under each arm, to the statehouse to make his point about – get it? – pork.
It is quite possible that most or many Americans don't care what Sanford did in his personal life, but the nicknamed "Luv Guv's" philandering meanderings were public matters by virtue of two facts: The highest-ranking official of the state lied about his whereabouts and was unreachable. He simply slipped the reins of government and followed his passion, which was concerned with "issues" having nothing to do with matters of state.
It's not the economy, it's character. Only someone as despicable as Donald Trump could make a man like Mark Sanford palatable. Sanford's well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons. But that time has passed.

Business leaders call on congress to act on gun violence

Texto completo: In a direct and urgent call to address gun violence in America, the chief executives of some of the nation’s best-known companies sent a letter to Senate leaders on Thursday, urging an expansion of background checks to all firearms sales and stronger “red flag” laws.
“Doing nothing about America’s gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety,” the heads of 145 companies, including Levi Strauss, Twitter and Uber, say in the letter, which was shared with The New York Times.
The letter — which urges the Republican-controlled Senate to enact bills already introduced in the Democrat-led House of Representatives — is the most concerted effort by the business community to enter the gun debate, one of the most polarizing issues in the nation and one that was long considered off limits.
The debate and the decision to sign — or not sign — are a case study in how chief executives must weigh their own views and the political risks to their businesses.
“To a certain extent, these CEOs are putting their businesses on the line here, given how politically charged this is,” said Chip Bergh, chief executive of Levi Strauss, a company whose denim jeans have long been a symbol of America. Bergh spent the last several days trying to cajole his peers into joining him and gun control advocates like Everytown, which is funded in part by Michael Bloomberg. “Business leaders are not afraid to get engaged now,” he added. “CEOs are wired to take action on things that are going to impact their business, and gun violence is impacting everybody’s business now.”
Bergh said he was encouraged by the conversations. “The tide is turning,” he said, citing a spate of recent polls that show a majority of Americans in both parties support background checks and red flag laws. “People were starting to be much more open-minded,” he said, even when the discussion didn’t conclude with a signature.
Yet he is also bracing for a backlash. “This has been spun by the NRA as we’re trying to repeal the Second Amendment,” Bergh said. “Nothing is further from the truth.”
The movement has gained momentum since last month, when a shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso killed 22 people. A day later, nine people were shot and killed in Dayton, Ohio.
“Gun violence in America is not inevitable; it’s preventable,” the business leaders wrote. “We need our lawmakers to support common-sense gun laws that could prevent tragedies like these.”
In addition to the expanded background checks, they are pressing the government to let federal courts issue temporary orders keeping guns out of the hands of people considered at risk of violence, under what is known as a red-flag law.
A week ago, Walmart, the largest retailer and employer in the country, wrote its own letter to Congress, pushing for a debate over reauthorizing an assault weapons ban. It also announced that it was removing certain ammunition and guns from its shelves and would discourage “open carry” in its stores. Other retailers followed suit by changing their open-carry policies, including Kroger, CVS, Walgreens and the Wegmans grocery chain.
The letter signers Thursday include the leaders of Airbnb, the Gap, Pinterest, Lyft, the Brookfield Property Group and Royal Caribbean.
Missing from the list, however, are some of America’s biggest financial and technology companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, some of which debated internally whether to sign the letter.
Two companies that signed may raise eyebrows in Washington: Thrive Capital, whose founder, Joshua Kushner, is the brother of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, and Bain Capital, the private equity firm co-founded by Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.
The letter is the latest example of the business community’s stepping into a sensitive political area — sometimes reluctantly — during the Trump presidency. Business leaders have criticized Trump’s immigration policy and his response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. On guns, the president has on several occasions offered support for stronger firearms policies before stepping away.
Some of the letter signers plan to lobby lawmakers in Washington, but it is unclear how much money, if any, the companies may devote to this issue.
Some executives signed on without hesitation. Others mulled it, often creating a raucous debate inside their offices and among their boards of directors, only to decide that the political risk was too high. More than a half-dozen executives spoke about their deliberations on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of conversations.
Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook did not sign, although he told colleagues and peers that he agreed with stricter background checks, two people involved in the conversation said. With Facebook under federal scrutiny — and contending with a drumbeat of criticism from Republicans who contend that the company’s platform silences conservative voices — Zuckerberg has decided that activism on this issue would only intensify the spotlight on the company, these people said. Others inside Facebook made the case that it was a moral responsibility to press for more responsible gun sales laws.
Similar concerns were raised by the leadership at Google, whose YouTube unit was the site of a shooting last year. Google recently announced an internal policy that would make it hard for the company to consider signing the letter. That policy includes this line: “Our primary responsibility is to do the work we’ve each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about nonwork topics.”
Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, signed. His company’s policy bans guns from its vehicles, either for drivers or passengers. Once he signed, Lyft, Uber’s main rival, signed as well.
Several executives said one of the biggest practical worries was whether taking such a stance would lead to in-store confrontations with angry customers carrying guns. Would they be putting their employees in danger or even just in an uncomfortable discussion about a divisive issue?
Even banks like Citigroup and Bank of America, which both publicly distanced themselves from gunmakers this year by ending lending and banking relationships with manufacturers, declined to sign the letter. After they made their positions public this year, the banks were rebuked by Republican lawmakers. Louisiana passed a law preventing the banks from working on bond offerings for the state.
“I personally believe the policies of these banks are an infringement on the rights of Louisiana citizens,” the state’s treasurer, John Schroder, said at the time. “No one can convince me that keeping these two banks in this competitive process is worth giving up our rights.”
For better or worse, business leaders are increasingly carving out positions on social issues. It’s not new — and the Hobby Lobby fight against the contraceptive provision of the Affordable Care Act shows us that such positioning does not confine itself to progressive causes — but it is growing.
In some cases, those maneuvers have happened out of necessity, as when top executives could not count on a strong response from Washington after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. That touched off a flurry of calls between some of the country’s top finance executives about how to handle a conference being hosted by Saudi Arabia, whose crown prince had been implicated in Khashoggi’s disappearance.
But over the last three years, businesses have become engaged on social issues like immigration, climate change and race in a way that would have been unfathomable a decade ago. On Thursday, businesses turned to the problem of gun violence.
The letter suggested that background checks on all gun sales were a “common-sense solution with overwhelming public support.” A number of polls have put backing for such policies above 90%.
The market is demanding action — and businesses are listening.

Texto completo: Most who know me (or have read these articles) probably know that I have daughter named Ruby who is the center of my world, but what you may not know is that Ruby was named after my great-grandmother, whom we lovingly called Mamo. My Mamo was a small but mighty woman who could easily beat any chef in the state. Her German chocolate cake was to die for. I remember going to Mamo's house every Saturday growing up and helping her shell peas, can preserves, or sneaking a taste of whatever it was she was cooking for the day. That was our routine until around my junior or senior year in high school. Around that time, Mamo was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and had to go live with my great-aunt in Houston. Mamo passed away in 2005, but one thing I will always cherish is that no matter what the disease may have caused her to forget, she never forgot me, and I, in turn, will never forget her.
Alzheimer's disease is a very tough disease that has lasting effects on those who suffer from the disease and the families who care for them. According to the Alzheimer's Association (www.alz.org), 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease and more than 16 million Americans provide unpaid care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias.
That is why I am so happy that Shreve Memorial Library has partnered with HOPEFUL: 8th Annual Alzheimer's & Caregivers' Symposium to host a "Meet the Authors" event on Friday, Sep. 13 at 1 p.m. at the Cedar Grove/Line Avenue Branch. Several authors from around the country will share their stories and experiences with Alzheimer's disease and caring for loved ones. Authors attending include Jennifer Freeman Liles, author of Heart of a Champion: The Life and Legacy of Coach Bill Freeman; Gwendolyn McMillan Lawe, author of "Taking Care of Mother: An Age of Transition"; Nick Mann, author of "Forgetful"; and Leah Stanley, author of "Goodnight, Sweet: A Caregiver's Long Goodbye".
HOPEFUL: 8th Annual Alzheimer's & Caregivers' Symposium will take place the following day, Saturday, Sept. 14 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Mrs. Eddie B. Jones Special Programs Center located at 2226 Murphy Street. The symposium is a free event that offers information about Alzheimer's disease and hope to caregivers. Special guest speakers include behavioral neurologist Dr. Mark Pippenger of Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina, Dr. Elizabeth Disbrow of LSU Health Science Center for Brain Health, and Attorney Joseph Gilsoul. The symposium is produced by Mrs. Roslyn Thibodeaux Goodall, and the St. Matthew AME Church hosts the free event. For more information or to register for the symposium, visit Eventbrite and search for HOPEFUL or call 318-570-9255.
What's New at the Library
"Someone We Know" by Shari Lapena (fiction)
The new domestic suspense novel from New York Times bestselling author, Shari Lapena. Maybe you don't know your neighbors as well as you thought you did... "This is a very difficult letter to write. I hope you will not hate us too much... My son broke into your home recently while you were out." In a quiet, leafy suburb in upstate New York, a teenager has been sneaking into houses – and into the owners' computers as well – learning their secrets, and maybe sharing some of them, too. Who is he, and what might he have uncovered? After two anonymous letters are received, whispers start to circulate, and suspicion mounts. And when a woman down the street is found murdered, the tension reaches the breaking point. Who killed her? Who knows more than they're telling? And how far will all these very nice people go to protect their own secrets? In this neighborhood, it's not just the husbands and wives who play games. Here, everyone in the family has something to hide... You never really know what people are capable of.
"The Yankee Widow" by Linda Lael Miller (fiction)
A richly layered, emotional novel about one woman's courage and the choices she must make in the face of a dangerous war. Caroline is the young wife of Jacob, and together they live on a farm raising their daughter just outside of Gettysburg. When Jacob joins the Northern army, no one anticipates he will not return. Then Caroline gets word that her husband is wounded, and she must find her way alone to Washington City and search among the thousands of casualties to find him. When Jacob succumbs to his injuries, she brings his body home on the eve of the deadliest battle of the war. With troops and looters roaming the countryside, it is impossible to know who is friend and who is foe. Caroline fights to protect those she holds most dear while remaining compassionate to the neediest around her, including two strangers from opposite sides of the fight. Each is wounded... Each is drawn to her beauty, her kindness. Both offer comfort, but only one secretly captures her heart. Still, she must resist exposing her vulnerability in these uncertain times when so much is at risk.
"Ghosts of Gold Mountain" by Gordon H. Chang (non-fiction)
A groundbreaking, breathtaking history of the Chinese workers who built the Transcontinental Railroad, helping to forge modern America only to disappear into the shadows of history until now. From across the sea, they came by the thousands, escaping war and poverty in southern China to seek their fortunes in America. Converging on the enormous western worksite of the Transcontinental Railroad, the migrants spent years dynamiting tunnels through the snow-packed cliffs of the Sierra Nevada and laying tracks across the burning Utah desert. Their sweat and blood fueled the ascent of an interlinked, industrial United States. But those of them who survived this perilous effort would suffer a different kind of death – a historical one, as they were pushed first to the margins of American life and then to the fringes of public memory. In this groundbreaking account, award-winning scholar Gordon H. Chang draws on unprecedented research to recover the Chinese railroad workers' stories and celebrate their role in remaking America. An invaluable correction of a great historical injustice, Ghosts of Gold Mountain returns these "silent spikes" to their rightful place in our national saga.

Texto completo: A Shelby County woman alleged in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday that New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown sexually assaulted and raped her in 2017 and 2018.
In the complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of Florida and obtained by USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday night, Britney Taylor, 28, claims that Brown sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions in 2017 while she was helping to train him for an upcoming NFL season. She alleges he raped her on May 20, 2018.
The complaint also states Taylor was born and raised in Memphis, began her college gymnastics career at Central Michigan and later transferred to LSU. Taylor's bio on the LSU athletics website lists her as a graduate of Ridgeway High School.
Brown's lawyer, Darren Heitner, said in a statement that his client had a "consensual personal relationship" with Taylor but denied raping or sexually assaulting her.
"Mr. Brown denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit," Heitner wrote in the statement. "He will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but to also protect other professional athletes against false allegations."
The NFL and the Patriots did not immediately respond to requests for comment from USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday night.
In a statement released through her attorney, David Haas, Taylor said the decision to come forward was "incredibly difficult."
"As a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision. I have found strength in my faith, my family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault. Speaking out removes the shame that I have felt for the past year and places it on the person responsible for my rape. I will cooperate with the NFL and any other agencies; however, at this time, I respectfully request that the media please respect my privacy."
USA TODAY does not typically identify victims of sexual assault unless they decide to come forward publicly, as Taylor has in this case.
In a statement released to The New York Times, which first reported the existence of the lawsuit, Taylor said the decision to come forward was "incredibly difficult" and that she will cooperate with the NFL in any forthcoming investigation.
According to the complaint, Taylor opened a gymnastics training center (Taylor'ed Gymnastics Training Center) in 2016 in Memphis.
Brown joined the Patriots this week after a tumultuous training camp with the Oakland Raiders.

Texto completo: What's on TV
MR. INBETWEEN 10 p.m. on FX. Toggling between work and family life can be a challenge no matter your profession, but it's especially trying for Ray Shoesmith, the contract killer at the center of this series. Outside of work, Ray is also raising a young daughter and trying to foster a new, post-divorce relationship. Played by the Australian actor and writer Scott Ryan, Ray spent the first season both nurturing life and taking it away, easing his daughter into the news that Santa isn't real in one scene and having a shootout in another. In his review of that season for The New York Times, Mike Hale referred to the show as "another dark comedy about the divided soul of the 21st century male, caught between rage and cuddly vulnerability -- in dramatic terms, between Scorsese and 'Everybody Loves Raymond."' The story, Hale added, "deftly and dryly exploits the gap between Ray's violent occupation and his efforts to be a good father, boyfriend, brother, ex-husband and mentor." Ray will continue straddling that gap in the second season, which debuts Thursday.
What's Streaming
THE VICTIM Stream on BritBox. Kelly Macdonald ("Boardwalk Empire") and John Hannah ("Four Weddings and a Funeral") star in this British mini-series. The seed of the story is the murder of a young boy. Years after that crime, the boy's mother, Anna (Macdonald), is accused of leaking the identity of the man she believes is the killer. The leak results in a brutal attack on the supposed killer, which leads to Anna being investigated as an accessory to the new crime. (Hannah plays the detective on the case.) It's a sinuous plot that does everything it can to keep viewers questioning their own conclusions. "The title is great because you're wondering who the victim is," Macdonald recently told The Guardian. "Reading the script, my allegiances were switching, so I hope it's the same for viewers."
BE NATURAL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF ALICE GUY-BLACHÉ (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Alice Guy Blaché was a pioneer of early cinema, credited as both the first woman movie director and first woman studio head. But many people haven't heard of her. This documentary, directed by Pamela B. Green, is a step toward changing that. To shed light on Guy Blaché's overlooked career, Green documents her own mission to track down artifacts from the filmmaker's life and search for any descendants. "The result," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, "is occasionally a little frantic -- animated segments sometimes bring the past to life and sometimes get in the way -- and often tremendously moving."
ARCHIBALD'S NEXT BIG THING Stream on Netflix. In 2014, the "Veep" and "Arrested Development" actor Tony Hale co-wrote a children's book about an awkward young chicken named Archibald struggling to come into his own. Hale voices Archibald in this animated adaptation, which also brings together the voices of other celebrities including Rosamund Pike, RuPaul and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

Purdue Pharma settles opioids case

Texto completo: Purdue Pharma and its owners, members of the Sackler family, have tentatively reached the first comprehensive settlement with lawyers representing thousands of municipal governments, tribes and states nationwide that are suing the pharmaceutical industry for the devastation resulting from the opioid epidemic.
The company is expected to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy imminently. The settlement, which was described by two people involved in the negotiations, involves the dissolution of Purdue Pharma as it now exists, the formation of a new company that will continue to sell its signature opioid, OxyContin, with the proceeds going to a public beneficiary company that will pay the plaintiffs. Purdue Pharma also will donate “rescue” drugs, several of which are in development, for addiction treatment and overdose reversal.
The Sackler family will pay $3 billion in cash over seven years.
The settlement does not include a statement of wrongdoing.
The company declined to comment.
The settlement is a landmark moment in the long-running effort to compel Purdue Pharma, the company whose drug is seen as an early driver of the crisis, and its owners, the Sacklers, to have their day of reckoning for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people from overdoses and the calamitous systemic costs.
The settlement comes scarcely six weeks before the start of the first federal trial in the sprawling opioid litigation in front of a federal judge in Cleveland who has recently issued tough pretrial rulings against the defendants — drug manufacturers including Purdue, as well as drug distributors and chain retailers. Although other manufacturers have already settled in that case, as well as in an earlier state opioid trial in Oklahoma, the Purdue agreement is the first so-called “global” arrangement. Negotiated by a team of five lawyers representing nearly 2,300 lawsuits in federal court, as well as by lawyers for the states, the resolution would end almost all of the cases against Purdue.
But because the deal falls short of what some state attorneys general had insisted upon, they have said that they will continue to pursue the Sacklers themselves. In recent weeks, perhaps in anticipation of legal fortresses built by the Sacklers to guard their fortune, which Forbes estimated to be about $13 billion, more states, including Virginia, New Mexico and Delaware, have been filing cases against members of the family. The states have used an array of legal tactics, hoping for an even bigger payout from the Sacklers and to force them out of the pharmaceutical business altogether.
A critical sticking point has been the timing of the family’s sale of its global pharmaceutical business, Mundipharma, and the contribution the family would make from the proceeds. Some attorneys general, including those from Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut, who have not signed on to the settlement, had been pressing the family to sell the company immediately and to discontinue manufacturing drugs for international markets. And regardless of what price Mundipharma fetched, the attorneys general said, they wanted the Sacklers to commit an additional $1.5 billion up front.
The family refused to do so.
“Connecticut has not agreed to any settlement,” William Tong, the state’s attorney general, said in a statement. “Our position remains firm and unchanged and nothing for us has changed today.” He added: “I cannot predict whether Purdue will seek bankruptcy, but all I can say is we are ready to aggressively pursue this case wherever it goes — whether it is in the Connecticut courts or through bankruptcy.”
Often when a company goes into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, all litigation against it is stayed. The deconstruction and evolution of Purdue would now be presumably overseen by a bankruptcy judge and, eventually, trustees appointed to assemble a new, transparent board, which would not include any of the Sacklers.
Still unclear is what the distribution of any Purdue and Sackler money would look like for 23 states and nearly 2,300 local governments and tribes that signed onto the deal, as well as for the federal government, which has been investigating the company, plus hospitals, insurers and a group representing infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which have also brought lawsuits.
Another significant question to be resolved is where, legally and practically, the settlement would leave the Sacklers themselves. They are not the company nor, apparently, are they insolvent and in need of bankruptcy protection. Whether they would be legally insulated by the settlement is in dispute.
One question is whether the Sacklers’ payouts in the settlement would bind them into Purdue’s bankruptcy proceeding and therefore halt the lawsuits against them as well as the company. Purdue is expected to file for bankruptcy in New York, which has occasionally looked favorably upon such conditions.
Many of the two dozen states that have named individual Sacklers as defendants have said that the family has been intentionally taking billions of dollars out of the company ever since 2007, when Purdue and its executives paid a $635 million fine to resolve federal civil and criminal charges related to the “misbranding” of OxyContin.
Legally speaking, this is known as “fraudulent conveyance,” and it could very well be a claim for the states to pursue in bankruptcy court. Some states have been aggressively hunting for where the Sacklers have deposited their money, particularly the New York attorney general’s office, which recently issued 33 subpoenas, including to offshore holding companies.
The Sacklers, however, have long said that whatever funds they withdrew from Purdue were appropriate dividends from a company they owned and directed.

Texto completo: “I know the system from the inside out, so trust me when I say we have a problem with mass incarceration in America. Trust me when I say we have a problem with accountability. Trust me when I say we have to take the profit out of criminal justice.” These are the words of presidential candidate Kamala Harris in an interview with the New York Times on her recently-unveiled criminal justice plan. She asks voters to put their faith in her because of her experience, but it’s her experience that shows voters exactly why they should think twice about that.
Harris’s new plan begins with an introduction that attempts once more to paint the self-portrait she’s persistently pushed throughout her campaign: one of a reform-minded prosecutor who “has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system.” She’s seen them alright—and personally contributed to them. As Tulsi Gabbard aptly noted in the last debate, Harris was far from a reformer during her prosecutor days. In fact, she was notoriously tough on crime.
But she’s apparently had a pretty recent change of heart.
In her new plan, Harris proposes ending the war on drugs, claiming marijuana legalization is the first step toward that. It’s an excellent proposition and fairly mainstream among the Democratic candidates, but it’s certainly not something that Harris has always stood by.
Historically, she opposed the legalization of marijuana, and as a San Francisco District Attorney, she oversaw hundreds of marijuana convictions. Although she may not have been directly involved in the convictions, she had immense power to direct her attorneys which marijuana cases to prosecute, and what punishments to pursue. Yet, despite how sorry she is for all of the lives she’s had a part in ruining during her tenure as lead prosecutor, she’s done nothing to help those particular people.
Among her plans, too, we find a proposed effort to expunge marijuana-related criminal records and create a grant program from marijuana sales tax to help those most adversely affected by the drug war. Sure, these policies are noble, but they’re not a total ceasefire in the drug war by any means. After all, this is where Harris’s plan here falls flat. Aside from legalizing marijuana, she supports reducing the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. That’s a change that is certainly important, but, in terms of drug reform, it’s low-hanging fruit.
Proposing pre- arrest diversion programs, legalizing safe injection sites, descheduling drugs and loosening academic study restrictions are all strong policies that would help end the drug war. But she didn’t make any of those suggestions.
As a San Francisco District Attorney, Harris opposed the use of drug courts for those charged with drug related crimes—another action which is not cohesive with ending the drug war which she now supports. Drug courts are great, because they’re set up to provide an alternative sentencing route for individuals so they can be connected with the resources and treatment they need, rather than sticking them straight into prison.
But as Reason Magazine reports, Harris complained that people “learned how to manipulate the system by simply claiming to be addicts.” She proposed barring individuals from drug court if they had ever sold any quantity of drugs in the past—even if they needed addiction help. This means prison time for low-level drug offenders who, somehow, she’s had a wild change of mind about.
That same goes for her stance of the cash bail system. Money bail disproportionately harms low- income individuals, because they can’t afford to buy their way out of pretrial incarceration the way the wealthy can. They remain in jail—sometimes for months on end—until they can find a way to post bail or until their court date comes around.
Though Harris has sponsored legislation to end cash bail, this fight may dwindle when she becomes president. She previously supported hiking the rates of cash bail, but, of course, this is the exact opposite of what she’s saying now.
Sure, Harris’s criminal justice plan has a lot of good proposals. It even calls for accountability by granting the U.S. Department of Justice explicit authority to conduct investigations into prosecutorial offices that commit misconduct.
It’s a bold policy that stands among many other needed reforms outlined found in her plan. But none of this changes the fact that she spent so many years of her life locking people up for the things she’s claiming to be dovish on now. And that’s when she wasn’t trying to become president.
Harris has been caught lying for political gain before, so what’s stopping her from doing it again—especially if it could win her the Oval Office?
For the sake of those who spent years of their lives sitting in prisons because of her terrible policies, it’s a question worth seriously considering.

Booker plan important for Nevada

Texto completo: It's way overdue, but climate change has finally become a potentially game-changing issue for Democratic presidential candidates. When was the last time candidates actually competed to outdo each other with bigger and bolder plans?
Any Democrat would be a huge improvement over the current occupant of White House, who seems bent on accelerating climate change by gutting restrictions on auto emissions, power plants and methane.
But Sen. Cory Booker is injecting an additional priority that's important for Nevada: cleaning up older environmental disasters that have often been neglected because they affect poor and relatively powerless communities.
The issues here aren't about climate change per se, but they are crucial to the goal of environmental justice. If we care about the future, we have to deal with the past. For Booker, that includes cleaning up decades-old Superfund sites as well as thousands of hazardous abandoned mines and toxic waste at sites once used by the Department of Defense.
These are big issues in Nevada, but they are the kind of local problems that usually get lost in national debates.
Nevada has three monster Superfund sites where cleanup has moved at a snail's pace and remains far from complete. At the Anaconda Copper Mine site near Yerington, which shut down 40 years ago, cleanup is just beginning now. The Carson River mercury site, which extends 130 miles downstream from Carson City, still contaminates fish and wildlife through a vast swath of floodplain. Finally, there's the old Rio Tinto copper mine site in Elko County, which has undergone a lot of cleanup but still contaminates waters crucial to the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes' Duck River Reservation.
Booker has also vowed to start cleanups of every abandoned hazardous mining site — Nevada has more 26,000, about 5,000 of which have yet to be secured. He would also start cleanups at contaminated sites formerly used by the Department of Defense — Nevada has 52 of those.
I salute Booker for specifically connecting the global challenge of climate change with the urgent but local needs of American communities that still suffer from environmental failures of the past. As climate change increases the disruption from extreme weather, whether its droughts and floods or fires, many of these communities will once again be among the most vulnerable. They shouldn't be left out.

Texto completo: "Alright, men! You heard him! Code Red! Repeat! We are Code Red Recon Plan Charlie! Execute! Let's move!"
In a memorable scene from Pixar's "Toy Story," the Little Green Army Men parachute from above to help the movie's lead character, Andy, fight back against a neighborhood bully who likes to torture toys. In the process, they got some very big exposure on the silver screen.
Along with the likes of Etch A Sketch, Barrel of Monkeys, Mr. Potato Head and Slinky Dog, the Little Green Army Men flew off the shelves of retail stores after the film grossed $39 million during its first five days at the theater in 1995. In fact, nearly all the classic toys and games featured in the animated film reported rejuvenated sales, The New York Times said.
The Little Green Army Men also appeared in the next three "Toy Story" movies and in other projects, and now the classic toy is breaking the mold in other ways. The line of green plastic soldiers will soon expand to include women.
Jeff Imel, owner of Scranton's BMC Toys, has been updating the company's blog regarding the "plastic Army women project." His first post June 20, 2018, detailed how a retired Navy sailor made a compelling case for why Plastic Army Women may be popular.
Imel agreed, and said the initial concept sketches showed the olive-drab women figurines at 1:32 scale, designed to fit with a wide variety of the plastic figures already in several generations of toy boxes. He solicited the public's feedback through a comments section and an email subscription form.
"Let us know if we're on the right track, or if we're way off our plastic bases," Imel wrote. "If there are enough confirmed subscribers, we'll continue to develop the project."
Fast forward more than a year, and Imel's latest blogs confirm the "amazing and somewhat surreal experience" of wall-to-wall media coverage on the development of Plastic Army Women.
"Every time I think the story has died down, another wave hits, and there are even more stories in progress," he wrote.
It helped that in August, Imel publicized a letter from a 6-year-old girl named Vivian asking, "Why aren't there any girl army men?" He responded to Vivian's mom to let her know about the project, and the story took on a life of its own.
In a recent interview with CBS Evening News, Imel and BMC Toys fully committed to producing a set of Army women figurines for Christmas 2020. The "On the Road with Steve Hartman" story also unveiled an original sculpture of the first figurine in the set, which will be displayed Sept. 22 at the Chicago Toy Soldier Show.
Imel wrote in his latest update that he's overwhelmed by so many messages of support, and has heard from women who wanted a set of Little Green Army Women as children, even back in the 1960s. Many have told him they look forward to sharing a set with their granddaughters and completing the circle of a long-lost childhood wish.
BMC Toys says the figures aren't quite ready for preorders, but they'll develop at least four figures in a set, with about 24 figures per package.
If the first set is popular enough, more sets will be added to the Plastic Army Women collection, Imel said.
He ended the blog by noting, "I'm guided by the thinking that every kid wants to be the hero of their own story ... thanks to movies, video games, and a thriving community of stop motion animators, Plastic Army Men have transcended, representing real soldiers, and now they exist in their own universe."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The secretary of commerce threatened to fire top employees at the federal scientific agency responsible for weather forecasts last Friday after the agency's Birmingham office contradicted President Donald Trump's claim that Hurricane Dorian might hit Alabama, according to three people familiar with the discussion.
That threat led to an unusual, unsigned statement later that Friday by the agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, disavowing the National Weather Service's position that Alabama was not at risk. The reversal caused widespread anger within the agency and drew accusations from the scientific community that the National Weather Service, which is part of the NOAA, had been bent to political purposes.
The NOAA's statement on Friday is now being examined by the Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times, and employees have been asked to preserve their files. The NOAA is a division of the Commerce Department.
The National Weather Service "must maintain standards of scientific integrity," the inspector general, Peggy Gustafson, wrote in a message to NOAA staff members in which she requested documents related to Friday's statement. The circumstances, she wrote, "call into question the NWS's processes, scientific independence, and ability to communicate accurate and timely weather warnings and data to the nation in times of national emergency."
The Commerce Department disputed the account on behalf of the secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross. "Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian," the department said in a statement issued by a spokesman.
The spokesman declined to comment on whether Mr. Ross had spoken with the NOAA administrator or ordered the agency to rebut the statement contradicting the president's assertion about a threat to Alabama.
The Commerce Department's Office of the Inspector General did not respond to requests for comment late Monday.
The accusations against Mr. Ross are the latest developments in a political imbroglio that began more than a week ago, when Dorian was bearing down on the Bahamas and Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that Alabama would be hit "harder than anticipated." A few minutes later, the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Ala., posted on Twitter that "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama."'
Mr. Trump persisted in saying that Alabama was at risk and a few days later, on Sept. 4, he displayed an NOAA map that appeared to have been altered with a black Sharpie to include Alabama in the area potentially affected by Dorian. (Alabama was not struck by the hurricane.)
Mr. Ross, the commerce secretary, intervened two days later, early last Friday, according to the three people familiar with his actions. Mr. Ross phoned Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of the NOAA, from Greece where the secretary was traveling for meetings and instructed Mr. Jacobs to fix the agency's perceived contradiction of the president.
Mr. Jacobs objected to the demand and was told that the political staff at the NOAA would be fired if the situation was not fixed, according to the three individuals, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the episode.

With Stephen King's new book 'The Institute' now on shelves, he's set to speak at Somerville event

Texto completo: Constant Readers, rejoice: On the heels of the release of his latest novel, which hit shelves Tuesday, author Stephen King is slated to speak with fans during a special event at Somerville Theatre next month.
On Oct. 10, the master of horror will sit down alongside his son, author Joe Hill — who also has a new book of short stories coming out, called “Full Throttle" — to discuss their respective works, according to Porter Square Books,which is organizing the event.
Perhaps in keeping with their horror personas, tickets to the father-and-son speaking engagement will go on sale Friday, Sept. 13, the announcement said.
“We hope you'll join us for what is bound to be a memorable evening," the company said in a statement on its website, promoting the author double-feature.
The Maine resident's appearance at the theater will center on the release of “The Institute," a nearly 600-page tale about the “most sinister of institutions," where children with special talents like telekinesis and telepathy are imprisoned and experimented on by corrupt staff who are “dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts."
“As psychically terrifying as 'Firestarter,' and with the spectacular kid power of 'It,' 'The Institute' is Stephen King's gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good vs. evil in a world where the good guys don't always win," according to a description of the book on the author's website.
To remind fans that he wrote a new book, King announced its impending arrival with a tweet this week featuring one of his most iconic monsters: Pennywise the Dancing Clown, from “It."
“Pennywise wants you to know THE INSTITUTE is coming this Tuesday," King said in a post on Twitter that included a GIF of the evil, pale-faced clown, squeezing a red balloon.
Beyond trying to get the word out on social media, which has become one of his central ways of communicating with avid readers, King appeared on “Good Morning America" on Tuesday to discuss “The Institute," his 61st book.
During the start of the sit-down with King, the camera panned to a bookshelf stocked with many of the author's novels. When asked by “GMA" cohost Amy Robach what it was like to see that many of his books together in one spot, King replied, “It's pretty scary, actually."
“All of that came out of my head? I can't believe it's still round," he quipped.
So what else gives the king of the macabre the creeps and keeps him “up at night," the hosts wondered?
“Well," King said, after taking a deep breath, “the current political situation for one thing."
The response from King, who has been an outspoken critic of President Trump and his administration and policies, drew applause and laughter from the crowd.
King said he tries to keep his politics and storytelling separate. But in “The Institute," the two crossed paths.
“There's a little bit in the book," King said on “GMA." (According to the New York Times, the novel takes “more than one overt dig at Trump").
Excitement around King's tales has been brewing on and off the bookshelves recently. Last week, “It: Chapter 2" arrived in theaters nationwide, and in November, “Doctor Sleep," the sequel to King's classic “The Shining," will hit the big screen, starring Ewan McGregor.

Texto completo: As Donald Trump Jr. took the stage at a campaign rally for his dad last night in North Carolina, he took a stab at the media and the anti-sexual harassment #MeToo movement.
After kissing girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, who introduced him to the Fayatteville crowd, Trump Jr. joked that she had consented to it.
"Kimberly, do you think the media's gonna sue me for harassment since I just gave you a little kiss?" Trump Jr. said. "Notice, there's no objection, ok. It's on the record, alright. I will not be getting Me Too'd this evening. "
"Kimberly may Me Too me later but that's a different story," Trump Jr. said to laughter from the crowd.
Guilfoyle is a former Fox News commentator and currently serves as an adviser for the president's re-election campaign.
This is not the first time Trump Jr. has come under fire for flippant remarks about the #MeToo movement. The Hill reported that in March during a discussion on gender identity, Trump Jr. responded to the comment about young boys using guns with "Hashtag Me Too. "
The #MeToo movement, which started nearly two years ago with the investigation into former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, has held men in positions of power accountable for harassment and assault.
The award-winning New York Times journalists who broke the Weinstein story released the book "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement" today.

President Donald Trump has had his share of scrutiny for making light of sexual assault. Last year he joked about the #MeToo movement at a rally, and he is also facing several allegations of sexual misconduct.
Trump rallied Monday night to support Republican Dan Bishop in the House special election taking place today.

Texto completo: Political tribalism keeps getting worse. The demand for unthinking and uncompromising loyalty keeps getting louder. Individuals or institutions that try to maintain a sense of fairness and balance, that don’t want to choose sides in our Uncivil War, are branded as weak-kneed, fainthearted heretics.
Two recent events highlight this dangerous development. First, Fox News was excoriated by President Donald Trump for daring to interview a Democratic Party official. And second, The New York Times was lambasted by liberal critics for a headline that was not, in their view, sufficiently critical of the president’s racist rants.
The parallels, of course, are imprecise. Trump has been eviscerating the press as a campaign strategy for years. But the similarities are still striking.
The president and his leftist critics share an instinct for intolerance: a deep disdain for anyone who strays from the party line, a demand for purity combined with a towering self-righteousness. You have to be on the Red Team or the Blue Team, a Loyalist or a Resister.
Both sides fundamentally misunderstand the role of impartial and independent journalists. We belong to no tribe, root for no team. And if that sounds musty and old-fashioned, well, so does the Constitution, which not only protects a free press but defines it as essential to a healthy democracy.
Trump was so outraged by Fox reporters, pollsters and anchors who dared to question the Lord of the Lies (as opposed to the bootlicking sycophants who inhabit the network’s prime-time schedule) that he tweeted: "The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn’t working for us anymore!"
Fox anchor Neil Cavuto spoke for many of his colleagues when he replied on the air, "Mr. President, we don’t work for you." But Trump doesn’t want to hear that. If you dare to contradict or fact-check the president, you are "all but dead to him," Cavuto added, and the president’s core supporters share his expectation of complete fealty. They’ve told the anchor, he said, that "I am either with him totally, or I am a Never Trumper fully."
But Cavuto firmly rejects that choice, saying, "You’re entitled to your point of view, Mr. President, but you’re not entitled to your own set of facts."
Over on the left, the latest brouhaha was trigged by a Times headline over a story about a Trump speech that read, "Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism." The words were technically accurate, but not nuanced or skeptical enough, and Times editors acknowledged the problem and changed it after the first edition. But that was not nearly enough to quell the bombastic blowback.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the headline served as "a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by — and often relies upon — the cowardice of mainstream institutions."
Sen. Cory Booker upped her on the outrage meter, tweeting, "Lives literally depend on you doing better."
Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Obama, told Politico: "A vast swath of Democratic voters are pretty angry at the media. They see a racist liar in the White House, and a media too afraid to call him a racist or a liar."
At a meeting of New York Times staffers, one told editor Dean Baquet that the paper was "actively misleading" readers by being too soft on Trump.
But Baquet, like Cavuto, hit back. "Our readers and some of our staff cheer us when we take on Donald Trump, but they jeer at us when we take on Joe Biden," he told the staff meeting. "They sometimes want us to pretend that he was not elected president, but he was elected president. And our job is to figure out why, and how, and to hold the administration to account. If you’re independent, that’s what you do."
Baquet told CNN that there is a "generational divide" in the newsroom, and the meeting made clear there’s a racial one as well, with reporters of color among the loudest critics of their own bosses. But Baquet — the first African American editor of the Times — is determined to resist their pressure. "Our role is not to be the leader of the resistance," he insists.
We believe deeply in the traditions that Cavuto and Baquet are defending. No news organization is perfect, but at their best, they don’t work for the right or the left — for Trump or his rivals, for the Reds or the Blues. They are not Loyalists or Resisters.
They are simply journalists — fact-finders, truth-tellers — and more valuable than ever.

Texto completo: The director of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology research lab who resigned from the university over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein has also resigned from the board of the MacArthur Foundation and two other organizations.
New York Times Publisher A.G. Sulzberger and the company's president, Mark Thompson, said in a companywide email Saturday that former Media Lab director Joi Ito has resigned from the board of The New York Times Co. "effective immediately."
The Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, which is headquartered in Miami, also announced Ito's resignation from their boards.
The New Yorker reported Friday that Media Lab had a more extensive fundraising relationship with Epstein than it previously acknowledged and tried to conceal the extent of the relationship.
MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote in a letter to the university community Saturday that the report contained "deeply disturbing allegations." He has ordered an independent investigation.
Reif said last month that MIT took about $800,000 from Epstein over 20 years. That announcement followed the resignation of two prominent researchers from Media Lab over revelations the lab and Ito took money from Epstein after he served time a decade ago for sex offenses involving underage girls.
The New Yorker reports Epstein arranged at least $7.5 million in donations, including $2 million from Microsoft founder Bill Gates and $5.5 million from investor Leon Black.
Epstein killed himself in jail in New York on Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Texto completo: The Kelleys were considering moving out of state before tragedy hit Thousand Oaks. What kept them here was the support they saw after the Borderline Bar & Grill mass shooting and the Woolsey fire.
“The support, immediate, massive and ongoing support,” said Mike Kelley on Monday. “This is home.”
“Home” is getting a “Healing Garden” at Conejo Creek North Park in Thousand Oaks to honor 12 innocent lives lost.
The Garden began its march toward completion Monday as crews began construction on the Thousand Oaks memorial, with a goal of finishing it by Nov. 7, the one-year anniversary of the Borderline mass shooting.
A skip loader moved dirt just south of an existing pond, home to turtles and koi. And soon, the sounds of loaders and crews will give way to a place of reflection.
The Healing Garden will be built at Conejo Creek North Park, the city’s most popular park.
It will honor:
* RON HELUS : The Ventura County Sheriff sergeant was shot running into the Borderline Bar to help.
* CODY COFFMAN : The 22-year-old had been meeting with recruiters and planned to enlist in the Army.
* JUSTIN MEEK: He worked as a promoter at Borderline Bar. The 23-year-old was a former student at Cal Lutheran.
* NOEL SPARKS: She was a Moorpark College student who liked horseback riding.
* ALAINA HOUSLEY: The 18-year-old was a Pepperdine University freshman who aimed to study law.
* TELEMACHUS ORFANOS: He had the misfortune of being at the Las Vegas mass shooting and the one in Thousand Oaks.
* SEAN ADLER: He was a security guard at the bar, but he has just opened his dream business: a coffeehouse.
* DANIEL MANRIQUE: He was an ex-Marine sergeant who dedicated his life to helping emotionally scarred veterans get back on their feet.
* BLAKE DINGMAN: This 21-year-old Newbury Park resident played high school baseball at Hillcrest Christian School in Thousand Oaks.
* JAKE DUNHAM: He always answers his phone, his father said, but it just keeps ringing.
* KRISTINA MORISETTE : She graduated from Simi Valley High School and reportedly worked as a cashier at the bar.
* MARKY MEZA JR .: He worked as a busboy and food runner at the bar and would have turned 21 in less than two weeks.
READ THEIR STORIES here
A group comprised of city and park officials, Ventura County sheriff’s officials and Cal Lutheran staff recommended building the memorial at the park by the one-year anniversary of the shooting.
Thousand Oaks Mayor Rob McCoy said officials were unwilling to let the building of a memorial languish for years, as it has for the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
“We wanted to have that in place (in Thousand Oaks) because we’ll never forget that day,” McCoy told the Daily News in June, when the garden’s design was unveiled. “While it’s a place for the families to come, it’s a place for the entire city to come. Every resident, over 160,000 residents were affected.”
And so, officials are on a fast track to having it completed by that November anniversary date.
When it’s done, the “Borderline 12” will be represented by a fountain feature with 12 vertical jets in the center of a pond, according to the city’s plan.
The scene will symbolize the broader community. There will be a contemplation area, where a shoreline will include seating and landscaping. A large Oak will be planted bordering the garden area. A boulder will introduce visitors to the Healing Garden at its entryway.
There will be 12 large natural stone-slab benches along the plaza — granite to illustrate the strength of the community. A unique color will designate 248 pavers in a scene that will represent the number of survivors from that night. And at the site’s north end, the existing Lakeside Pavilion will offer space for community events and other gatherings.
On June 25, the city of Thousand Oaks approved a grant agreement with Conejo Recreation and Park District for $250,000 to provide funding for the construction.
Since November, Borderline has itself become a place of reflection.
Kelley touched one of twelve crosses at the makeshift memorial outside the closed club. It was there for Jake Dunham, one of the 12 victims and Kelley’s Newbury Park neighbor. Kelley and his wife watched Dunham grow up.
“He was a force,” Kelley said of the young man who rode motorcycles and worked on his truck with friends in the family garage.
“Watching his mother light his lantern (one of 12) and set it free was the single most emotional event I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kelley said.
The question is where will all the photos, bibles, cowboy boots, rocks, hearts and the ceramic “Love” and “Peace” sculpture end up after the formal memorial is built.
Since the Borderline massacre, 2019 has continued to be a year in which gun violence in the United States is taking a deadly toll.
According to Mass Shooting Tracker, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot (but not necessarily killed), there have been 352 such incidents in the United States this year.
And of those, according to the New York Times, which compiled MST’s and other data for a report, there were 38 shootings by the end of August in which three or more people were killed (the Department of Justice defines a mass killing as an episode in which three or more are killed). That number — 38 — includes the shooting in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 3, in which 22 were killed.

Trump administration clashes with CNN over secret Russian source

Texto completo: The U.S. extracted a high-level covert source close to the Kremlin from Russia in 2017, in part over concerns that President Trump’s handling of classified information might put the asset at risk, per a new report.

But the Trump administration promptly pushed back against the claim that the Russian source was pulled out of the country over fears that Trump might be putting him at risk.
CNN cited sources Monday alleging that the decision to exfiltrate the Russian informant, amid worries that the source might be exposed, happened after Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office. During that May 2017 meeting, Trump disclosed some classified information about an anti-ISIS operation in Syria to the Russians. The intelligence had been provided to the U.S. by Israel.

Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said “CNN's reporting is not only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger.”
“CNN's narrative that the Central Intelligence Agency makes life-or-death decisions based on anything other than objective analysis and sound collection is simply false,” said CIA public affairs director Brittany Bramell. “Misguided speculation that the President's handling of our nation's most sensitive intelligence — which he has access to each and every day — drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate.”
An article from the Washington Post in June 2017 revealed the existence of a Kremlin source close to Russian President Vladimir Putin who reportedly claimed that Russia’s election interference was directed by Putin himself. CIA Director John Brennan allegedly fed this sensitive material to President Barack Obama and a small circle of aides.

One day after Trump granted Attorney General William Barr broad declassification authority in his review of the Trump-Russia investigation in May 2019, the New York Times hinted at fears that Barr’s investigation of the investigators might put the United State's Kremlin sources at risk, but CNN says at least one informant left Russia two years prior.

“I am confident that the attorney general will work with the intelligence community in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly sensitive classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk,” then-Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said at the time.iFrame Object

It was Friday afternoon, less than 24 hours before Pitt played Ohio. No one at Dad's Pub&Grub in Braddock Hills knew the Panthers would beat the Bobcats, and at the time, no one cared. Not in the moment, at least. Everyone sitting at the bar - from Hillgrove, the voice of the Panthers, to the workers on lunch break - had their eyes peeled to SportsCenter as Antonio Brown's ongoing antics were dissected.
Thank God we traded him.
Not our problem anymore.
Hillgrove couldn't help but crack a smile. The 78-year-old thought he had seen it all.
Of course, he has seen a lot. Pitt's play-by-play radio broadcaster has called Panther football games since 1974 - his voice describing more than 500 games, 27 bowls and a national title.
The broadcaster's career isn't ending anytime soon. That's not where this story is going. Hillgrove said he'll keep calling games "as long as it's fun." "Why would I not?" he asked. "I'm like a golf pro. What do I retire to?"
However, a chapter of Hillgrove's life is coming to a close: He has accepted that next Saturday's Pitt-Penn State game will likely be his last from the booth.
The 100th meeting between Pitt and Penn State is the schools' final matchup for the foreseeable future. After a 16-year hiatus, a brief four-game renewal served as a reminder of one of college football's historic rivalries. But beyond 2019, there's no return in sight. Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke has expressed interest in continuing the series. But Penn State, as of athletic director Sandy Barbour's comments in 2016, can't make it work schedule-wise until at least 2030.
Hillgrove, frankly, isn't even optimistic it'll be that soon. The longtime Pitt figure believes it would take a drastic change in conference alignment to reunite Pitt and Penn State on the field.
"In my opinion - in your lifetime, not mine - there will be one more earthquake in the NCAA landscape," Hillgrove said. "Notre Dame will get caught up in it, and I'm hoping Pitt, Penn State and West Virginia all end up in the same geographic conference or division. I think that's going to happen."
Hillgrove, after suggesting significant alterations to Power 5 football (or Power 4 football?), took a bite of his macaroni and cheese and sat in silence. He let the idea float around the bar for a minute or two as The Beatles' "Come Together" played over the speakers, irony at an all-time high.
"I don't know what's going to create it," Hillgrove later admitted. "But a fault, in terms of earthquakes, would be the Big 12. They're the most strung out geographically, and from a power position, they're the weakest of the others. If they came apart and went to other conferences, you can see that earthquake happening."
As it stands, college football's major conferences are stable. So are their TV contracts.
The ACC and ESPN - which recently launched the ACC Network - agreed to a 20-year rights extension in 2016. The same year, the Big Ten signed a six-year deal with ESPN and Fox. The Big 12 cut a deal with ESPN (and, by extension, ESPN+) in April. You get the idea. "Conference shifts and people moving have been happening since the dawn of time. That's nothing new," Texas AD Chris Del Conte told the Sports Business Journal in December. "But right now, it's very calm. I don't see any movement right now."
Maybe that changes in the distant future. Or as Hillgrove put it, in a younger person's lifetime. Perhaps, someday, Joe Paterno's old plan for an eastern conference catches a second wind.
It's well-known that in 1981, Paterno - then serving as Penn State's athletic director, as well as its head football coach - pitched a conference for East Coast programs. It would have included Pitt, West Virginia, Syracuse, Boston College, Rutgers, Temple and Maryland, at least. But the league never came to be. Pitt basketball joined Syracuse and Boston College in the Big East in '82, and the conference started football in '91, adding West Virginia, Temple and Rutgers to the picture.
Paterno's dream disintegrated. But linking up with those schools wasn't out of the question. Former Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese told The New York Times in 2009 that the Big East had an opportunity to bring Nittany Lion basketball into the fold in '82, back when founder Dave Gavitt still ran the league. "Dave wanted to go to Penn State and extend the invitation," Tranghese said. "But he couldn't if we didn't have the votes. And we had eight teams and needed six votes and it was a 5-3 vote."
Hillgrove said he heard Paterno was interested years ago.
"From Dave Gavitt's mouth to my ears, not once but twice: Joe Paterno tried to get into the Big East. Twice. And twice he was turned down because he didn't bring a basketball market with him," Hillgrove said, wagging his finger. "Paterno likes everyone to think that Pitt scuttled the eastern conference plans, but that wasn't the case."
If Penn State basketball was welcomed into the Big East, Tranghese said, Penn State, Pitt, Boston College and Syracuse football "probably would have agreed to play and continue as independents." If that happens, does Pitt-Penn State take a crippling break from 2001 through 2015? Does the rivalry continue past 2019? Who knows?
What's for certain is, Hillgrove will remember Pitt-Penn State for what it was. He'll remember the Panthers' heartbreaking loss in '75, a 7-6 defeat due to a blocked extra point and three missed field goals. He'll remember Pitt's 24-7 win in '76, when Johnny Majors' side "arrived as a major power" and later won the national title.
Hillgrove will enjoy Pitt-Penn State while he has it, believing he won't have it for much longer.
"It's like someone stole Mother's Day," Hillgrove said of the series' hiatus and dreary future. "It used to be the best rivalry, the highest-rated rivalry. ABC loved it. End of the year, bragging rights for the whole offseason. ... I look forward to get up

Iggy Pop, 'Sonali'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Iggy Pop's new album, "Free," relies on jazz-rooted collaborators for most of its words and music, particularly the trumpeter, keyboardist and producer Leron Thomas. "Sonali" suggests what Iggy might have sounded like backed by Weather Report. He sings its semi-absurdist lyrics -- "Do like the Romans/pop melatonin" -- over a rushing, fluttering, quasi-waltz that hurries toward an undisclosed destination, whimsical but driven. JON PARELES
Björk, 'Features Creatures' (The Knife Remix)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Björk and Karin Dreijer -- who has recorded in a duo, the Knife, andsolo as Fever Ray -- agreed to trade remixes. Dreijer applied both groups' different personae to Björk's "Features Creatures," a song from the album "Utopia" that was a free-floating soliloquy about the nature of attraction, squaring it off and finding beats for it. As Fever Ray, Dreijer set Björk's vocals atop a half-remembered girl-group beat, weighted with a throbbing low synthesizer. The Knife's remix suggests a happier flirtation, with a plinking, strutting, carnival-like beat and synthesizers hooting like air horns. Björk, meanwhile, went bleak: She excised all the pop elements and doubled down on the most brutal impacts of Fever Ray's "This Country," for a profanity-laced (and retitled) revamp of the song. PARELES
Camila Cabello, 'Liar'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Uncontrollable desire is Camila Cabello's recurring topic, and it figures in both songs she just released: "Shameless," which shamelessly echoes Rihanna's belting in "We Found Love," and "Liar," a canny pan-Caribbean and Spanish mélange. As she sings about how a certain kiss makes her lose control despite herself -- "Clothes are on the floor," she notes at the end -- the ultra-canny track segues from mariachi horns to the stark electronics of Latin trap to flamenco handclaps (hello, Rosalía!) to a ska-pop chorus: border-hopping at the speed of pop. PARELES
Los Wembler's de Iquitos, 'Los Wembler's para el Mundo'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The sound of Los Wembler's de Iquitos hasn't changed a lot since 1968, when these five Peruvian brothers (at that time led by their father) began putting their stamp on the wobbly, psychedelic, surf-rock-indebted, Afro-Latin jungle funk known as chicha. But there's enough depth and delirium in this music for it to stay fresh, even today. A few years ago the group mounted a successful comeback, and briefly toured the United States for the first time. "Los Wembler's para el Mundo," from a new album, is a well-deserved victory lap, and a paean to their own powers. In it they sing (in Spanish) of traveling "from the jungle to the world," toting a "fascinating rhythm that makes the people dance." GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
Kelsea Ballerini, 'Homecoming Queen?'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This macro version of the micro-level empowerment anthems that Kelsea Ballerini has excelled at isn't quite as effective. Her singing is more measured, her phrasing more deliberate, her emotional keen more even. JON CARAMANICA
Mallrat, 'Drive Me Round'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The peculiarly structured "Drive Me Round" starts out almost sleepwalking, with Grace Shaw -- the Australian songwriter who records as Mallrat -- murmuring, "Are you still awake?/I know you're up late" in a melody that doesn't quite align with the pillowy keyboard chords around it. It's a whispery late-night phone call, one misfit trying to connect with another. Suddenly, about two minutes in, the tempo picks up and Shaw's voice multiplies, imagining love and open roads while repeating "And you drive me round," as if she's lapsed into a blissful dream. PARELES
Tinariwen featuring Warren Ellis, Noura Mint Seymali and Jeiche Ould Chighaly, 'Zawal'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Modal guitar riffs, handclaps, dryly urgent voices: this is what Tinariwen has been doing since the group emerged from the North African desert. The stark six-beat beauty of "Zawal," abetted by Western and African collaborators, carries far more for those who understand its apocalyptic lyrics: "All whose consciences won't leave them in peace are sad/They're living through terrible times and believe the last judgment is nigh." PARELES
Mahalia featuring Ella Mai, 'What You Did'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Vengeance is served chilled in "What You Did" from the new album "Love and Compromise" by the English R&B songwriter Mahalia Burkmar. The tempo is patient, with ticking, twitching drum-machine sounds and samples from Rose Royce's tearful song about loneliness, "I'm Going Down." Mahalia and her grainier-voiced colleague Ella Mai shed no tears. "I know what you did," Mahalia warns, and goes on to calmly inquire, "Tell me is she nice? Does she know I know?" Ella Mai adds details to the indictment with jazzy flourishes. Together, they refuse to forgive. PARELES
Greta Van Fleet, 'Always There'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
On a slow week, why not Greta Van Fleet? This strikingly overlong number is from the soundtrack to "A Million Little Pieces," a film based on the memoir-turned-novel by the fabulist James Frey. Like that author, Greta Van Fleet fudges the details -- a little Zeppelin in the guitar, a little Marc Bolan in the vocals. A hodgepodge of touchstone years: 1974, 1975, 1976, even 1977. But also like that author, this band has a kind of primal instinct, activating long-suppressed pleasure centers that are easy to scoff at, and yet ... CARAMANICA
John Mayer, 'Carry Me Away'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Beautiful cover art. CARAMANICA
Hardy featuring Morgan Wallen, 'He Went to Jared'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Another month in Nashville, another contribution to the ocean full of white-collar/blue-collar romantic square-off songs. "He Went to Jared" is among the funnier of the recent contributions. Hardy and Morgan Wallen are rapscallion-like, and shaggy at the edges -- their singing is lighthearted and unsentimental: "He went to Ole Miss, I went to work/He pushes paper, I push the dirt." CARAMANICA
Stolen Jars, 'Ghost Towns'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In "Ghost Towns," Stolen Jars set up a quick, precise, transparent tangle of counterpoint, with more than a hint of Dirty Projectors. There are stop-start drums, tendrils of guitar, the plink of what might be a marimba and vocal lines that hop around, converge, diverge and eventually reunite, singing about escaping the strictures of the past: "Found my way out, I won't go back to ghost towns." Based in New Jersey and Brooklyn, Stolen Jars is led by the songwriter Cody Fitzgerald, who shares lead vocals with Sarah Coffey; the band's third album is due Oct. 11. PARELES
The Messthetics, 'Touch Earth Touch Sky'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Messthetics' rhythm section -- the drummer Brendan Canty and the bassist Joe Lally, both of Fugazi renown -- is capable of some serious post-hardcore thrash. And the guitar-and-pedals whiz Anthony Pirog has it in him to spin acid arabesques around your head till you can't see straight. But on "Touch Earth Touch Sky," the closer from their second album, the trio isn't trying to outdo or outrun anything. Slow tides of distortion rise and then fade; Canty uses his bass drum to patiently reinforce Pirog's slow, single-note lines. The sonic squall grows melancholy and implacable, like a memory that won't fade away. RUSSONELLO
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

NOAA assailed for defending bogus Trump claim

Texto completo: White House Roundup
WASHINGTON - Former top officials of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are assailing the agency for undermining its weather forecasters as it defends President Donald Trump's erroneous statement from days ago that Hurricane Dorian threatened Alabama.
They say NOAA's action risks the credibility of the nation's weather and science agency and may even risk lives.
Dismay came from those who served under Republican and Democratic presidents alike as leaders in meteorology and disaster response sized up a sustained effort by Trump and his aides to justify his spurious warning that Alabama, among other states, was "most likely" to be hit hard by Dorian, contrary to forecasts showing Alabama was clear.
That effort led NOAA to repudiate a tweet from the National Weather Service the previous weekend assuring Alabamans - accurately - that they had nothing to fear from the hurricane. The weather service is part of NOAA and the tweet came from its Birmingham, Alabama, office.
"This rewriting history to satisfy an ego diminishes NOAA," Elbert "Joe" Friday, former Republican-appointed director of the National Weather Service, said on Facebook.
He told the Associated Press on Saturday: "We don't want to get the point where science is determined by politics rather than science and facts. And I'm afraid this is an example where this is beginning to occur."
Officials discuss
slashing refugee cap
WASHINGTON - Trump administration officials will meet next week to discuss whether to further restrict the number of refugees accepted into the U.S. each year, according to a senior administration official.
Some administration officials believe that the cap should be reduced because of the number of asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border and other protections afforded to migrants who live in war-torn countries or those devastated by natural disasters. Some have argued for the number to be 15,000 or fewer, according to two other administration officials. The officials were not allowed to speak publicly and spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Nothing has been decided. Senior leaders will meet in the Situation Room on Tuesday to discuss the cap, which is set by the president and must be decided before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. The New York Times first reported the meeting.
Right now, the cap is set at 30,000, and 28,501 refugees were accepted between Oct. 1, 2018, and Sept. 6. Last budget year the cap was 45,000 and 22,491 were admitted. That's one-quarter of the number allowed to enter two years ago and the lowest since Congress passed a law in 1980 creating the modern resettlement system.

Fall TV 2019: New shows to watch, try and avoid

Texto completo: Get ready, couch potatoes. This fall’s TV season is more cross-your-fingers-and-hope-for-the-best than viewers would like – but the highs have a chance to soar.
Several anthologies, including Ryan Murphy’s Netflix debut, may be the standouts of the season. The schedule, packed with big names, is also littered with flimsy plots. Still, the beauty of TV is the surprises, not the predictable successes.
We’re here to help, and have weeded through the lineup to help you figure out what’s worth your time. Here are the new shows you should watch, give a try and avoid.
WATCH
“Unbelievable” (premieres Friday on Netflix)
If it’s not too traumatizing to watch, and for some it may be, this could be a defining story of the #MeToo movement. “Unbelievable” is a miniseries based on the ProPublica article about a teen (Kaitlyn Dever) accused of lying about her rape and the two female detectives (Merritt Wever and Toni Collette) who believe her.
“A Little Late with Lilly Singh” (premieres Monday at 1:35 a.m. on NBC)
While the small screen is saturated with talks shows, Lilly Singh is doing something special. The Indian-Canadian YouTube star with almost 15 million subscribers will become the only woman to host a late-night talk show on one of the four major networks when she takes over for Carson Daly.
“Prodigal Son” (premieres Sept. 23 at 9 p.m. on Fox)
In 2019 alone, Michael Sheen has played, to delightful results, a lawyer inspired by Roy Cohn on “The Good Fight” and a literal angel on “Good Omens,” so the logical next step, of course, is a serial killer nicknamed The Surgeon. Everything about it is absurd: the serial killer’s son (Tom Payne) who hunts serial killers and the ex-wife (Bellamy Young) who drowns her past in pills. Not to mention a truly bizarre and remarkable cast of surrounding characters.
“The Politician” (premieres Sept. 27 on Netflix)
Ryan Murphy, the co-creator behind “Glee,” “American Horror Story” and much more, pulled out all the stops for his first show at Netflix, and that’s saying a lot. In true Murphy fashion, he’s compiled a who’s who of Hollywood stars – including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Lange, Zoey Deutch, Lucy Boynton, Bette Midler, Judith Light, Dylan McDermott and January Jones – for a show about an entitled California high school student (Ben Platt) and his rise in politics. Murphy might be the busiest man on the West Coast these days, but he hasn’t gotten it wrong in a long time.
“Modern Love” (premieres Oct. 18 on Amazon Video)
Anthologies are having a wildly successful run, thanks in large part to the aforementioned Murphy, which brings us to “Modern Love,” based on the New York Times’ weekly column about, well, modern love. As is often the case with anthologies, the cast will carry it, and it’s made up of Tina Fey, Anne Hathaway, John Slattery, Brandon Victor Dixon, Cristin Milioti, Andrew Scott, John Gallagher Jr. and pretty much everyone Murphy hasn’t already cast.
“The Mandalorian” (premieres Tuesday, Nov. 12 on Disney+)
Sure, we may be culturally obligated to support all “Star Wars” content but there’s no way Disney+ is launching an entire streaming service with a less-than-perfect series. Jon Favreau moves over from Marvel to write and produce the story of a Mandalorian gunfighter (Pedro Pascal) a few years before “Return of the Jedi.”
“The Morning Show” (premieres this fall on Apple TV+)
It may be a little inside baseball, but there’s an inherent interest in who decides what we see on TV during our morning Cheerios and how they decide it. Of course, it helps when Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell are the ones breaking the news. Early trailers for the comedy-drama less-than-subtly hint at a #MeToo ousting for Carell, but it’s not quite clear if that’s just a jumping off point. Best-case scenario is that this is a less-pretentious version of “The Newsroom.”
“The Gilded Age” (premieres in 2019 on HBO)
We don’t even have a cast for “The Gilded Age” yet, let alone a trailer to go off of, but Julian Fellowes’ “Downton Abbey” follow-up, about 1885 New York and the racial, financial and gender gaps that come with that time and that place, is full of promise. But can we get a trailer at some point please?
TRY
“Emergence” (premieres Sept. 24 at 10 p.m. on ABC)
Allison Tolman deserves better than the credit she gets for being such a great actress and she also probably deserves better than “Emergence,” about a Long Island police chief who takes in a child after an accident of which she has no recollection. Like “Manifest” last season, this’ll be all about how long the writers can drag out the mystery.
“Perfect Harmony” (premieres Sept. 26 at 8:30 p.m. on NBC)
The line between fun and cheesy is awfully thin and this Bradley Whitford/Anna Camp musical comedy series about a grumpy, Ivy League music professor and a small-town church choir could easily go either way. The songs will probably make or break it.
“Evil” (premieres Sept. 26 at 10 p.m. on CBS)
Robert and Michelle King are among the most underrated showrunners on TV (seriously, “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” are great, but please watch the canceled “BrainDead” too). Supernatural drama “Evil” revolves around a clinical psychologist (Katja Herbers), a priest-in-training (Mike Colter) and a contractor (Aasif Mandvi) investigating religious occurrences (miracles, demonic possessions) and could be fascinating. It also could just end up being a less fun version of “The X-Files.”
“Almost Family” (premieres Oct. 2 at 9 p.m. on Fox)
Even if you’re not a lawyer, you have to realize that using your own sperm at your fertility clinic crosses some ethical boundaries (it’s also probably super illegal). But Leon Bechley (Timothy Hutton) somehow either didn’t know or didn’t care and now his daughter (Brittany Snow) is stuck with almost 100 new siblings, including Roxy (Emily Osment) and Edie (Megalyn Echikunwoke) in this drama.
AVOID
“Bob Hearts Abishola” (premieres Sept. 23 at 8:30 p.m. on CBS)
It’s a little hard to believe that, in 2019, Chuck Lorre is putting out a sitcom based entirely on the premise that a mediocre middle-aged white man (Billy Gardell) could have a crush on an immigrant (Folake Olowofoyeku), but here we are. What about that exactly is funny? It’s almost certainly not worth finding out. And hey, while you’re here, please don’t put emojis in show titles, like the actual heart shape that’s officially used in the show’s title. We are way too old for that.
“Stumptown” (premieres Sept. 25 at 10 p.m. on ABC)
Honestly, truly, how many tough private investigator shows do we need? It’s like Mad Libs: (proper noun), a former (job title), moves to (city with a lot of rain) and becomes a private investigator so (he/she) can support (his/her) (family member). This time it’s Cobie Smulders, Marine veteran, Portland, brother. Been there, been bored by that.
“Carol’s Second Act” (premieres Sept. 26 at 9:30 p.m. on CBS)
Carol (Patricia Heaton) has fulfilled her duties as a wife and mother and now she gets to be a doctor like she always wanted because women can’t actually be a wife, mother and doctor at the same time. So now we’re left with a bunch of jokes about the aforementioned Carol being old and, well, that seems to be about it.
“Bless the Harts” (premieres Sept. 29 at 8:30 p.m. on Fox)
It’s yet another animated show about a family being poor and white. The cast is great – Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Jillian Bell and Ike Barinholtz are all lending their voices as series regulars and Mary Steenburgen is set to have a recurring role – but just go watch “King of the Hill” at this point. Or literally any of Fox’s other animated sitcoms. They have enough.

Texto completo: The day the self-described “little brown woman with a big mouth” wakes up and no longer has anything to say is the day national political commentator Michelle Malkin will stop spouting her views.
That day hasn’t come for 48-year-old Malkin, who moved from outside Washington, D.C., to the Colorado Springs area in 2008.
“After 25 years, I haven’t run out yet,” she said during an interview in her home in El Paso County, where she lives with her husband of 26 years, Jesse, and their teenage son and young-adult daughter, who is studying to be an esthetician.

“My problem is I have way more topics and not enough time to get to all of them,” Malkin said.
Her fiery, stalwart ideology, which falls “between libertarian and conservative,” has long presaged current headlines. Malkin was sounding off about problems she saw with America’s immigration policies years before Donald Trump started firing celebrities on TV.
The Fox News and C-Span pundit’s first book, “Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals, and Other Foreign Menaces,” was published in 2002 and became a New York Times bestseller.
Her newest book — her seventh and the third on immigration — “Open Borders Inc.: Who’s Funding America’s Destruction?” will be released Tuesday.
In it, Malkin examines what she perceives to be the global forces behind illegal immigration, from Pope Francis to George Clooney, and George Soros to the Koch brothers, to Silicon Valley.
“Follow the money” to get the real story, is her mantra.
Legal immigration is personal to Malkin, whose parents came to the United States from the Philippines and naturalized.
“The two things that were the keys to my family’s American dream: Electing to come here, knowing what a privilege it was, and empowering themselves with the pursuit of their education, to improve themselves.”
Malkin was born in Philadelphia and grew up in South Jersey. She played the piano for 14 years, which remains a centerpiece in her home today. Her 15-year-old son performs musical theater, and her daughter demonstrates her artistic genes by sometimes doing Malkin’s makeup before television appearances.
Oberlin College — where Malkin met her husband, a retired health economist who books her speaking engagements and helps run her business — gave her a taste of how she could use her words and wit to give wings to her thoughts. And people listened.
She became an editorial writer and columnist for the LA Daily News and then the Seattle Times.
“The years I spent at metropolitan newspapers were the most valuable years of my life,” Malkin said. “We had to do on-the-ground reporting and bring that back to the editorial board. I had so many mentors.”
The Malkins moved from North Bethesda, Md., to Colorado Springs 11 years ago because Malkin said the East Coast was becoming “too toxic” of an environment.
“I hated the power moves, the back-scratching, the cliques.”
The quality of life, cost of living and education system were the biggest draws of El Paso County, she said.
At her daughter’s private school in Baltimore, Malkin had objected to the first-grade math curriculum. The textbook had been dropped by other schools, she wrote in a syndicated column.
Malkin was summoned to the principal’s office, where a lawyer told her if she didn’t agree to not write about the topic anymore, her daughter would be kicked out of the school.
Parents in Colorado Springs, she discovered in her research, had been exposing flaws in the same curriculum.
Malkin also liked that Colorado is a choice education state, and that some parents were fighting against Common Core academic standards and protecting the data privacy of children, issues dear to her heart.
“Education is a place you can find liberal and conservative parents who can unite to effect change in your school system,” she said. Parental autonomy and local control of education are two subjects she believes cross party lines.
Many people told Malkin she was committing career suicide by moving far from the nation’s capital. But the advent of the internet meant she “didn’t have to be tethered to the swamp” of Washington, D.C., which she said she found “liberating.”
From 1992 to 2015, Malkin says politics was “pretty predictable.”
The Trump presidency ushered in a new era for political analysts, one that she said can be either incentivizing or disruptive, depending on attitude.
“Our jobs are interesting every single day — every day we wake up and think ‘What’s going to happen today?’” she said. “A lot of horrible things are happening; a lot are not attributable to Donald Trump.”
She has met Trump only once, in a green room before the president did an interview.
“He muttered, ‘Good job, Michelle,’ as I walked past,” Malkin said.
The chance encounter came after a public Twitter spat, during which Trump called Malkin a “dummy,” over a column she wrote, calling him out for eminent domain practices in commercial development.
She has set the “silly tweets” aside. “I agree with his larger worldview and nationalist agenda. He has a fundamental bedrock patriotism that resonates with me.”
Does Malkin think Trump is a racist?
No.
“He’s a lot of other things — he’s vulgar, crass, mercurial,” Malkin replies.
But not racist.
“You go back and look how he was embraced by minority Democrats, in states, in New York City, for years,” she said. “Knowing members of his family and the positions he takes, I do not doubt that he loves this country and he thinks he’s doing the best he can for it …”
Malkin said she has seen, heard and felt more than her share of racism.
“I’ve experienced it from people all across the political spectrum,” she said. “All the time I face it. On social media, it’s a cesspool.”
Her first blog hit the web waves in 2000, and in her 2006 book, “Unhinged,” Malkin devoted a chapter to hate mail she’d received.
“I’m a trifecta, being a woman, a minority and a conservative,” she said, “which is practically being a unicorn. The combination triggers people.”
At first, the nastygrams and mud-slinging jabs bothered her.
A decade ago, in what she calls a “blatant show of misogynistic hatred,” MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann compared her to a “mashed-up bag of meat with lipstick on it.”
Now, she said, “It doesn’t faze me. It’s the price of being on this kind of media.”
In May, Facebook censored Malkin for posting a photo of herself with fellow conservatives who had been banned from the site.
Malkin said she’s “terrified” voices are being silenced and fears for what will happen.
“If we cannot communicate freely in defense of our nation, if we cannot publish vital information on the threats we face, who is funding them, how we stop them, if we cannot gather in public places without fear, we will no longer be a sovereign nation.”

Texto completo: "A Bright Room Called Day" (1985) - Set in the 1930s and the 1980s, this drama contrasts the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany with the popularity of President Ronald Reagan. The Chicago Tribune called the play "unabashedly political, thought-provoking, a little scary, and frequently a good deal of theatrical fun" and "anything from infuriatingly naÃ¯ve to intoxicatingly visionary."
"Hydriotaphia, or the Death of Dr. Browne" (1987) - In the introduction to his collection "Death and Taxes," Kushner describes "Hydriotaphia" -- one of his lesser-known plays -- as "a crash course in learning how to write jokes." Variety noted that the play -- inspired by the life of doctor, scientist, scholar and author Sir Thomas Browne -- "flourishes Kushner's trademark ability to mix up wildly diverse tonalities and ideas."
"The Illusion" (1988) - Pierre Corneille's 17th-century comedy, "L'Illusion" -- involving a father, his son and a magician -- is the basis for Kushner's adaptation. The New York Times called the New York Theater Workshop's production "snappy, stylish and quick" and "a wise and merry piece of magic that captures the soul of Corneille's play and the imaginations of its audience."
"Slavs!: Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of Virtue and Happiness" (1994) - Set against the backdrop of the fall of the Soviet Union, this comedy-drama centers on a lesbian security guard at a storage facility for the brains of departed Soviet leaders. The play debuted at the Actors Theatre of Louisville before moving to the New York Theater Workshop with Academy Award winner Marisa Tomei as its star.
"Homebody/Kabul" (2001) - Set in London and Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, Kushner's exploration of Afghan culture, politics and history was praised as a work comparable in ambition and scope to "Angels in America." The New Yorker observed that the play -- which focuses on a nameless woman called Homebody -- "continues the playwright's habit of taking on the world."
"Caroline, or Change" (2003) - With book and lyrics by Kushner and music by Jeanine Tesori, this musical set in the 1960s revolves around Caroline, an African American maid. She works for a Southern Jewish family, and Kushner describes the show as semi-autobiographical. The New York Times noted that he "proves that you don't need a fancy vocabulary to create intellectually complex effects."
"The Intelligent Homosexual's Guide to Capitalism and Socialism With a Key to the Scriptures" (2009) - A longshoreman philosopher attempts to come to grips with 21st-century realities while coping with emotional demands in this drama that focuses on a family reunion. The New York Times observed that a 2011 production at the Public Theater exploded "into a babel of fast-talking, passionate voices -- slapping and overlapping, twining and crashing into one another."
Kushner also wrote or co-wrote the screenplays for director Steven Spielberg's "Munich" (2005), "Lincoln" (2012) and the upcoming remake of "West Side Story."
See the play in its entirety Sept. 15, 18, 21, 28 and 29 and Oct. 5 and 6, with performances of "Part One: Millennium Approaches" at 1 p.m. and "Part Two: Perestroika" at 7 p.m.
"Angels in America," the epic and politically engaged play that made the reputation of Tony Kushner, was written in response to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and the indifferent presidential administration of Ronald Reagan. But in recent years, the two-part drama that opens the 2019-20 Repertory Theatre of St. Louis season has taken on a renewed relevance.
"There were things that were frightening me back in the '80s and early '90s, and that I put in the play, that are frightening in a whole new way today," says Kushner, who worked at the Rep early in his career and was a 2012 recipient of the St. Louis Literary Award.
"Reagan did not mention the word 'AIDS' until 1987 -- which was many years into the epidemic," he says. "It was a terrible time, and not dissimilar to what we're feeling now."
The play debuted on Broadway in 1993 and was adapted for an HBO miniseries in 2003. A revival opened on Broadway in 2017 for a limited run with an all-star cast.
Although medical breakthroughs have lessened the global impact of the disease, Kushner says, the political climate has only worsened.
"The country was beset by the first wave of reactionary, antidemocratic politics that I think has led directly to Donald Trump," he says.
Leading the cast of "Angels in America" -- whose two parts are titled "Millennium Approaches" and "Perestroika" -- are Meredith Baxter and Barrett Foa. The production is directed by Tony Speciale.
Baxter is perhaps best known for her role as Elyse Keaton, mother of the politically conservative Alex P. Keaton (Michael J. Fox), on the 1980s sitcom "Family Ties." Foa plays intelligence analyst Eric Beale on "NCIS: Los Angeles."
Subtitled "A Gay Fantasia on National Themes," the Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning play combines realism and fantasy.
"I think of myself as a realistic writer," Kushner says. "But I was writing at a time when it felt like the ordinary rules of reality -- the things that people sort of relied on -- were beginning to come undone. Sometimes, life is so stressful that it's almost impossible to feel like you're describing it adequately if you only describe day-to-day reality. You need to reach for something else."
Each of the actors in "Angels" plays multiple roles. But at the heart of the story are eight characters. Foa portrays Prior Walter, who is afflicted with AIDS and abandoned by his partner, Louis (Ben Cherry). Baxter is Hannah Pitt, a Mormon whose closeted gay son, Joe (Jayson Peters), is on the verge of leaving his Valium-addicted wife, Harper (Valeri Mudek).
Also figuring in the story are Belize (David Ryan Smith), a nurse and former drag performer; Roy Cohn (Peter Frechette), based on the real-life lawyer and political fixer who was a crony of Communist-baiting senator Joseph McCarthy and a mentor to Trump; and the Angel (Gina Daniels), who makes a profound impression on Prior Walter.
The Rep's production of "Angels" has special meaning for Kushner, who wrote several shows for the organization's Imaginary Theatre Company during its 1985-86 and 1986-87 seasons -- including "In Great Eliza's Golden Time," which he also directed. In addition, Kushner lent his talents to the Rep's mainstage, directing a 1986 production of Clifford Odets' "Golden Boy."
"I had a wonderful cast," he says. "And it was a complicated experience, but a valuable one. I wasn't supposed to direct a mainstage production, but somebody dropped out."
What "Angels in America: Parts One and Two" - When "Part One: Millennium Approaches" opens 7 p.m. Friday, "Part Two: Perestroika" opens 7 p.m. Sept. 13; performance times vary through Oct. 6 - Where Loretto-Hilton Center for the Performing Arts, 130 Edgar Road, Webster Groves - How much $20-$97.50; 15 percent discount for tickets to both parts - More info repstl.org

Texto completo: What's on TV
LIVE FROM LINCOLN CENTER 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Midway through "Odyssey: The Chamber Music Society in Greece," the camera brings us inside a tour bus snaking through a serene Greek countryside. Musicians from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center sit quietly, reading from a phone or a laptop or pensively gazing out the windows as the landscape slides by. In other words: "Gimme Shelter" this is not. Instead, "Odyssey" is something like a rock 'n' roll tour documentary for the chamber music crowd, following a group of world-class classical musicians as they perform at venues around Greece. The locales range from historic (the First Ancient Theater of Larissa) to cutting edge (the Renzo Piano-designed Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center). The musicians play Beethoven, Debussy, Bach and more.
RUST CREEK (2019) 8 p.m. on Showtime. Sawyer (Hermione Corfield), a Kentucky college student, is on her way to a job interview in Washington, D.C. when she gets stranded on a roadside early in this thriller. After a run-in with a pair of unsavory locals, she flees into the woods -- only to soon find herself in the custody of an aggressive meth cook (Jay Paulson). In her review for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that the film falls squarely into the tradition of horror movies like "Wolf Creek" and "I Spit on Your Grave," which drop sympathetic characters into dangerous, forested surroundings. "What sets 'Rust Creek' apart from most of its genre predecessors, though, is that its director, screenwriter and cinematographer are all women," Catsoulis wrote. "Sadly (or happily, depending on your viewpoint), this hasn't made an appreciable difference to the broadly familiar beats of Julie Lipson's screenplay, even if Jen McGowan's direction is as attentive to stasis as action."
GOOD TALK WITH ANTHONY JESELNIK 11 p.m. on Comedy Central. "Comedy is under a microscope today, but because my career has been going on long enough, I've been grandfathered in," the comedian Anthony Jeselnik told The Times in April. The interview was about his recent Netflix special, "Fire in the Maternity Ward," but some of the coarse brand of humor on display there is also present here. "Good Talk," a new series, sees Jeselnik conducting quip-heavy interviews with a handful of his fellow comedians, including Tig Notaro, Kumail Nanjiani and Nick Kroll, who is the guest in the debut episode.
What's Streaming
LATE NIGHT (2019) Stream on Amazon. Emma Thompson stars as a TV host facing potential cancellation in this comedy. Written by Mindy Kaling (who also co-stars), the movie satirizes sexism in the broadcasting industry through a story that sees Thompson's character joining forces with her new writer (played by Kaling) to try and reinvigorate her strained career. "Every time you think 'Late Night' is settling into familiar tropes -- about workplace politics, mean bosses, long marriages, fish out of water, bootstraps and how to pull them -- it shifts a few degrees and finds a fresh perspective," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times.

Texto completo: The only thing worse than feeling completely wired at 11 p.m. when you're ready for sleep is being stark awake at 3 a.m. About half of all insomnia sufferers experience this middle-of-the-night "sleep-maintenance" insomnia, said Jennifer Martin, a professor of medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles. The next time you find yourself staring at the ceiling at 3 a.m., try these six things:
REMAIN IN BED For you to fall asleep, your heart rate needs to slow down, said Michael Breus, a Los Angeles area clinical sleep psychologist. But when you get up, you elevate it.
And skip the middle-of-the-night snack, unless you have diabetes or low blood sugar.
STAY IN THE DARK When you can't sleep, LED indicator lights on, say, printers and cable boxes, can feel intrusive. The same goes for light streaming in through cracks in the curtain.
Try covering indicator lights with black electrical tape and wearing a sleep mask. Of course, avoid scrolling through your smartphone and turning on the lights.
BLOCK OUT NOISE For you to fall asleep, your soundscape doesn't have to be completely silent, but it does need to be monotonous, which signals the brain that it's safe to sleep.
Some people like to sleep with a fan running. If you have a white noise machine (or an app) for bedtime, turn it on.
ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE If the room feels warm, lower the thermostat -- around 65 degrees fosters sleep, said Dr. Breus.
QUIET YOUR MIND Ruminating about past events or worrying excessively can cause a surge in stress-related chemicals, which in turn sparks a rise in heart rate and core temperature.
Give relaxation techniques (deep breathing, meditation, mindfulness exercises) a try.
THINK POSITIVELY If your wake-up time is 6:30 a.m. and the clock reads 3 a.m., don't think, Oh no! I have only three hours left! Negativity only sets off a stress response that keeps you up. Instead, say, Oh great! I have three more hours to sleep!

Texto completo: Lizzy Goodman and Hala Matar fondly describe the rock that came out of New York in the 2000s as unserious and beautifully ugly. Their joy is not only palpable -- it's contagious. And their belief in the power of musicians is reflected in their work: In 2017, Goodman wrote "Meet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001-2011," and Matar directed Interpol's "If You Really Love Nothing" music video the following year.
Now they have curated "Meet Me in the Bathroom: The Art Show," a visual counterpart to the book. The exhibition opened Sept. 4, and runs through Sept. 22 at the Hole art gallery in the East Village.
Ms. Goodman's oral history, which chronicled the resurgence of rock in the East Village and the Lower East Side in the 2000s, was broadly praised for its intimate portrayal of bands like the Strokes, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, LCD Soundsystem and Interpol. The art show features more than 70 works from some of those musicians, including Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Paul Banks of Interpol, Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio and Adam Green of the Moldy Peaches. The show also features work from the artists Aurel Schmidt, Rita Ackermann, Urs Fischer, Rob Pruitt and Ryan McGinley.
It's a dizzying display for music fans.
Karen O's microphones -- still wrapped in duct tape adorned with her colorful doodles -- are on display, as well as her pepperoni pizza dress and other outrageous stage outfits by the costume designer Christian Joy. There's also a guitar belonging to Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio. One room is dedicated to memorabilia, a collaged frenzy rewarding fandom and voyeurism with photos sourced from the bands themselves, magazine covers from the early aughts and more original artwork. Another room recreates the famous stank bathrooms from the now-closed dive bar, the Hole, which the gallery is named after, replete with graffiti from Ben Solomon, Shaun Crawford and the Irak crew.
Lesley Silverman, of United Talent Agency's fine arts division, which helped Ms. Matar and Ms. Goodman organize the exhibition, called the show "an altar." The New York Times recently spoke with Ms. Goodman and Ms. Matar about the opening. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
How did you source the show?
HALA MATAR We had to contact the record labels. We worked with photographers who went on tour with the bands, and then we also have some personal photos by the bands themselves, like Nick Zinner's [of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs].
LIZZY GOODMAN We just went to Paul Banks's apartment. Really, it's stuff from under people's beds -- that idea of having work that feels personal mixed with work that's been shown in museums and has this sense of formality to it. And it's been positioned in a different way in its history. Blending that is part of the idea.
MATAR There was a bar called the Hole, and a lot of the artists hung out there and this gallery is called the Hole. We tried to recreate the environment of that bar and that experience.
GOODMAN It's really good to cast a wide net and be ambitious. But I think we both feel this huge responsibility to get it right and to not play fast and loose with the legacy of this time.
What did you hope to accomplish with the show?
GOODMAN I want you to feel a little unsafe, a little unsure. What is this? Is this a gallery show? Is it a rock show? Is this 20 different girls' bedrooms in here? Is this some sort of weird, rock-obsessed serial killer living in here? Like what is going on here? That sense of unease is the word we talked about.
MATAR We tried to show work that evokes the feeling of that time. Some pieces are a bit violent; some pieces make you feel that unease. The artists were also having fun, creating pieces from their ideas, not knowing if they'll turn into masterpieces.
You two met at a dinner around the time the book came out. How did you all decide to turn this project into a show?
MATAR It felt obvious to me.
GOODMAN First of all, I was like I don't want to make anything ever again. I wrote it, I'm going to bed -- see you all in a couple of years. I just felt like the idea of undertaking something else that would require genuine creative and emotional bandwidth was sort of hard for me to even get excited about. But then I slept for a while. [Hala] kept after me in the best way.
Considering the dearth of women on the scene at the time, there's something special about the fact that two women are curating this show. Have you discussed that?
GOODMAN I'm thinking about that all the time about pretty much every creative decision that I'm making, not just about women but underrepresented parties, whatever that is. It's our view; our lens is what you're seeing. This is our idea; this is this book that I wrote. It's Hala's vision for the show, it's Kathy Grayson's gallery, inspired by the Hole. None of this is constructed as consciously gendered in the sense of 'let's empower women'; it's just what happened with all of us.
And, look, we have a bunch of butts on the next wall and erotic photos of women, and I love those photos. That cover [the international edition of the Strokes' debut 2001 album, "Is This It," by the photographer Colin Lane] is one of the most brilliant rock covers of our generation. I also feel like I want some balance with that; it works because it's in this context of this badass female artist [Rita Ackermann, and her 1994 painting "We Mastered the Life of Doing Nothing"] on the opposite wall. That was very conscious.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - State and local agencies in Pennsylvania will receive $75 million over the next year to combat the opioid epidemic, part of $1.8 billion in funding the Trump administration announced Wednesday.
The new round of funding includes a $5.2 million grant for the Allegheny County Health Department to better collect and track overdose data as close to real time as possible. The initiative, funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has already reduced reporting delays in opioid deaths, administration officials said.
The Pennsylvania Department of Health received $8.5 million, and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health received $5.9 million, for the same purpose.
"We really struggle in collecting reliable and timely data from our coroners," said Jen Smith, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs. Counties use different reporting systems, which can lead to a lag in overdose trends as long as nine months and prevent the state from effectively targeting resources to places that need it most, Ms. Smith said.
The department plans to use the money to help overwhelmed county offices, she said, and find ways to streamline the data into a standardized statewide system.
A spokesman for the Allegheny County Health Department said the agency could not comment Wednesday.
The new money to improve opioid reporting comes in addition to nearly $56 million Pennsylvania will receive in the next year to carry out its State Opioid Response plan. The state also received $56 million in 2018, plus a supplemental $29 million, which has been allocated to programs that support housing and employment initiatives.
The second and final year of funding under the State Opioid Response grant program, administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, will continue to build those programs. "We can really look at addressing gaps in our treatment system," Ms. Smith said.
In a call with reporters, White House officials said the funding was designed for local authorities to have the flexibility to treat addiction using a variety of methods.
"We are truly headed in the right direction for the first time since this crisis arose," said Alex Azar, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
In part, the grant program aims to increase access to medication-assisted treatment of opioid dependence using the three drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration: buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone. Mr. Azar called medication-assisted treatment the "gold standard" of options, and the Trump administration is requiring it as a condition of agencies receiving the money.
Money could also be used for telemedicine programs in rural areas, employment coaching, the distribution of naloxone and other measures to help people recover from addiction, Mr. Azar said.
Additionally, prescriptions of naloxone, which can counter the effects of an overdose, have risen by 378% since President Donald Trump took office, Mr. Azar said. And the Centers for Medicare&Medicaid Services have approved waivers so 21 states can obtain Medicaid funds to pay for substance use disorder treatment services.
"All of this work is making a difference and saving lives," Mr. Azar said.
Mr. Trump, discussing the new funding Wednesday in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, said his administration has been working to "smash the grip of addiction" since he declared a public health emergency in October 2017.
"So many problems are caused by this problem," Mr. Trump said. "It's something I saw firsthand during the campaign, and I couldn't believe when I looked at certain states in particular, how bad it was."
He cited a drop in opioid deaths in Pennsylvania as evidence his policies are making headway. Other measures - such as a nationwide ad campaign to highlight dangers of misusing painkillers - will take more time, he said.
"You won't see the results of this for a couple of years - two, three, four years - but the results are going to be there," Mr. Trump said. "They're really powerful ads."
Mr. Trump said the U.S. is also stepping up efforts to stop Chinese fentanyl shipments into the country and thanked the Mexican government for a seizure last week of almost 24 tons of fentanyl originating in China.
"First time that's ever happened, where Mexico's helped us at the border, and they've helped us in a very big way," Mr. Trump said. "Far bigger than anyone thought even possible."
The new round of funding comes days after a report found Pennsylvania and Ohio have received relatively modest shares of federal opioid funding that don't fully account for the number of opioid-involved deaths in each state.
Pennsylvania should have received about $740 million, rather than the $345 million it actually received, according to the Richard M. Fairbanks Foundation, an Indianapolis-based philanthropic organization that cited 2017 opioid-involved deaths. Ohio should have gotten about $670 million, up from the $344 million that state actually received.
In 2018, Pennsylvania saw an 18% drop in fatal drug overdoses compared with the previous year, led by a plunge of 40% in southwestern Pennsylvania.
The Trump administration has said it distributes State Opioid Response plan money using a formula that considers two factors: the state's proportion of people with abuse or dependence on opioids who need but are not receiving treatment and the state's proportion of overdose deaths.
Ms. Smith, the head of drug and alcohol programs, acknowledged the challenge of sustaining existing state opioid programs beyond the current round of funding. But she said she has a "pretty high degree of certainty there will be another round."

How Lana Del Rey translates Norman Rockwell

Texto completo: When Lana Del Rey sings, “your poetry's bad and you blame the news,” is she talking to other artists, those who have subordinated art to bland political protest? It’s doubtful, but the phrase still seems so pointed.
In her latest album, Norman F---ing Rockwell, Del Rey draws listeners in, as is her custom, to the dark side of Americana. Yet she manages to do it without getting too political.
During a recent interview with the New York Times, she said, “I’m grateful to be in a country where everyone can have their own political views. I’m really not more of a liberal than I am a Republican — I’m in the middle.”
Del Rey was responding to the claim that she was looking for a reaction when she sang, “Kanye West is blonde and gone.” After West publicly supported President Trump, Del Rey, who sang at his wedding, wasn’t the only fan who was confused. She said the lyric “was more like the mood and the vibe around: Yo, this man is the greatest! Really? The greatest?”
Rather than making statements, Del Rey prefers to ask questions.
On NFR, she maintains her commitment to apoliticism, leaving off a song she wrote in the aftermath of the recent shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas. Besides the line “I'm still looking for my own version of America / One without the gun,” the song sounds like a haunting, modern-day “American Pie”: “Pulled over to watch the children in the park,” she sings. “We used to only worry about them after dark.”
Her latest album has no such political aim, and it views bits of American culture through the lens of dysfunctional love. This has been Del Rey's go-to for some time; her breakout hit, “Video Games,” describes a codependent relationship.
Pitchfork, the online music magazine that rated Del Rey’s latest album a 9.4 out of 10, called her “a woman whose songs are like miniature syllabi in American Studies — saturated in references to jazz, girl groups, heavy metal, Springsteen; Hemingway and Fitzgerald; money, power, glory; excess and loss; Whitmanian multitudes.”
Among other artists, NFR name-drops Sylvia Plath, the Rolling Stones, and, of course, Norman Rockwell.
The title of the album, Norman F---ing Rockwell, recalls a nuanced version of America. Rockwell painted not just of everyday life in America, but also scenes of war and racial discrimination. One of his most famous paintings, “The Problem We All Live With,” became an iconic image in the civil rights movement for depicting 6-year-old Ruby Bridges, who was harassed on the way to an all-white school during desegregation. TweetBridges walks resolutely past the tomato thrown at her, while the viewer watches from the perspective of a protester. Rockwell's social commentary here, as in his other works, is subtle but powerful. With NFR, does Del Rey attempt a similar perspective? Perhaps.
She’s willing to share scenes of disillusionment without overly politicizing them, and she knows how to make a statement without trapping it within the confines of 2019. Del Rey turns Ella Fitzgerald’s “dream a little dream of me” into a plea on “F--- It I Love You”: “Dream a little dream of me / Turn this into something sweet.” If she hoped moving across the country would solve her relational anxiety, it didn't. "So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind/ It turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie," she sings.
Of course, her rendition of Sublime’s “Doin’ Time” removes the gusto while retaining a sense of unease. In the summertime, it turns out, living is anything but easy. When she sings to the “man-child” on the title track, Del Rey could be singing to all of us. She’s not looking to change anyone's mind. As she responded to a critic on Twitter, she may not "have made bold political or cultural statements before," and her real gift is "self reflection."
When she sings on "Norman F---ing Rockwell," she simply presents her art for us either to enjoy or ignore: “Your poetry's bad and you blame the news / But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood.”

Texto completo: We are No. 1.
Number one?
That is what North Carolinians love to say about our state. We want our state's things to be the best, biggest, first, most successful, bestselling, and best loved.
Think of the Wright Brothers' first in flight, the 1775 Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence's first in freedom, Michael Jordan, and on and on.
We are proud, and we like to brag. That is one reason I think the five books and authors to be featured on UNC-TV's North Carolina Bookwatch will make for the program's all time favorite month.
Opening the month will be the first lady of North Carolina literature, Lee Smith, arguably also the best-loved. In "Mothers and Strangers: Essays on Motherhood from the New South," Smith and her co-editor, Samia Serageldin, collected essays by 28 southern writers, mostly North Carolinians.
Smith emphasizes that the relationships and experiences between mothers and children as described in these essays are varied. She explains, "America's traditional Hallmark conception of Motherhood (note the caps) takes a real beating in these essays."
Smith and Seragelden will talk about their book on North Carolina Bookwatch, Sunday, September 1, at 11 a.m. and Tuesday, September 3 at 5 p.m.
Then, there is the country's No. 1 best selling book, which is set in our state. For almost a year, Delia Owens' "Where the Crawdads Sing," has been at the top of The New York Times' bestseller list, usually at No. 1. The book's central character, Catherine Clark or "Kya," lives alone in a shack in the marshes miles away from a fictional North Carolina coastal town. Owens blends a compelling murder mystery, with a coming of age theme, a love story, and beautiful descriptions of nature's plants and creatures. (Bookwatch, September 8, 10)
None of us is proud of the Jim Crow segregation that ruled our region for so many years and still infects our culture. We do not want to be No. 1 in this category. So we can be grateful for a new book, "Hattiesburg: An American City in Black and White," by UNC Chapel Hill assistant professor of history, William Sturkey. He tells the story of a Mississippi city. The book's chapters alternate between the experiences and viewpoints of white and black residents. The reader learns how each group dealt with each other and with the Jim Crow overlay that affected everything. Though set in Mississippi, the story could have fit the experience of most North Carolina towns and cities. (September 15, 17)
Another example of how North Carolinians like to be associated with No. 1 is our pride in the Biltmore House outside Asheville, the largest privately owned residential mansion in the nation. In "The Last Castle: The Epic Story of Love, Loss, and American Royalty in the Nation's Largest Home," Asheville author Denise Kiernan tells the story of how and why the Biltmore House was built and how its gradual transformation to a high-class tourist attraction made possible its survival. (September 22, 24)
Finally, there is a book about the only time North Carolina was No. 1 in professional baseball. In "The Cloudbuster Nine: The Untold Story of Ted Williams and the Baseball Team that Helped Win WWII," Anne Keene explains how Ted Williams and other major league players came to Chapel Hill to get the Navy fighter pilot training they needed to help win World War II. While they were in North Carolina, they played for a Navy team called the Cloudbuster Nine that was arguably better than any major league team. Keene details the rigorous training the cadets endured and the glory their baseball team brought to North Carolina.

Texto completo: Today is Thursday, Sept. 5, the 248th day of 2019. There are 117 days left in the year.
Birthdays: Former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul A. Volcker is 92. Comedian-actor Bob Newhart is 90. Former NFL All-Pro quarterback and college football Hall of Famer Billy Kilmer is 80. Movie director Werner Herzog is 77. College Football Hall of Famer Jerry LeVias is 73. "Cathy" cartoonist Cathy Guisewite is 69. Actor Michael Keaton is 68. Actress Debbie Turner-Larson (Marta in "The Sound of Music") is 63. Rock musician Brad Wilk is 51. Actress Rose McGowan is 46. Rock musician Kyle O'Quin (Portugal. The Man) is 34. Actor Andrew Ducote is 33. Olympic gold medal figure skater Yuna Kim is 29.
In 1774, the first Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia.
In 1864, voters in Louisiana approved a new state constitution abolishing slavery.
In 1882, the nation's first Labor Day was celebrated with a parade in New York.
In 1939, four days after war had broken out in Europe, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a proclamation declaring US neutrality in the conflict.
In 1960, at the Rome Olympics, American boxer Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali) defeated Zbigniew Pietrzykowski of Poland to win the light-heavyweight gold medal.
In 1975, President Gerald R. Ford escaped an attempt on his life by Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme, a disciple of Charles Manson, in Sacramento, Calif.
In 1984, the space shuttle Discovery ended its inaugural flight as it landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
In 1991, the 35th annual Naval Aviation Symposium held by the Tailhook Association opened in Las Vegas. (The gathering was marred by reports that dozens of people, most of them women, were sexually assaulted or otherwise harassed during the meeting.)
In 1997, breaking the royal reticence over the death of Princess Diana, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II delivered a televised address in which she called her former daughter-in-law "a remarkable person." Mother Teresa died in Calcutta, India, at age 87.
In 2014, the US and 10 of its key allies, meeting in Wales, agreed that the Islamic State group was a significant threat to NATO countries and that they would take on the militants by squeezing their financial resources and going after them with military might. Ukraine, Russia, and Kremlin-backed separatists signed a cease-fire after five months of bloodshed.
In 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he was phasing out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program protecting young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally, but said he was giving Congress six months to come up with an alternative. (The Supreme Court is expected to decide by June 2020 whether Trump can terminate the program.) Hurricane Irma strengthened to a Category 5 storm as it approached the northeast Caribbean on a path toward the United States.
Last year, The New York Times published an opinion piece from an anonymous senior administration official claiming to be part of an internal "resistance" working to thwart President Donald Trump's "worst inclinations;" Trump responded that if such a "gutless" person exists, "the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to the government at once!" At the second day of his confirmation hearing, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh rejected repeated efforts by Democrats to get him to reveal his views about a president pardoning himself or being forced to testify in a criminal case. Britain charged two men it identified as Russian military intelligence officers with the nerve-agent poisoning of double agent Sergei Skripal. Republican Jon Kyl of Arizona was sworn in to fill the Senate seat left open by the death of John McCain.

'Emily Doe' to release memoir

Texto completo: The woman who was dubbed “Emily Doe" in the sexual assault case involving Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner has revealed her full identity in a forthcoming memoir that will be released this month.
Chanel Miller , who was in her early 20s at the time of the January 2015 assault, has come forward to share her story in a new 368-page book, titled “Know My Name," which will be released Sept. 24. She also sat for an interview with CBS's “60 Minutes," which will air on Sept. 22.
According to her author profile on Penguin Random House's website, Miller “is a writer and artist who received her BA in Literature from the College of Creative Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara." She lives in San Francisco, according to her profile.
Miller's case gained national attention after she read a heart-wrenching 7,200-word victim impact statement in court during Turner's trial in 2016. She began the statement by saying, “You don't know me, but you've been inside me, and that's why we're here today."
She continued to explain her ordeal in the statement, adding, "You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today."
Prosecutors said that Turner assaulted Miller while she was unconscious behind a dumpster on campus. Turner was caught by two passersby, described by Miller in her statement as Swedish graduate students.
“When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn't speak because of what he'd seen," she wrote in her statement.
Turner was convicted in 2016 on three felony charges: sexual assault of an unconscious person, sexual assault of an intoxicated person, and sexual assault with intent to commit rape. He was sentenced to six months in jail — a sentence that was widely criticized as too lenient. He served three months of that sentence, according to The New York Times.
The judge in the case, Aaron Persky , was recalled as a result of the ensuing uproar.

Jury considers fate of top Obama lawyer Greg Craig

Texto completo: A jury began its deliberations Wednesday on whether Obama White House counsel Greg Craig is guilty of scheming to mislead the Justice Department, after clashes by the prosecution and defense in closing arguments Tuesday.
The trial against Craig lasted more than two weeks and included a day and a half of testimony from the high-powered Democratic lawyer himself.
Craig, 74, is charged with scheming against DOJ investigators about contacts with the media in promoting a report written at the behest of the Kremlin-linked government in Ukraine in 2012 about the country’s prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was tried under President Viktor Yanukovych. The president was a close ally of Republican operative Paul Manafort, chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign, who was convicted of crimes in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Manafort was Craig’s contact with Ukraine, and Craig’s case spun off from Mueller’s inquiry.
The DOJ’s case against Craig focused on the public relations work allegedly performed for Ukraine by Craig and his firm — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom. Prosecutors said Craig “schemed, falsified, and concealed” facts from the then-head of DOJ’s Foreign Agents Registration Act unit, Heather Hunt, in 2013. The law mandates anyone working for a foreign government register with DOJ. Craig denied helping Ukraine advance its agenda.
The prosecution and defense painted starkly different pictures of Craig, though the closing statements both referred to the movie Jerry Maguire.
Bill Murphy, Craig’s lawyer, quoted Tom Cruise’s sports agent character in his two-hour closing statement, saying that “we live in a cynical world.” Murphy argued that, according to Craig’s character witnesses, “in the cynical world that is Washington D.C.” there is one man who can be trusted: Greg Craig.
Jason McCullough, of DOJ’s National Security Division, invoked a different quotation in his 30-minute rebuttal.
“Mr. Murphy mentioned Jerry Maguire, but what’s the line from that movie?” McCullough said. “Show me the money! Show. Me. The. Money! $4 million.”
Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch, paid more than $4 million for Skadden’s report, despite Ukraine's initial claim Craig’s firm was hired for $12,000.
In his 90-minute statement to the jury, Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez pointed out Craig back-dated a letter at Manafort’s request asking for $1.25 million more from Ukraine that was “top-to-bottom false.”
“That tells you a lot about his honesty, his integrity, and his willingness to do what Ukraine wanted,” Campoamor-Sanchez said. Campoamor-Sanchez argued that Craig was working with Ukraine on messaging about the report, pointing to his dropping off an early copy to David Sanger of the New York Times in the screen door of Sanger's home.
But Craig’s lawyers argued he didn’t lie, and his only involvement in media outreach was to stop the whitewashing of the conclusions of his report by Ukraine or people working for Manafort, such as right-hand man Rick Gates and publicist Jonathan Hawker.
Hunt, Hawker, and Gates testified against Craig.
Craig’s lawyer attacked the government’s “star witnesses” by calling Hawker an “occupational liar” and Gates a “congenital liar” and “con artist” seeking a lighter sentence. Murphy said Craig didn’t trust Manafort, Gates, and Hawker to “play it straight” so he “hijacked their strategy” by telling Sanger what his report really said, rather than letting them spin it.
Murphy also noted the absence of other witnesses.
“Where was Mr. Manafort?” Murphy asked. “Where was Mr. Sanger?”
Craig’s lawyer ended by calling upon the jury to “salvage his reputation.”
The prosecutor told the jury the defense was trying to distract them, illustrated by a picture of a puzzle with small pieces missing, even though the larger picture was clear.
“Mr. Craig schemed to mislead his law firm and the FARA unit about what actually happened,” McCullough said.
If convicted, Craig faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.

Texto completo: My proposal is that we revert to the gun laws that prevailed in the United States around 1960.

From a public safety standpoint that was far from a perfect world. The cheap revolvers called "Saturday night specials" ruled the night in many cities. Loopholes in the sale and registration of long arms allowed the importation of the mail-order rifle that Lee Harvey Oswald used to kill President John F. Kennedy in 1963.

Yet law-abiding hunters and target shooters had all the weapons and firepower they needed -- and were not in a state of constant turmoil over state and federal laws that restricted most shotguns to three rounds and most semiautomatic rifles and handguns to fewer than 20 rounds.

American gun and ammunition manufacturers such as Remington, Winchester and Colt were thriving. Nobody argued that a six-shot revolver was inadequate for home protection emergencies. Deer and elk hunters who used larger caliber rifles felt amply equipped with standard magazines of a half-dozen or so shells.

A return to these basic restrictions would appeal to most hunters, firing-range shooters and gun collectors who battle the nonstop whirlpool of National Rifle Association paranoia.

It would give members of Congress, including those from rural pro-gun states, a sellable policy with a history of limiting mass shootings in public places while protecting the sporting and self-protection practices of law-abiding citizens.

And it would reduce the body count from shootings in public places.

I've been a gun owner for more than 60 years, yet I seldom mention that fact to fellow liberals I know to be offended by hunting as a blood sport -- or who regard all guns as evil instruments.

Yet most of us on the left would accept reasonable accommodations on guns.

I believe my proposal to go back to the flawed status quo of a half-century ago would give us an imperfect firearms future that would nonetheless spare the lives of thousands of citizens in our schools, churches, bars, concerts, cinemas or wherever comes next.

Texto completo: Should Elizabeth Warren do the right thing and drop out of the Democratic presidential race, so Bernie Sanders can address Joe Biden's multiple "reality issues" before taking on President Donald Trump?
Yes, immediately.
Bernie can beat Trump. Warren and other Democrats also match up well with Trump, but Sanders has the necessary authenticity. And Biden has a serious flaw.
If you can't see this, you might just be blind to Joe adrift, lost in his multiverse of fabrications and moist feelings, like a sad sci-fi astronaut with gleaming white teeth in a Netflix movie, unmoored.
For now, the hard-left vote -- the spine of the Democratic Party this cycle -- remains split between Warren and Sanders. If something's not done and soon, Biden may ride his whoppers to the Democratic nomination.
Democratic activists worry about Biden, but the national media, which is even further to the left than are the activists, also worry. They're trying to take Biden out with stories like the one in The New York Times the other day, depicting Biden as a confused bumbler: "Does Joe Biden Want To Be Doing This?"
So Biden is portrayed by many as a geezer lost in the discount drugstore after the shuttle bus has left.
Biden remains stubbornly on the national platter, congealing like day-old "Cold Omelets with Crab Meat," the now-infamous dish Warren offered as authentic Cherokee fare in the cookbook "Pow Wow Chow," back when she was climbing the political ladder as an authentic Native American Harvard law professor.
"You can't call on Warren to drop out," said a guy who's been counting all the "Warren Has a Plan for That" signs sprouting in his progressive North Side Chicago neighborhood. "She's a woman. And Democrats will need the white suburban woman vote in 2020."
True, and I mean no disrespect to her, her gender or to the Democratic Party's strategy to target that key suburban white female demographic through a relentless 24-7 media spin that's been going on since 2016.
But the charade of representing herself as a Native American, and the catastrophe of her DNA test, turns off working-class families. Democrats need them too.
The thing about an omelet with crab meat is that you've got to break some eggs.
And she'll have to break a few on Biden in the next Democratic presidential debate in Texas. But that could get messy, since Biden has support from older African Americans and older, more centrist Democrats who don't like the way their party is trending.
Sanders represented the progressive faction in 2016. But Hillary Clinton and establishment Democrats, through former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, rigged the primaries and leveraged all that Wall Street cash and the superdelegates to cynically take Sanders out.
Now progressive Democrats seem at a loss to stop Biden. It reminds me of how my brothers and I would wait outside our house for Uncle John, a restaurant man, when Aunt Mary called to tell us he was bringing his famous dessert over to our house.
We'd stand in the middle of the street and flag him down in his big gray sedan, waving our arms and shouting until he finally stopped. He was in his mid-90s and mentally quick. He just had trouble seeing. Still, it was worth the risk of getting flattened because Uncle John made great rice pudding.
But he wasn't campaigning for president.
Biden doesn't make rice pudding. Instead, Biden makes sweet and creamy feelings.
Bernie Sanders, at 77, is a year older than Biden but seems much sharper. He's a socialist, yes, and unlike Biden, he knows the difference between Vermont and New Hampshire.
Bernie went to Moscow on his honeymoon. He talks about free stuff -- free college tuition, "free" health care for all, even for immigrants who illegally cross the border. He probably should use Pete Seeger's version of "The Big Rock Candy Mountain" either as a campaign song or an economic platform.
Sanders doesn't have good hair, but who does? At least his locks are not orange. They're authentically white and grow wild and frizzy from Sanders' head like the hair of Rick Sanchez, the brilliantly sarcastic scientist in the "Rick and Morty" cartoons.
Sanders is a true lefty, not a faux lefty, and perhaps it would be a good thing for the country to have left and right meet in the November 2020 Thunderdome and just end this incessant bickering once and for all.
The problem is Joe's in the way. He's locked up key Democratic Party food groups and won't let go.
Biden's weakness is the weight of his lies. Trump lies, too, obviously, but then so did former Presidents Bush I and Clinton and Bush II and Obama. Americans reward politicians who lie, if the lies are offered with emotion or silkiness. Trump just blusters through, like a cheesy house announcer at a pro wrestling match.
The other day, The Washington Post outed Biden, known plagiarist and gaffe machine, for making up a story about his own heroism as vice president in a war zone honoring an American soldier.
"Biden got the time period, the location, the heroic act, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony," the Post wrote.
He told that whopper to puff himself up, like some Commander McBragg. Biden insists such criticism is "irrelevant" and pushes ever forward, building a safe mind palace for himself on the shores of some golden pond, from which he will run his general election presidential campaign against Trump.
Unless Elizabeth Warren breaks some eggs, and soon.

Texto completo: U.S. manufacturing slowed in August
The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted last month, heightening fears that the trade war with China could bring on a recession. Manufacturing accounts for just 11% of the country's gross domestic product, but it is often seen as a harbinger of what lies ahead. The manufacturing index was at 49.1 for August, down from 51.2 in July. Anything below 50 is considered a sign of contraction.
Campbell Soup to sell European chips brands
Campbell Soup Co. has agreed to sell its European chips brands for $80 million to Valeo Foods, the Camden, N.J.-based soup company announced Monday. The two chips businesses - Kettle Brands Ltd., based in Norwich, England, and Yellow Chips B.V. - were bought in 2018 as part of the Snyder's-Lance Inc acquisition. Campbell said it will continue selling Kettle chips in the U.S., where it also owns Cape Cod potato chips and other salty snack brands. The sale is part of Campbell's plan to sell overseas businesses to pay off debt and concentrate on North American business.
UAW picks GM as bargaining target
The United Auto Workers union has picked General Motors as the target company for this year's contract talks with Detroit's three automakers. The move means any deal with the company will set the pattern for Ford and Fiat Chrysler. It also means that if the union decides to go on strike, it will be against GM. Contracts with the union representing about 152,000 workers expire Sept. 14. Automakers are making billions in profits and workers want a bigger slice. The companies want to get closer to parity with foreign automakers with U.S. factories.
Samsung is working on a foldable phone
Samsung Electronics Co. is preparing to unveil its second foldable device early next year, a luxury phone that folds down into a compact-sized square. The South Korean smartphone giant is working on a device with a 6.7-inch inner display that shrinks to a pocketable square when it's folded inward like a clamshell, people familiar with the product's development said. Samsung is seeking to make its second bendable gadget more affordable and thinner than this year's Galaxy Fold, they said.
Dealmaker Franklin agrees to buy APi Group
J2 Acquisition, the investment vehicle backed by serial dealmaker Martin Franklin, made its debut acquisition after an almost two-year search with a deal to acquire U.S. engineer and oil pipeline contractor APi Group for about $2.9 billion. London-based J2, which is run by Mr. Franklin and longtime partners James Lillie and Ian Ashken, is looking to build on their track record of creating outsized shareholder returns, most notably with Jarden Corp.

WHO URGES COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE: The director general of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Tuesday called for world leaders to support universal healthcare coverage, even as he acknowledged pursuing such a system was difficult politically.
Tedros campaigned on the issue of universal health coverage when he was running for WHO’s top slot, and on Sept. 23, the United Nations General Assembly is meeting to discuss the issue. Ahead of the meeting, WHO will publish a report showing that countries are not on track to meet their previously agreed-upon 2030 goal to get there.
“My message at the high-level meeting will be clear: universal healthcare is a political choice,” Tedros wrote on Tuesday. “I call on all leaders to make that choice.”
The 2030 timeline was ambitious. About half of the world’s population doesn’t have access to healthcare. While WHO defines universal health coverage as having “all individuals and communities receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship,” it also notes that countries need a robust healthcare workforce and have to come up with a financially sustainable plan. Even developed countries that have insurance for everyone struggle with access and budget issues.
In his statement on Tuesday, Tedros said he was reminded of how urgent the issue was after returning from a visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is in the middle of a dire Ebola outbreak.
“I was reminded once again that Ebola is just one symptom of a deeper problem: When people don’t have access to health services, or those services are of poor quality or don’t meet their needs, diseases can spread and lives can be lost,” he wrote.

SANDERS CAMP SPARS WITH WAPO OVER WHAT THE PAPER CALLS A ‘FLAWED STATISTIC’: Senior adviser to Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign Warren Gunnels demanded a retraction in a letter to the Washington Post after fact checker Salvador Rizzo said Sanders’ oft-cited statistic that “500,000 Americans will go bankrupt this year from medical bills” was inaccurate. Sanders has repeated the statistic on Twitter and CNN.
Where does the stat come from? The figure relies on a 2018 editorial in the American Journal of Public Health in which Dr. David U. Himmelstein surveyed 910 debtors and found that 66.5% said medical costs were “somewhat” or “very much” to blame for the 750,489 bankruptcies last year to arrive at the 500,000 figure.
Rizzo wrote in his fact check that by citing the statistic, Sanders conflated the claim that medical costs are "somewhat" to blame for bankruptcies with the claim that they are solely to blame. Rizzo said instead that the editorial only shows that medical costs contribute to bankruptcies, rather than that they are to blame for two-thirds of them.
Himmelstein, a supporter of a single-payer healthcare system, took issue with Rizzo’s determination, saying that asking for a single cause of bankruptcy “is a meaningless question.” He wrote to the Post that several factors contribute to bankruptcy and people “cannot identify a single problem among them. Thus, if an illness led to lost work time (and hence income) and medical bills, debtors cannot separate out these different problems; they are of a piece.”
What does Gunnels’ letter say? Gunnels accused Rizzo of anti-Sanders reporting and said that Himmelstein’s editorial was, contrary to Rizzo’s reporting, peer-reviewed. Gunnels’ letter, addressed to Washington Post editor Marty Baron, demands a retraction of the “inappropriate coverage” immediately as well as a commitment “to covering Senator Sanders in a fair, professional and ethical manner that finally starts honoring the most basic standards of accuracy.”
Sanders plans to erase medical debt if elected president: Sanders has announced that he will be releasing a plan to have the government pay off $81 billion in medical debt. It’s not yet clear how much the plan would cost because the proposal would involve the government negotiating the pay-back amounts.
FEDERAL AND STATE HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE SEARCHING FOR A LINK BETWEEN VAPING AND LUNG DISEASES: After the count of respiratory illnesses across 25 states reached 215 last week, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced they are teaming up with state health officials to pinpoint exactly how much vaping nicotine and THC contributed to the confirmed cases. Patients are reporting chest pains and difficulty breathing, and one Illinois patient died of a respiratory disease, having reported e-cigarette use. The FDA and CDC asked state officials to figure out what patients were using prior to getting sick, because, as CDC Director Robert Redfield and acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless said Friday, “Even though cases appear similar, it is not clear if these cases have a common cause or if they are different diseases with similar presentations, which is why our ongoing investigation is critical.”
RBG ASSURES DC CROWD SHE’S ON THE CUSP OF FULL RECOVERY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told a crowd of thousands at D.C.’s National Book Festival that she’s on her way “to being very well” after undergoing radiation treatment for a malignant tumor on her pancreas. She has received treatments for both colon and pancreatic cancers in the past and recently underwent a lobectomy of one of her lungs after suffering a fall leading to three fractured ribs. Ginsburg is 86 and the oldest member of the Supreme Court, on which she has served since 1993.
FBI SEIZED FORMER MARINE’S FIREARMS UNDER AUSPICES OF OREGON’S RED FLAG LAW: The FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force confiscated Oregon resident and former Marine Shane Kohfield’s five guns, including an AR-15, after he threatened to “slaughter” antifa activists who he thought were coming after right-wing activists. He said all of this through a loudspeaker outside of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s home in July. Oregon’s red flag law allows law enforcement officials and family members to ask a judge to take firearms from a dangerous or unstable person using an “extreme risk protection order.”
SERVICE MINI HORSE BOARDS A FLIGHT FROM CHICAGO TO OMAHA, WHICH IS TOTALLY LEGAL: An American Airlines passenger brought her service animal, a miniature horse named Flirty, on a flight from Chicago to Omaha which, believe it or not, is absolutely legal. In fact, the Department of Transportation lists mini horses as one of the most common service animals, among cats and dogs, and must be permitted to travel on aircraft. A tweet from Flirty The Mini Service Horse said Friday: "Flirty was FANTASTIC and handled it all like a pro. That being said, I’m going to keep traveling by car, it’s just easier on Flirty. Flying will be reserved for emergencies and such.” No word yet on whether the trip from Chicago to Omaha was an emergency.

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

Texto completo: The San Francisco FogCam, believed to be the longest-running public webcam, was supposed to shut down at the end of August, 25 years after it began broadcasting images of life at San Francisco State University (and, on occasion, the city's trademark fog).
But after recent news reports publicized the beloved webcam's impending demise, the university decided to step in to "preserve and run it indefinitely," according to the FogCam's website.
"San Francisco State University can confirm it has agreed to continue maintaining the FogCam, which prevents shutdown of the service," the website said. "San Francisco State University has supported operation of the FogCam since its inception in 1994, a major technology milestone at the time. The university looks forward to continuing the webcam's legacy."
The FogCam was originally set up by two students at the university, Jeff Schwartz, known online as Webdog, and Dan Wong, called Danno. They were studying instructional technologies at the Graduate College of Education at the time.
According to a 2004 interview with The Golden Gate Xpress, a student-run publication, the men bought the camera from a campus bookstore and sought to provide "a typical view of campus life," long before the popularization of streaming video. The FogCam began capturing images every 20 seconds, as it still does today.
Over the decades, the webcam has drawn a sizable following as an everyday chronicle of the seemingly mundane.
Its location on campus has sometimes changed, partly because of run-ins with school administrators who threatened to shut it down on several occasions.
Mr. Wong and Mr. Schwartz had initially wanted to put the webcam in the student center, but they were denied access. They placed it in front of the student health center, in a room overlooking Tapia Drive, and, ultimately, on the edge of campus, facing Holloway Avenue.
The webcam was becoming harder to maintain. Mr. Schwartz told the news website SFGate last month that "we no longer have a really good view or place to put the camera."
"The university tolerates us," he added, "but they don't really endorse us and so we have to find secure locations on our own."
San Francisco State University did not respond to a request seeking comment on Sunday evening. Neither did the FogCam's creators.
Before he knew that the FogCam would not be turned off, Mr. Schwartz told The New York Times last month that it was easier to accept the end because internet ventures nowadays tended to be more corporate in nature.
"The big technology companies have stifled innovation," he said. "They rake in billions of dollars by surveilling people who do -- and don't -- buy products."
Mr. Schwartz said he and Mr. Wong had never sought to make money with the FogCam.
"It was a throwback to the time when anyone could publish anything," Mr. Schwartz said. "A lot of people were experimenting. It wasn't very exciting. But it didn't matter."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: CARLSBAD, N.M. -- The first time Carlsbad Medical Center sued Misti Price, she was newly divorced and working two jobs to support her three young children.
The hospital demanded payment in 2012 for what Ms. Price recalled as an emergency room visit for one of her children who has asthma. She could not afford a lawyer, and she did not have the money to pay the bill.
Ms. Price let the summons go unanswered, figuring she would settle the balance -- with interest, about $ 3,600 -- when she could. A few months later, she opened her paycheck and discovered the hospital had garnished her wages by $ 870 a month.
Her car was soon repossessed because she could no longer make the payments. She was on the verge of losing her house, too, when her mortgage company stepped in to help her save it.
"I was going to let it go," Ms. Price said, tearing up recently in an interview at the Carlsbad Public Library. "It was tough."
And it was only the beginning. Ms. Price, 40, a nurse and local 4-H leader, has been sued five times by Carlsbad Medical Center, for bills totaling more than $ 17,000.
It's not because she and her children are uninsured; according to the hospital, the charges are what she owed after her insurer had paid. But Ms. Price said she had never received an itemized bill outlining exactly what she owed money for. The collection agency wanted the balance in full, and she was not able to work out a payment plan until after she was sued.
In this town, she has a lot of company.
An examination of court records by The New York Times found almost 3,000 lawsuits filed by Carlsbad Medical Center against patients over medical debt since 2015, more than 500 of them through August of this year alone. Few hospitals sue so many patients so often.
Ms. Price's sister, a police dispatcher, has been sued twice. Her husband has been sued. The county judge who hears many of these cases was once sued, too.
Carlsbad Medical Center is not the only hospital to have filed reams of lawsuits over unpaid bills. In Memphis, Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, a nonprofit hospital, filed 8,300 lawsuits from 2014 through 2018, including some against its own employees, according to an investigation by the journalism nonprofit groups ProPublica and MLK50.
In Virginia, hospitals filed more than 20,000 lawsuits over patient debt in 2017 alone, according to a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Just five hospitals accounted for half of the resulting wage garnishments in the state.
People across the country are coping with soaring medical costs, opaque pricing and surprise bills, but these issues are felt acutely in one-hospital towns like Carlsbad, where residents have few options for care -- and must pay whatever prices the hospital sets.
"Hospitals that have little competition can negotiate higher rates, because the insurer wants that hospital in their network," said Sara Collins of the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund. Patient deductibles, which must be paid out of pocket, are rising for almost everyone, she added.
Nationally, more than one in four consumers in 2018 were reported to credit bureaus over unpaid debt, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. More than half of those reports involved medical bills. One survey of women with breast cancer found that a third of those with health insurance had been referred to bill collectors; among those without insurance, the number rose to 77 percent.
People confronted with medical debt typically drain their savings, the Commonwealth Fund has found, and 43 percent said it lowered their credit rating, suggesting that many of these consumers were reported to collections agencies.
Melissa Suggs, a spokeswoman for Carlsbad Medical Center, declined requests for interviews about the hospital's debt collection practices.
"The majority of accounts from which we seek to collect payment are patients with insurance who have not fulfilled their deductible, co-payment, or coinsurance responsibility set by their health insurance plan -- and who have chosen not to enter into a payment arrangement for those amounts," the hospital said in a written statement.
Following inquiries from The New York Times, the hospital said on Friday that it would no longer sue patients whose incomes are below 150 percent of the federal poverty level (roughly $ 19,000 for a single person), whether they have insurance or not, and would release current court judgments against any such patients.
Uninsured patients will now receive "discounts" that will bring down their bills roughly to Medicaid reimbursement rates, the hospital said.
New Mexico expanded Medicaid enrollment under the Affordable Care Act in 2014, and most of these patients qualify for coverage. The state is now considering a Medicaid "buy-in" option that would further expand coverage.
Liens and garnished wages
A small, sun-baked town once known mostly for its nearby caverns, Carlsbad's population has ballooned in recent years with an influx of workers drilling and fracking in the oil-rich Permian Basin.
The town's sole hospital, Carlsbad Medical Center has long faced criticism from community leaders for high prices.
In 2013, officials of Carlsbad, which is self-insured, formed a task force called the Mayor's Hospital Reform Committee to address the strain on its budget over health care costs for city employees. Administrators considered sending employees to neighboring towns for care before they were able to negotiate lower rates for key services.
In a presentation to the state legislature in 2015, the mining company Intrepid Potash, a major employer in Carlsbad, calculated that it would be cheaper for one of its workers to travel to Hawaii for a gall bladder operation -- including airfare for two, and a seven-day island cruise -- than to get the procedure at the local hospital. The company still encourages employees to seek care out of town when possible.
In May, a nationwide survey by the RAND Corporation found that private insurers paid Carlsbad Medical Center five times more than Medicare would have paid for the same services -- about twice the figure in the state overall.
Carlsbad Medical Center is owned by Community Health Systems, a chain of hospitals based in Franklin, Tenn. An investigation in 2014 by the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper found that the three hospitals charging the highest prices in the state were all owned by that chain.
In 2015, the company paid $ 98 million to the federal government to settle charges that it had inflated revenue by admitting patients unnecessarily. Community Health Systems admitted no wrongdoing.
In 2018, a unit of the company agreed to pay $ 260 million to settle charges, brought by the Department of Justice, that it had systematically overbilled for emergency room visits. Company officials noted that the fraud occurred before C.H.S. bought the subsidiary.
There are alternative hospitals near Carlsbad, but the closest is more than 40 minutes away, in the town of Artesia -- which residents may find too far to drive to in an emergency. One of Ms. Price's bills followed an emergency room visit after her daughter broke her arm on the soccer field.
"When your kid's in pain, it's hard to wait 45 minutes to get them there," she said.
Victoria Pina, 38, an instructional aide who lives in nearby Loving, N.M., visited the Carlsbad Medical Center emergency room several times for a shoulder that repeatedly dislocated.
"For me to be driving over 45 minutes to an hour to Artesia, I can't make it," she said.
She's been sued three times by Carlsbad Medical Center over E.R. bills. After the first suit, she tried to call a number listed on the paperwork to work out payments, but said she never got a return call.
The hospital attempted to garnish her wages, and then placed liens on her home totaling more than $ 9,000. She and her husband discovered the liens recently when they attempted to refinance their mortgage to a lower interest rate.
Had they been able to lower their house payment, they could have put aside the money to pay the hospital bill, she said. "But because of the lien on the property, we can't bring our house payment down," she added. "And that's hard."
If Ms. Pina had gone to another hospital nearby, she likely would have escaped a lawsuit. Lovelace Regional Hospital in Roswell, just over an hour away, has filed about two dozen suits over patient debts since 2015.
Artesia General has no debt-collection suits against patients on record since 2015. Neither does Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque -- which, at 450 licensed beds, is almost four times as large as the hospital in Carlsbad.
By contrast, other hospitals owned by Community Health Systems in New Mexico also regularly file suits over unpaid bills. Lea Regional Medical Center in Hobbs has filed almost 2,000 such suits since 2015. Mountain View Regional Medical Center in Las Cruces has filed about 2,000 suits against patients in that time; almost half of them came just this year.
In Carlsbad, these lawsuits flood the docket. District Judge Lisa Riley, who has been on the bench in Eddy County since 2011, estimated that about one-third of all civil cases that come across her desk involve unpaid medical debt.
The overwhelming majority of lawsuits simply go into default judgment, she said, meaning that the defendants fail to respond -- as was the situation in Ms. Price's first case -- and the hospital proceeds to garnish wages.
"Out of those people who do respond, which is very few, the responses almost always say, 'I admit I owe the money and I'd like to make payment arrangements,' or 'I can't afford to pay it right now,"' Judge Riley said. Hearings on the hospital cases are rare.
Hospital suits over unpaid debt are so frequent in Eddy County, "I had no idea that it wasn't common practice," Judge Riley added. "I assumed that all hospitals did that."
She, too, was a target of the hospital before she became a judge. Her husband had been disputing emergency room charges when the hospital sued; the case was resolved and dismissed. (Judge Riley would not comment further, citing ethics restrictions that prohibit judges from making statements about matters that might appear in court.)
Judge Riley's case and others from Carlsbad appear in an upcoming book called "The Price We Pay," by Dr. Marty Makary, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins University who studies the costs of American health care and led the study of hospital suits in Virginia.
Debt collection is common in the health care industry, he said, but lawsuits are a traumatic way to force patients to pay. Normally hospitals simply refer unpaid bills to debt collectors; fewer file lawsuits and then garnish wages or place liens on homes.
In his study of Virginia, 36 percent of hospitals garnished the wages of patients owing money, with 10 percent doing so frequently. (Even his own institution, however, has come under fire for suing the poor.)

When seeking payment for medical bills, "Collections agencies may harass you with phone calls," Dr. Makary said. "They may send a note to your credit bureau, but they're not reaching into your paycheck."
Many of these patients are low-paid workers with little savings. Dr. Makary's study found that Walmart was the most common employer of those whose wages were garnished over medical bills. "These are hardworking Americans who did nothing wrong," he said.
The cost of care differs from institution to institution, partly because hospitals have broad discretion in setting prices. Charges for the same services vary widely, even when hospitals have similar patient demographics, and the amounts billed have little relationship to quality.
If you are a hospital executive, "you could charge whatever you want," said Dr. Makary. "You could charge $ 1 million for an X-ray."
Surprise bills
What frustrates patients is the inability to find out prices until the bill comes, even when they ask. "They say, 'Oh, we can't tell you until insurance pays," said Melissa Phillips, Ms. Price's sister. "That's the answer. Or, 'Depends what all we have to do."'
Ms. Phillips, a police dispatcher who also has insurance, has been sued twice over hospital bills. Her husband was sued once.
Carlsbad Medical Center does have a chargemaster of sticker prices posted on its website. The charges are listed according to "service code" -- some clear, others less so.
"Blood transfusion" is listed at $ 1,303.58. A more cryptic "CC-RHC" is listed at $ 53,711.62. But those prices differ from what patients actually will be asked to pay. In a statement, the hospital claimed that no patient actually pays the listed price.
In July, the Trump administration announced a proposed rule to require hospitals to make public the prices negotiated with insurers.
The disclosure is an important first step, but will not necessarily keep patients from amassing unanticipated debt, said Jack Hoadley, research professor emeritus at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute.
Patients are still responsible for co-pays and deductibles, and the negotiated fee wouldn't reflect extra payments for complications. "It still doesn't fully tell you what your out-of-pocket liability is going to be," he said.
Ms. Price's insurance statements indicate that many of her bills have come from high deductibles and some from out-of-network charges -- even though Carlsbad Medical Center is in network on her insurance.
Patients sometimes go to in-network hospitals for emergency care, but don't learn until they get the bill that some providers or services -- especially those in the emergency room -- were actually out of network. Across the country, these "surprise bills" have become such a problem that many state legislatures have outlawed them.
New Mexico has such a law, but it does not go into effect until next year, said John G. Franchini, the New Mexico insurance commissioner.
"Small hospitals cannot afford an emergency-room medical doctor," he said. "They can't afford the full-time cost. This has become an abuse because people also can't afford to pay it."
John Heaton, a retired pharmacist and former New Mexico state legislator who lives in Carlsbad, worries that the hospital's charges and aggressive billing are driving patients into nearby towns whenever possible.
"When somebody goes out of town, that revenue is lost," he said. "And because it's lost, the hospital has to charge everybody else more."
Ms. Price remarried in 2017, and her husband has health insurance through his job at an oil field supply company. His wages were garnished last year by the hospital, the result of a lawsuit he does not remember ever seeing.
She no longer takes any chances. When she recently needed a mammogram, she said, "I drove to Artesia."

Texto completo: A commercial dive boat with 39 passengers and crew members aboard was engulfed in flames early Monday and sunk hours later near the Santa Cruz Island shoreline off the Ventura County coast. By late Monday, authorities confirmed that 25 people died in the ordeal, with several others still unaccounted for, the Associated Press reported.
FIve of the boat’s six crew members were rescued.
By midday Monday, authorities had confirmed that four victims were found dead near the 75-foot vessel Conception, which departed Saturday from Santa Barbara Harbor for a Labor Day holiday weekend excursion. Later in the day, crews discovered four more bodies on the ocean floor near the wreckage of the vessel, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.
The AP reported that, by late Monday, the Coast Guard had confirmed that at least 25 people had died.
Torrance resident says ‘divine intervention’ kept him off deadly dive boat
What sparked the horrific fire, which was first reported to the Coast Guard via a frantic mayday call around 3:30 a.m., wasn’t immediately known.
“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Brown said at a somber news conference. “We understand the tremendous burden they are under right now as they wait to determine exactly what happened. We will be working diligently to get them as much information as possible as soon as possible.”
Authorities were continuing to search into the evening for more of the 33 passengers unaccounted for after flames tore through boat. The Conception also carried six crew members, five of whom were rescued after fleeing the burning craft, officials said.
“We will continue to search but we should be prepared for the worst outcome,” U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said.
Firefighters responded to the blaze shortly before 3:30 a.m., about 90 miles from Los Angeles. Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach overheard a mayday call about 15 minutes earlier of a commercial vessel with 39 people aboard.
By the time crews arrived shortly after the mayday call, the boat was fully engulfed in flames with little anyone could do to save it, said Mark Hartwig, Santa Barbara County’s fire chief.
Crews from the Coast Guard, Santa Barbara Fire Department, Ventura County Fire Department and Vessel Assist responded. The fire crews were fighting the blaze when the vessel sank 20 yards off shore in 64 feet of water, officials said.
Authorities said that initial four recovered bodies had injuries consistent with drowning, according to The Associated Press.
Five of the boat’s crew members were rescued by a nearby boat.
“The crew was actually already awake and on the bridge and they jumped off,” Rochester told reporters at a news conference at the Channel Islands Harbor.
They were evacuated on to a good Samaritan’s boat, Grape Escape, the Coast Guard said. Two of the crew members had minor injuries, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.
“When we looked out, the other boat was totally engulfed in flames, from stem to stern,” Grape Escape owner Bob Hansen told The New York Times. “I could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat. There were these explosions every few beats. You can’t prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.”
As the morning turned to afternoon, family members of the missing passengers trickled in to the Coast Guard station in Oxnard in search of answers.
Sheriff Brown told reporters that the passengers would have be identified through DNA, depending on the condition of their remains.
A woman who came to the harbor early Monday said, “My son was on that boat.” She was led away by a Ventura County firefighter.
At around 8:30 a.m. the vessel had a portion of the bow sticking out of the water, authorities said.
Rochester said that the missing passengers were sleeping below deck at the time of the fire. She said authorities were working with the owners of the boat which had been in “full compliance” prior to its trip departure.
Rochester said rescuers would continue searching through the night.
“This isn’t a day that we wanted to wake up to,” she said at the afternoon news conference.
Several photos on social media posted by the fire agencies showed the Santa Barbara Harbor-based vessel completely overtaken by flames.
According to the Worldwide Diving Adventures website, the boat was on its last day of a three-day diving excursion that started in Santa Barbara Harbor. The Labor Day weekend trip, which started Aug. 31, gave passengers the opportunity to see marine life and explore San Miguel Island, according to the website.
The Conception had departed at 4 a.m. Saturday with plans to return Monday.
The boat was launched in 1981 and had a 46-person capacity, according to its profile on the website of Truth Aquatics, the Santa Barbara company that owns the ship. It had rafts and life jackets for 110 passengers and a fixed CO2 engine room for fire suppression.
Divers sleep in a single room of bunk beds, according to a diagram of the Conception posted on the website.
Thomas Kruger, director of scuba operations at Dive N’ Surf in Redondo Beach, said the boat and the operator had a good reputation.
Dive N’ Surf has booked charters on the Conception and other dive boats operated by Truth Aquatics, but not for at least a year mainly because of the distance, he said.
“This has been way out of left field,” Kruger said in an interview Monday. “The boat has been a phenomenally good boat that was meticulously kept. There was nothing anytime they were diving that would have indicated an event like this.”
Dive boats of that size are typically inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard about once per year, Kruger said. Operators also generally perform regular checks of fire extinguishers and other safety devices whenever the boat goes out, he said.
“Having a boat of that caliber there is a lot that goes into maintaining those boats and the systems on them,” Kruger said.
The event had a major effect on the close-knit diving community. Calls have been coming in inquiring whether anyone local was on board, Kruger said. As of Monday afternoon, the identities of the victims had not been released and Kruger did not know if any local divers were on board.
“We are sending out our prayers and our hopes that we get some better news by the end of the day,” he said.
Dale Sheckler, a Torrance man who is an experienced diver, had planned on spending Labor Day weekend aboard the Conception, but a hip surgery sidelined those plans.
“I feel frightened and relieved at the same time,” Sheckler said. “I’m also sick about the lives that were lost. I’m upset about it. My heart goes out to them.”
Sheckler said he’s been on the Conception several times before, but hasn’t been on the vessel in well over a year.
“I think considering the fact that the crew lost one of their members, I think that people need to understand that the crew was probably unable to assist those in distress,” he said.
Members of the diving community also expressed their grief on social media. Many shared their thoughts on the Truth Aquatics Facebook page, some recounting their own diving experiences.

Others showed photos of the vessel’s sleeping area, pondering if passengers could have escaped.
Most, like Kruger, offered their condolences and prayers.
Sprinkled into the comments were those who questioned why members of the crew may have been the only ones to survive. That sentiment was addressed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who Monday afternoon called for an “immediate and robust” investigation.
“It’s inconceivable that with all the safety regulations we have in place today, a fire on a boat can lead to the loss of life we saw this morning near Santa Cruz Island,” Feinstein said in a statement.
“We must know what fire-suppression systems and other emergency equipment are in place on these boats and whether they were in working order on the Conception. And we need to understand exactly how the crew was trained and, if they were awake and above-deck, why they were unable to alert or help rescue passengers.”
The Channel Islands National Park Service said that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, Santa Barbara County Fire Department, United States Coast Guard are working with it as a unified command.
A one-mile safety zone was established around the perimeter of the incident while search-and-rescue efforts continue, officials said. A 3,000-foot flight restriction was also temporarily placed around the ship.
Authorities have established a Family Assistance Center at the Earl Warren Showgrounds, 3400 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, which is expected to remain open through Thursday. Information via phone is available from the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management at 833-688-5551.

Texto completo: A commercial dive boat with 39 passengers and crew members aboard was engulfed in flames early Monday and sunk hours later near the Santa Cruz Island shoreline off the Ventura County coast. By late Monday, authorities confirmed that 25 people died in the ordeal, with several others still unaccounted for, the Associated Press reported.
FIve of the boat’s six crew members were rescued.
By midday Monday, authorities had confirmed that four victims were found dead near the 75-foot vessel Conception, which departed Saturday from Santa Barbara Harbor for a Labor Day holiday weekend excursion. Later in the day, crews discovered four more bodies on the ocean floor near the wreckage of the vessel, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.
The AP reported that, by late Monday, the Coast Guard had confirmed that at least 25 people had died.
Torrance resident says ‘divine intervention’ kept him off deadly dive boat
What sparked the horrific fire, which was first reported to the Coast Guard via a frantic mayday call around 3:30 a.m., wasn’t immediately known.
“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Brown said at a somber news conference. “We understand the tremendous burden they are under right now as they wait to determine exactly what happened. We will be working diligently to get them as much information as possible as soon as possible.”
Authorities were continuing to search into the evening for more of the 33 passengers unaccounted for after flames tore through boat. The Conception also carried six crew members, five of whom were rescued after fleeing the burning craft, officials said.
“We will continue to search but we should be prepared for the worst outcome,” U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said.
Firefighters responded to the blaze shortly before 3:30 a.m., about 90 miles from Los Angeles. Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach overheard a mayday call about 15 minutes earlier of a commercial vessel with 39 people aboard.
By the time crews arrived shortly after the mayday call, the boat was fully engulfed in flames with little anyone could do to save it, said Mark Hartwig, Santa Barbara County’s fire chief.
Crews from the Coast Guard, Santa Barbara Fire Department, Ventura County Fire Department and Vessel Assist responded. The fire crews were fighting the blaze when the vessel sank 20 yards off shore in 64 feet of water, officials said.
Authorities said that initial four recovered bodies had injuries consistent with drowning, according to The Associated Press.
Five of the boat’s crew members were rescued by a nearby boat.
“The crew was actually already awake and on the bridge and they jumped off,” Rochester told reporters at a news conference at the Channel Islands Harbor.
They were evacuated on to a good Samaritan’s boat, Grape Escape, the Coast Guard said. Two of the crew members had minor injuries, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.

Remembering the point of Labor Day

Texto completo: It was known as the "Treaty of Detroit," but it did not end a shooting war. In 1950, Walter Reuther, the legendary leader of the United Auto Workers union, and Charlie Wilson, the CEO of General Motors, agreed to a historic labor contract that bought the automaker five years of labor peace.
After more than a decade of sometimes violent conflict and short-term contracts, Wilson wanted stability so he could expand his company. The result was a trend-setting deal that included not only substantial wage increases but also generous pension and health care coverage. The Washington Post labeled it "a great event in industrial history."
Those were the days. At the peak of its power at the end of World War II, the American labor movement -- which had cooperated closely with management and government to create democracy's great arsenal -- fundamentally altered the social contract in the United States. Fortune magazine said the Treaty of Detroit "made the worker to an amazing degree a middle class member of a middle class society."
The story of the Reuther-Wilson pact is told in Steven Greenhouse's "Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present and Future of American Labor," an excellent account of how important strong unions were in moving our nation "toward greater economic and social justice," and how their decline has increased "inequality and unfairness."
Greenhouse, who spent 19 years covering labor and workplace issues for The New York Times, is unabashedly pro-labor without ignoring the union movement's warts and shortcomings. His essential point is that, while we can talk all we want about how technological change and the decline of manufacturing work have undercut the living standards of many Americans, the truth is that better wages and benefits are almost always the product of bargaining power. Building that power was the work of tough-minded idealists like Reuther, backed by New Deal-era labor laws rooted in an understanding that mass purchasing power underwritten by decent wages was good for the overall economy.
In the years since the Treaty of Detroit, the negotiating leverage of American workers has been vastly diminished. In the absence of powerful unions, we have yet to find an alternative and sustainable way of representing employees' interests.
We have also lost the sense of solidarity that originally inspired Labor Day. Greenhouse recounts a conversation with his then-86-year-old mother when he was in Wisconsin covering former Republican Gov. Scott Walker's offensive to gut collective bargaining and cut public employee benefits.
"When I was growing up," she told him, "people used to say, 'Look at the good wages and benefits that people in a union have. I want to join a union.' Now people say, 'Look at the good wages and benefits that union members have. They're getting more than I get. That's not fair. Let's take away some of what they have.'"
How did we get to this point? In another must-read book for our moment, "The Economists' Hour: False Prophets, Free Markets and the Fracture of Society," Binyamin Appelbaum argues that the growing role of professional economists since the late 1960s fundamentally altered popular understandings about how the world should work.
We have moved, Appelbaum argues, from a healthy respect for what markets can accomplish in their proper sphere to a "single-minded embrace of markets" that "has come at the expense of economic equality, of the health of liberal democracy, and of future generations."
"In the pursuit of efficiency," Appelbaum writes, "policy makers subsumed the interests of Americans as producers to the interests of Americans as consumers, trading well-paid jobs for low cost electronics."
Appelbaum, who writes about economics and business for The New York Times editorial page, values what economists do, but the ones he respects most are those who understand the limits of a purely material understanding of what matters. He quotes the brilliant Amartya Sen: "Economic growth cannot sensibly be treated as an end in itself. Development has to be more concerned with enhancing the lives we lead and the freedoms we enjoy."
The financial crisis of 2008, as Appelbaum suggests, will be seen historically as dropping the curtain on a period of market supremacy and radical individualism. The transition to the next act is not pretty. The rise of right-wing nationalism is part of the reaction against the earlier era's mistakes. The times call for democratic visionaries of Reuther's stripe who understand that free societies -- and, yes, thriving economies -- depend on sharing the fruits of our productivity and rebuilding a solidarity that can overcome our fractiousness.

Texto completo: When I adopted my dog, Regan, six months ago, I made a few promises to myself. First, I would never skimp on her exercise. Second, I would never feed her from the table or allow groveling in its vicinity. Third, I would never get lazy and use her as column fodder.
Two out of three ain’t bad.
She’s 5-1/2 years old, about 48 pounds and mostly black, but with blazes of white in all the right places: her paws, her chest, the tip of her tail. “Border collie?” ask people who know the breed, but a DNA test said different. She’s mostly Australian shepherd and Siberian husky.
And she’s not just smart. She’s telepathic. From the slightest twitch of my thoughts, she can tell that I’m mulling the mortal sin of leaving our Manhattan apartment without her, in which event she wedges herself against the front door to form a blockade of fur and flesh. I’m totally convinced that she could beat Donald Trump in a general election, but she’d never get through the Democratic primary. Her Upward Hound proposal for puppy pre-K is an incremental, modestly funded shadow of Bernie Sanders’ version.
But this column isn’t really about Regan, so go easy on me. She’s my pivot into a lament about the degradation of our country’s civic culture and a suggestion of how to push back at that process. You expected a simple, sentimental ode to the joys of a four-legged companion? Sorry. This is a mutt-and-switch.
You see, something happens when Regan does leave the apartment with me, something so rare these days that it’s practically revolutionary. I have honest-to-goodness conversations with actual strangers, who are from all kinds of backgrounds and occupy all sorts of categories: young and old, black and white, rich and not, fit and fat.
Some use highfalutin words befitting their highfalutin jobs. Some talk bluntly and plainly. Some curse the city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio. Some have a more generous assessment of him. None bicker, because we don’t have our guards up. That’s not the posture we’re in. A dog or dogs have established a bridge between us and started us off on a note of good faith. Because we love dogs, we can’t be all bad.
If the strangers are dog-less and are pausing to pet Regan, our exchange may be as brief as their asking and my explaining the origin of her name. (Her previous owner bestowed it on her, though I sometimes joke that it’s an homage to the little girl in “The Exorcist.”) If they have dogs of their own, it lengthens, in part because our charges’ olfactory inventories of each other can be extensive, not to mention invasive. I wish I were half as uninhibited as Regan. OK, maybe just one-fifth.
In Central Park, there’s a whole vibrant society of those of us with dogs, especially during the off-leash hours before 9 a.m. and after 9 p.m., when I let Regan lead the way and the people I get to know are appendages of the dogs she decides to wrestle with. They’re not chosen by some social-media algorithm, sorted by income level, screened by political affiliation.
Which is to say that these communions are gloriously out of step with the times. Over the past decade, I’ve watched more and more Americans retreat with greater and greater efficiency into increasingly homogeneous enclaves. I’ve marveled over our fine-grained tiers of affluence and our microclimates of privilege, which are reflected in and reinforced by the neighborhoods that we settle in, the vacation spots that we flock to, the exercise fads that we embrace, the schools that we send our children to.
And technology both speeds us to people who think precisely as we do and filters out anyone who might challenge us. We can click, scroll, sweep, share, like and favorite our way into a meticulously tailored and reliably validating tribe. There’s no real surprise, no true spontaneity, no actual serendipity.
But when I’m out and about with Regan, there’s all of that and more. There’s mutual courtesy and reciprocal generosity, for heaven’s sake. I’m not in the habit of asking random New Yorkers for freebies, or of responding cheerfully when some random New Yorker asks me for one, but I’m frequently cadging or gifting poop bags. When you’re about to bend down and scoop up your beloved’s odoriferous bequest, there’s no snobbery and no timidity, only solidarity.
My interactions in Central Park are partly about having a dog but just as much about what the dog encourages, even compels: spending time in public spaces that are open to everyone and well situated and appealing enough to guarantee that people from all walks of life cross paths.
Even before Regan came along, I found myself more drawn to such spaces than I’d once been and more conscious and appreciative of them as antidotes to the fragmenting of American life. I regularly visit Austin, Texas, which I love, and its open spirit is inextricable from the primacy of Lady Bird Lake, which is the name for a dammed stretch of the Colorado River that wends through the very center of the city and has a 10-mile trail for walking, hiking and biking that loops around it.
The trail has been continually refined and improved over the years, with the addition of a boardwalk that juts out over the water and a beautifully manicured pedestrian bridge that reminds me of New York City’s High Line. There’s no private analogue to this public treasure, which tugs the city’s residents out of whatever customized cocoons they may inhabit and into the light. I’ve put in hundreds of hours there — and fussed over scores of dogs. A statuesque Doberman was attached to a recent immigrant from Mexico who was part of the local restaurant scene and who pointed me to his favorite Texas barbecue.
A whole lot has gone wrong in New York City over the past quarter-century, but the expansion and improvement of parkland along the perimeter of Manhattan and on the Brooklyn waterfront has gone spectacularly right. The visitors to these greenbelts compose a group more diverse than any in the city’s gleaming shopping emporiums; they’re sweating, snoozing, sunbathing and strolling with their dogs on common ground, which is precisely what’s disappearing almost everywhere else.
The more parks, the better, though let’s not concentrate them in relatively affluent neighborhoods. And let’s throw public libraries into the mix. I’m elated to read about renewed attention to them and the reimagining of them as community centers that can draw heterogeneous crowds with a mix of needs.
We need more vigorous pushes in this direction, as sociologist Eric Klinenberg discussed in his recent book “Palaces for the People: How Social Infrastructure Can Help Fight Inequality, Polarization, and the Decline of Civic Life.” They’re one road out of a tribalism that’s tearing us apart.
And we need dogs, or at least we’re better off with them. They yank us outside of our narrowest selves. They force us to engage. In a perfect world, we’d do that on our own, but in this one, Regan plants herself squarely in front of a Central Park sprinkler, opens her jaws wide, treats the spray as an unusually emphatic water fountain and attracts an eclectic cluster of admirers who then fall easily into chitchat — about the cooling weather, the blooming skyline, new movies, old routines — that probably wouldn’t happen otherwise. We walk away feeling a little less isolated, a little less disconnected. I know I do.

Texto completo: As I write this article, I want you to know I’m not affiliated in any way with the media. I have been a police chief in four major cities and, in this capacity, my police department and I were often the focus of media attention. For over 20 years, I was consistently questioned by the press regarding officer-involved shootings, police officer misconduct and major crime problems.
During these years, I experienced frustrating times with reporters, but I never experienced what is currently being called “Fake News.” Probing for answers, the questions from reporters were periodically frustrating, but I never felt that reporters were trying to be dishonest or biased. Hard questions were designed to flush out the truth.
Consistently calling America’s major news outlets “Fake News” and “liberal” has been effective. Beginning with conservative talk radio and sustained by Fox News, repeatedly calling the mainstream media liberal has crystalized a belief in a substantial number of American’s that the major newspapers and national television channels are liberal.
This is an oblique attack on the First Amendment, and this not so subtle attack, has been effective. From calling the mainstream media the “Drive-by news” and labeling the major new outlets as liberal has worked.
The lack of an effective defense for America’s historic media sources has given this false narrative a strong foothold in our national mindset. It has facilitated the defense of conservative positions and conservative missteps. I know this broad bush label of liberal is not true in a majority of our major news outlets, but repeatedly stating that the media is liberal and calling their reporting “Fake News” has consequently formed an opinion that the major news sources are not truthful.
From journalism classes at Columbia University and Northwestern University, in the newsrooms from The Los Angeles Times to The New York Times, to college textbooks and university lectures, across the United States, the principle reporting values in journalism are honesty, integrity and truthfulness. These long-held values are ingrained in reporters, editors, news directors and publishers.
Violating these values is more than just unethical. These values have legal standing. The word “libel” is intentionally writing something you know to be false, and “slander” is saying something you know to be untrue. False reporting or “fake news” has legal consequences. News organizations can and are sued for reporting false information.
Read any contemporary textbook on journalism or communication and you will find the values of honesty, integrity and truthfulness fully explained as the important core values of journalism in America. These values are important to those responsible for reporting the news.
From experience, I know that if a bad or false idea is repetitively stated, there are those who will accept it as true. Repeatedly stating false information has consequences. Historically false statements are the building blocks of racism. Repeating false statements, by those in position of authority, increases the credibility of a lie.
Repetition is an ingrained learning tool. Repeating the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag builds patriotism. Repeating religious doctrine builds faith. But can you see the power of repeating an idea that is false has the same impact on individual belief? Repeating a false statement can destroy a value effectively just as repeating a highly respected value can create patriotism or faith.
The conservative movement, through talk radio and Fox News, has made the term “Fake News” viable. This tactic has hurt the credibility of the mainstream media, and in the process, has hurt the First Amendment’s protection of a free press.
When people only hear the ideas that support their own thinking, it creates a vacuum. This vacuum makes room for a long list of conspiracy theories and, in some people, the desire to attack those that are the subject of the false arguments.
From the Charlottesville white nationalist driving a car into people, to the person who attacked and killed Hispanic people in El Paso, “fake news rhetoric” has consequences and is damaging the First Amendment of our Bill of Rights.
All of us, as Americans, need to widen our knowledge and pay attention to what this attack on the First Amendment has created.

Texto completo: I hate movies about dogs.
Not because I think they’re intrinsically all bad. I just know dogs and for all the love and attention we give them, fate always takes their short little lives away just as we’ve gotten to really know them.
And, I know movies. For a successful movie to exist there must be conflict and a series of emotional arcs. This means in a movie centered on dogs something bad is going to happen. It always does. And, then I’m left a stupid wreck. That’s why.
The makers of “The Art of Racing in the Rain” must know there are people like me in the audience because their movie begins at the end, and in so doing they get the hardest part out of the way so they can tell their tale without that inevitability hanging over our heads. Fat chance.
While it is admirable, and very well acted by its principals Milo Ventimiglia, Amanda Seyfried, Kathy Baker, Martin Donavan and Kevin Costner as the voice of Enzo, the dog, it’s a melodramatic roller coaster built around the premise that for a dog to become reincarnated as a human, he or she must be prepared. They must learn as much as they can about humanity: our needs, drives, inspirations, and our faults. Only after all that will their little souls move on.
So, Enzo the dog finds his purpose when Denny Swift (Ventimiglia) picks him out of a litter of pups and takes him home. Denny is a race car driver and mechanic, which tells you right away the risks in his job will create some built-in conflicts, but Denny has an edge. He has figured out a way to drive in the rain that never fails him and as long as he uses that technique on the track, he’s fine. It’s when he fails to use it in life that he hits proverbial brick walls.
Part of that emerges when he meets and falls in love with an English-as-a-foreign language teacher named Eve (Seyfried). Then, they get married and have a sweet little daughter named Zoe (Ryan Kiera Armstrong). All along, Enzo watches and observes, and helps when he can. But when he sniffs the fatal odor of cancer, he cannot and that becomes one of his greatest inner tragedies.
Based upon a New York Times best seller by Garth Stein and directed by Simon Curtis, the movie is uplifting and rather inspiring at times, but keep those hankies ready. It’s gonna a tough ride at times. And, if you have a dog waiting for you at home, hug them extra tight. You just never know.
Tempo grade: B+
“The Art of Racing in the Rain” is rated PG for thematic material.
It is screening daily at Mitchell Storyteller 7 Theatres, 110 Old Talpa Cañón Road. For showtimes, tickets and additional information, call (575) 751-4245 or visit storyteller7.com.
Also showing in Taos.
Spider-Man: Far from Home Extended
MPAA rating: PG for rude humor and action.
From our review first published July. 7. This new release adds about 4-5 minutes of new footage.
At the outset, the new Spider-Man movie acknowledges the cataclysmic events of the Avengers’ “Infinity Wars” — which (spoiler alert) dealt with half the population of the universe disappearing — and “Endgame” when, five years later, they put things right again at great cost.
In Spidey’s world, this incident became known as “The Blip.” Those lost five years meant the people who came back had not aged, and so relationships, marriages, businesses, finances, government, everything took a hit because it. For Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland), it means (spoiler alert, again) he still mourns the death of Tony Stark/Iron Man, his mentor.
Despite the fact that Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) of S.H.I.E.L.D. want to re-form The Avengers with Spider-Man, Peter Parker, the teenager, just wants to pursue a romantic relationship with M.J. (Zendaya) if he can ever find a place or time to be alone with her. That might finally happen when Peter signs-onto a class trip that will take him — and M.J. — to Europe.
This also coincides with the latest super-villain threat and Nick’s urgency to get Spider-Man involved to help fight it. Helping the effort is a new ally named Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), who claims to be from an alternate universe in which the earth was destroyed by the evil super villain.
Where this movie falls off the rails is in spending a lot of time on Peter’s comic misadventures trying to get M.J. alone so he can express his feelings for her and on playing cute with the plot twist you can see a mile off involving Quentin Beck. Unfortunately, the same fate that befell the last X-Men movie may hit this one due either to super-hero fatigue on the part of audiences or the inability of Marvel to come up with interesting stories worthy of their attention.
Personally, the animated “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” now playing on Netflix, is still my favorite so far. Stay put at the end for two end-credit scenes that changes what you’ve just seen by quite a bit.
It is screening daily at Mitchell Storyteller 7 Theatres, 110 Old Talpa Cañón Road. For showtimes, tickets and additional information, call (575) 751-4245 or visit storyteller7.com.

Trump, Biden have the same message

Texto completo: During a recent speech in New Hampshire, President Trump unveiled a new campaign line: "Whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me." Citing the strong economy, Trump told voters that if he loses, "your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes," so "you have no choice!" To underscore the point, when he finished speaking, the music that came on was the Rolling Stones singing, "You can't always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, well, you might find, you get what you need."
Not far away, in Nashua, the Biden campaign rolled out the very same message about its candidate. "I know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that," Jill Biden told Democratic primary voters. "Your candidate might be better on, I don't know, health care, than Joe is. But you've got to look at who's going to win this election. And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, 'OK, I personally like so and so better,' but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump."
To put it another way: "Whether you love Joe or hate him, you have got to vote for him."
Trump and Biden are both running on the same message, but with one crucial difference: Trump is directing his at independent swing voters; Biden is directing that message at his base.
The New York Times reports that, despite his commanding lead in the polls, Biden faces a problem of low enthusiasm. While Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., "have followings rooted in zealous support for their ideas," Biden's support is rooted in a belief that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Trump. Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University's Polling Institute, told the paper that while spending time recently in Iowa "I did not meet one Biden voter who was in any way, shape or form excited about voting for Biden. They feel that they have to vote for Joe Biden as the centrist candidate, to keep somebody from the left who they feel is unelectable from getting the nomination."
The danger of running on electability is that all it takes is one catastrophic gaffe or debate stumble for Biden's support to collapse. And even if Biden manages to secure the Democratic nomination, running a campaign built exclusively on ousting the sitting president, rather than enthusiasm for your own ideas, is not a winning strategy. Just ask President Mitt Romney.
Trump, by contrast, has his base wrapped up and energized. The president consistently enjoys nearly 90% support among Republicans (in contrast with Barack Obama, who had just 75% support among Democrats at this stage in 2011, according to Gallup). For Trump, the risk of this strategy is not with his base, but with the swing voters who put him over the top in 2016.
According to Axios, in 2016 "20% of Trump's voters told exit pollsters they didn't like him." These reluctant Trump voters put Trump in the White House and are critical to his keeping it in 2020. Like many Americans, they are exhausted by the chaos of the Trump presidency. Biden is targeting his message directly at these voters, echoing George W. Bush's 2000 campaign pledge to restore "honor and dignity" to the Oval Office in the wake of the tumultuous Clinton presidency.
Yet, despite their exhaustion with Trump, many of these voters approve of his economic performance in office. Despite recent market turbulence, the U.S. economy remains strong. On Trump's watch, unemployment has reached a five-decade low, and our biggest economic problem is that we have 1.6 million more job openings than we have unemployed workers to fill them. And a decade after the Great Recession, wages are finally rising, with those at the bottom of the economic ladder benefiting the most.
The problem is that Trump has made virtually no effort to win over these reluctant Trump voters again, much less expand his base by appealing to Americans who did not vote for him but are benefiting from his policies. He is betting that presidents seeking re-election in a full-employment economy don't tend to lose. The danger is that, if the economy takes a nosedive, his argument for re-election with these voters does as well.
Biden and Trump are giving voters an ultimatum rather than inspiration. They both may find that running on your unlikability is a risky strategy.

A new niche Producer Will Packer finds success by treating every movie as though it's his first

Texto completo: Producer Will Packer's films, such as the NWA biopic "Straight Outta Compton," Tiffany Haddish's breakout vehicle "Girls Trip" and the dance drama "Stomp the Yard," have generated more than $1 billion at the box office by making blockbusters that appeal to black audiences and beyond.
"Little," starring Issa Rae and "Black-ish" cast member Marsai Martin, was co-produced by Martin, who is 14, with whom he worked to develop and pitch the idea for a "Big"-in-reverse-style comedy. He talks about changing things up in Hollywood and working with a new generation of talented women.
Fast Company: You've collaborated with a lot of powerful women over the years, including Tiffany Haddish, Queen Latifah, and Taraji P. Henson. "Little" showcases the talent of Marsai Martin, both behind and in front of the camera. She's now the youngest person to have produced a Hollywood movie. What made you want to work with her?
Will Packer: This next generation of creatives is more comfortable with its voice than previous generations. They are more aware of their reach and their power. With the right leadership and guiding hand, the sky's the limit for them. Marsai is a great example. She's amazing in that she listens to me and allows me to give her advice. But she has a very clear idea of what she wants to do, and what her talents are. My job is to put her in a position to win.
FC: You broke into film in 1994 as an undergraduate at Florida A&M University by producing "Chocolate City," a drama about a young man attending a historically black college. You spent $20,000 on the film, which became a local hit. What did you learn from that experience?
WP: There is a benefit to naïveté - you try everything and you're fearless. As an industry veteran, I think you still have to be fearless, even when you know that certain things may not work. You have (to remember) that you wouldn't be where you are if it wasn't for bucking trends and doing things in a nontraditional way.
I still have the philosophy that I have to attack this industry every day as if it's my first movie and I've got something to prove.
FC: With "Chocolate City," you tapped into an underserved audience that was hungry for films that spoke to their own experiences. Do you think the industry has changed its outlook on tailoring content for specific audiences?
WP: Being somebody who started off creating content for a niche audience, I was always feeling pressure from financiers, studios, distributors to bring the budgets down. But I understood how to get in under the hood and where to move the chips around in order to make (my films) palatable for a financier.
This is before people realized how big and fruitful my niche could be. I don't think anybody would say the urban - or new American mainstream - audience is some tiny niche now. Everybody knows that audience is a force to be reckoned with.
FC: Lately, your movies, like "Girls Trip" and your shows on OWN - which include the reality dating show "Ready to Love" and the family drama "Ambitions" - have focused on black women. You also acquired the popular black women's lifestyle site xoNecole. How do you identify content that appeals to this segment of the population?
WP: In today's environment of oversaturated content, if you're not making a movie for a specific somebody then you damn sure better be making it for everybody. But that's really, really hard to do.
So I think about (a specific) audience member. I think about what she does, what she likes, what she wants to see, what she hasn't seen and how she likes to see herself. I think about how I can make something that feels really specific and organic to her. And the stories usually evolve from that. "Girls Trip" was based on Essence magazine's annual music festival celebrating African-American culture and music. That was a real festival with real people, so it had a real texture to it.
FC: You are based out of Los Angeles and Atlanta, a major hub for black culture. Does having roots in Atlanta help your career?
WP: Living in Atlanta means I interact with my consumers daily. It gives me a leg up over my peers who don't leave the Hollywood bubble very often. The (2012) movie "Think Like a Man," which I produced and which was very successful, is based on Steve Harvey's book "Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man." I reached out to Steve before it was a New York Times best-seller.
I was dropping my girlfriend off at the hair salon when I noticed somebody with the book - it had been passed along to her, and there were two other people waiting to read it. I saw a demand (for the book) in a way that's not quantifiable, at least not in the ways that Hollywood usually thinks about intellectual property.
Ultimately, the book caught fire and multiple studios reached out to Steve. But to his credit, he said, "Will Packer was the first to talk to me about turning it into a movie."
FC: How has your role as a producer evolved since you founded your upstart production company, Rainforest Films, which you began while you were in college, to your current company, Will Packer Productions?
WP: I am what I like to call a "real" Hollywood producer. I've actually done every role on-set. I've held the boom. I've wrangled the cables. I understand physical production. So I'm not just an idea guy - I'm also somebody who understands the full 360-degree process of the execution of an idea. Although I'm a macro person, I pay attention to the minutiae.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
If newspapers had astrological signs, The New York Times, which was first published, or born, on Sept. 18, 1851, would be a Virgo. The sign is known for clear communication, a command of language and is sometimes even described in astrology texts as a staid librarian.
Astrology dates to ancient Babylonian times, at least, and was long seen as just another way to make sense of the world. During the 17th century, the scientific principles of astrology were deemed untenable, but the appeal of the zodiac endured.
Therapists now say they've started brushing up on astrology to better communicate with their patients, who reference the subject as a way to understand their lives, The Times recently reported. An earlier article found that venture capitalists have been investing in zodiac-focused start-ups because "astrology is having a cultural moment." Another profiled Susan Miller, a prolific astrologer who has built an empire through her monthly horoscopes, while a different article dove into the logistics of a tough astrological certification exam. And The Times has also reported, coincidentally, that Virgos are one of the most talked-about signs on the internet.
Today, astrology is at once a big business, a topic that unifies people online, a daily diversion and a balm for the anxieties of everyday life.
"We cover it because people have made it newsworthy," said Choire Sicha, the editor of The Times's Styles section, which reports on cultural trends and has published many of the recent articles on astrology. "It is a so frequently used part of people's Instagram lives and online lives."
Astrology, as a subject, has appeared throughout the Times archives for decades. In the early 20th century, the topic was grouped in the same category as ghost stories, told to amuse readers; later, it contributed shock value and a sense of satire to political and news stories, like a series of articles written about the use of astrologers by Nancy Reagan, the former first lady.
"It was filed under 'Superstition and Witchcraft,' which means The Times didn't hold much weight to what was written in the stars," said Jeff Roth, who manages the files of newspaper clippings in The Times's morgue.
The subject of astrology began to regularly appear in newspapers during the 1930s and 1940s, often in the form of horoscope columns.
The first horoscope column in a newspaper is often credited to R.H. Naylor, a prominent astrologer in the early 20th century. When Princess Margaret of Britain was born in 1930, he wrote a column for Britain's Sunday Express titled, "What the Stars Foretell for the New Princess," which became a recurring feature.
These columns made astrology more accessible to the general public, according to Chris Brennan, author of "Hellenistic Astrology: The Study of Fate and Fortune."
At the time, these articles were "one of the biggest things that helped to shape the public's awareness of and attitudes toward astrology in the 20th century," Mr. Brennan said.
Although many newspapers run a horoscope column, The Times never has. Mr. Roth said he believes this is because it is not supported by science.
"I couldn't even imagine, in the greatest stretch of the imagination, The Times running horoscopes," he said.
Today, astrology articles go through the same vetting as articles involving experimental beauty, wellness, internet culture or drugs, and editors acknowledge when there is no scientific evidence to back up a trend.
"We don't write about astrology to legitimize it as an area of science, because it's not scientific," Bonnie Wertheim, an editor on the Styles desk, said. "But we write about astrology to the extent that it reflects popular culture or personal anxieties."
Mr. Sicha said he believes astrology provides a framework for social interactions.
"Astrology is a great entry point to intimate conversations about relationships and family," he said. "We hear a lot of people move from shorthand invocations, like, 'OMG I'm dating a Capricorn, so you know he's stubborn,' to deeper conversations about how to be happy or faithful or polyamorous."
"Whether people think these are metaphors or archetypes or take these ideas very literally," he said, "they're widespread ideas in the culture that help people connect."
But one celestial forecast is certain -- The Times will not be printing daily horoscopes anytime soon. (Such a Virgo.)

At Starbucks you now have to bring your own NY Times (if you can find one)

Texto completo: At a Starbucks in Pomona a month ago, the newspaper rack just inside the door had disappeared. Copies of the New York Times were on a bar by the counter, a placement that looked unlikely to last long. The other newspapers weren’t present at all.
The barista didn’t know what it was all about. As I’m in the gloom business, I had a pretty good guess.
This was borne out when I found the rack gone at a second Starbucks in Claremont. That barista said the chain would no longer be selling the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal. All that location had left was the New York Times, left on the counter.
A stack, not a rack.
“They did sell,” the barista told me of the newspapers. “Customers are, ‘nooooo!’”
The New York Post, it turned out, broke the story in July. Starbucks, which had been selling the N.Y. Times since 2000 and other papers since 2010, would stop selling newspapers at its 8,600 U.S. stores Sept. 1 due to “changing customer behavior.”
I have to be honest: I never bought a newspaper at Starbucks. I also never swiped a newspaper from Starbucks. Many customers did, treating papers as if they were free and leaving them behind on communal tables. Since people think news on the internet should be free, they must think that also applies to newspapers.
What I would do was pause at the rack, peer at the front page of the N.Y. Times and maybe read a few paragraphs. My philosophy was that page one was fair game. Opening the paper would be getting into “Hey, kid, this ain’t a library” territory.
Starbucks was probably the most visible retailer to carry newspapers, so even if I didn’t buy papers there, I hated to see them on the way out. And it’s a maxim that things (and people) can become more desirable if they’re unattainable.
And so, with newspapers leaving Starbucks, suddenly I was pining for a N.Y. Times.
My hope had been to buy a Times at Starbucks on one of the last Sundays and wade into its glory, section after section after section. But I ran out of time for the Times. Last Sunday morning at a Pomona Starbucks, I was only able to read my own two home-delivered dailies before needing to be somewhere, so I didn’t buy one of the two Times copies on the counter.
In Chino Hills that afternoon, a friend and I stopped at a Starbucks. (Breaking: Starbucks is everywhere.) The newspaper rack was empty except for two lonely copies of the Orange County Register at the bottom. I mentioned that Starbucks wouldn’t be selling newspapers anymore.
“That’s a harbinger of the future,” said my friend, who writes for a newspaper, and who had the demeanor of someone who’s just seen the Angel of Death drift past, chuckling.
I hit up two Starbucks later that day. The one in Pomona had sold out (or thrown its copies away). One in Claremont didn’t think it had received any.
“It’s the end of an era,” one barista said. Her co-worker added: “It’s so sad!”
So there went my plan to buy a Sunday N.Y. Times at a Starbucks. My new plan was to buy a weekday N.Y. Times at a Starbucks. But there were none to be had. Newspaper sales apparently stopped a week early.
My final plan was to buy a N.Y. Times somewhere else, take it to Starbucks and read it. Give me this: Once I get an idea into my head, I will stubbornly see it through.
Finding a copy of the N.Y. Times was easier said than done. This despite what a Times spokeswoman had told the Post: “Although disappointed by the decision, we’re confident that given our wide retail distribution, readers will have no trouble finding The New York Times for sale at nearby outlets.”
Claremont, the college town where I live, seemed the likeliest bet for the Gray Lady. Downtown used to have two Times racks, one outside the Post Office, one outside Walter’s, but both are gone.
The Village Market sells only the Daily Bulletin, for which I commend them, and the Claremont Courier. Pomona College has a couple of spots where the NYT is available for free, meant for students, but classes haven’t resumed yet and neither has delivery. The college bookstore doesn’t stock newspapers. The libraries downtown and at the colleges get the Times, thankfully, but my goal was to buy one.
At the Barnes & Noble in neighboring Montclair, I asked if they carry newspapers, like the N.Y. Times. “Like, actual newspapers?” a clerk asked. A second clerk said: “We don’t. We used to, but not anymore.”
A gas station near the colleges had also given up. “No, we stopped selling newspapers last year, I think,” a clerk said. “You could try Starbucks.”
I delivered the bad news. “They stopped selling them too?” he said, eyes wide. He shook his head. “A printed newspaper. That’s a hard find.”
This reminded me of an encounter earlier this year at Creme Bakery in downtown Claremont. I often read my newspapers there, partly for pleasure, partly to model good behavior. A woman noticed me reading and said, a bit wistfully, “I miss newspapers.”
A few seconds went by.
I said, “They print new ones every day.”
Where else might one buy a New York Times locally? Suddenly I remembered the area’s only newsstand, Newsboy Books in downtown Ontario.
Newsboy stocks 10 daily newspapers, including the NYT, although the Starbucks decision seemed to throw a wrench into local distribution. The last copy delivered to Newsboy was last Sunday’s, although co-owner Roberta Gingold told me she expects to have copies again starting Tuesday.
In the meantime, on Friday morning she had one copy of last Sunday’s NYT, and to fulfill my goal, and also to round out this column, I handed over $6.47.
Next stop: an Ontario Starbucks, where the newspaper rack stood empty. I bought a drink, sat down with my fat copy of the NYT, with 10 sections and a magazine, and dug in.

The truth about James Comey

Texto completo: On Jan. 28, 2017, a day after having dinner with President Trump at the White House, James Comey wrote a memo recording his recollection of the evening and the conversation.
“I felt comfortable throughout,” he wrote, “although never relaxed, given the focus the conversation required.”
Comey noted that the president had asked him, “So what do you want to do?” in the context of a discussion of whether the then-FBI director would stay in that job or move on.
“I responded by saying that he could fire me any time he wished, but that I wanted to stay,” Comey wrote. “I added that I was ‘reliable’ in one way but not in the way political people sometimes use the term. I explained that he could count on me to always tell him the truth. I said I don’t do sneaky things, I don’t leak, I don’t do weasel moves.”
Then the president asked “whether the FBI leaks.” Comey wrote that he told Trump the whole government leaks like crazy, and “he replied that he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.”
If that phrase sounds familiar, it may be because it was one of the leaks that was splashed all over newspaper front pages and TV news shows from Comey’s memos of his conversations with Trump, which he had secretly stored in his personal safe at his home and retrieved after the FBI locked him out of his office a few months later, on the day the president fired him.
It might have saved the country a lot of time and stress if Comey had leaked the quotation that the president “could fire me any time he wished.” But that might have inhibited calls for an investigation into potential obstruction of justice.
That’s not what Comey wanted. He wanted a special counsel to investigate the president.
According to the new report from the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General, Comey improperly stashed private copies of four of seven memos he wrote to document his official meetings with Trump. One of them memorialized the conversation in a one-on-one meeting on February 14, 2017, in which Trump had said he hoped Comey could “see [his] way clear … to letting [Michael] Flynn go.”
Days after he was fired on May 9, 2017, Comey texted photos of “Memo 4” to his personal attorney and friend, Daniel Richman, with specific instructions to share the contents, but not the document, with a New York Times reporter.
The newspaper ran the story the same day under the headline, “Comey memo says Trump asked him to end Flynn investigation.” It related all the details that Comey had noted about the Oval Office meeting, including the notation about “letting Flynn go.”
The inspector general’s report says Comey did not mark Memo 4 as classified, even though Flynn was the subject of a non-public FBI investigation at the time. Instead, he gave one copy to his chief of staff to keep at the FBI and he secretly kept a copy in his personal safe at home.
We didn’t need the IG report to know why Comey arranged the leak. He told us himself, in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017 that he did it to “prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” He said he was concerned that Trump might destroy tapes of their conversations: “My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.”
The inspector general thought that explanation was unacceptable. “Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,” the IG wrote. “What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.”
What was the outcome that Comey personally desired? Was it really the appointment of a special counsel in order to force the preservation of supposed tapes in the White House? Or did he reveal his true goal with his own words?
In the same testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017, Comey was asked by Sen. John Cornyn about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and former President Bill Clinton’s tarmac meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch just as the investigation was wrapping up.
“After former President Clinton met on the plane with the attorney general, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel and decided that would be an unfair thing to do because I knew there was no case there,” Comey testified, speaking of the Clinton email investigation. “And calling for the appointment of a special counsel would be brutally unfair because it would send the message, ‘Uh-huh, there’s something here.’ ”
Cornyn asked, “If a special counsel had been appointed, they could have made that determination there was nothing there and declined to pursue it, right?”
“Sure,” Comey answered, “but it would have been many months later or a year later.”
If that isn’t enough to prove that Comey intended and knowingly acted to smear the president with an endless investigation based on no wrongdoing, consider Comey’s notes from the Jan. 27 dinner meeting, the one in which he said he doesn’t do sneaky things, doesn’t leak, doesn’t do weasel moves.
Comey wrote that Trump said the salacious story about prostitutes in a Russian hotel was “a complete fabrication and ‘fake news,’” and the president “said he thought maybe he should ask me to investigate the whole thing to prove it was a lie.”
“I replied that it was up to him,” Comey wrote, “but I wouldn’t want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, because we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued. I also said that it is very difficult to disprove a lie.”
It sure is. It’s even more difficult when the liar hides behind the fine reputation of federal law enforcement agents, people who did their greatest work for the country on the day they locked James Comey out of the building.

Texto completo: Una mujer lanzó este viernes un cóctel molotov en la recepción de una oficina del Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (USCIS, por sus siglas en inglés) de Oakland Park, Florida . La bomba casera no funcionó y el incidente quedó en un susto y sin heridos, según Associated Press.
De acuerdo al informe que consultó la citada agencia de noticias, la mujer entró con una botella llena de gasolina y una mecha encendida . Sin embargo, al lanzarla la mecha se soltó y la botella no se encendió.
El personal de seguridad de la oficina esposó a la autora y la detuvo hasta que llegó el Servicio de Protección Federal y la arrestaron.
Las autoridades policiales dijeron que este ataque no está relacionado con otros perpetrados también contra agencias del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS). No obstante, no dijeron el nombre de la mujer ni qué la habría movido a enfrentarse a la institución.
The New York Times informó hace dos semanas de una investigación en proceso sobre unos disparos en una oficina texana del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE).
Estos ataques llegan en un momento de máxima tensión respecto a las restrictivas políticas migratorias que está proponiendo y empleando el presidente Donald Trump.
USCIS en concreto ha estado en el punto de mira en los últimos tiempos porque su director interino Ken Cuccinelli es partidario de las estrictas medidas migratorias del presidente. Bajo su supervisión, USCIS ha encabezado modificaciones como negar tarjetas de residencia a inmigrantes que hayan solicitado beneficios como Medicaid.

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- In many places around the world, a single date marks seismic events considered turning points in recent history, like the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States or the Nov. 9 fall of the Berlin Wall for Europe. For post-colonial Hong Kong, the turning point fell on Aug. 31, 2014.
That was when a top Chinese government body announced a plan for limited democracy in Hong Kong. Beijing's decision fell considerably short of what democracy protesters were demanding that summer, and it set off a two-month occupation of several Hong Kong neighborhoods that came to be known as the Umbrella Movement.
This year, demonstrators seized on that day -- known simply as "the 8/31" -- for what they hoped would be a huge march this Saturday, although an organized rally now seems unlikely.
The Hong Kong authorities have declined to grant the protesters a permit, raising the possibility of a repeat of recent clashes should the demonstration be held. The authorities rejected an appeal on Friday, and march organizers called off the demonstration after failing to win approval, although people are likely to protest in other ways.
What was the decision?
The Standing Committee of China's rubber-stamp legislature, the National People's Congress, approved a law five years ago on Saturday that would have allowed all adults who are permanent residents of Hong Kong to vote on who would be the next chief executive of the semiautonomous Chinese territory. But it came with a catch: Beijing would have tight control over who could run.
A 1,200-member electoral committee stacked with Beijing loyalists currently chooses the chief executive. The Aug. 31 decision would let that committee only choose the candidates, and then let the general public vote on those candidates. But opponents felt that meant Beijing would still be choosing their leader. And Beijing did indeed say that whoever won the vote of the general public would still have to be appointed to the job of chief executive by China's national government.
The Standing Committee's pronouncement did not become Hong Kong law because pro-democracy lawmakers in the Hong Kong legislature blocked approval of it in 2015. So the same 1,200-member election committee continues to choose the chief executive, with the system favoring pro-Beijing candidates. The committee selected Carrie Lam, the incumbent, in 2017, and she won with 777 votes of the 1,163 votes actually cast.
Why are the protesters upset about it?
Most democracy advocates in Hong Kong have long rejected the decision as worse than nothing at all. "The decision of Aug. 31 is totally unacceptable to the Hong Kong people," said Bonnie Leung, the vice convener of one of the main protest groups, the Civil Human Rights Front, which had been organizing the Saturday demonstration. "The chief executive would have millions of votes, not a handful, but they would still be handpicked by Beijing."
Mrs. Lam, now the chief executive of Hong Kong and previously the territory's top civil servant, tried to find a compromise during the Umbrella Movement. Her compromise would have changed the composition of the nomination committee, notably by reducing the large number of seats reserved for farmers and fishermen. Farming and fishing now represent a tiny share of Hong Kong's population and economy these days, but these are staunchly pro-Beijing sectors.
But Mrs. Lam's compromise still would have left the nomination committee in charge of who could appear on the ballot. Democracy advocates rejected her suggestions.
Who likes the Aug. 31 decision?
A few centrists in Hong Kong and Western political scientists have suggested that adoption of the Aug. 31 decision five years ago might have helped the democratic cause and might still be a good option for the territory. They argue that even if two or three Beijing allies appeared on a ballot for a vote by all of the people of Hong Kong, those candidates would become less pro-Beijing during the campaign. They might compete with each other in promising more democracy, so as to win the most votes from the general public.
"If they want to win a popular election, they would have to adopt policies closer to the political center," said David Zweig, a longtime political scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
The Aug. 31 decision gives Beijing final say on who becomes chief executive. After the general election, Beijing would decide whether to appoint the winner of the general election to become chief executive. If a candidate became too critical of Beijing during an election campaign, or promised too much, that candidate might not be appointed, said Lau Siu-kai, vice chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, an elite, semiofficial advisory body set up by Beijing.
"Beijing will not allow any person who seems to place his accountability to the Hong Kong people above his accountability to Beijing," Mr. Lau said.
Does Beijing still back the decision?
The decision five years ago was a compromise in Beijing between moderates willing to tolerate some democracy in Hong Kong and hard-liners less willing to allow it. The compromise was aimed at going far enough in meeting Hong Kong democracy demands to head off a threatened occupation of the streets that autumn -- a goal the compromise completely failed to achieve.
Hong Kong has changed since then, with protesters more willing to resort to violence. But Beijing has also changed since then. President Xi Jinping had been in office for less than two years at the time of the Standing Committee's decision, and was still consolidating power.
In the years since, he has repealed a constitutional limit of two terms as president, allowing him to remain in office indefinitely. He has replaced almost all top military and security officials with people loyal to him. Human rights lawyers have been sentenced to long jail terms and much stricter controls have been placed on internet use in mainland China.
Democracy advocates still hope Beijing will make them a better offer. "I hope Beijing will understand if you make a concession, it is not a sign of weakness but a sign of a great power," said Emily Lau, a pro-democracy lawmaker.
Some Beijing hard-liners on Hong Kong policy, however, have begun to question whether any concession to democracy advocates, like allowing general elections with Beijing controlling who is a candidate, is even needed anymore.
Lau Siu-kai said that because the Standing Committee has never repealed the decision, it remains on the books and in theory available to Hong Kong.
"It is still available, because it is the national law," he said, while adding that, "I don't see this as a possibility at all, that 8/31 would be accepted by the democrats."

According to the report, 72 percent of those deaths and 93 percent of violent pregnancy-associated deaths were preventable. [...]women have the right, regardless of how they are paying for their stay, to receive an explanation of the total bill for services, including itemized charges for specific services received as part of her maternity care.

Texto completo: Illinois is taking steps to combat troubling maternal and infant mortality statistics after one lawmaker was moved to action by a series of reports which showcased the state’s and country’s maternal health shortcomings, particularly among African-American women.
The lawmaker is Chicago Democrat Mary Flowers. The troubling statistics: Pregnancy-related complications kill more mothers in the United States than in any other developed country, and African-American mothers die at three to four times the rate of white mothers.
Last week, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the last bills from a package of new laws to create new maternal legal rights and a task force to study the high death rate among African-American mothers and babies, to force hospitals to collect more accurate data on maternal mortality and be better equipped to treat pregnant women, and to mandate proper training for medical staff that are likely to treat pregnant women.
Troubling Statistics The U.S. weakness in maternal health care was detailed in a 2017 study by National Public Radio and ProPublica which showed 26.4 of each 100,000 mothers in the U.S. died from pregnancy-related complications in 2015, while the next closest developed country was the United Kingdom with 9.2 per 100,000.
The racial disparities are driven home in a report by the Illinois Department of Public Health which said an average of 73 women in Illinois died each year from 2008 to 2016 within one year of pregnancy, and African-American women were six times more likely to die of a pregnancy-related condition during that span. According to the report, 72 percent of those deaths and 93 percent of violent pregnancy-associated deaths were preventable.
State Sen. Jacqueline Collins, a Chicago Democrat and Senate sponsor of several of Flowers’ maternal health care measures, said the disparities existed across income and education levels.
"We found that a lot of highly educated black women in high paying careers are more likely to die as a consequence of childbirth than a white woman without even a high school diploma," she said.
Flowers said a 2018 New York Times Magazine article which also caught her attention detailed that, in the U.S., African-American infants were more than twice as likely to die than white infants, at 11.3 deaths per 1,000 babies and 4.9 deaths per 1,000 babies, respectively.
While infant deaths have decreased to 30 times less than what they were in 1850 for African-American babies, the number decreased by 44 times for white babies, making the disparity between the races even larger today than it was during that pre-Civil War era.
Collecting Accurate Data In response to the reports, Flowers called two committee hearings last year which she said brought forth further revelations.
Her committee heard testimony about poor hospital funding and readiness to handle childbirth in certain communities, obstacles to continuity of care and poor documentation of preexisting conditions for people with low incomes, and systemic bias and racism in the medical profession which leads to stress on patients and their health concerns sometimes being ignored by doctors.
"Doctors testified to racism, and they also testified to implicit bias and all other kinds of problems that needed to be addressed as well as training," she said. "And we know that more women are dying from something as simple as hemorrhaging, and it’s not being addressed."
To look further into the driving forces of maternal and infant mortality rates, Flowers sponsored and unanimously passed House Bill 1, which was signed by the governor in July to create the Task Force on Infant and Maternal Mortality Among African Americans.
The task force will be comprised of state health officials, doctors, midwives and medical professionals, hospital and insurance leaders, community experts in infant and maternal health, and an African-American woman who has experienced a traumatic pregnancy.
The task force will meet quarterly and report findings to the General Assembly by Dec. 1, 2020, on the causes and rates of maternal death and ways to improve the quality and safety of maternity care.
"It’s been well known in African-American communities that there were certain disparities in care and how doctors perceive our pain, but we never had the data to back it up, or to make that determination," Collins said. "And so this is really getting at it."
Another measure, House Bill 3, requires hospitals to include in each of their state-mandated quarterly reports any instances of preterm infants, infant mortality and maternal mortality, and the racial and ethnic information of the mothers in those instances.
Collins said accurate data is necessary to more clearly define the problem in Illinois, and "just to put the issue on the radar screen."
"We want to hold hospitals accountable so we can have accurate data and gauge the scope of this problem," she said. "This task force will focus on a data-driven approach to crafting policy."
Maternal Rights House Bill 2 is another unanimously-passed bill in the maternal mortality package, and it adds 19 new rights for pregnant women to the Medical Patient Rights Act. The Act was established in the 1990s, laying out rights for medical patients that, if violated by a health care provider or insurance company, can result in a fine ranging from $500 to $1,000.
House Bill 2 adds to that act, giving a woman the right to receive health care for herself and her baby before, during and after childbirth, to be treated with respect at all times, to contact with her baby when medically possible, and to refuse any treatment to the extent medically possible.
A woman also has the right to choose a certified nurse midwife or physician as her maternity care professional, to seek different caregivers if they are unsatisfied, to know the names of those providing her care, and to receive information about her condition and possible treatments.
Women also have the right to receive medical information in a language they understand, and to receive information about breastfeeding.
As well, a woman can choose her birth setting from a full range of options in her community, be informed if caregivers enter her or her baby in a research study, and has a right to give birth in the position of her choice within generally accepted medical standards.
"These rights show that a woman is to be respected," Flowers said.
The bill also gives a right to privacy and confidentiality, emotional and physical support during childbirth, and the ability for a mother to decide collaboratively with caregivers when she and her baby will leave the birth site.
Finally, women have the right, regardless of how they are paying for their stay, to receive an explanation of the total bill for services, including itemized charges for specific services received as part of her maternity care.
"We know that patients have rights, but it’s unfortunate that we need to enumerate them, the kind of rights that should be so basic, and universally understood," Collins said.
Other Measures Another of the bills which received unanimous approval, House Bill 5, directs the Department of Human Services to ensure pregnant and postpartum mothers have access to substance use disorder services that are gender-responsive and trauma-informed.
House Bill 2433, which passed 56-0 in the Senate and 111-2 in the House, requires every hospital to have the proper instruments available to take a pregnant woman’s blood pressure.
House Bill 2438, which also passed unanimously, amends the insurance code to require insurers to cover any mental health condition that occurs during pregnancy or during the postpartum period.
House Bill 2895, which passed the House 109-2 and the Senate 55-0, requires all birthing facilities to conduct continuing education yearly for all staff that may care for pregnant or postpartum women. That training must include modules on management of severe maternal hypertension and hemorrhaging.

'Factory' offers peek at Obamas' mission

Texto completo: If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way from former President Barack and former first lady Michelle Obama's new production company.
The Obamas launched Higher Ground Productions last spring in partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would "harness the power of storytelling" and touch on "issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more."
"American Factory," the first title from Higher Ground, is available now on the streaming service. It manages to make good on the Obamas' pledge, which is a promising sign for what's to come.
The documentary, which won a directing award this year at the Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of a Chinese billionaire who opens a glass factory in a former General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, and hires both American and Chinese workers. The film looks at how their cultures clash (with the Chinese workers getting lessons in how Americans are overconfident and need to be praised), how the workers are taken advantage of by management (they're convinced not to join a union for the security of their jobs) and how automation could take many of their jobs.
Through the emotional stories of some of the workers, and even the billionaire chairman himself, the documentary winds up being funny, shocking, upsetting and eye-opening. The film works well without a central narrator, allowing the people themselves to tell their stories. There also plenty of How did they get that?! insider footage, courtesy of Dayton-based co-filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar.
At almost two hours, the documentary doesn't drag. Instead, it sets an impressive precedent for the Obamas' forthcoming projects.
What else does Higher Ground have in the works?
Here's what's planned so far:
A drama series about the fashion world: "Bloom" will show the struggles faced by women of color in post-World War II New York. It's written and produced by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri ("Thelma & Louise").
A biopic about Frederick Douglass: Higher Ground plans to adapt the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom" into a movie about the abolitionist and statesman who was born into slavery.
An anthology series about unnoticed deaths: "Overlooked" will be a scripted show adapted from The New York Times' column of the same name that looks to correct the issue of obituaries primarily being written about white men.
A traveling kids' food show: "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents" is a half-hour preschool series from creators Jeremy Konner ("Drunk History") and Erika Thormahlen that will tell the story of food.
A Michael Lewis nonfiction series: The show will be based on "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," the book by the best-selling "Moneyball" and "The Big Short" writer about everyday heroes safeguarding the nation.
A documentary about camp for disabled teenagers: "Crip Camp" will tell the story of how a ramshackle summer camp down the road from Woodstock transformed young lives in the early '70s.

Texto completo: So much television, so little time. Here are a dozen titles to keep in mind when the avalanche of offerings hits this fall.
'Country Music'
Premiere date: Sept. 15-18, Sept. 22-25 on PBS
Premise: Ken Burns ("The Civil War") takes a 16-hour look at the American music, its roots and its influence.
What to expect: The documentary offers talking, picking and singing. Bolstering this history are engaging speakers such as Dolly Parton, Merle Haggard, Ketch Secor and Kris Kristofferson, who says it's "the white man's soul music."
'Stumptown'
Premiere date: Sept. 25 on ABC
Premise: Based on the graphic novels, the drama follows a savvy veteran working as a private eye.
What to expect: Dynamic Cobie Smulders is the main draw as risk-taking investigator Dex Parios. The action sequences have punch, and the supporting cast includes Michael Ealy, Camryn Manheim and Jake Johnson.
'Perfect Harmony'
Premiere date: Sept. 26 on NBC
Premise: A former music professor improves the terrible choir at a small-town church.
What to expect: Bradley Whitford's grouchy performance as the prof gives edge to this hopeful sitcom. Anna Camp stands out as a waitress in the choir, which needs major help. Music can change lives, the show demonstrates.
'The Unicorn'
Premiere date: Sept. 26 on CBS
Premise: A widower (Walton Goggins) tries to move on a year after losing his wife.
What to expect: In this warm comedy, Goggins ("Justified") aces a change-of-pace role as the father of two adolescent daughters. Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins offer support as Goggins' character negotiates the dating scene.
'Evil'
Premiere date: Sept. 26 on CBS
Premise: A psychologist and a Catholic Church employee investigate miracles and mysteries.
What to expect: Good acting enhances this creepy drama from Robert and Michelle King ("The Good Wife," "The Good Fight"). The set-up may remind you of "The X-Files," but Katja Herbers and Mike Colter make a promising team.
'The Politician'
Premiere date: Sept. 27 on Netflix
Premise: A satire about a California student (Ben Platt) who's ruthlessly ambitious.
What to expect: Ryan Murphy delivers this freewheeling series, and the tone is reminiscent of "Glee" without music. Even so, in a peak moment, Tony winner Platt ("Dear Evan Hansen") sings. Jessica Lange and Gwyneth Paltrow co-star.
'Living With Yourself'
Premiere date: Oct. 18 on Netflix
Premise: After a spa treatment, a man must contend with a better version of himself.
What to expect: The winning Paul Rudd plays the two roles. Timothy Greenberg ("The Daily Show With Jon Stewart") created the eight-episode series. The directors are Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris ("Little Miss Sunshine").
'Looking
for Alaska'
Premiere date: Oct. 18 on Hulu
Premise: A drama based on the novel by Orlando writer John Green.
What to expect: In the eight-episode series, Miles "Pudge" Halter (Charlie Plummer) enrolls in boarding school, makes new friends and falls for Alaska Young (luminous Kristine Froseth). As readers know, he also must deal with tragedy.
'Modern Love'
Premiere date: Oct. 18 on Amazon Prime Video
Premise: A romantic anthology based on the New York Times column.
What to expect: Big names fill the eight episodes based on true stories. The Tina Fey-John Slattery episode looks most intriguing. The cast also includes Anne Hathaway, Dev Patel, Andy Garcia and Catherine Keener.
'Watchmen'
Premiere date: October on HBO
Premise: An action drama, based on the graphic novel and set in an alternate history.
What to expect: Executive producer Damon Lindelof, one of our most dependable showmen, presents this flashy adventure about masked vigilantes. Regina King leads a cast that includes Jeremy Irons, Louis Gossett Jr., Don Johnson and Jean Smart.
'The Crown'

Texto completo: Imagine that a time machine transports you back 1,500 years to a forest road in what is now Croatia. You get up, dust yourself off, and look around. You're in the Early Middle Ages.
A local inhabitant approaches you, and you see something you didn't expect. You're immediately struck by the shape of their head. It's extremely elongated toward the back, resulting in an egg shape.
As a curious crowd gathers, you see that there are other people in the crowd whose heads are deformed in a different way. Their foreheads have been flattened, and their skulls have grown upward higher than normal.
Researchers, after looking at evidence from skeletons in a mysterious burial pit found in 2013 near the town of Osijek in eastern Croatia, say people who practiced artificial cranial deformation appear to have lived in the area at the time.
But the reason they changed the shape of their heads is still a matter of speculation.
“The impetus behind why these things were done can't really be deciphered by the kind of data we have," said Kendra Sirak, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School in the Reich Lab of Medical and Population Genetics. Sirak was one of the lead authors on a new paper on the skeletons, which was published last week in the journal PLOS One.
“We think it could be some sort of visual indicator of group membership," she said. The people who did it may have thought, she said, that “it sets us apart. It makes us unique. It allows us to identify other members of my same group."
Practiced for some 5,500 years by cultures around the world, artificial cranial deformation involves binding the growing heads of infants and children with bandages, planks, boards, or bricks. As the skull grows under constant pressure, it becomes misshapen, resulting in oblong heads and other unusual shapes. Anthropologists have documented this practice on every inhabited continent, but it isn't common. Today it continues in only a few remote tribes.
Skulls unearthed in the burial pit near Osijek were the first with artificial cranial deformation found in Croatia.
The pit contained three sets of human bones, as well as animal skeletons and broken pottery. Two of the skulls were deformed, but in different ways — one resembled an elongated egg, and the other had a flattened forehead, causing the cranium to grow higher.
Researchers, led by Mario Novak, an archeologist at the Institute for Anthropological Research in Croatia and Ron Pinhasi of the University of Vienna, examined the bones, scanned and reconstructed the skulls, and analyzed their DNA.
The findings suggested that between the fifth and sixth centuries, during the Migration Period, people of starkly different cultural backgrounds may have interacted more than previously thought. The study also provides the earliest genetic evidence of the presence of people from East Asia in Europe.
The Migration Period was the time in Western European history around and after the fall of the Roman Empire. It was marked by frequent warfare, a virtual disappearance of urban life, and the movement of so-called barbarian peoples into what had been the Western Roman Empire, according to britannica.com.
The researchers found that the skulls belonged to three malnourished males, between the ages of 14 and 16, who had lived between A.D. 415 and 560. There were no signs of violent death.
DNA testing deepened the mystery. It revealed the flat-foreheaded skull belonged to someone from somewhere in the Middle East, northern Africa, or southeastern Europe. The egg-shaped skull belonged to someone from East Asia. The unaltered skull likely came from a person of West Eurasian ancestry. Their genes were relatively unmixed, suggesting they had moved from these places or their parents had.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
THE DARK CRYSTAL: AGE OF RESISTANCE Stream on Netflix. The cast includes Mark Hamill, Sigourney Weaver, Andy Samberg, Awkwafina and Simon Pegg. Is it a big-budget ensemble comedy? No. How about a "Star Wars" spinoff? Not quite. With an all-star voice cast, a hefty budget and many puppets, this new series aims to give a serious face-lift to the 1982 fantasy film "The Dark Crystal." The original movie, which came from the Muppets's Jim Henson, was a luxuriant, puppet-driven fantasy fable that, Vincent Canby wrote in his review for The New York Times, "aims, I think, to be a sort of Muppet 'Paradise Lost' but winds up as watered down J.R.R. Tolkien." It told of a world where mystical species good and bad were caught in a power struggle that hinged on a magical crystal. The Netflix series, which is aimed at adults and children, tells a prequel over 10 episodes.
CARNIVAL ROW Stream on Amazon. Immigration is the key issue in this new series -- but the show doesn't take place in our world. Or not quite, at least. The setting is a fantasy city with Victorian flourishes and an immigration crisis involving a population of winged-fairy refugees. One of these refugees, Vignette (Cara Delevingne), strikes up a forbidden romance with a human detective played by Orlando Bloom. The story focuses on their romance and the mystery surrounding unsolved murders that Bloom's character is trying to solve.
KEEPING FAITH Stream on Acorn TV. This Welsh mystery series became something of a sensation in Britain after it began in 2017. The first season introduced Faith (Eve Myles), who, when the show started, was on maternity leave from her family law practice. She was pushed back into it after the disappearance of her husband, Evan (Bradley Freegard). Her investigation into the disappearance stirred up uncomfortable mysteries about his identity, which was part of the focus of the first season. Season 2, which aired overseas earlier this year and is now available for American audiences to stream on Acorn TV, picks up the story a year and a half later.
What's on TV
STAR WARS: EPISODE I -- THE PHANTOM MENACE 8:30 p.m. on TBS. When Disney unveiled new footage from the coming "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" this week, one quick shot sparked more conversation than any other: the image of Daisy Ridley wielding a double-bladed, red lightsaber. That weapon was the tool of choice for Darth Maul (Ray Park), the evil warrior in red and black makeup who dukes it out with Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) at the end of this "Star Wars" prequel. While this may not be the most acclaimed entry in the franchise, it is a natural starting point for those who want to revisit all eight movies in the main "Star Wars" series before "Rise of Skywalker" comes out in December.

Texto completo: DOJ report criticizes how former director handled memos on Trump talks
Former FBI director James B. Comey violated FBI policies in how he handled memos that detailed his controversial interactions with President Trump, setting a "dangerous example" for bureau employees about substituting personal righteousness for established rules, the Justice Department's internal watchdog found in a report released Thursday.
The inspector general criticized Comey for keeping the government documents at his home, engineering the release of some of their contents to the news media and not telling the bureau to whom he had given them - even after he was aware that some contained classified information.
Comey told investigators that he felt the memos were personal and that he was acting in the best interests of the country. But the inspector general rejected that defense, writing that Comey's senior FBI leaders all agreed the memos were government documents, and that the former director's "own, personal conception of what was necessary was not an appropriate basis for ignoring the policies and agreements governing the use of FBI records."
"The responsibility to protect sensitive law enforcement information falls in large part to the employees of the FBI who have access to it through their daily duties," the inspector general wrote. "Former Director Comey failed to live up to this responsibility."
By now, Comey's memos are well-known. They described, among other things, how Trump had pressed Comey for loyalty and had asked him about letting go of an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Comey's orchestration of the release of their contents helped spark special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's appointment to investigate possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to affect the 2016 election. Mueller would go on to focus intently on the episodes Comey described as possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Trump on Thursday seized on the findings to lash out at Comey.
"Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General's Report," he tweeted. "He should be ashamed of himself!"
In total, the inspector general wrote, Comey wrote seven memos, documenting most of the nine one-on-one conversations he had with Trump in early 2017, just before he was fired.
Comey left three memos at the FBI, the inspector general wrote. He stored the other four documents in a safe in his home and provided copies to his personal attorneys, the inspector general found. Of those four, he gave one - which included information the inspector general called "sensitive" but unclassified - to a friend and authorized him to share its contents.
One of those memos shared with the attorneys was later determined to contain information that was classified as confidential, the lowest level of secrecy, after a review that included Comey's FBI general counsel, the inspector general wrote.
The confidential material in that memo entailed just six words "from a statement by President Trump comparing the relative importance of returning telephone calls from three countries," the inspector general wrote. Another memo Comey kept contained a classified "assessment of a foreign leader by President Trump," though Comey redacted that before providing it to his attorneys, the inspector general wrote.
On Twitter, Comey noted that the inspector general found "no evidence" that he or his attorneys released any classified information to the media.
"I don't need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a 'sorry we lied about you' would be nice," he wrote. "And to all those who've spent two years talking about me 'going to jail' or being a 'liar and a leaker' - ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president."
The report is the second time Inspector General Michael Horowitz has criticized Comey for how he handled FBI business during his abbreviated tenure in charge of the bureau. Last summer, Horowitz lambasted Comey for his leadership of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, accusing him of insubordination and flouting Justice Department policies in deciding only he had the authority and credibility to make key decisions on the case and speak about it publicly.
The inspector general wrote that his office gave its findings to the Justice Department to determine whether Comey had committed a crime and that officials declined to prosecute the case. Conservatives, though, used the finding to attack Comey.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said in a statement that it was a "stunning and unprecedented rebuke of a former Director of the FBI."
George J. Terwilliger III, a former deputy attorney general and acting attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, said the inspector general had described "a gross abuse of institutional power and authority."
"And for someone who claims on a regular basis the mantle of righteousness, Comey should be ashamed of what he did," Terwilliger said.
That Comey had in his possession material that was later deemed classified and shared it with his lawyers has also rankled liberals. It was Comey, after all, who said Clinton and her aides were "extremely careless" in their handling of classified information in their use of a private email server.
Many Clinton supporters say the FBI's investigation into that matter - and Comey's revelation on the eve of the 2016 election that the case was resuming - cost her the presidency. As an FBI employee, Comey had to surrender all bureau materials upon leaving his job and abide by a "lifelong" duty to protect classified material, the inspector general wrote.
The New York Times first made some of the contents of Comey's memos public on May 11, 2017, publishing a story about how, at a private dinner, Trump asked him for the loyalty pledge. Later, it published another story detailing Comey and Trump's conversation about Flynn.
Comey would later admit that he had engineered the release of some of that information through a friend, Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor who served as a special government employee at the FBI while Comey was director. Comey claimed he did not authorize Richman to serve as a source for the story on May 11, but did for the later piece.
None of it was authorized by the FBI. When Comey revealed what he had done at a June 2017 congressional hearing, senior bureau leaders were taken aback, the inspector general wrote.
Earlier that month, Comey had reviewed the memos and seen the classification markings the FBI had applied to the memos after he had left, the inspector general wrote.
FBI officials scrambled to get in touch with Richman, who told them Comey had also shared the material with his other lawyers, the inspector general wrote.
The memo provided to Richman was determined to be "For Official Use Only" but did not contain classified information, the inspector general wrote. But because other memos Comey shared with attorneys had material deemed classified, officials had to track down who had accessed the documents so they could be secured, the inspector general wrote.
"Members of Comey's senior leadership team used the adjectives 'surprised,' 'stunned,' 'shocked,' and 'disappointment' to describe their reactions to learning that Comey acted on his own to provide the contents of Memo 4, through Richman, to a reporter," the inspector general wrote.
The man who subsequently became the acting head of the FBI, Andrew G. McCabe, referred the matter to the inspector general in July 2017, the inspector general wrote.

DOJ's inspector general report worse for Comey than the Mueller report was for Trump

Texto completo: Despite declining to prosecute James Comey, the Department of Justice's Inspector General report released today proved damning for what little reputation remains of the former FBI Director. His sophomoric victory lap is somehow more petty than that of President Trump's after the release of the Mueller report.
Whereas the Special Counsel investigation simply proved that Trump's only crime was stupidity, the IG report provides irrefutable evidence that Comey, a career prosecutor, violated several known terms of his employment and policies of the FBI and Department of Justice.
[READ: The full DOJ inspector general report on James Comey]
TweetThe Office of the Inspector General found that, contrary to Comey's assertions, his memos documenting interactions with Trump were in fact public records.
The report lambastes his "characterization" of the memos as "wholly incompatible with the plain language of the statutes, regulations, and policies defining Federal records, and the terms of Comey's FBI Employment Agreement." Not only did the report find that Comey's "own statements and actions demonstrate the inherently governmental nature of the Memos," but also that "none of the members of Comey's senior leadership team" concurred.
Thus, when Comey texted the fourth memo to his friend Daniel Richman, a Columbia University professor, to disseminate the contents to the New York Times with the express intention of instigating the appointment of a Special Counsel, he "violated FBI policy and the requirements of his FBI Employment Agreement."
The report goes into further details of Comey's mishandling of the memos with regards to their physical location and distribution outside of the FBI, but most damning is the report's detailing of Comey's indirect contact with the New York Times:
By disclosing the contents of Memo 4, through Richman, to The New York Times, Comey made public sensitive investigative information related to an ongoing FBI investigation, information he had properly declined to disclose while still FBI Director during his March 20, 2017 congressional testimony. Comey was not authorized to disclose the statements he attributed to President Trump in Memo 4, which Comey viewed as evidence of an alleged attempt to obstruct the Flynn investigation and which were relevant to the ongoing Flynn investigation. Comey clearly considered the contents of Memo 4 highly sensitive — in fact, as he stated in his June 8, 2017 congressional testimony, Comey and other senior leaders of the FBI had decided not to report the President’s statements to the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General, and to keep the President’s statements “very closely held,” so that the FBI leadership could “figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed.” Comey placed in the public domain evidence relevant to the investigation of Flynn, and what he clearly viewed as evidence of an attempt to obstruct justice by President Trump. Rather than continuing to safeguard such evidence, Comey unilaterally and without authorization disclosed it to all.
So yes, the quotation shared by Comey is technically correct. The report found that he did not have any direct contact with the press in sharing the memos, a notion that no serious person was proposing. But the media's rightful framing of Comey sharing the memos with Richman for the sole purpose of getting its contents to the Times was wholly accurate. He is owed no apology, because he was in fact a leaker.
Like Trump, Comey is celebrating a report that documents, in detail, his disregard for law and penchant for lies.TweetBut unlike Trump, he actually did the thing he was initially accused of. He leaked federal records through a third party. Comey ought to be thanking his lucky stars that the DOJ declined to prosecute. Only a fool with more hubris than the president would think this report is a cause for celebration.

Texto completo: The New York Times was pressured this week into updating its 10-year retrospective on the Tea Party to include an aside about the grassroots political movement’s allegedly racist roots. This marks the second time this month that the newspaper has, under outside pressure, amended the content of its news coverage to appease an online rage-mob.
On Aug. 28, the Times published a report by national politics reporter Jeremy W. Peters titled, “The Tea Party Didn’t Get What It Wanted, but It Did Unleash the Politics of Anger.”
The subhead read, “Ten years after a summer of rage over spending, trillion-dollar deficits are back.”
It is true. One of the declared motives of the defunct Tea Party movement that was to reduce government spending, now seems as though it is a hazy, half-remembered memory for the Republicans and conservatives who control the White House and the Senate. This political about-face is certainly worthy of investigation. In fact, the Right’s seeming abandonment of this once-paramount issue was the chief focus of Peters’ article, as it appeared originally on the Times’ website. His report was not a defense of the Tea Party. It was not an attack on the Tea Party. The story reported merely that Republicans were swept into power in 2010 and 2014 with promises to reduce spending, and now they barely even talk about it anymore. There were no asides in Peters' report about racism, hate speech, xenophobia or the like.
But his disciplined focus did not sit well with many politicos, journalists, and media pundits, who apparently feed on seeing right-wing activists and conservatives accused daily of racism and bigotry.
“How do you write a 10 years later piece on the Tea Party and not mention — not once, not even in passing — the fact that it was essentially a hysterical grassroots tantrum about the fact that a black guy was president?” asked the Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery, claiming the story amounted to journalistic “malpractice.”
Rolling Stone’s Jamil Smith complained elsewhere that the retrospective makes “not a single, solitary reference to race or racism” nor the supposed fact that “a good deal of it involved opposing President Obama because he was black.”
“A fundamental flaw in this analysis is there is no mention of race and how much racism drove the Tea Party movement,” said ABC News’ Matthew Dowd. “You can’t talk about the rage politics and leave out race.”
Even the Times’ own Paul Krugman got in on the game, implicitly accusing Peters of being bad at his job while claiming also that the newspaper failed in its mission to accuse the Tea Party of racism.
“Are we still pretending that the Tea Party was about small government and concern about budget deficits?” he asked on social media. “It was always, from the beginning, about racial anger; opposition to big government only to the extent that it helps Those People.”
A brief reminder: Krugman is the same individual who slandered former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in 2011 by accusing her of inspiring the Tucson, Ariz., mass shooting. This erroneous claim, which is backed by nothing, was repeated later in 2017 by the Times editorial board, for which Palin is now suing the newspaper. You will excuse me if I go on ignoring Krugman’s “analyses” of that which inspires anything, let alone entire political movements.
Unfortunately, the Times’ editors did not similarly write off the criticisms aimed at Peters’ report. The paper has since amended his article so that it now includes accusations of racism and xenophobia.Tweet
The updated article now contains the following edits [emphasis added]:
One significant limitation to the Tea Party is the contradiction in its DNA: It was a mass uprising based on notions of small-government libertarianism that are popular with think tanks but not so popular with most Americans. And as Mr. Obama’s allies saw the movement, its outrage over the debt and deficit had another purpose: giving cover and a voice to those who wanted to attack the first black president — people who in some cases showed up at rallies waving signs with racist caricatures and references.
Needless to say, at the time, Tea Partiers and a lot of other people, as the election results suggest, saw this as a disingenuous and partisan attempt to deflect criticism of a presidency which, regardless of color, was not living up to the expectations of all those 2008 Obama voters.
This is the second time this month that the Times has caved to a mob.

Earlier, after President Trump addressed two separate mass shootings events that took place over the same weekend, the Times ran a headline for its print edition that read: "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM." Democrats and their allies in the press screamed at the newspaper until it agreed to change the headline to: “ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS."
Surely I am not the only one who sees a problem with the most prestigious and powerful newspaper in the United States allowing itself to be coerced twice over the course of three weeks into amending its coverage to appease the screaming left-wing masses.

The Times is not so brave as its publisher would have you to believe.

Texto completo: Good morning.
My colleague Dan Levin wrote a story about an all-gender cabin at a 90-year-old Jewish summer camp in Groveland, near Yosemite National Park.
I asked him to tell us a little more about the experience of heading back to a sleepaway camp like the ones he went to during his own childhood -- only this time, as a reporter:
The Indigo Girls' hit song "Closer to Fine" crooned through the arts and crafts shack, cluttered with campers' drying tie-dyed T-shirts and ceramic mugs. Had I suddenly been time-warped back to the summer of 1995?
Sadly, no. But the great thing about sleepaway camp is that pastimes like lanyard bracelets, awkward dances and dodge ball never really change.
When I visited Camp Tawonga, a 90-year-old rustic Jewish sleepaway camp near Yosemite National Park, it felt like returning to the summer camps where I spent many school vacations two decades ago. Almost.
Unlike most sleepaway camps, then or now, Tawonga has sought to blend Jewish tradition with a social justice mission to be inclusive of all campers, particularly youth who are L.G.B.T.Q.
While Camp Tawonga has for years allowed children to bunk in cabins that matched their gender identity, rather than their biological sex, this summer the camp offered a new option: a cabin for all genders.
Amid a nationwide rise in youth who see gender identity as a spectrum, I was curious to meet the campers who chose to bunk in the all-gender cabin, known as AG-6, and learn why Camp Tawonga chose to offer it.
Upon my arrival, I met Meg Adler, a longtime Camp Tawonga staff member, who helped create a "beyond the binary" campfire for campers and staff who did not feel comfortable at the men's or women's campfires. She explained that letting young people know they don't have to conform to gender norms is part of the camp's larger goal of making sure every camper feels secure and confident being themselves.
"We're trying to show that you're right just as you are and we should celebrate you," Ms. Adler said.
[Read Dan's full story here .]
Along with hiking and swimming, each cabin participates in activities aimed at helping them challenge gender stereotypes and discover their own resilience.
In an age of gender-reveal parties and conservative criticism over state laws that mandate the inclusion of L.G.B.T. issues in sex education, Camp Tawonga's approach can seem radical. But for many of the campers in AG-6, the normalcy at camp was transformative -- and often healing.
Grae Smith, 13, a transgender boy who was in AG-6, said he has struggled with feeling unhappy about his body and was usually afraid to meet new people.
At first, he said, those emotions followed him to camp, but surrounded by supportive campers and counselors, Grae soon found the courage to let his guard down and simply have fun.
"I'm learning what it's like to feel safe all the time," Grae said. "Here I really can be my full self."

It feels like a parable, some sort of made-up real estate Icarus story, but it really happened -- just recently, in fact. The land, in L.A., was sold to a lone bidder at auction. The property, once the most expensive in Los Angeles, was in foreclosure.
Like so many things in L.A. it was both as simple as that, and much more complicated. Also, celebrities were involved.
Here's the story. And with that, have a nice weekend.

Texto completo: ST. THOMAS, V.I. -- Jeffrey Epstein once described the United States Virgin Islands as "my favorite place to be."
When he was there, Mr. Epstein had a knack for getting his way, according to public records and interviews with residents and local officials.
Mr. Epstein, the accused sex trafficker who committed suicide in a Manhattan jail this month, used these islands as a personal and corporate hideaway, negotiating lucrative local tax breaks even as he faced federal investigations for sexual misconduct.
He cultivated close ties to the islands' political and financial elite. He employed a governor's wife. He hired an architecture firm owned by that governor's uncle. He donated money, sponsored scholarships and even gave dozens of computers to a local lawmaker to distribute.
The islands became a haven for Mr. Epstein. His private plane would fly him to St. Thomas's international airport, where he would board a helicopter that whisked him to his Little St. James and Great St. James islands. Once there, he was known to entertain famous friends and, his accusers have said in court filings, traffic underage girls for sex.
While federal authorities spent years criminally investigating Mr. Epstein, a spokesman for the local police department said it had no records of having visited his Virgin Islands properties.
"It was kind of accepted," said Sasha Bouis, who used to run a floating restaurant anchored near Great St. James. "There was just this creepy old billionaire living out there."
Since Mr. Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in July, his island operations have been under scrutiny. A few days after his Aug. 10 death, F.B.I. agents and New York Police Department investigators raided Little St. James, which some locals say they had nicknamed "Pedophile Island."
Federal prosecutors handling Mr. Epstein's sex-trafficking case have said the investigation will not end with his death. In recent lawsuits, his accusers have lodged fresh claims about how they were sexually assaulted on his islands.
In the weeks ahead, the wrangling over Mr. Epstein's assets is likely to play out on St. Thomas. Last week, lawyers handling Mr. Epstein's estate filed his will in court on St. Thomas and said he had more than $ 570 million in assets.
Mr. Epstein arrived in the Virgin Islands in 1998, when he paid $ 7.95 million for Little St. James, a roughly 70-acre island. Mr. Epstein called it "Little St. Jeff's." In 2016, he bought the larger Great St. James for $ 17.5 million.
Over the years, he spent millions more developing the islands, including building a villa with a library, a Japanese bathhouse and a movie theater.
His construction projects led to repeated clashes between Mr. Epstein and the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources, according to paperwork related to his work permits reviewed by The New York Times.
A memo from the agency's wildlife chief in 2010 noted that Mr. Epstein's properties had "a long history of egregious and blatant disregard for environmental regulations." Projects had "introduced several nonnative species to the island." The arrival of one invasive species, the Cuban tree frog, led to a recommendation that all landscaping and building materials be inspected, the memo said.
Mr. Epstein's lawyers resolved some disputes by paying fines, retroactively applying for permits and making donations, sometimes using funds from his charities.
In 2016, Mr. Epstein reached a settlement with the agency over unapproved construction projects on Great St. James. Officials soon accused his company of violating the agreement by not removing a beach bar cabana and by expanding a driveway, despite a stop-work order.
Mr. Epstein used St. Thomas to register a number of his businesses. Little remains known about their purposes. In public documents, many listed their addresses as Mr. Epstein's office at the American Yacht Harbor complex in the Red Hook quarter of St. Thomas.
Mr. Epstein was rarely seen there. Last week, a man at the front desk said through an intercom that no one was available to talk to a reporter.
People around St. Thomas are reluctant to talk about Mr. Epstein -- even after his death, locals say, there are fears about violating nondisclosure agreements or angering his close associates on the island.
Mr. Epstein went out of his way to ingratiate himself with local leaders. He donated 50 computers that a local senator could give away to schools and youth organizations. He financed programs at an elite local private school. He sponsored scholarships for a beauty pageant and a 2014 science and math fair for children in the Virgin Islands.
Mr. Epstein's companies repeatedly were allowed to participate in a United States Virgin Islands tax-cut program that allows certain people and businesses that invest at least $ 100,000 locally to have their income and other tax rates cut substantially or eliminated.
In 2012, one of his companies, Southern Trust, applied to take part -- and cited his donations as a selling point.
"Those of you who know Mr. Epstein -- he has been a long-term resident of the Virgin Islands -- know that he has given generously over the course of the last 11 years to various charities in the Virgin Islands," said Erika Kellerhals, one of Mr. Epstein's lawyers, at a public hearing about the application.
That application was approved. So were Mr. Epstein's previous applications for his advisory company, Financial Trust, and the Red Hook marina that he co-owned with a company owned by a New York businessman. The authority held a hearing on one application in 2009, shortly after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor.
The tax-incentive program is administered by a division of the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority. Some of its board members are appointed by the governor of the Virgin Islands.
From January 2007 to January 2015 -- when Mr. Epstein's various companies were participating in or applying for the tax program -- the governor was John P. de Jongh Jr. The governor's wife, Cecile, was the manager of Southern Trust. (It was not clear what that role entailed.) Mr. Epstein had also hired an architecture firm owned by Mr. de Jongh's uncle for work on his private islands, records show. Efforts to reach the de Jonghs were unsuccessful.
In an interview, executives from the economic development authority said that Mr. Epstein's businesses had qualified for and remained in compliance with the program, which has 71 participants. The authority would not disclose the dollar value of the nearly two decades of tax breaks Mr. Epstein's companies received.
"I can't say anything stood out in this particular case," said Wayne Biggs Jr., the authority's assistant chief executive.
Mr. Epstein had unusual plans for Southern Trust: He hoped to create an algorithm to mine information from genetic sequencing databases as a way to find treatments for cancer, according to the transcript of the tax-incentive hearing, which is where he extolled the Virgin Islands as his "favorite place." Mr. Epstein had long cast himself as a science aficionado, inviting physicists to his island, and even discussing how he could perpetuate his own DNA in the human population.
As he made the pitch for the tax break in 2012, he compared his DNA-sequencing efforts to those of the Wright Brothers and the science to "Frankenstein." He also noted that he had a friend in New York who had a recent cancer diagnosis. "I'm leaving for New York after this meeting to go sit with the sequencers to see if I can save my friend," he said.
"Places, frankly, like St. Thomas are the perfect place to sequence people because it is so isolated," he added.
At times, the board seemed perplexed with his plan. Mr. Epstein offered reassurances.
"I am not a madman," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Gregory B. Craig, one of Washington's most powerful Democratic lawyers, testified in his own defense in a federal felony trial on Wednesday, denying passionately that he had deceived federal investigators six years ago about whether he had aided a public relations campaign by Ukraine's president to repair his battered image in the United States.
"I did not lie," Mr. Craig said, looking directly at the jury in the most dramatic testimony of his nearly two-week trial in the federal courthouse in Washington. "I did not withhold any information."
The unusual case against Mr. Craig, 74, turns on whether he misrepresented his contacts with journalists over a 2012 report by his law firm examining whether a political rival of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then Ukraine's president, had received a fair trial on corruption charges.
Mr. Yanukovych was hoping the report, by the internationally known law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, would help him blunt criticism that threatened Ukraine's hopes of joining the European Union. Federal prosecutors contend that Mr. Craig, then a Skadden lawyer, lied about his role in the public relations campaign to safeguard his reputation and career prospects, as well as those of his colleagues.
Court filings and exhibits have painted an unflattering portrait of the actions of both Skadden and Mr. Craig, who served as White House counsel in the first year of the Obama administration and represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment hearings.
But his guilt or innocence turns on the narrow question of how he responded to Justice Department officials who were trying to determine whether he needed to register as a foreign agent for Ukraine. Anyone who tries to shape American public opinion on behalf of a foreign government is required to disclose that work to the Justice Department.
Prosecutors charge that Mr. Craig misled investigators in part because registering would have forced him to disclose embarrassing details about the project, including that a Ukrainian oligarch had secretly financed at least $ 4 million of the work through an offshore bank account.
Mr. Craig appeared at ease in the courtroom, testifying calmly, sometimes smiling, for more than five hours. He acknowledged that he did not want to register as a foreign agent, but insisted that he had never deceived federal investigators to skirt the registration requirement. He admitted that he made some sloppy errors in what he told both the Justice Department and Skadden's own general counsel about his contacts with journalists. But he insisted that "the answers were truthful."
"I just muddled it up," he said when asked about a draft explanation to Justice Department officials that he circulated within Skadden.
The Skadden report on Ukraine drew a mixed picture of the prosecution of Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister and political rival of Mr. Yanukovych. Although it found her trial to be flawed in some respects, a majority of the firm's conclusions were either favorable or neutral to Mr. Yanukovych's government.
But as the report neared publication in December 2012, Mr. Craig became engaged in a tug of war with Ukrainian officials, their lobbyists and their public relations specialists over how its conclusions would be presented to the press. Skadden lawyers had advised him to stick to lawyering and avoid public relations. But Mr. Craig testified that he felt compelled to engage with the news media to combat Ukraine's efforts to play down the report's criticisms.
He said he was especially concerned about the "honesty and reliability" of Ukraine's lead publicist, a British citizen named Jonathan Hawker. "I did not trust him," he said.
He said he was trying to head off Mr. Hawker -- not carry out Ukraine's media strategy -- when, two days before the report was released, he hand-delivered an advance copy to the home of David E. Sanger, a New York Times reporter, and offered to grant The Times the first interview about it.
Those interactions loom large in his case because Mr. Craig told Justice Department officials that he engaged with journalists only to correct mischaracterizations of the report that had already been published.
"If anybody was going to talk to The New York Times, it was going to be me," he said. "I was not acting in the interest of Ukraine. I was defending the integrity of the report." He added, "I did not think it crossed the line" requiring registration as a foreign agent.
The defense is expected to rest its case on Thursday. The offense of lying to federal authorities carries a maximum prison term of five years, but recent first-time offenders have been sentenced to a month or less behind bars.

Texto completo: The MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell retracted a story he reported on Tuesday night that claimed President Trump had made a financial arrangement with so-called Russian oligarchs.
Mr. O'Donnell said the reporting, which he had attributed to a single source on his 10 p.m. program, "didn't go through our rigorous verification and standards process."
"I shouldn't have reported it, and I was wrong to discuss it on the air," he said on Wednesday, referring to a report he issued on air the night before.
Hours before his broadcast on Wednesday, Charles J. Harder, an attorney for Mr. Trump, had sent a letter demanding that the network and NBCUniversal, its parent company, "immediately and prominently retract, correct and apologize for the aforementioned false and defamatory statements."
"These statements are false and defamatory, and extremely damaging," Mr. Harder wrote in the letter, addressed to NBCUniversal attorneys.
He added that without a retraction and an apology, Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization would consider "immediate legal proceedings" against Mr. O'Donnell and NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast.
Mr. O'Donnell offered both on his program on Wednesday night.
"Tonight, we are retracting the story," he said. "We don't know whether the information is inaccurate but the fact is we do know it wasn't ready for broadcast, and for that, I apologize."
Deutsche Bank said Tuesday that it had tax documents being sought in a congressional inquiry into Mr. Trump's finances, igniting a storm over what they may say.
Mr. O'Donnell's statement on Wednesday was likely to be fuel for Mr. Trump, who has attacked specific media outlets repeatedly since Tuesday, including The New York Times, Axios, The Washington Post and even Fox News.
On Tuesday evening, before his show, Mr. O'Donnell wrote on Twitter: "A source close to Deutsche Bank says Trump's tax returns show he pays very little income tax and, more importantly, that his loans have Russian co-signers. If true, that explains every kind word Trump has ever said about Russia and Putin."
Mr. O'Donnell said on his show that the "co-signers are Russian oligarchs."
But the MSNBC host also suggested at times that his reporting might not have been that robust, repeating during the hour that it would be explosive "if true, and I stress the 'if true' part of this."
Rachel Maddow, MSNBC's 9 p.m. host, told Mr. O'Donnell as she was handing off to his show that his reporting "obviously would be absolutely flummoxing, but I don't know."
"I'm going to now sit and watch your show," she added.
Mr. O'Donnell replied, "It would test the Trump theory that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would still be with him."
"Yeah, man, seriously," Ms. Maddow said. "That's the financial equivalent of that, yeah. Wow, thanks Lawrence, geez."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: A memo issued to staff at the Washington Post confirms the newsroom in their Washington, D.C., headquarters was infested with cockroaches.
"We have a growing pest problem,” said director of newsroom operations Jillian S. Jarrett in an office memo. "We’ve gotten several reports of cockroaches in the newsroom."
The report of the insect infestation at the Washington Post closely mirrors a bedbug infestation at the New York Times. An internal memo sent to New York Times newsroom staff on Monday confirmed the presence of bedbugs. "During an extermination sweep of the newsroom over the weekend, we discovered evidence of bedbugs in a wellness room ... on the second floor, a couch on the third floor and a booth on the fourth floor." The memo informed staff the areas would be thoroughly cleaned.
New York Times columnist Bret Stephens deleted his Twitter account after a George Washington University professor jokingly called him a "bedbug" in light of the infestation. Stephens said he was deeply offended by the "dehumanizing rhetoric."
Jarrett went on to say the cockroaches in the Washington Post seemed to be confined only to the newsroom and suggested staff be more tidy with food. "There are Clorox wipes in the copy aide station. We have on-call cleaning services, if you need a vacuum or mop, please let me know," Jarrett said.
An email reply to Jarrett's memo from the newsroom praised the cockroach fighting skills of reporter Taylor Telford and included photos of her flushing the insects down the toilet.
Other Washington Post newsroom staff tweeted harrowing incidents of roach encounters from this summer. "When you slide in early to claim a corner 'office' in the @washingtonpost kitchen to get some serious revisioning done and see a COCKROACH skittering by your foot!" tweeted reporter Tracy Jan. "Lucky for me, @taylormtelford is on the morning GA shift and responded to my screams. Calm, cool and collected, this girl’s my hero!"

Colleagues heaped praise on Telford's bravery and complimented her ability to stay fashionable under pressure. "I thought there was a wild beast in the kitchen from your screams!! Major props to @taylormtelford for not only restoring calm but rockin a very chic jumpsuit," said reporter Rachel Leah Siegel.
"It’s her roach murdering jumpsuit!" Jan exclaimed.

Obama counsel Greg Craig: I didn’t lie to investigators, and I wasn’t an agent of Ukraine

Texto completo: Greg Craig, the Obama White House counsel swept up in a case spun off from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, denied on the stand Wednesday allegations he’d misled investigators looking into whether he’d acted as an agent of Ukraine.

Craig, 74, is charged with misleading Department of Justice investigators about his role promoting the report put together at the behest of the Kremlin-linked government in Ukraine regarding the country’s controversial prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko for alleged corruption. Craig testified that he did not lie to investigators and that his only involvement in any media outreach was to stop the whitewashing of the conclusions of his report by Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice or by people working for Manafort, saying his report was “bad news for Ukraine” and that he was motivated by a desire for his report to be portrayed accurately in the media.
Tymoshenko was prosecuted under President Viktor Yanukovych, who worked closely with Paul Manafort. The DOJ’s case against Craig focuses on the public relations work allegedly performed for Ukraine by Craig and the law firm he worked for — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom — throughout 2012.
Craig allegedly “schemed, falsified, and concealed” important facts from the then-head of DOJ’s Foreign Agents Registration Act enforcement unit, Heather Hunt, and the members of her team in 2013. The "scheme" relates to the foreign agents law, which mandates anyone working on behalf of a foreign government register with the DOJ.

“I did not lie to Ms. Hunt or members of the FARA unit,” Craig testified today. “And I did not withhold or conceal information from Ms. Hunt or members of the FARA unit.”
Prosecutors say Craig initially sought advice about whether he’d need to register under the law if he took the job writing the report and that a Skadden colleague advised him writing a report would be fine, but doing public relations work would not, and that Craig’s deceptions likely stemmed from a desire to avoid registering as a foreign agent.
But during nearly four hours of testimony, Craig maintained Skadden put together an independent report and denied his involvement in the media plans put together by Rick Gates, Paul Manafort's right hand man, and Jonathan Hawker, the British publicist who Manafort brought on to shape a pro-Yanukovych media narrative. Gates and Hawker both testified against Craig.
“I did not trust Jonathan Hawker to give an honest portrayal of our report on the Tymoshenko trial,” Craig said. “I had no confidence he would be accurate or honest.”
Prosecutors say Craig was especially deceptive about his interactions with David Sanger of the New York Times, pointing out that Craig offered Sanger the report ahead of its release, emailed it to him and hand-delivered a copy to his home, and did an interview with him and other reporters. But Craig said he only did so because he believed Hawker would lie about the report's contents, planning to spin the report the way his bosses wanted him to and claim the report showed Tymoshenko’s trial wasn’t politically motivated when Skadden did not reach a determination on that issue.
“I feared he would care more about pleasing Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates than accurately portraying our report,” Craig testified. “He seemed to have just signed up for whatever the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice wanted to do.”
And Craig said that “if anyone was going to talk to the New York Times, it was going to be me.”
Craig was asked repeatedly by his defense attorney whether he believed any of the conversations he had with journalists from the New York Times, the L.A. Times, the Daily Telegraph, or the National Law Journal crossed the line given the advice he’d been given about DOJ’s rules related to registering as a foreign agent.
“I did not think correcting misinformation crossed any line or made me an agent of Ukraine,” Craig said.
Craig was also asked whether he’d helped the Ukrainian government advance its agenda.
“I did not — quite the contrary,” Craig testified. “I was not acting in the interests of Ukraine. I was trying to defend the accuracy of the report.”
Craig did admit that one of his letters to DOJ’s FARA unit got a significant date wrong. Craig told investigators Skadden didn’t contact the media until Dec. 12, 2012, when he’d reached out to Sanger on Dec. 11, 2012.
“I just muddled it up,” Craig said.
Prosecutors will get the chance to cross-examine Craig this afternoon.

Atlanta’s High Museum of Art Receives a Huge Donation of Impressionist Paintings

Texto completo: The High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Ga., has made some fascinating acquisitions over the past couple years, but the institution was just bequeathed a particularly excellent collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works that will surely draw a lot of new and returning visitors by the end of 2019. Philanthropists Doris and Shouky Shaheen were responsible for the gift, which includes 24 paintings by distinguished artists including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri Matisse, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Camille Pissarro and Maurice de Vlaminck. “Their collection is really a godsend,” museum director Rand Suffolk told the New York Times . “It’s the kind of blessing that we would not be able to orchestrate on our own.”
Indeed, when the status quo is churning along like it’s supposed to, the relationship between philanthropists and museums is a productive and symbiotic one. If a successful business owner spends years accumulating significant wealth, it’s only natural that she might want to spend her downtime cultivating an enviable art collection so as to telegraph her fantastic taste. As she gets older, however, the natural next step is to pass along this art collection to a public institution: this conveys her willingness to give back to her community.

Recently, however, global criticism of the Sackler family and the clan’s opioid crisis money has forced the art world to confront the fact that it was willing to accept huge donations from people who have actively worked to make people’s lives worse. In July, the Louvre removed the Sackler name from its walls but declined to specify why.
All of which is to say: obviously, it’s not a bad thing for museums to receive two dozen precious paintings from people who are generous enough to offer them. However, as more and more people begin to challenge the largely ineffective nature of the philanthropist class in the midst of a planet wracked by inequality, artistic gifts will no longer be able to obscure the disparity between the 1 percent and the destitute.

Texto completo: Nathalie Centeno set two Latin-inspired treats on the counter at her new shop, Crazy Fruits in North Fort Myers. One, the Mangonada, was a mango smoothie filled with sliced mango, Changuitrozos — bits of fruit candy with salt and chili — a chewy tamarind stick and chamoy, a Mexican condiment made with fruit, chilies and lime juice.
Fruity, citrusy, tart and just a little bit spicy — one sip of the Mangonada and the only possible response was: Wow.
The second, called the Coconut Palm, was a raspado, another Mexican treat, usually made with fruit and sweetened-condensed milk. This one had coconut ice cream with flakes of toasted coconut, sliced mangoes and strawberries, homemade passion-fruit syrup, shaved ice and a drizzle of condensed milk for a refreshing blend of sweetness and richness with a tart finish.
Wow, again.
Behind the counter, Centeno smiled. "Wow" is something she's heard a lot since opening Crazy Fruits with her mother in June in a small strip mall on Hancock Bridge Parkway. The pair are originally from Nicaragua, though they lived in southern California before moving to Southwest Florida.
"In Cali, there's something like this on every corner," Centeno said.
"We wanted to bring something different here. A lot of people haven't tried it yet."
Crazy Fruits offers a variety of sweet, salty and layered treats, from traditional American-style ice creams, made locally by the famed Love Boat, to Mexican fruit bowls garnished with wedges of lime and dashes of hot chili, to those raspados, smoothies and fruit-and-ice-cream combinations.
"We also have more of a Mexican street line," Centeno said, "with the chamoy sauce and a lot of candies that we can mix in with the fruits."
Crazy Fruits' fresh fruits include strawberries, mangoes, cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapple and bananas. Its syrups — pineapple, tamarind, mango and strawberry — are made from scratch by Centeno's mother, using recipes she has slowly perfected over time.
"She would make them for parties," Centeno said of her mom's process, "and little by little she has added her own little twists to them. So, they're like family recipes — new family recipes."
Crazy Fruits is the first business for the pair, and they're confident their treats will catch on locally.
"These are really popular in Cali," Centeno said.
"They attract a lot of customers because it works with a lot of people. It's one of those shops that attracts everyone's attention. If people want something simple, they can come in for a fresh fruit bowl or fresh fruit juice. If they want something more exotic and crazy, we can come up with something crazy and wild."
Wild like spicy, limey, fruity smoothies? Or creamy, tart, coconut-y shaved ice?
Centeno just laughed. That and more.

Warren, Markey, Pressley letter demands answers on asylum delays in Boston

Texto completo: Three members of Massachusetts' congressional delegation are questioning the Trump administration's decision to divert immigration officers from Northeast offices to assist with processing asylum cases at the southern border, leaving behind a backlog of 40,000 New England cases.
In a letter to acting US Citizenship and Immigration Services director Ken Cuccinelli, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Senator Edward J. Markey, and Representative Ayanna Pressley called the move an “unfair and unjustified shift of resources" and demanded written answers to a series of questions about the operations of the affected office in Boston.
“This appears to be another cruel and unnecessary action by the Trump Administration to hurt
immigrants," the lawmakers wrote.
USCIS told attorneys earlier this month in an e-mail, which the Globe obtained, that it would no longer schedule any new asylum interviews in Boston and only a “small number" in Newark, because of “shifting priorities and the continued influx of cases at the Southwest Border." Staff will finish cases in which interviews already took place, the letter said.
The types of cases that are being affected in New England are called “affirmative" asylum cases. The vast majority of affirmative asylum-seekers arrived legally, according to immigration advocate and lawyer Matt Cameron, and apply for asylum within a year. Asylum officers then interview the applicants and determine if their claims are valid. In March, the Boston office completed almost 200 cases, approving asylum for 34.
The diversion of staff means thousands of asylum seekers are being left in limbo. In their letter, Warren, Markey, and Pressley press Cuccinelli on how much longer those in line for asylum interviews should expect to wait.
“When does the USCIS plan to lift the suspension on scheduling new asylum interviews in the Boston Asylum Sub-Office?" one of the questions reads.
Senator Jeff Merkley first shed light on the diversion of staff last week, sparking an outcry among Democrats and immigration advocates.
Cuccinelli soon pushed back in his own tweet, calling the allegation “false," but Merkley pointed to the e-mail announcing the halt of interviews as evidence of his claim.

Herman: Does a football player belong in the Texas State Cemetery?

Texto completo: I’m going to shirk my constitutional duty as a columnist to tell you what to think about this. I’ll offer some data and encourage you to think about it.
Let’s be clear that I categorize myself as a big sports fan who sometimes has twinges and pangs about how big sports has become in our society. Things and people spark those twinges and pangs. Things like point spreads on NFL preseason games. People like Indianapolis Colts fans who booed Colts quarterback Andrew Luck as he left the field Saturday night after word spread that he was retiring.
So do sports figures belong in the Texas State Cemetery? It’s a hallowed ground that proudly and properly bills itself as “the final resting place of governors, senators, legislators, congressmen, judges and other legendary Texans who have made the state what it is today.”
Here’s what one reader asked: “So, how does being a football star qualify someone to be buried in the Texas State Cemetery?”
The reader asked for anonymity because “Football is the No. 1 religion in Texas and the U.S. and, as a retired minister, I wouldn’t want to appear to be anti-religious. I do wonder, however, why being a football star entitles someone to burial with former governors and other state big-wigs?”
The rules for qualifying for the honor of State Cemetery burial are simple, though not without a subjective component.
Automatic eligibility goes to legislators, elected state officials and appointed state officials who won Senate confirmation and served at least 10 years in office. People also can get in via gubernatorial proclamation or legislative resolution OK’d by the three-member, gubernatorially appointed cemetery committee, now chaired by Benjamin Hanson of Austin.
The committee also can approve people for Texas State Cemetery burial, the rules say, if it “finds that the person made a significant contribution to Texas history and culture in the following fields: air and space, agriculture, art and design, business and labor, city building, education, governmental service, industry, justice, military affairs, law enforcement, oil and gas, performing arts, philanthropy, public administration, ranching, religion, science and medicine, sports and writing.”
It’s a statement broad enough to allow for consideration of a variety of worthy Texans. Benson’s significant contribution to Texas history and culture? He was the star running back on a Midland Lee High School team that won three state titles, he had four years at the University of Texas that made him the school’s second-leading, all-time ground gainer, and he spent eight years in the NFL.
Again, I’ll let you decide if you think his too-short life of 36 years qualified him for the Texas State Cemetery. There’s no need to delve here into his brushes with the law. Benson was buried Monday near other sports figures and the small temporary marker where former UT President Bill Powers recently was interred.
Also buried near Benson are James Street, quarterback of the 1969 UT national champs and an All-America baseball pitcher, and Johnny “Lam” Jones, who in addition to his UT football career was a gold medalist at the 1976 Olympics on the 400-meter relay team. Former UT football Coach Darrell Royal and former UT baseball Coach Augie Garrido also are buried near Benson. There’s also former longtime Major League Baseball player and manager Don Baylor and Willie Wells, a Negro Leagues baseball star.
Sports-related, there’s also Wally Pryor, whose headstone calls him “The Voice of the University of Texas Longhorns.” The cemetery has a monument for Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry, but he’s buried in Dallas.
The cemetery committee also handles advance requests for burial plots. The list of those precleared has several sports figures, including longtime sportscaster Verne Lundquist, golfer Ben Crenshaw, former UT women’s hoops coach Jody Conradt, former UT athletic director DeLoss Dodds, former longtime UT sports information director Bill Little and former Texas A&M University football coach and Regent Gene Stallings. My apologies if I’ve missed others.
(Lundquist is among those who’ve had a headstone placed while still alive to enjoy it. His includes some of his memorable calls, including “Yes sir!” when Jack Nicklaus won the 1986 Masters.)
A few other names you might recognize on the cemetery’s precleared list: Larry Gatlin, Ken Starr, Karl Rove, Jerry Jeff Walker and Dan Rather.
Rather is not the only journalist who has passed cemetery committee muster. Already interred in the Texas State Cemetery are longtime Capitol correspondents Bo Byers of the Houston Chronicle and Jack Keever of the Associated Press.
Living journalists on the precleared list include Dave Montgomery of Austin and former American-Statesman cartoonist Ben Sargent and his wife, Diane Holloway, this paper’s former TV beat reporter. Both, appropriately, have reservations in the cemetery Statesman’s Meadow section, which probably is not named for my favorite local daily newspaper.
Sargent is a Pulitzer Prize winner, as is local author Lawrence Wright, who’s on the cemetery’s precleared list. Ken Towery, who won a 1956 Pulitzer for the Cuero Daily Record, was buried in the Texas State Cemetery in 2016.
Sargent told me he didn’t inquire about it “until I retired from the active-journalist ranks.” He said state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, “helped me through the process, which at one point stalled for several years because the people on the pertinent committee were not fans of my work.”
Many of you will recall that Sargent made a habit and career out of drawing pointed little pictures about politicians. When opposition to allowing him in came up, Sargent recalls asking Watson, “Really? About a quarter of the guys out there were engaged in an illegal, unconstitutional armed insurrection against the United States, and I’m not good enough to get in?”
“But patience prevailed, and this is one thing we can check off the list,” Sargent told me.
There are 1,816 Confederate veterans buried in the State Cemetery.
Montgomery, who now freelances for The New York Times and other publications, told me he and wife, Linda, applied so they can be buried near her parents, Kyle and Vivian Thompson. Kyle Thompson was a longtime Texas journalist and press secretary. More significantly, during World War II he was part of the “Lost Battalion” captured by the Japanese and held for 42 months.
The Cemetery Committee also has approved former Texas Monthly Publisher Mike Levy, who I watched laid to rest in the State Cemetery in 2016. Oh, he’s still quite alive. But, because he’s Levy, he graciously (and enthusiastically) agreed to pose, prone, in front of his headstone so I could shoot a photo. He looked good there.
Did Benson deserve the honor of burial in the Texas State Cemetery? It’s a judgment call. Hanson, the committee chairman, told me Tuesday he, as part of what he sees as the responsibility to let Texans know of potential Texas State Cemetery burial availability, contacted Benson’s family. After the family expressed interest, Hanson said, the committee, in a decision that will have to be ratified in a formal meeting, unanimously decided Aug. 20 that Benson qualified.
Like all three committee members, Hanson is a UT alum, though he says he grew up as an Oklahoma University fan. Hanson cited Benson’s contributions both in sports and philanthropy, mentioning Benson’s foundation’s efforts in repairing the home of a victim of the 2018 bombings in Austin.
Is Hanson worried that we don’t yet know all the circumstances of Benson’s death? Hanson said the decision was based on broader criteria, not just “what caused the death or the demons he had to deal with.
“You look at the full history of the man,” he said.
Larvin Jefferson agrees. I ran into the Huston-Tillotson University worker Monday at the cemetery a few hours after the private burial service for Benson.
“He was a good example to many people,” Jefferson, 56, told me as we stood at the flower-covered grave. “Sad that he had to go, yeah. But we all have to accept that, that sacrifice. Part of the sacrifice is giving up the earthly life and going back where we came from.”
And Jefferson wondered aloud about the high points in Benson’s life. Jefferson is a sports fan. “If I could just come out of that tunnel wearing an orange and white jersey,” he said. “That would make my day.”
“Unfortunately,” Jefferson said, “on that Saturday night when he went out, he didn’t know what was around the corner.”
We both agreed none of us ever do.

Deep dives into journalists' digital histories are welcome Yes, some careers may be damaged. But bring it. Because truth itself is facing a hostile takeover.

Texto completo: 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers."
So says Dick the Butcher in Shakespeare's "Henry VI, Part 2." Though often regarded as a Renaissance-era lawyer joke, the line is actually a backhanded compliment to the legal profession. Dick, a follower of the rebel Jack Cade, knows that before their insurrection can succeed, they have to get rid of the defenders of law and order.
We are seeing a disturbingly similar strategy unfold in American politics. Except that this time, they want to kill all the journalists.
The 2018 massacre at a newsroom in Annapolis and ongoing violence and threats against reporters make the analogy a rather sensitive one, so let's emphasize that it's only that - an analogy. The people we're talking about aren't actually out to kill journalists, just their credibility.
Tom Wright-Piersanti is the latest victim. According to a report in Sunday's New York Times, Wright- Piersanti, a Times editor, was targeted by "a loose network of conservative operatives allied with the White House." Their aim: Discredit news organizations they consider hostile to President Trump. Their strategy: posting damaging or embarrassing information about journalists.
So last week, after the Times ran an editorial and a profile unflattering to the Trump White House, this group unveiled on Breitbart some racist and anti-Semitic tweets Wright-Piersanti wrote 10 years ago. He has apologized and expressed "deep shame" for "lame attempts at edgy humor" - and also, in essence, for being a millennial.
"For my generation, the generation that came of age in the internet," he said, "all the youthful mistakes that you made get preserved in digital amber, and no matter how much you change and mature and grow up, it's always out there, waiting to be discovered." The Times said it was looking into what it called "a clear violation of our standards" by Wright-Piersanti.
One need not condone Wright-Piersanti's old tweets to note that whatever offensive thing he said, he said 10 years ago when he was in college. The last offensive thing Trump said was less than 10 days ago, and he is in the White House.
But there is far more at stake here than one man's career. A president who has branded journalists "enemies of the people" and news media "an evil propaganda machine" now has working on his behalf an anti-journalism hit squad. These people are nothing less than termites in the woodwork of freedom.
Beyond Wright-Piersanti, they're also said to have targeted reporters from The Washington Post, Business Insider and CNN. Like him, most were in their teens or early 20s when they penned the offensive posts. Arthur Schwartz, a conservative political consultant and friend of Donald Trump Jr., described by The Times as a central figure in the campaign, says it has only just begun. The group claims to have done deep dives into the digital histories of numerous journalists - and their family members.
"Lots more where this came from," he tweeted last week.
To which journalism as an institution must respond: Bring it.
Yes, some people may be embarrassed, some careers damaged. But bring it. Because truth itself is facing a hostile takeover. Because the machinery of authoritarianism is being assembled before our eyes. Because the people's right to know is sacred. And because without an informed electorate, democracy is not possible.
See, this group understands what Dick the Butcher did not. The first thing you do is "kill" not the lawyers, but the reporters.
Then you can do whatever you want to the lawyers, and no one will even know.

$2.7 Million Settlement Is Reached in Rent-to-Own Case

Texto completo: New York regulators have reached a settlement worth up to $ 2.7 million with a hedge fund that provided financing and assistance to a large rent-to-own home firm accused of engaging in predatory business practices.
The settlement announced Tuesday requires the hedge fund, Atalaya Capital Management, to provide at least $ 20,000 in restitution to the more than 100 state residents who thought they were entering into deals to ultimately buy homes from Vision Property Management.
Atalaya, a $ 5 billion hedge fund based in New York, also agreed to pay a $ 250,000 civil penalty under the settlement, reached with the state attorney general and the Department of Financial Services. The deal came less than a month after the agencies filed a lawsuit against Vision, saying the company had operated an "illegal, unlicensed mortgage lending" business by using deceptive rent-to-own agreements to sell often-rundown homes.
Linda A. Lacewell, New York's superintendent of financial services, said the settlement "provides a measure of restitution to New York consumers who were left holding the bag with further debt, uninhabitable properties and broken dreams."
Atalaya did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement. The company severed its financing deals with Vision after The New York Times published a series of articles in 2016 about Vision and other companies engaged in a revival of the so-called seller-financing of rundown homes following the financial crisis.
"As the settlement acknowledges, Atalaya, which was a capital provider to subsidiaries of Vision Property Management, responded immediately when it became clear that questions surfaced about Vision's business practices," said Sean Hecker, a lawyer for the hedge fund. "As it does in all matters, Atalaya remains dedicated to ensuring that its business is conducted, in all respects, with transparency and integrity."
The regulators sued Vision, which is based in Columbia, S.C., in federal court in Manhattan on Aug. 1. At its peak, Vision owned more than 5,000 homes across the country, buying thousands of foreclosed properties on the cheap from Fannie Mae, one of the big federal government-controlled mortgage finance firms.
The agencies said Atalaya began providing financial backing and other support to Vision in 2012 and either was aware or should have been aware of the predatory nature of Vision's business practices.
Letitia James, New York's attorney general, said the settlement would put firms on notice that "anyone who preys on innocent, hard-working New Yorkers" would be held accountable.
An executive from Vision did not respond to a message seeking comment.

Texto completo: Samantha Power, Sarah M. Broom, Chris Ware and Tim O’Brien are just a few of the big names lined up for this year’s Texas Book Festival, according to the full lineup announced Tuesday night.
As usual, the festival takes place in and around the Capitol grounds and along Congress Avenue on Oct. 26-27. It is free and open to the public.
This year, Samantha Power, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, will discuss her memoir, “The Education of an Idealist.”
The book traces Power’s life, from her childhood in Dublin to her time in war-ravaged Bosnia to her stint working in former President Barack Obama’s administration.
In addition to her role as ambassador, Powers served four years as Obama’s human rights adviser and was considered a key member of his foreign policy team.
New Orleans native Sarah M. Broom will discuss her debut memoir, “The Yellow House,” a history of the Louisiana city as seen through her family’s time there. It’s one of the year’s most critically feted books.
Cartoonist and writer Chris Ware, whose 2000 book “Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth” was the first graphic novel to win the Guardian First Book Award, will come to this year’s festival with “Rusty Brown,” a graphic novel he has been working on for about 16 years. Look for a melancholic examination of the Midwest, isolation and fan culture.
Tim O’Brien, author of “The Things They Carried” and a Texas State University professor, will present “Dad’s Maybe Book,” covering a life of letters, lessons learned in wartime and the experience of raising two sons. O’Brien picked up the 1979 National Book Award for his bestseller, “Going After Cacciato.”
Also on the lineup is New York Times bestselling author, historian and activist Ibram X. Kendi, who will come to the festival with “How to Be an Antiracist,” an examination of how to identify and counteract white supremacy in ethics, history, law and science. National Book Award finalist Laurie Halse Anderson will present “Shout,” a memoir inspired by her novel, “Speak,” which advocated for survivors of sexual assault.
Over on the food side, Chris Shepherd, chef of Houston’s Underbelly Hospitality, will discuss his “Cook Like a Local: Flavors That Can Change How You Cook and See the World.” TV personality, chef and cookbook author Aarón Sánchez will present his memoir, “Where I Come From: Life Lessons From a Latino Chef.” Sánchez is often a judge on the TV culinary competition series “MasterChef” and has also appeared on “Chopped” and “Chopped Junior”
Previously announced authors appearing at this year’s festival include Malcolm Gladwell, John Grisham, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Sean Brock, John Hodgman, Kristen Arnett, Hafsah Faizal, Attica Locke, Saeed Jones and Kwame Alexander.
The Texas Book Festival touts itself as one of the country’s largest literary festivals. It draws 50,000 fans and more than 300 local, Texas and national authors, according to organizers.

Opinion: Andrew Luck is not coming back to the NFL because he doesn't need it

Texto completo: Anyone who has ever been jilted unexpectedly will recognize Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay’s deluded optimism that Andrew Luck might someday return.
Michael Jordan changed his mind, Irsay noted Saturday night. Brett Favre made it an annual event. Ben Watson’s retirement didn’t even last the offseason, while Josh McCown decided to give the NFL another go after two months.
“I don’t rule it out,” Irsay said. “Because as quickly as this thing sort of descended upon us, and as mysterious as it was coming upon us, it could leave the same way. … I would say it’s possible. ”
Of course it’s possible. Luck is not even 30, and there will come a time when his body is no longer battered and aching and the psychological scars from all of those injuries have faded.
But the reality is that Luck’s goodbye is almost certainly final, not one he will reconsider or even second-guess.
Luck has always been a different sort of athlete – in the best sense of the phrase. While there was never any denying how much football meant to him, it also was never the only thing in his life. That was clear in early 2011, when everyone just assumed he would forgo his senior season at Stanford to be the NFL’s No. 1 pick.
He’d led the Cardinal to a 12-1 record, Stanford’s best season since 1940, and finished second to Cam Newton in the Heisman Trophy voting. His coach, Jim Harbaugh, was about to leave for the NFL, and there was no reason to think Luck wouldn’t be far behind.
Except there were other things equally important to Luck as playing in the NFL, even being its No. 1 pick.
“It’s a Rorschach test for people’s values system,” Luck’s father, Oliver, told The New York Times after his son’s stunning announcement that he was staying at Stanford for his senior year.
Fascinated by the look of different buildings since he was a child, he wanted to finish his degree in architectural design. He also enjoyed the bubble-like atmosphere at Stanford, where he was noticed and occasionally fawned over but was still allowed to be an ordinary college student.
Even after he went to the NFL – still as the No. 1 pick – he was not caught up in the trappings of the game or the celebrity afforded its marquee players. He famously hung on to his flip phone and avoided social media.
He gave a new definition to the term “cerebral quarterback” when he started a virtual book club at the behest of fans who heard him talk of his love for reading. Each month, he’d make a recommendation for “rookie” (younger) and “veteran” (older) readers. Many of the choices were weighty, books designed to open someone’s mind to the world and test his or her assumptions about it.
The selections for August: Terry Pratchett’s "Nation," about refugees from opposite sides of the globe, and John Carreyrou’s "Bad Blood," which chronicles the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and her fraudulent startup Theranos.
Almost every offseason, Luck would return to Europe, where he’d spent most of his childhood while Oliver Luck ran the NFL’s offshoot there. He reveled in his anonymity there, as well as the opportunity to soak up Europe’s culture and history. The soccer enthusiast would also go to Premier League games, and fans spotted him following the U. S. men’s team during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
All of this is to say that not only was Luck’s decision not made lightly, something that was clear listening to his anguished news conference Saturday night, but that he has an advantage over so many other players who leave football only to find they no longer know where the game they have loved for so long ends and they begin.
Luck has outside interests, many of them. Though he won’t want for money, he also has the blueprint for building the next part of his life from his father, a former NFL quarterback who has gone on to become a successful executive in both collegiate and professional sports.
“Excited for Andrew Luck. The next phase is going to be an amazing one for him. Super intelligent and fun guy,” former NFL tight end Martellus Bennett, who has, among other things, written children’s books since retiring in 2018, said on Twitter.
Luck and wife Nicole are also expecting their first child, something that no doubt factored into his decision to leave the game now. At some point, he might feel a pull to return so his son or daughter can see him play. But Luck being Luck, that sentimentality will be outweighed by his desire to see them grow up.
When something unexpected occurs, it's natural to imagine an alternate outcome. But that can only be wishful thinking in Luck's case. He's gone, and he's not coming back.

Pain. Frustration. Even a Trip to the Hospital.

Texto completo: The rise of drug-resistant urinary tract infections has been particularly burdensome for the significant subset of people who suffer from them on a regular, recurrent basis. These individuals, mostly women, can wind up on a carousel of antibiotics, sometimes the wrong ones, and many experiment with homeopathic alternatives that have not been scientifically validated.
These themes were echoed widely in accounts offered by readers of The New York Times in response to a recent article about the rise in U.T.I.s (as they are known) that are not cured by a growing list of commonly used antibiotics. Nearly 600 people responded to the paper's invitation to share their experiences with these infections.
As an alternative to antibiotics, some readers mentioned they have found relief using a supplement called D-mannose. This compound is a simple sugar, like glucose, that can adhere to bacteria, notably E. coli, which cause the majority of U.T.I.s of the bladder. By doing so, the supplement is intended to interfere with the germ's ability to adhere inside the bladder and grow into an infection.
D-mannose has provided hope to Margaret Finnegan, 67, from Charlotte, N.C., who seemed at wit's end over persistent U.T.I.s "My urologist failed to culture a urine specimen and wound up with an antibiotic resistant UTI," she wrote. "I was referred to an infectious disease specialist who couldn't see me for a week! I was already in pain for 3 weeks!"
"Finally I was given a very strong antibiotic," she continued. "I still had the U.T.I., was put on another one and finally cured. I'm now on a low dose antibiotic for 6 months. I'm taking a probiotic and D-mannose to help fight this."
In reality, there is only modest science to support the use of D-mannose to combat urinary tract infections. Among the research, a small pilot study from Italy said the compound showed "promising results," but multiple experts in the field said research does not support reliance on the compound for prevention or cure. Also, D-mannose can have side effects: it can cause loose stools, and, because it is a sugar, it creates risk for diabetes, noted Dr. Lee Riley, a professor of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the University of California, Berkeley.
"It is option four or five to reach for when someone says, 'What else can I do?"' said Dr. Dimitri Drekonja, a specialist in infectious diseases and U.T.I.s at the University of Minnesota Medical School.
The rise of drug resistance in the germs that cause U.T.I.s does not mean that these infections are untreatable. Rather, it leads to higher hospitalization rates and complications. It also creates a societal risk because overall resistance can grow when antibiotics are overused, for example when someone with a U.T.I. is prescribed the wrong medication and has to take more than one course of antibiotics.
This has intensified a debate over whether to regularly encourage doctors to culture a patient's urine to determine which germ is causing the infection, and which drug can best treat it.
Cece Turner, 30, who described herself as a "healthy mum" from Scotland, wrote that she had learned the hard way to seek a culture after a harrowing first experience with a U.T.I. two years ago.
She said that she "blindly followed orders, taking drug after drug with no reprieve."
"I ended up being severely ill with a multi-drug resistant infection," she continued. "Having tried 6+ different courses of antibiotics over the course of 4 months, my U.T.I. was eventually 'cured' in July by a 2 week course of antibiotics."
Less than a year later, she got a second U.T.I. "This time," she wrote, "I was a bit more savvy and demanded a culture immediately."
Doctors and researchers interviewed agreed that in an ideal world, it would be great to culture each infection for possible infection. But that is far from realistic because cultures cost money and take time, discouraging doctors, labs and insurance providers, and also because the usual practice is to quickly treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics.
Dr. Eva Raphael, a physician at San Francisco General Hospital who does research on U.T.I.s, said cultures should be taken more often. "Yes, it takes manpower to send a urine culture, plate it, identify the colonies," she said, but she added that she believes it's worth doing "if we're going to be judicious about the use of antibiotics."
It might hearten some readers to know that the rise in resistance has spurred policymakers to think about whether to make getting cultures more standard. Dr. Drekonja, who is involved in discussing those kinds of issues with the Infectious Disease Society of America, said: "I suspect it will be addressed in the next version of U.T.I. guidelines," although it is not clear when those will come out or what they will say.
Many readers who responded to The Times query were women in their 50s or older. Women who are postmenopausal are particularly susceptible to urinary tract infections because their falling levels of vaginal estrogen can interfere with the body's ability to fight off bladder infections.
The other peak period for U.T.I. infections for women is after puberty, during sexually active, child bearing years. Katrina Ramirez, 28, wrote that when she was in college at the University of Kansas, she experienced "a U.T.I. that did not respond to three different rounds of antibiotics."
"It got so bad that I was out of school for months and had to get a medical withdrawal," she said.
After moving to Chicago, she said she was getting the infections twice a year. "At one point I went to an E.R. five or six times in a year!"
She said the problem has subsided now that she is working in the Peace Corps at the border of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. "I get U.T.I.s much less frequently right now since, due to the logistics of my position, I am woefully celibate."
Many readers wrote with stories of excruciating frustration, and some with the sort of life-threatening infections doctors fear could worsen in an era of drug resistance.
Aranzazu Dobbels Busto, 23, a native of Spain who lives in London, wrote that she got her first U.T.I. in 2015 and had a total of 10 that first year. "Four years later U.T.I.s are still something I am constantly battling with," she wrote. "The amounts of antibiotics that I have put my body through," she continued, "have given me bad stomach problems to deal with. Additionally, it affected my intimacy with my partner, as I was always scared that anything we did would lead to a U.T.I. It has affected other parts of my life as well, such as attending university and going to work."
"The frustration I have felt throughout the last four years is difficult to describe to someone who has never had a U.T.I."
It is not only women who are at risk. Andrew Stephens, from Bakersfield, Calif., described the heart-wrenching experience of his son, who contracted a highly-drug resistant U.T.I. a week after birth.
Doctors thought the boy would not survive, said Mr. Stephens, 33. Finally, intravenous antibiotics saved his life.
"Luke is now 6 years old and a great joy, challenge, and everything a wonderful son should be," Mr. Stephens wrote.
He said he partly blames overuse of antibiotics in livestock for the drug-resistant illness. "It's not worth squandering our antibiotics on slightly reducing the price of meat."

Get over yourselves: Public statements of journalists are fair game

Texto completo: The White House has partnered with pro-Trump activists to embarrass newsrooms by highlighting their employees' awkward and controversial past remarks, according to the New York Times.
A better administration would just take hostile media coverage on the chin. That is all that really needs to be said about the matter. But leave it to the editors of the nation’s largest and most prestigious newsrooms to climb back up onto their crosses and play the role of the selfless martyr.
Supposedly, it is now a dastardly attack on the “free press” for pro-Trump activists to draw attention to very problematic public statements that seep out, illustrating the corruption of journalists' thoughts — and perhaps even pointing to a sickness in the culture of the outlets that chose to employ them.
This effort may well suggest that President Trump is thin-skinned and unable to handle a hostile press. But it does not mean reporters are operating now in censorious tyranny. The inability of so many ostensibly intelligent journalists to understand the distinction is a truly amazing thing.
When government “and those working on their behalf, threaten and retaliate against reporters as a means of suppression, it’s a clear abandonment of democracy for something very dangerous," a spokesperson for CNN said in a statement to the New York Times.
Now seems like a good time to remind you that CNN in 2017 hunted down an anonymous pro-Trump Reddit user, “HanAssholeSolo,” and used the threat of public exposure to wrestle from him an apology and a promise of good behavior.
Then in February 2018, CNN confronted a Florida woman, whom its reporters accused of unwittingly coordinating with Kremlin-connected trolls by promoting a pro-Trump Facebook page. The cable news network published the woman’s first, middle, and last names, revealed her state of residence, the county in which she lived, the exact title of the pro-Trump Facebook page with which she was associated, and broadcast images of the woman's face. Needless to say, she became the target of intense online harassment.
Elsewhere, Huffington Post editor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen, whose newsroom published a report in 2018 exposing the familial and professional associations of an obscure pro-Trump social media troll, said of the White House's partnership with pro-Trump social media activists, "This is an extremely alarming piece and should worry anyone who cares about independent journalism." Really?
Former Washington Post executive editor Leonard Downie Jr. said in a statement of his own, “If it’s clearly retaliatory, it’s clearly an attack, it’s clearly not journalism ... It’s one thing for Spiro Agnew to call everyone in the press ‘nattering nabobs of negativism,’” he added in reference to President Richard M. Nixon’s vice president. “And another thing to investigate individuals in order to embarrass them publicly and jeopardize their employment.”
Remember: By “investigate individuals” and “embarrass them publicly,” Downie Jr. means people are looking at public Twitter accounts maintained by public individuals. Also, it is probably worth mentioning here that the Washington Post is the same newspaper that in 2014 assigned a reporter specifically to comb through the past statements of a congressional aide who published a Facebook post criticizing former President Obama's daughters.
The most hilariously overwrought reaction from the press, however, comes from New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger, who called the effort to highlight newsroom employees’ past statements an “attack,” and an “assault.”
“This represents an escalation of an ongoing campaign against the free press,” he warned. “[T]he political operatives behind this campaign will argue that they are ‘reporting’ on news organizations in the same way that news organizations report on elected officials and other public figures. They are not. They are using insinuation and exaggeration to manipulate the facts for political gain.”
The New York Times report itself attempts to explain why it is very terrible for pro-Trump operatives to peruse the social media accounts of reporters.
“[U]sing journalistic techniques to target journalists and news organizations as retribution for — or as a warning not to pursue — coverage critical of the president is fundamentally different from the well-established role of the news media in scrutinizing people in positions of power,” the report reads.
I cannot stress enough that what these people are calling “assault” and “targeting” is an effort to comb through public statements made by individuals who shape public opinion from within the most powerful and prestigious newsrooms in the United States. The “attack” on the free press is nothing more dastardly than reporters and editors having their public remarks quoted. Some people seem to think it is too good for the gander.

Texto completo: The New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger sent a memo to the paper's staff to say they will not back down in their reporting on President Trump, after they published a story detailing how the president's allies are searching through their social media accounts.
The Times reported friends and advisers in the Trump family orbit are combing through the accounts to look for embarrassing or damaging posts.
Sulzberger said that since they are, "Unable to challenge the accuracy of our reporting, political operatives have been scouring social media and other sources to find possibly embarrassing information on anyone associated with The Times" to "silence critics and undermine the public's faith in independent journalism."
Sulzberger said the plan is the result of Trump's rhetoric of calling the press "fake news" and "enemy of the people." He added their attempts to compare "reporting on news organizations in the same way that news organizations report on elected officials and other public figures" are wrong.
"They are using insinuation and exaggeration to manipulate the facts for political gain," Sulzberger concluded.
In their story, Sulzberger said, "The Times will not be intimidated or silenced.”TweetSome reporters and editors have already had their old posts be highlighted. A CNN photo editor and writer resigned after his previous anti-Semitic tweets were dug up. One tweet said, "More than 4 jewish pigs killed in #Jerusalem today by the Palestinian bomb explode. #Israel #Gaza."
It was also discovered that Times political editor Tom Wright-Piersanti had tweeted, “I was going to say ‘Crappy Jew Year’ but one of my resolutions is to be less anti-Semitic. So … HAPPY Jew Year. You Jews" and, "There are four Indian guys with mohawks in this one class and each one is a douche in his own awful way. I hate Mohawk Indians."

Texto completo: Georgia has joined other states in investigating possible cases of severe respiratory illness that may be linked to vaping.
Vaping is the use of e-cigarette devices, which mimic cigarettes but produce inhalable vapors instead of smoke. The devices are marketed as alternatives to smoking, but health experts say they cause problems of their own.
The CDC said it's aware of about 190 cases of severe lung disease in 22 states that could be caused by vaping.
And Illinois health officials Friday announced the death of an adult who had vaped and later developed a severe respiratory illness. This is the first such death reported amid a growing number of lung illnesses nationally that physicians say could be connected to e-cigarettes.
The Georgia Department of Public Health said Friday that it's investigating possible cases of severe respiratory illness linked to vaping.
Symptoms, which worsen over time, include cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Many patients nationally acknowledged a history of vaping nicotine and/or products containing THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana that makes people "high."
The CDC and state
investigators have not identified any specific product or compound linked to all cases.
Amid the lack of information, health officials said they are scrambling to find common themes to the respiratory problems, the New York Times reported. "More information is needed to know what is causing these illnesses," said Ileana Arias, a CDC official.
A disproportionate share of the cases appear to be happening in Illinois, where there have been 22 confirmed illnesses, according to Jennifer Layden, the chief medical officer and state epidemiologist at the Illinois Department of Public Health. She said officials were still investigating the patient's death, the Times reported.
Here in Georgia, Public Health has requested that health care providers ask patients with severe respiratory illness whether they have used devices for vaping nicotine and/or THC. The agency also is asking the providers to report possible cases to the Georgia Poison Center.
Patients with a history of vaping who are experiencing breathing problems should seek medical care, Public Health said.
The vaping-connected respiratory illnesses have also occurred in California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin, USA Today reported. Similar cases have also been reported in three additional states - Ohio, Virginia and Tennessee, according to NBC News. Wisconsin has seen at least 15 cases, including vaping-related lung illnesses among older people.
E-cigarettes and other vaping devices are not safe for youths, young adults, pregnant women or adults who do not currently use tobacco products, according to the CDC.
"The severity of illness people are experiencing is alarming and we must get the word out that using e-cigarettes and vaping can be dangerous," Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said in a statement, CNN reported.

'Slava's Snowshow' Back to Broadway

Texto completo: It's too early to tell if New York will see a White Christmas this year -- outside, at least. Inside Broadway theaters, the holiday offerings are already piling up.
At the Lyceum Theater, a new stage adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" will have a limited run during the holiday season. "The Illusionists," too, will try to attract a seasonal audience with its "Magic of the Holidays" spectacular. (And let's not forget the Rockettes' annual high-kicking pageant at Radio City Music Hall.)
Now, there's a new addition: "Slava's Snowshow" -- a surrealist children's show packed with dreamlike scenes, clowns and, yes, snow -- will join the holiday lineup with a run at the Stephen Sondheim Theater from Nov. 11 through Jan. 5, 2020.
The show will open after "Beautiful," the long-running Carole King musical and the theater's current tenant, closes at the end of October.
The antics-filled "Snowshow" was created by Slava Polunin, a clown from central Russia who starred in the original production in its first Broadway stint at the Helen Hayes Theater. That run, also a limited holiday appearance, earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Special Theatrical Event and was preceded by a successful two years Off Broadway.
A New York Times review in 2008 said the production had no shortage of the fluffy white flakes audiences were expecting: "It was falling on every part of the dark central section, on the balcony, falling softly upon the first rows. It lay thickly drifted on the aisles and on the floor, on the delighted faces of the littlest children, on the coat-covered laps of their parents."
And if the total blizzard of a finale in "Snowshow," or the rest of this season's holiday offerings, still don't quite fill your appetite for blankets of white confetti? "Frozen" at the St. James Theater down the block still has plenty.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
AMAZING GRACE (2018) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In January 1972, Aretha Franklin stepped up at a podium at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles and began recording what was to become "Amazing Grace," a live record that remains Franklin's (and live gospel music's) biggest-selling album. Last year, the film that was shot over the two-night concert there under the direction of Sydney Pollack finally made it to theaters, giving the public the opportunity to see -- and not just hear -- what happened in that church. The movie also gives plenty of attention to the proceedings's very qualified host, the Rev. James Cleveland." "This is obviously one of the great music films, less epic in scope than, say, 'The Last Waltz' but as glorious in communal feeling and South Los Angeles zeal as 'Wattstax' (the natural partner for a double feature) and as musically imaginative as 'Stop Making Sense,"' Wesley Morris wrote in his review for The New York Times. "What distinguishes 'Amazing Grace,' what lifts it to the penthouse, is a mix of energy and moment."
KATHERINE RYAN: GLITTER ROOM Stream on Netflix. The Canadian comic Katherine Ryan discusses "Hamilton," Celine Dion and men (who, she says, are "like dolphins, in that they should be enjoyed on holiday") in her second Netflix special, which was filmed at the Belasco Theater in Los Angeles.
MORTAL ENGINES (2018) Stream on HBO Platforms. It's the post-apocalypse on wheels in "Mortal Engines," a heavily stylized sci-fi spectacle based on a young adult series by the British author Philip Reeve. The story is set in a futuristic land where the world as we know it has crumbled, replaced by a new human civilization that took the pieces of destroyed metropolises -- most prominently, London -- and built mobile cities with wheels. Hugo Weaving takes on powerful villain duties, with Robert Sheehan and Hera Hilmar playing younger, more agreeable characters who take him on. (It's a familiar formula.) The screenplay is by the same three people who brought the "Lord of the Rings" series to the big screen (Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Peter Jackson); expect similarly colossal action here.
What's on TV
THE HOUSE (2017) 8 p.m. on TNT. Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler star in this dark comedy. The movie casts the pair as parents who, in order to save up enough money to send their daughter (Ryan Simpkins) to college, team up with a friend (Jason Mantzoukas) to open an illegal underground casino. "Based on trailers and the durable, slightly stale charm of its stars, 'The House' might be mistaken for a genial, silly movie about nice people making questionable decisions," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "Instead, it is a dark, startlingly bloody journey into the bitter, empty, broken heart of the American middle class, a blend of farce and satire built on a foundation of social despair."

Dynasty and tragedy

Texto completo: html> It was dark in room 107 of the Brazilian Court. The blinds were down. A “Do Not Disturb” sign hung on the door.
An employee of the historic Palm Beach hotel knocked quietly. No answer. She used a pass key to enter the room that morning of April 25, 1984. She saw two beds, still made.
“Then, almost immediately, I saw David,” recalled hotel secretary Elizabeth Barnett. “He was on the floor, between the beds. I looked at him. I touched his face and there was no doubt about it — he was dead.”
The haunted life of David Anthony Kennedy — troubled son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy — was over at age 28.
But a complex year-and-a-half-long investigation into his drug overdose death was just beginning, marking another sad chapter in both the saga of America’s most well-known political family and the annals of Palm Beach scandal.
Before it was finished, the media free-for-all involved lurid stories of cocaine, bellhops, an opera singer, a shadowy dealer named “Armando” and a funky bar called the Kenya Club. Famous Kennedys — from David’s mother Ethel to cousin Caroline to ailing grandmother Rose — were dragged into the spotlight.
The State Attorney’s Office found itself under siege by the mainstream press, which went to court repeatedly to get documents related to the case, as well as pesky tabloids, which were flashing money all over town and printing rumors as fast as they paid for them.
Kennedy’s life ended that spring day in 1984, from a mixture of cocaine and two prescription drugs: the painkiller Demerol and tranquilizer Mellaril. Narcotics experts said overuse of just one of the drugs was potentially lethal, but a cocktail mix of all three was a sure death.
What led to this privileged scion’s downfall?
Some traced its roots to the summer of 1968, when a young David was with his family at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He was watching television when he saw news footage of his father being shot downstairs after giving a victory speech in the California primary, another Kennedy cut down by an assassin’s bullet.
Friends said he was never the same again.
’A tormented, sensitive son’
David Kennedy didn’t come to Palm Beach on a whim. It was a gathering of the clan. Matriarch Rose Kennedy had suffered a stroke, and family members convened at the longtime Kennedy compound on the northern end of the island expecting the worst.
John F. Kennedy’s daughter, Caroline, was there. So was cousin Sydney Lawford McKelvy and David’s brother, Joseph Kennedy II, as well as his aunts, Jean Smith and Eunice Shriver.
Along with younger brother Douglas, David checked into a $150-a-day room at the Brazilian Court about five days before his death. He was carrying heavy emotional baggage that had taken years to accumulate.
After his death, The New York Times would describe him as a “tormented, sensitive son,” reporting that his father’s assassination in 1968 had “sent
him into a 15-year slide.”
A painful car crash in 1973 might have started his drug dependency, the paper said. Substance abuse problems followed when he entered Harvard, where he was an indifferent student.
But he also found time to party at Manhattan discos and live the glamorous life of a Kennedy. He even squired actress Rachel Ward (“The Thorn Birds,” “Against All Odds”), who told the Times that Kennedy had “a wonderful sense of humor and was always very merry.”
By 1976, though, he had dropped out of college, gone in and out of detox programs and was found beaten up in a Harlem drug “shooting gallery,” the Times reported. More stints in rehab followed, including one in Minnesota just before he arrived in Palm Beach.
A friend told the Times he was “a sick, sick young man” and that Kennedy suffered from continuing nightmares about his father’s death.
Looking to score ’stuff’
In Palm Beach, Kennedy’s demons became apparent. The then-owners of the Brazilian Court initially said Kennedy’s behavior was “within the bounds of a young gentleman on vacation.”
But a medical examiner’s report indicated that he was told to leave Rose Kennedy’s home a day before his death because he was “drunk or stoned.”
He was seen drinking at Palm Beach watering holes such as Chuck & Harold’s, Doherty’s and the Kenya Club bar, as well as the Raindancer restaurant on Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard in West Palm Beach.
Press reports at the time varied on whether his partying and clubbing was beyond the bounds of a young vacationer, with some saying he consumed numerous vodkas and others saying his intake was exaggerated in the media.
But according to witness statements, Kennedy was soon asking around the hotel for “stuff”: namely, a supply of cocaine.
Harriet Couch, who performed with a New York opera company, said she watched Kennedy pull out a packet of white powder and a straw after a night of drinking at the Kenya Club. And 1.3 grams of 70-percent pure cocaine were found in Kennedy’s hotel room after his death.
Two Brazilian Court bellhops, David Linwood Dorr, 31, of West Yarmouth, Mass., and Peter Andrew Marchant, 24, of Warwick, R.I., were eventually charged with providing cocaine to Kennedy. Trying to trace their source led to an intriguing bit of testimony from Derrick Evans, a Kennedy acquaintance.
When asked by investigators where the cocaine came from, Evans mentioned “this guy Armando, or whatever, a shady character who stayed in his house with the shades down all the time and only went out at night.” Armando, if he existed, was never found.
More than a year and a half after they were arrested, Dorr and Marchant both pleaded no contest to a single charge of conspiracy to sell cocaine. Another charge that could have led to significant jail time was dropped. They were each fined $200 and sentenced to 18 months’ probation.
Useless tips and conspiracy theories
While it took until December 1985 to close the books on the Kennedy death, The Palm Beach Post kept busy reporting on every tantalizing detail and conspiracy theory in the case.
For example:
•Drug traces were found in the toilet of Kennedy’s hotel room. Did somebody try to flush evidence before Kennedy’s body was found? Palm Beach police conducted a tampering investigation, but never charged anybody. Some speculated that Kennedy had injected Demerol via syringe and that the syringes were disposed of in the toilet. (Investigators also thought the Demerol was part of a vial missing from Rose Kennedy’s home.)
•A hotel employee claimed Caroline Kennedy could have entered David Kennedy’s hotel room before his body was found. She issued a statement emphatically denying she entered the room, and police said they found no evidence that she did.
•A man told local radio show host Jack Cole that Kennedy cousin Sydney Lawford McKelvy tampered with evidence at the death scene. Kennedy family attorneys called it “total hogwash.” And the man later admitted his statement was false, “the result of alcohol-induced speculation,” according to then-State Attorney David Bludworth.
•An informant for the FBI said that Kennedy might have been targeted for death by drug dealers because he was trying to score cocaine on credit and the cache of his name. The informant’s leads “didn’t provide any useful information,” a Palm Beach police detective said.
•Hotel secretary Elizabeth Barnett, who discovered the body (though others said it was a bellman or a maid), later wondered about the “very peculiar angle” of Kennedy’s body in the room. She speculated that he may have died elsewhere and was carried into the room. “I’ve had a lot of sleepless nights because something isn’t setting right,” she said.
•Tabloids, including the National Enquirer, were offering hotel workers from $500-$1,000 for inside stories about the Kennedy death. One bellman said he was offered $5 to reveal the color of Kennedy’s room. The bellman told the reporter it was pink, when it was really white.
•Police received lots of useless tips. One person thought Kennedy’s death was caused by “Communist infiltrators.” Another said the fatal overdose was done by hypnosis. Yet another said that Kennedy’s supplier was a “tall, but very skinny, very pale, hooked-nose man with acne scars.”
•Why did the hotel check on Kennedy in the first place? His mother Ethel frantically called that April morning, saying he didn’t show up as expected on a flight to Boston. When the hotel called her back to relay the terrible news, she blurted out, “He’s dead, isn’t he?” and hung up the phone.
•Rose Kennedy was never told about her grandson’s overdose, at least not at the time. And despite worries that she was in imminent danger of death, she lived another 10 years.
•Just a week after Kennedy’s death, the Brazilian Court closed and was sold to new owners. It did not reopen until the end of 1985. After a long series of ups and downs, it is now one of the island’s swank addresses, with a pedigree restaurant, Cafe Boulud, and a serious upgrade from its dowdier 1984 look.
No end to heartache and notoriety
As for bellhops Dorr and Marchant, they claimed they were innocent before and after accepting plea deals. Marchant agreed to spare his ailing father, according to his lawyer. Dorr said he just wanted to “end this nightmare.
“I feel in no way was I responsible for (Kennedy’s) death,” Dorr told the Associated Press. “I never bought cocaine in my life. I was aware there was coke in Palm Beach, but I stayed away from it.”
Their lawyers believed they would have never been charged if the last name of the victim hadn’t been Kennedy. Prosecutors freely admitted that they put more effort — and expense - into it for that reason.
In the end, Assistant State Attorney Pablo Perhacs said nobody was happy with the outcome. Some wanted the bellhops jailed. Others wondered why the mysterious supplier was never found and prosecuted. “I was caught in a no-win situation,” Perhacs said.
As for the Kennedy family, there is seemingly no end to the heartache and notoriety.
Seven years after David Kennedy’s death, William Kennedy Smith would be charged and acquitted of rape in a case that brought even more intense media coverage to Palm Beach.
And earlier this month, Saoirse Kennedy Hill, the granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, died of an alleged drug overdose. Newspapers reported that tragedy had now scarred a new Kennedy generation.
At age 22, Hill was six years younger than David Kennedy — the uncle she never knew.

Texto completo: html> It was dark in room 107 of the Brazilian Court. The blinds were down. A “Do Not Disturb” sign hung on the door.
An employee of the historic Palm Beach hotel knocked quietly. No answer. She used a pass key to enter the room that morning of April 25, 1984. She saw two beds, still made.
“Then, almost immediately, I saw David,” recalled hotel secretary Elizabeth Barnett. “He was on the floor, between the beds. I looked at him. I touched his face and there was no doubt about it — he was dead.”
The haunted life of David Anthony Kennedy — troubled son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy — was over at age 28.
But a complex year-and-a-half-long investigation into his drug overdose death was just beginning, marking another sad chapter in both the saga of America’s most well-known political family and the annals of Palm Beach scandal.
Before it was finished, the media free-for-all involved lurid stories of cocaine, bellhops, an opera singer, a shadowy dealer named “Armando” and a funky bar called the Kenya Club. Famous Kennedys — from David’s mother Ethel to cousin Caroline to ailing grandmother Rose — were dragged into the spotlight.
The State Attorney’s Office found itself under siege by the mainstream press, which went to court repeatedly to get documents related to the case, as well as pesky tabloids, which were flashing money all over town and printing rumors as fast as they paid for them.
Kennedy’s life ended that spring day in 1984, from a mixture of cocaine and two prescription drugs: the painkiller Demerol and tranquilizer Mellaril. Narcotics experts said overuse of just one of the drugs was potentially lethal, but a cocktail mix of all three was a sure death.
What led to this privileged scion’s downfall?
Some traced its roots to the summer of 1968, when a young David was with his family at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He was watching television when he saw news footage of his father being shot downstairs after giving a victory speech in the California primary, another Kennedy cut down by an assassin’s bullet.
Friends said he was never the same again.
’A tormented, sensitive son’
David Kennedy didn’t come to Palm Beach on a whim. It was a gathering of the clan. Matriarch Rose Kennedy had suffered a stroke, and family members convened at the longtime Kennedy compound on the northern end of the island expecting the worst.
John F. Kennedy’s daughter, Caroline, was there. So was cousin Sydney Lawford McKelvy and David’s brother, Joseph Kennedy II, as well as his aunts, Jean Smith and Eunice Shriver.
Along with younger brother Douglas, David checked into a $150-a-day room at the Brazilian Court about five days before his death. He was carrying heavy emotional baggage that had taken years to accumulate.
After his death, The New York Times would describe him as a “tormented, sensitive son,” reporting that his father’s assassination in 1968 had “sent
him into a 15-year slide.”
A painful car crash in 1973 might have started his drug dependency, the paper said. Substance abuse problems followed when he entered Harvard, where he was an indifferent student.
But he also found time to party at Manhattan discos and live the glamorous life of a Kennedy. He even squired actress Rachel Ward (“The Thorn Birds,” “Against All Odds”), who told the Times that Kennedy had “a wonderful sense of humor and was always very merry.”
By 1976, though, he had dropped out of college, gone in and out of detox programs and was found beaten up in a Harlem drug “shooting gallery,” the Times reported. More stints in rehab followed, including one in Minnesota just before he arrived in Palm Beach.
A friend told the Times he was “a sick, sick young man” and that Kennedy suffered from continuing nightmares about his father’s death.
Looking to score ’stuff’
In Palm Beach, Kennedy’s demons became apparent. The then-owners of the Brazilian Court initially said Kennedy’s behavior was “within the bounds of a young gentleman on vacation.”
But a medical examiner’s report indicated that he was told to leave Rose Kennedy’s home a day before his death because he was “drunk or stoned.”
He was seen drinking at Palm Beach watering holes such as Chuck & Harold’s, Doherty’s and the Kenya Club bar, as well as the Raindancer restaurant on Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard in West Palm Beach.
Press reports at the time varied on whether his partying and clubbing was beyond the bounds of a young vacationer, with some saying he consumed numerous vodkas and others saying his intake was exaggerated in the media.
But according to witness statements, Kennedy was soon asking around the hotel for “stuff”: namely, a supply of cocaine.
Harriet Couch, who performed with a New York opera company, said she watched Kennedy pull out a packet of white powder and a straw after a night of drinking at the Kenya Club. And 1.3 grams of 70-percent pure cocaine were found in Kennedy’s hotel room after his death.
Two Brazilian Court bellhops, David Linwood Dorr, 31, of West Yarmouth, Mass., and Peter Andrew Marchant, 24, of Warwick, R.I., were eventually charged with providing cocaine to Kennedy. Trying to trace their source led to an intriguing bit of testimony from Derrick Evans, a Kennedy acquaintance.
When asked by investigators where the cocaine came from, Evans mentioned “this guy Armando, or whatever, a shady character who stayed in his house with the shades down all the time and only went out at night.” Armando, if he existed, was never found.
More than a year and a half after they were arrested, Dorr and Marchant both pleaded no contest to a single charge of conspiracy to sell cocaine. Another charge that could have led to significant jail time was dropped. They were each fined $200 and sentenced to 18 months’ probation.
Useless tips and conspiracy theories
While it took until December 1985 to close the books on the Kennedy death, The Palm Beach Post kept busy reporting on every tantalizing detail and conspiracy theory in the case.
For example:
•Drug traces were found in the toilet of Kennedy’s hotel room. Did somebody try to flush evidence before Kennedy’s body was found? Palm Beach police conducted a tampering investigation, but never charged anybody. Some speculated that Kennedy had injected Demerol via syringe and that the syringes were disposed of in the toilet. (Investigators also thought the Demerol was part of a vial missing from Rose Kennedy’s home.)
•A hotel employee claimed Caroline Kennedy could have entered David Kennedy’s hotel room before his body was found. She issued a statement emphatically denying she entered the room, and police said they found no evidence that she did.
•A man told local radio show host Jack Cole that Kennedy cousin Sydney Lawford McKelvy tampered with evidence at the death scene. Kennedy family attorneys called it “total hogwash.” And the man later admitted his statement was false, “the result of alcohol-induced speculation,” according to then-State Attorney David Bludworth.
•An informant for the FBI said that Kennedy might have been targeted for death by drug dealers because he was trying to score cocaine on credit and the cache of his name. The informant’s leads “didn’t provide any useful information,” a Palm Beach police detective said.
•Hotel secretary Elizabeth Barnett, who discovered the body (though others said it was a bellman or a maid), later wondered about the “very peculiar angle” of Kennedy’s body in the room. She speculated that he may have died elsewhere and was carried into the room. “I’ve had a lot of sleepless nights because something isn’t setting right,” she said.
•Tabloids, including the National Enquirer, were offering hotel workers from $500-$1,000 for inside stories about the Kennedy death. One bellman said he was offered $5 to reveal the color of Kennedy’s room. The bellman told the reporter it was pink, when it was really white.
•Police received lots of useless tips. One person thought Kennedy’s death was caused by “Communist infiltrators.” Another said the fatal overdose was done by hypnosis. Yet another said that Kennedy’s supplier was a “tall, but very skinny, very pale, hooked-nose man with acne scars.”
•Why did the hotel check on Kennedy in the first place? His mother Ethel frantically called that April morning, saying he didn’t show up as expected on a flight to Boston. When the hotel called her back to relay the terrible news, she blurted out, “He’s dead, isn’t he?” and hung up the phone.
•Rose Kennedy was never told about her grandson’s overdose, at least not at the time. And despite worries that she was in imminent danger of death, she lived another 10 years.
•Just a week after Kennedy’s death, the Brazilian Court closed and was sold to new owners. It did not reopen until the end of 1985.

Texto completo: We won't be hearing from Meghan McCain on social media for a while.
McCain, the daughter of the late Sen. John McCain, tweeted Saturday that she's taking a break from social media starting on Aug. 25 — the anniversary of John McCain's death at 81 — and Aug. 29, his birthday.
It's probably not a bad idea.
"Last year tomorrow, August 25th was the worst day of my life," Meghan McCain tweeted Saturday morning. "I lost my hero. I miss my father every single day, I will for the rest of my life. Grief is omnipresent and relentless. For every single person who has sent prayers, love & support to my family, we are truly grateful."
It's been a tough year for McCain, a co-host on ABC's "The View." She has struggled publicly with her grief after the death of her father. She also revealed in a column in the New York Times that she had a miscarriage. She's also been the source of a lot of scrutiny — often on social media — for her outspoken views.
"On this anniversary until his birthday after the 29th I am going to take a break from social media," she tweeted. "The memory of my father's life continues to guide me today, as it always will. Remember to cherish your loved ones. I still can't believe my heart didn't stop when yours did, Dad."
McCain is active on social media, particularly Twitter and Instagram. Her posts typically generate a lot of response — not all of it positive.
That's part of social media, of course. McCain, 34, doubtless knows this.
She clearly understands the platforms and how they work, so sitting out the next few days makes a certain amount of sense.
And it'll be interesting to see what she posts when she returns.

Here's how to keep your back-to-school budget under control

Texto completo: I remember as I was growing up, I always thought school was free. I mean, I understood that private school costs money, but I went to public school, and I didn't think a whole lot about the expenses associated with it.
Now that I'm older, I realize how much parents actually spend on their kids when they go back to school. In fact, the National Retail Federation reports parents plan to spend $696 on back-to-school supplies this year. Isn't that crazy?
There are the obvious school supplies like notebooks, markers (my favorite!), and backpacks. And as a kid, I always needed new clothes and shoes. But there's not-so-obvious ones that nickel-and-dime you to death.
One of my coworkers told me that he had to buy football gear for his son that totaled $260. Understandably, it gave him a bit of sticker shock. There's nothing wrong with paying for this kind of thing if you have the money, but you still need to have a plan for how you're going to pay for it.
As the school year is gearing back up, it's important to make a list of things you need to budget for. So, think about these categories and come up with a dollar amount you plan to spend in each one:
School supplies; Uniforms; Sports equipment; Fall clothes and shoes; Meal plans; Fees for clubs, sports, band, and other extracurricular activities
I'd like to point out this is a great time of year to teach your kids that money isn't infinite. Teach them the value of working within a budget! They don't need the trendy name-brand shoes, or the flashy notebook that costs more. You're setting your kids up to win when they understand money can – and often does – run out.
Now, if you've already busted budget:
Get your budget back on track. Where can you cut back this month to make up for the overspending? Is there anything lying around the house you can sell? Can you pick up some extra hours at work?
Plan for future school expenses. Once school is back in session, there will be other costs that come up. School pictures, yearbooks, field trips and more extracurricular activities are just around the corner. And now you know how to get ahead of them.
I know paying for all these school expenses can feel overwhelming, but if you plan ahead and pay with cash, you'll feel a lot better when September rolls around.

1. Make lists. 2. Read Lists. 3. Make more lists.

Texto completo: "I blame David Letterman for this. His Top 10 lists were delicious late-night snacks."
Here are my five favorite things about this sentence: (1) It grabs your attention, (2) It keeps you guessing, (3) It's not overly wordy, (4) It's something you might forward to friends, (5) It's part of the list-making trend that just keeps growing.
The New York Times sent subscribers an email on Aug. 11 promoting "12 new books our editors liked" and "10 best new recipes." There was also a report on "the 50 best TV shows on Netflix right now." 50! That's quite a list. I expect a follow-up in which editors select "the 10 best TV shows on our list of Netflix's 50 best TV shows."
The very same day:
The Boston Globe continued its obsession with sports lists: "Eight takeaways from the Patriots' time in Michigan."
The Washington Post offered, "Eight non-culinary tools you can use in the kitchen." (Spoiler: one is a blow torch.)
The Chicago Tribune: "10 summer care tips for curly hair." Parade magazine: "20 songs Joni Mitchell Wrote About Men."
So, yes, it seems we're all drawn to lists. And, clearly, editors have figured that out.
The Internet's clickosphere contributes to it. Just Google "Top 10 Lists" and you'll be amazed. A few of my favorites: "Top 10 Researchers Who Experimented on Themselves" and "10 People Who Gained Genius from Brain Damage."
I blame David Letterman for this. His Top 10 lists were delicious late-night snacks, with entries such as: "Top 10 Things That Sound Cool When Said by Snoop Dogg."
Of course, Dave is now off in semi-retirement, trying desperately to come up with a list of 10 good reasons not to shave his beard, and undoubtedly laughing over the fact that editors can't resist his fun-with-lists gimmick.
There's an actual Wikipedia section titled "List of lists of lists." How detailed is it? It includes "List of Tamil films of the 1940s" and "Lists of 'Dungeons & Dragons' monsters."
Buzzfeed has popularized the term "listicle," which is any article in the form of a list — and Buzzfeed's listicles get millions of views!
So, my Top Five reasons for writing this: (5) I will presumably be paid, (4) It required little thinking, (3) It's summer, after all, (2) Readers love lists, and (1) It serves to remind us that lists, while sometimes engaging, should never be confused with actual writing.

Texto completo: Remember the controversy in 2012 when President Barack Obama said, "If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."
In context, the president was trying to make the point that in addition to our own hard work, others contributed to whatever level of success we have attained. The president suggested no one achieves success on his or her own.
Republicans took his words as just another indicator that Democrats want more government control over our lives and businesses.
The New York Times appears to have endorsed Obama's view and gone a step further. The newspaper's executive editor, Dean Baquet, recently called a staff meeting to announce "The 1619 Project," named for the year the first African slaves were brought to Virginia. Someone recorded the session and leaked it to Slate, which published a transcript. The Washington Examiner reported on it.
"The goal of the 1619 Project," says a statement from the newspaper "is to reframe American history."
More like rewrite it.
This is the stuff of totalitarian regimes where the media serve as a propaganda organ for the state, in this case the surging left wing of the Democratic Party.
No more America beginning with the Declaration of Independence, The Federalist Papers and the Constitution. Africans had no say in these, though Jefferson's brilliant line about all of us being created equal would resound nearly a century later in a Civil War that led to the freeing of slaves and the long road to achieving Jefferson's noble statement.
Not satisfied with practicing what used to be called journalism, it appears the newspaper's ultimate goal is to change what is taught in public schools so that children will no longer think highly of their country because of the "stain" of slavery, a stain that has been more than paid for in blood and federal programs, which have attempted to lift some descendants of slaves out of poverty. In many cases those programs have failed, poverty having many causes, but liberals continue to promote them because it seemingly makes them feel better about themselves.
The Examiner's Byron York writes: "The basic thrust of the 1619 Project is that everything in American history is explained by slavery and race. The message is woven throughout the first publication of the project, an entire edition of the Times magazine."
One excerpt reveals their drift: "If you want to understand the brutality of American capitalism, you have to start on the plantation."
Never mind that "brutal" capitalism has lifted more boats than any other economic system.
There's much more. We are led to believe that America is evil, soulless, that those at the top have always exploited those at the bottom. There's appears to be advocacy for bigger government, reparations and never-ending guilt for things we today had nothing to do with. Is this what we want to impose on our children?
The New York Times, despite Donald Trump's criticism, carries influence with broadcast and cable networks like CNN and MSNBC, and these networks in turn can have a collective effect on the American psyche, particularly when there is no counterbalance.
No wonder private and home schools are growing at such a rapid pace. The National Home Education Research Institute projects that by next year the number of home schools will be 2.3 million, a major increase over recent years. According to the Department of Education, about 10 percent of children in grades K through 12 now attend private schools.
The Times' attempt to shape history to fit its own biases is not journalism. If public schools follow its lead, they will begin to resemble schools in countries where freedom is not the prevailing tenet and antithetical to what the Founders gave us. America's greatness eventually led to the freeing of slaves and a chance at a better life for their descendants.

CITY &amp; STATE; Newsom assails Trump's auto emissions policy; Governor calls president's decision to scuttle state's tough standards 'pathetic.'

Texto completo: Gov. Gavin Newsom has accused President Trump of trying to scuttle California's strict car emissions standards to help the oil industry, calling it a "pathetic" decision disguised as a way to assist automakers.
Newsom's comments this past week came less than a month after state officials worked to circumvent the Trump administration's efforts to relax tailpipe pollution regulations by reaching a deal with four major automakers to gradually strengthen fuel-efficiency standards.
"This was a big blow to the Trump administration, what we were able to accomplish, and I don't think they saw it coming," Newsom told reporters at a conservation summit at Lake Tahoe with leaders from California and Nevada. "This idea that they're helping the automobile manufacturers, that's just been blown up, a complete myth. It was made up."

The New York Times reported that after the announcement of the deal, a Trump advisor called officials from Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and General Motors to the White House to urge them to support the president's emissions policy.
Newsom criticized the president for trying to impose his will on private industry, saying it was a strong-arm tactic expected in "crackpot, Third World countries" and not the United States.
"This is pathetic, and it shows the weakness of the administration," Newsom said. "No one wants [Trump's mileage policy] except the oil companies. And what a sad, pathetic state of affairs that they're the ones calling the shots."
A White House official said the president's policy will save Americans money and make vehicles safer, adding that the White House attempted to work with California leaders when crafting a new policy, but that the state did not attempt to negotiate in good faith.
The voluntary deal between the California Air Resources Board and automakers Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW covers about a third of the new cars and sport utility vehicles sold in the U.S. Under the agreement, the four automakers agreed to produce cars that must reach a minimum of about 50 mpg by 2026.
Newsom also confirmed a New York Times report that Mercedes-Benz is about to join the agreement with California and said state officials are in discussions with another major automaker.
Newsom said it showed that automakers, which had supported relaxing emission standards just a few years ago, now realize that producing high-mileage cars was a necessity to keep pace with competing automobile manufacturers in China, India and across the globe.
The pact marks a major strategic victory for California in its fight with the Trump administration over tailpipe pollution and efforts to combat climate change.
The Trump administration's policy would freeze miles-per-gallon targets after 2020, a rollback that its own calculations show would increase daily gas consumption across the United States by about 500,000 barrels a day, worsening greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to the rise in global temperatures.
When Trump announced the rollback of mileage standards in 2017, he told workers at a vehicle testing facility outside Detroit that his administration was making "common-sense changes" and would lift up the American auto industry and its workers. "We are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs," Trump said.
Since Trump's election in 2016, California officials have filed more than 50 lawsuits over the administration's actions on a variety of issues, including more than two dozen challenges to policies proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of the Interior and other federal agencies responsible for setting energy and fuel-efficiency standards. Just last week, California joined a coalition of 21 other states suing to block the Trump administration's attempt to gut restrictions on coal-burning power plants.
"We're just in a completely unprecedented and different moment in our history, but will continue to fight back and punch above our weight and build partnerships and collaborations," Newsom said.
Newsom was the keynote speaker at Tuesday's Lake Tahoe Summit, an annual event first held 23 years ago when leaders in California and Nevada became alarmed that the lake's water was clouding up.
The event was hosted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), and speakers included Nevada's Democratic governor, Steve Sisolak, and one of the state's two Democratic U.S. senators, Catherine Cortez Masto. Reps. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) and Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove) also spoke at the event.
Feinstein struck a bipartisan tone when she opened the summit, saying efforts to restore Lake Tahoe's once crystal-clear waters have been successful in recent years because Democrats and Republicans worked together.
In 2016, Feinstein and former Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) joined with their Senate counterparts in Nevada at the time, Democrat Harry Reid and Republican Dean Heller, in a successful effort to reauthorize the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, bringing $415 million over seven years to protect Lake Tahoe from pollutants and invasive species, as well as to help restore the health of the surrounding forests and reduce the risk of wildfire.
"It has to be bipartisan. It's not going to work if you fragment and you fight," Feinstein said. "People are now working together."

If Things Go Wrong, A Plan Will Help

Texto completo: Ten days into what would have been two months in South America, I broke my leg in two places. I was deep in Chile, a country whose language I didn't speak, and I'd just booked flights to Brazil and Easter Island. I could have panicked. Instead, I was just disappointed. After years of extended traveling, I had a system in place to handle emergencies. I was in a staggering amount of pain, in an embarrassed heap far from home and hostel, but I wasn't too worried.
You don't need to go overboard to be prepared for travel emergences. My advice is to plan for the obviously probable, and don't sweat the unlikely and improbable. Here's some precautionary steps I've found to be invaluable during my trips over the years.
Before You Go
Do a bit of research
How tolerant a country's residents are toward foreigners varies significantly from region to region, and of course, person to person. Some understanding of local cultural norms will go a long way in bridging any etiquette differences and assessing risks. Are shorts O.K.? Do you need to wear a head covering? Should you tip? A few minutes online before you leave will give you a much better idea of dos and don'ts. A good place to start is Travel.state.gov's Country Information.
Take a working phone
A prepared traveler has a mobile phone provider like Google Fi, Sprint or T-Mobile that works in other countries, or has obtained a local SIM card. The value in having a working phone overseas can't be overstated. The last thing you should be concerned about in a crisis is how much your phone bill is going to be. Or worse, figuring out how to get your phone working in an emergency. Regardless, download the local area to your Maps app, and download the local language pack on Google Translate. That will cover you for most of it, even if you don't have a signal.
Protect yourself online
Back up your photos and documents to the cloud, either Google Photos, iPhoto or any number of free and paid services available. (Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products has a guide.) A V.P.N., password manager and two-factor authorization on websites and apps that have this security will all make it harder to break into your accounts.
Buy travel insurance
Travel insurance has paid me back far more than I've paid into it. And it's cheap enough that I never travel without it. Just make sure you get receipts for everything. Those flights I booked before breaking my leg? I got all that money back thanks to travel insurance. However, when I got my camera gear stolen on a train in Italy I barely got anything thanks to high deductibles and low coverage costs. Oh, well. Your homeowners and health insurance might cover you for some things, but probably not.
Wirecutter also looks at travel insurance and recommends which ones worth buying.
During your journey
Find out the local emergency info
In some countries, 911 works outside the United States. In Europe and Central Asia it's usually 112. Britain and many former British Territories use 999. Google the country you're visiting plus "emergency number." Alternately, Wikipedia has a list, and the State Department has a PDF. There might not be an English-speaking person at the other end of the line, but it's a start.
Take a card
At the check-in desk, there's almost always a business card for the establishment. Take it and put it in your wallet or with your passport. Or both. Now you have a way to explain -- with or without speaking the local language -- to every cabbie in the area how to get back to where your stuff is. Worst case? Take a picture of the front of the hotel or hostel with the name.
Minimize risk
This one is easy: Don't put your wallet or passport in your back pocket. Secure a purse or backpack with a small lock. If you can get at your items easily, so can someone else.
When things go wrong
There are infinite possibilities of what could happen, but statistically they won't. Could you get hit by a meteorite in Luxembourg? Sure. Will you? No. For the most part, the same risks you take every day are the same ones that you will have abroad: Cars are dangerous, pickpockets like crowded areas and the like.
The most important thing to realize is that whatever has happened, it has happened there before and probably to locals as well. Unless you're in the middle of the desert or over an ice cap, hospitals, clinics and police are there to help.

Hong Kong protesters, calling for direct elections, join hands across city

Texto completo: Hong Kong • Hong Kong residents Friday night formed human chains across large parts of the city in a call for direct elections, a test of the continuing strength of the months-long protest movement and a display that recalled a major anti-Soviet demonstration 30 years ago.
Participants fanned out across three routes over densely populated sections of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. Organizers said on Saturday that more than 210,000 people had participated, covering a total of about 35 miles.
The plans developed online after a march Sunday drew hundreds of thousands who demonstrated in the rain, a sign that protesters had not been dissuaded by a police ban or warnings from the Chinese government.
Participants on Friday sang protest songs and chanted slogans. While many joined hands, others held up their cellphones to illuminate the lines of people. Several held signs with flags of foreign nations and the phrase, “Thank you for supporting freedom and democracy!”
They lined up along Victoria Harbor and on Lion Rock, the peak that overlooks the Kowloon Peninsula. They stood amid apartment towers and on busy shopping streets, beside drinkers spilling out of bars and office workers heading home.
“I want to deliver a message to the world that we are peaceful,” said Lee Kin, 29, an insurance company employee who joined the chain in the Wanchai neighborhood on Hong Kong Island. “Even though I support fighting violently against the Chinese Communist Party, if we can demonstrate peacefully, we can get more support from the rest of the world.”
The event followed a variety of protest efforts, including marches, petitions, advertisements in international publications and walkways filled with art, as well as more confrontational actions such as defacing government buildings, clashing with the police and blocking roadways and trains.
Paul Au, 62, the owner of a record store, previously participated in several protest movements in Hong Kong, including after the deadly crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. None of those, he said, were as large as the demonstrations this summer.
“We have shown today that we are very peaceful, so let’s see what they can do to us,” Au said after joining protesters in the Sham Shui Po neighborhood.
Friday was the 30th anniversary of the 1989 Baltic Way protest, when up to 2 million residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania formed a chain to call for independence from the Soviet Union.

Texto completo: Northwell Health's chief executive officer is urging other leaders in the multibillion-dollar health care industry to take a stand against gun violence and urge legislative reforms to prevent mass shootings and firearm-related deaths.
"It's a major public health crisis," Michael Dowling said during a five-minute appearance on CNN Newsroom on Friday with anchor Brooke Baldwin. "We see the impact of violence and gun violence. We see it in the emergency rooms. We see the suffering, we see the pain. We see the distraught families, we see the blood."
The segment followed a letter he wrote that was printed as a full-page ad in the The New York Times and an opinion piece on cnn.com on Thursday, all of which invite leaders in the industry to support "sensible gun legislation," and call for better mental health services and universal background checks.
He advocated for preventing "the sale and access of firearms that serve no other purpose than to inflict mass casualties," in one text posted on cnn.com, where he also called for active-shooter drills.   
Dowling heads a Great Neck-based health care system that employs more than 70,000 employees and has 23 hospitals, 6,675 hospital and long-term care beds and more than 750 outpatient physician practices, according to his biography on the system's website. The system generates $12 billion in annual revenue.
Leaders in the $3.5 trillion health care industry, he said, can react in the wake of the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio - which took the lives of 31 people over two days this month -- by banding together to prevent another one.
"I think what we do is we raise our voices and try to get a coalition of health care leaders across the country to stand up and say this is a public health issue," he said. "This is about protecting the community. This is about leadership. This is about standing up and saying enough is enough."
Dowling said focusing on gun violence as a public health issue may start a healthy dialogue and avoid "the toxicity of the political environment we are in," he said in the CNN segment, adding, "It is about public health and health care leaders, we are the protectors of the public health and if we are not leading on this, then I would say 'Shame on us.' We are not meeting our leadership responsibilities by not doing so."

Texto completo: The hashtag #PrayForAmazonas was the top trending topic in the world on Twitter on Wednesday, as images of a rain forest on fire spread across the internet. Here's what we know so far about the fires raging in the Amazon.
How widespread are the fires in the Amazon?
The number of fires identified by satellite images in the Amazon so far this month is the highest since 2010, according to Brazil's National Institute of Space Research agency, which tracks deforestation and forest fires using satellite images.
The number of fires identified by the agency in the Amazon region so far this year, 40,341, is about 35 percent higher than the average for the first eight months of each year since 2010.
The decade before that included several years in which the number of fires identified during the first eight months was far higher.

How did the fires start?
Natural fires in the Amazon are rare, and the majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year's crops and pasture.
Much of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use.
How unusual are the fires? How dangerous are they to the rain forest?
INPE's figures represent a 79 percent increase in fires from the same period in 2018. There have been large numbers of fires in other recent years as well: According to a manager of Global Forest Watch, the number of fires in the Amazon this year is roughly comparable to 2016.
Deforestation more broadly is always a cause for concern. Last year, the world lost about 30 million acres of tree cover, including 8.9 million acres of primary rain forest, an area the size of Belgium, according to data from the University of Maryland.
The destruction of the Amazon rain forest in Brazil has increased rapidly since the nation's new far-right president took over and his government scaled back efforts to fight illegal logging, ranching and mining.
While campaigning for president last year, Mr. Bolsonaro declared that Brazil's vast protected lands were an obstacle to economic growth and promised to open them up to commercial exploitation.
Less than a year into his term, that is already happening.
Brazil's part of the Amazon lost more than 1,330 square miles of forest cover in the first half of 2019, a 39 percent increase over the same period last year, according to the government agency that tracks deforestation.
The Amazon is often referred to as Earth's "lungs," because its vast forests release oxygen and store carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that is a major cause of global warming. If enough rain forest is lost and can't be restored, the area will become savanna, which doesn't store as much carbon, meaning a reduction in the planet's "lung capacity."
[Read about the backlash against Brazil's environmental policies, which have paved the way for runaway deforestation of the Amazon.]
Did climate change cause these fires, and how will they affect climate change?
These fires were not caused by climate change. They were, by and large, set by humans. However, climate change can make fires worse. Fires can burn hotter and spread more quickly under warmer and drier conditions.
When it comes to the future of climate change, widespread fires contribute a dual negative effect. Trees are valuable because they can store carbon dioxide, and that storage capacity is lost when trees burn. Burning trees also pumps more carbon into the atmosphere.
How does deforestation work? Is this different?
Deforestation can be caused by natural factors, like insects or blight, or by humans. This is a typical case of human deforestation: Farmers cut down trees to plant or expand a farm, then burn the leavings to clear the ground.
Brazil had previously tried to portray itself as a leader in protecting the Amazon and fighting global warming. From 2004 to 2012, the country created new conservation areas, increased monitoring and took away government credits from rural producers who were caught razing protected areas. This brought deforestation to the lowest level since record-keeping began.
But as the economy plunged into a recession in 2014, the country became more reliant on the agricultural commodities it produces -- beef and soy, which are drivers of deforestation -- and on the powerful rural lobby. Land clearing, much of it illegal, began to tick upward again.
Are the fires the fault of President Jair Bolsonaro?
There is evidence that farmers feel more emboldened to burn land following the election of Mr. Bolsonaro.
A New York Times analysis of public records found that enforcement actions intended to discourage illegal deforestation, such as fines or seizure of equipment, by Brazil's main environmental agency fell by 20 percent during the first six months of this year.
Mr. Bolsonaro blames nongovernmental organizations for the fires. He has cited no evidence, and environmental experts dispute the claim.

What is Brazil's government doing to fight the fires?
Some local governments have said they are shoring up their fire brigades. On Thursday, Mr. Bolsonaro said the Brazilian government lacked the resources to fight the fires, but on Friday he said he would direct the military to enforce environmental laws and to help contain the fires.

DON'T WEAPONIZE SCHOOL LUNCHES LUNCH SHAMING SHOULD BE A THING OF THE PAST, NO MATTER THE COST

Texto completo: I was working my way through the school lunch line with my elementary-aged daughter who was giddy with delight at the prospect of Mum's noon-time visit. It was a once-a-year perk from our neighborhood school, the occasion being the celebration of her birthday.
I can't remember the meal she and I were served. But I remember vividly the meal that was given to the little boy in front of me in the line.
Two pieces of bread, two slices of American cheese, an apple and a carton of milk.
It wasn't his meal of choice.
Like my daughter and me, he had collected the hot meal of the day (whatever it was) and had proceeded to the checkout where he was informed in hushed tones there was no money in his lunch account. His hot-meal tray was taken away and he was given the "alternative meal."
His eyes welled with tears.
I think I asked to pay for his hot lunch but, so profound was my shock at what had unfolded, I don't remember for certain if that's what I did or just what I wished I had done.
And while some memories fade with time, my mental image of this child's eyes brimming with tears - a memory from more than a decade ago - remains crystal clear.
...
There is actually a name for this school-endorsed slap-in-a-little-kid's-face.
It's called "lunch shaming."
Specifics vary from place to place across the country. But the overriding theme is this: Kids with empty lunch accounts or those who have run a deficit that exceeds a certain dollar amount are denied that day's hot lunch. (I haven't heard of any schools that send the kid away with nothing on his tray. Though who knows how many youngsters avoid the lunch line and the humiliation altogether and simply go hungry?) Some schools give an alternative meal - usually a cold sandwich, some milk, a fruit or some cut-up veggies. Others require that the kid work off his debt by cleaning up in the cafeteria.
I got to remembering my own encounter with lunch shaming when, a few weeks back, a school district in Luzerne County in northeastern Pennsylvania made headlines by sending letters to a few dozen parents of children whose lunch accounts were in arrears. The letters threatened to report the parents to the local child welfare agency for neglect, the premise being that the parents weren't providing food for their child. The specter of foster care placement loomed.
Are you kidding me?
The crisis was averted when a well-off businessman cleared the students' debt.
I started poking around on the internet and talking to some friends and I found out this is a "thing."
And while it's easy to cast the school district or the food service manager or the lunch ladies as the villains in this story, "easy" isn't "right." Unpaid lunches by students who do not qualify for free or reduced-price meals can add up to a significant deficit for lunch programs that are expected to be self-sustaining.
...
Curtistine Walker has been around long enough as food service manager for Pittsburgh Public Schools to recall some years back when the district's policy keyed on alternative meals for students who owed the district for their lunches. It's not an issue in PPS now because the district has so many children who qualify for free or reduced-price meals that the entire district can participate in a program that gives free lunches to everybody.
Still, Ms. Walker remembers keenly the situation she faced as the manager of the program. She told me that by March of each school year, in the elementary lunch program alone, the balance owed hovered around a quarter-million dollars. It was an amount that risked the financial stability of the entire program, she said.
And while Ms. Walker said she didn't like the idea of denying a hot lunch to any kid, she said no one was sent away hungry. "We wouldn't do that. But, unfortunately, a lot of parents counted on that. They gamed the system. They'd call me and tell me we could keep sending them bills but that they weren't going to pay because they knew we'd feed their child no matter what."
...
I rang up my school district a few days ago to talk about the lunch shaming I had witnessed back when. I was curious if that protocol remained in place today. Within a few minutes of my leaving a message, I got a callback from Seneca Valley district Superintendent Tracy Vitale who set things straight from the onset: That's not how things roll now.
Ms. Vitale, herself a parent, was downright passionate in her anathema for lunch shaming.
Describing herself as "hypersensitive" to the topic, she said she made it clear from her get-go as superintendent about a decade ago that "I don't ever want a kid to ever not have a hot meal in this district."
Alternative lunches? SV doesn't do them. "It's as simple as that," she said.
Are there kids with lunch accounts that run a deficit? Yes. But Ms. Vitale has solved that problem by creating a fund to cover those deficits. At the end of each year, any student leaving the district who has a balance owed to his family is asked if he or she is willing to donate it to cover the costs of those who have been unable to pay. "The answer is almost always yes," she said.
And if there is a deficit anyway, Ms. Vitale said she'd find a way. "We will not engage in lunch shaming. We're just not going to do it."
Why?
Ms. Vitale articulated two reasons and they follow, paraphrased:
1) If we want kids to do well in the classroom, they need to eat. And if they're too embarrassed to go through the lunch line, they may skip the meal.
2) Kids are kids, not adults. It's not their fault if their parents didn't pay the bill. And a lot of time it's not even the parents' fault. It could have been oversight. It could be a technical error on our end. There could have been a sudden change in the family's financial well-being.
Some people will argue that Seneca is in the luxurious position of having a comparatively low percentage of families that struggle. Of some 7,500 students district-wide, only about 17% of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals.
Ms. Vitale is unbending.
"This is an adult issue. Not a child issue. This is simple. This is just money. A district has to just figure it out."
She believes the U.S. should follow the lead of some European countries that provide free meals to students. But, short of that, Ms. Vitale said she'd all but make a deal with the devil to ensure that no child ever is lunch shamed or ever goes hungry. "I'd reach out to churches. I'd go to community groups. Whatever it takes," she said.
...
I sympathize with the food service managers tasked with balancing budgets and ensuring each kid gets a nutritious lunch every day.
But this I know:
Snatching a hot meal from a hungry kid and making him walk away from the lunch line with an "alternative" risks unforgettable humiliation and amounts to school-sanctioned bullying. A child is not responsible for paying his family's bills. A child needs to eat. The sins of the father should not be visited on the son.
In sum, school lunches shouldn't be weaponized.

Texto completo: DARIEN — Scott Hapgood says he and the angry Anguilla natives he encountered when he appeared in court this week share the same goal.
“We all want the same thing: justice,” Hapgood said in a statement.
Hapgood, 44, has been charged with manslaughter in the death of 27-year-old Kenny Mitchel. Hapgood, a Darien resident who is on leave from his job as a UBS trader, has been accused of killing the hotel worker in April during a violent struggle while on vacation with his family in the Caribbean.
Hapgood’s attorney, Juliya Arbisman, of Amsterdam & Partners LLP, said Anguilla police have warned of potential threats of violence as her client has returned to the island several times in the past week for court appearances.
Hapgood, who spoke publicly for the first time on Tuesday, released a statement after making a brief court appearance Thursday in Anguilla.
“I am grateful for the opportunity to appear in Anguillan courts today because every court appearance means we are one step closer to putting this nightmare behind us — a nightmare for my family but also for the people of Anguilla,” Hapgood said in the statement.
“We came to your beautiful island for a vacation, just like many thousands of others do each year. We came here because of how welcoming you all are. Unfortunately, my family and I were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and in an instant, a tragedy resulted that has changed our lives and yours forever.”
Marshal Mitchel, the half-brother of Kenny Mitchel, spoke to a group of reporters Thursday outside the Anguilla courthouse, saying the family wants justice.
“As long as he (gets) jail, justice is served,” Marshall Mitchel said, according to the New York Post. “He (Hapgood) had enough time to let go of my brother. He needs to understand he (took) a life.”
The Hapgood family has said the Darien man was defending himself and his young children — aged 14, 12 and 9 — after Mitchel came to their room to fix a bathroom sink. Hapgood contended the sink was never broken and no one called for someone to come to their room, but he trusted Mitchel because he was wearing a hotel uniform.
The family has accused Mitchel of pulling a knife, resulting in Hapgood “fighting for his life” and being bitten multiple times, including on the face.
A toxicology report released last week revealed Mitchel tested positive for cocaine, Delta-9 THC (the active substance in marijuana) and other drugs. The report also showed that Mitchel had a blood-alcohol content level of .181, which is more than double the legal limit in the United States and the United Kingdom, which is .08.
“The toxicology report confirms that Scott Hapgood had no choice but to defend himself and his children from the frenzied attack of a man under the influence of a dangerous combination of illegal drugs and alcohol,” Arbisman said Monday in a prepared statement.
Mitchel was also facing rape charges stemming from a March 25 incident with his former girlfriend and mother of their child, according to a New York Times report. The case was pending when he died.
However, the woman told the Times Mitchel did not rape her, and that the incident leading to his arrest was “a misunderstanding.”
Residents on the island were outraged Hapgood was permitted to return to Connecticut after Mitchel’s death. Hapgood was originally held at Her Majesty’s Prison in Anguilla when he was denied bail. But he was later released on bond after his attorney appealed to the High Court.
“I understand your anger,” Hapgood said to Anguilla residents in his statement released Thursday. “I’ve read the same false facts and untrue stories about what allegedly happened in that room on that fateful day in April. If I lived here and believed those stories, I’d be angry, too. But the stories you’ve read and heard are not what happened, and someday I will be able to tell the real story in a legal setting. The sooner that day comes, the better.”
According to a Facebook message to Hearst from the Royal Anguilla Police Force after the Thursday court date, “the matter has been adjourned for the 9th of September when the preliminary Inquiry will begin.”

Texto completo: An 1794 Lloyd Harbor home, listed for $2.075 million, was once home to "The Big Oak," a famous tree where Theodore Roosevelt is said to have frequently sat under while eating pie.
The famous  black oak tree, reported to be more than 500 years old when it came down in 2006 during Tropical Storm Ernesto, sat at the edge of a property next to the four-bedroom Colonial, formerly known as the Denton House. In 1918, the house was transformed into a tavern owned by the Sammis family that became a resting spot for the president after his sail, according to a story written by Noreen Castelli Sweeney in a 2012 issue of Lloyd Harbor Life.
"Legend has it," the story says, "that President Roosevelt often devoured large portions of Mrs. Sammis' seafood pie, while sitting under the 'sweeping canopy' of 'The Big Oak.'" 
The tree, hailed in a 1947 issue of the Long Islander as the largest black oak in the United States, was reported by The New York Times to be 90 feet tall with a tree circumference of 36 feet. 
"I love sitting on the old front porch and looking out at the water toward where the tree once was," says homeowner and listing agent Henriette Lacroze of Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty. 
With the home's unique history, Lacroze says updates were done to modernize the home while maintaining the tone of an antique farmhouse. 
The house still features a parlor with the original Dutch oven and wood-burning fireplace with a crane. On the mantle above is a painting of the house and oak tree alongside a sign that reads, "THE BIG BLACK OAK Circa 1450 Oldest Black Oak in North America."
The house, with five fireplaces, also includes formal living and dining rooms and an extended kitchen with stainless steel appliances and radiant heated floors. An office, once a greenhouse, still has the windows from its previous use, Lacroze says 
The four-car garage features an attached cottage that has a living room, kitchen, dining room, bedroom and bathroom. There's also a horse barn with stalls and a paddock, plus a putting green. 
The four-acre property, Lacroze says, is a combination of three lots that includes a waterside parcel across the street and the small corner lot where the oak tree once stood. The stump remains, still drawing the occasional visitor.
"It's a really special house," Lacroze says, "because it has so much local history."
Part of the wood from the big oak, the Times reported, was used in renovations of Lloyd Harbor's Village Hall, where a slice of the tree has also been preserved and displayed. 
The home was once owned by former Newsday publisher Ra

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The National Rifle Association's outside legal team was reportedly shaken up on Thursday, during what can only be described as a turbulent time for the gun rights lobbying group. Since the spring, the NRA’s president, chief lobbyist and several board members have also parted ways with the organization.
In the apparent next phase of a continuing civil war within the NRA, the country’s most powerful gun lobbying organization cut ties with outside attorney Charles Cooper, the New York Times and both Washington Post both reported. Additionally, another outside counsel, Michael Volklov resigned, the Post also reported citing NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. And the Times reported that a top in-house counsel resigned as well.
Cooper represented the NRA for the past three decades. He said in a statement provided to the Post: “At every turn, I have advised my client as to my best judgment of the steps that should be taken to advance and protect the best interest of the NRA itself. ” He also said he had "adhered to the highest standards of professionalism and loyalty. " And that his allegiance had been to the group itself “not to any individual officers or directors of the organization. ”
Earlier this year, the infighting within the organization burst into public view when Oliver North, then the NRA's president, was forced out after expressing concerns about the group's finances.
North was also reportedly involved in an effort to oust NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, who has been facing pressure to resign, including from deep-pocketed donors concerned about the ongoing strife, according to a July New York Times report.

More: Fourth NRA board of directors member resigns
Just before two recent mass shootings, three members of the NRA board resigned, citing concerns over irresponsible spending by the organization’s leaders. Additionally, Julie Golob, a professional sport shooter, wrote in a post published on her website that she will not be completing her full 3-year term and gave notice of her resignation from the organization's board to NRA President Carolyn Meadows earlier this month.
Two more board members' resignations were reported earlier this week, bringing to the total number of departures from the organization's board to seven, according to the Washington Post.
Previously undisclosed documents obtained by the New York Times reveal an effort by lawyers and top NRA officials to oust LaPierre who thus far has survived such challenges and continues to lead the NRA.
The ending of the organization's relationship with Cooper was first reported by the Times, and occurred as LaPierre has reportedly been working with another NRA outside counsel, William Brewer, to fend off allegations of financial mismanagement of the organization.
Chris Cox, a longtime lobbyist for the NRA, was also ousted in June, after allegedly attempting to accomplish LaPierre's removal from atop the group.
The NRA is also facing probes by the attorneys general in New York and the District of Columbia.
Despite also its recent internal turmoil, the NRA remains influential in the debate over gun control and Second Amendment rights in the U. S. Following two mass shootings earlier this month, LaPierre appeared this week to convince President Donald Trump to oppose new measures on background checks.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE FLAY LIST 10:30 p.m. on Food Network. The celebrity chef Bobby Flay and his daughter, Sophie Flay, bop around and sample New York City delicacies on this new show. The game of "The Flay List" is blending its food travel show setup with a dose of father-daughter bonding and teasing. Episodes center on the Flays each choosing a restaurant to share with the other, chomping and ribbing along the way. The first episode centers on tacos. Bobby brings his daughter to the Chelsea Market mainstay Los Tacos No. 1; Sophie brings her father to the hipster-chic Greenpoint, Brooklyn, restaurant Oxomoco. In between the two, they make time for desserts at L'Arte del Gelato. It looks like a good gig.
SAN ANDREAS (2015) 6:30 p.m. on TNT. "Hold on," Dwayne Johnson yells during one of many nail-biting moments in this disaster movie, "we gotta get over it before it crests!" The "it" is a giant tidal wave barreling toward the Golden Gate Bridge. The "we" is Johnson's character, a California rescue helicopter pilot named Ray, and Emma (Carla Gugino), his wife. Before the movie's devastating earthquakes hit California, the couple were on the brink of divorce. They team up in an effort to save their only living daughter, Blake (Alexandra Daddario), from death by natural disaster -- a mission given extra urgency by the warnings of a seismologist played by Paul Giamatti. "The dialogue (the script is by Carlton Cuse) consists mainly of variations on 'Hurry up!,' 'Get out of the way!,' 'Oh my god!' and, 'Let's go get our daughter,"' A.O. Scott noted in his review for The New York Times. "That's as it should be, of course. Eloquence is the first casualty of disaster, though the seismologist (encouraged by a journalist played by Archie Panjabi) does manage to issue a clear and cogent warning. And 'San Andreas,' for its part, delivers a perfectly sensible message: Listen to scientists."
What's Streaming
HAIL SATAN? (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The filmmaker Penny Lane turns her camera on the group that calls itself the Satanic Temple in this documentary, which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival this year. Diving deep without losing a sense of humor, the movie looks at some of the group's members, its role in the culture wars, and the history of American religion over the last hundred years or so. In his review for The Times, Ben Kenigsberg called the results "wry and illuminating."
MILES AHEAD (2015) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The life and music of Miles Davis are the subject of "Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool," a documentary that hits theaters this weekend. Those who want to pair that movie with a more impressionistic portrait of the artist can revisit this very nontraditional take, directed by and starring Don Cheadle. The film attempts to capture the musician's essence by taking a period of his life in the 1970s and injecting it with, among other imagined scenarios, an armed car chase.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
This spring, a group of editors sat in a white-walled conference room at The New York Times, throwing out ideas.
The 60th anniversary of the day that Hawaii became a state was coming up. The editors, part of a team that tells stories through The Times's vast photo archive in a project called Past Tense, wanted to highlight images from across America.
They also wanted to find an interesting way to tell the story.
If they ran a slide show, readers might lose interest after clicking through a few photographs. A long article with a running list of photos could lose readers well before they made it to Wyoming. They wanted it to be engaging.
The final idea, published this week, is a quiz that presents photos pulled from The Times's archives from all 50 states and invites readers to identify each location. The project would take several months to complete and involve more than 20 people from around the newsroom.
Each page of the quiz shows the photo alongside a question with clues, such as "A fleet of blimps rises over the Goodyear Airdock in this Midwestern state." If readers spend a long time on the page, another hint, like "The state is also the birthplace of seven U.S. presidents and home to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame," flies into frame. Once the quiz-taker makes a guess, a paragraph with information about the photo and state appears.
"I wanted this to be a moment where readers in every single state can have a look back at their own history," said Lauren Reddy, the audience director for special projects, who first suggested the quiz.
Ms. Reddy had the idea after looking over other projects from the Past Tense team, particularly one that showed sunbathers on a sandy "beach" in Battery Park City in New York that was actually a landfill.
"I loved those stories because they told me a bit about where I live and the city that I love," Ms. Reddy said, and she wanted readers in every state to have the same experience.
To create the quiz, 13 people searched through The Times's photo archive to select a single photo to represent each state.
The team divided the states among themselves, many choosing states they had connections to, and began searching for photos that weren't "too obvious," but that were unique to each state, said Alexandra DiFiglia, who is on the archival scanning team, a group of people who are digitizing The Times's archives.
They wanted each photo to capture something special about the state and have a visual "wow factor," Ms. DiFiglia said.
The group narrowed the photos down to a selection of 15 to 20 for each location before selecting a final image.
Each state comes with its own blurb, most of which were written by Jennifer Harlan, a reporter on the archival storytelling team. She was surprised by many of the tidbits she came across during her research.
The photos highlight an archaeological dig in the Plains, a Native American village where the Postal Service still delivers mail by mule and the largest cave system in the world.
"We're really trying to tell little mini stories about every state," Ms. Harlan said.
The quiz was designed to showcase "the breadth and depth" of The Times's archives, said Aliza Aufrichtig, a graphics editor who built the quiz.
She added fun flourishes to further engage the quiz-taker; for example, a right answer results in a burst of digital confetti in the shape of the state the photo is from.
At the end of the quiz, readers are able to look at all 50 images again and peruse the information in non-quiz form.
"I hope people get a view into the diversity of the states across the U.S., how geographically and architecturally varied the country is," Ms. Aufrichtig said.
"I think it really does just remind you how big the U.S. is."

President Trump’s deregulatory promise: John Stossel

Texto completo: President Donald Trump promised he’d get rid of bad rules.
“Remove the anchor dragging us down!” he said when campaigning for president. “We’re going to cancel every needless job-killing regulation!”
Trump was a developer, so he knew that the thicket of rules government imposes often makes it impossible to get things done.
But would he keep his deregulation promise? I was skeptical.
Republicans often talk deregulation but then add rules. People called President George W. Bush an “anti-regulator.” But once he was president, he hired 90,000 new regulators!
Trump has been different.
When he took office, he hired regulation skeptics. He told government agencies: Get rid of two regulations for every new one you add.
I think his anti-regulation attitude is why stock prices rose and unemployment dropped. Trump sent a message to business: Government will no longer try to crush you. Businesses then started hiring.
Of course, the media wasn’t happy. Reporters love regulation.
They call Trump’s moves “an attack on the environment” and on “workers’ health.” The New York Times ran the headline “Donald Trump Is Trying to Kill You!”
What the media don’t get is that regulations have unintended side effects that often outweigh the good they’re intended to do.
Cars built smaller to comply with President Obama’s rules that require doubling of gas mileage cause increased deaths because smaller cars provide less protection.
“Should the government tell you what kind of car to buy?” asks Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in my new video about Trump.
Norquist says that Trump has largely kept his deregulation promise, and that’s been great for America.
For example, Trump repealed the Obama-era plan to classify franchise businesses like McDonald’s as one single business. Why?
“The trial lawyers want to be able to sue all of McDonald’s, not just the local McDonald’s, if they spill coffee on themselves,” says Norquist. “And the labor unions want to unionize all McDonald’s, not just the one store. That would have been a disaster.”
Trump’s FCC repealed Obama’s “net neutrality” rule, which would have limited internet providers’ freedom to charge different prices.
Democrats and other regulation-lovers predicted repeal would mean that rich people would dominate the internet. Bernie Sanders even tweeted that repeal would mean “the end of the internet as we know it.”
Of course, none of those things happened. Or as Norquist puts it: “None of it! None of it!”
But some Obama regulations sounded so important.
Norquist laughs at that. “The names for these regulations are written by regulators. They’re advertisements for themselves.”
Of course, unlike advertisers, regulators don’t list side effects of their rules, which Norquist says should read: “May cause unemployment, may reduce wages, may raise the cost of energy, may make your car not drivable.”
Trump’s deregulation record would be better were he not so eager to add regulations, such as tariffs, at the same time.
“There is a challenge. Trump is a protectionist in many ways,” says Norquist, sadly. “Tariffs are taxes, and regulations on the border are regulations on consumers.”
So are Trump’s “buy American” rules.
“That sounds like a good idea, but it’s a dumb idea, and I wish he hadn’t done it,” says Norquist. “That is not deregulation. The good news is that the vast majority of the acts have been deregulatory and tremendously helpful.”
Recently, Trump announced, “We have cut 22 regulations for every new regulation!”
He exaggerated, as he often does. The real number is about five. But that’s still pretty good. Better than Ronald Reagan did.
I wish Trump would do more.
I wish he’d remove his tariffs and agricultural subsidies and kill the Export-Import Bank, drug prohibition and the onerous rules that encourage illegal immigration by making it almost impossible for foreigners to work here legally.
Keep your promise, President Trump! Repeal 22 regulations for every new one!
Nevertheless, so far, mostly good.
Every excessive rule repealed is a step in the right direction: toward freedom.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump slammed the Ford Motor Company on Wednesday for reaching an agreement with California to lower emission standards, even as his administration has sought to relax federal rules around pollution from cars.
"Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesn’t work as well, because execs don’t want to fight California regulators," Trump wrote in a tweet.
Trump's tweets follow a recent report in the New York Times that the White House was blindsided by an agreement between California and four large automakers and that the administration summoned companies to the White House to press them on the issue.
Last year, the Trump administration proposed freezing mile-per-gallon standards for cars and light trucks after the 2020 model year, saying it would keep prices lower for consumers and improve safety. Trump has also taken aim at California's more stringent standards, which the federal government historically allowed under a special exemption.
Trump has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Detroit, at once crediting his policies with helping to revive the auto industry while also blasting company officials when they announce autoworker layoffs. Trump got into a spat with General Motors last fall after the company announced layoffs and plant closures in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland.

Dungy writes children's book about adoption

Texto completo: CARMEL – Tony Dungy and his wife, Lauren, have been writing together for a long time.
For adults, they've written about marriage. For children, they've written about faith, courage and fair play, life lessons learned through the lens of children playing sports.
With their latest book, We Chose You, the Dungys got a chance to write about another subject that is near and dear to their hearts.
Adoption.
The Dungys, who were in the Indianapolis area last week to promote two recently-released children's books, have adopted eight children — the most recent child adopted from foster care this summer — a mission that started when they helped another coach go through the adoption process in Florida and realized the need for adoptive parents, particularly for African-American and biracial children.
By writing We Chose You, the couple wanted to share their passion for adoption with as many people as possible.
"We wanted to encourage adopted children to realize they're special and unique," Dungy said. "Wanted to encourage people who were thinking about possibly adopting and might have questions, let them know how awesome it could be that they could change a life."
With the blessing of their publishers, Harvest House, the Dungys set out to write the kind of story they didn't often see in children's books, the books they'd read to their kids at home.
"It seemed that there were a lot of adoption stories, but they used animals, and not children," Lauren said. "You want to read a story and see yourself, see something that is realistic."
The Dungys tried to write something real, something that an adopted child might have to go through, something drawn from the conversations they've had with their own children.
In the book, the main character, Calvin, finds out he's adopted and asks his parents to tell him what it means.
"One of the questions that many adoptive parents have is when, and how do you tell your child that he or she is adopted?" Lauren said. "Adoption should be a natural thing, it should be talked about at an early age. It's not a secret. We love you, and we chose you."
Dungy, whose post-coaching life has been filled with writing and activist, has spent a lot of time and energy trying to help kids in need of a home. Dungy's All Pro Dad Experience, an event brought back to Indianapolis in June by Colts coach Frank Reich and general manager Chris Ballard, partnered with the Indiana Department of Child Services to promote foster care and adoption.
Ballard has two adopted children of his own, and like Dungy, says he wasn't fully aware of the need for adoptive parents until his family was put in a position to adopt their own.
Dungy remembers hearing a lot about parents looking to adopt, about couples who could not have children and wanted to be able to have children of their own.
By partnering All Pro Dads with the Indiana DCS —and with similar organizations in other states — Dungy wants to let prospective parents know about the other side of the story.
"They don't always hear the side that there are a lot of children out there who are in need of a home, wanting to be adopted," Dungy said. "For a long time, I never heard that story, and I don't think we hear that enough."
Dungy, a New York Times bestselling author, is well-versed in the writing process, and Lauren, an early childhood education specialist, knows how kids learn. But it was still a challenge to learn to write for children. Along with We Chose You, the Dungys were in the Indianapolis area last week to promote Carson Chooses Forgiveness, the third book in their Team Dungy series of children's stories revolving around sports.
"We needed a lot of support," Lauren said. "You have a lot of ideas, and to condense it into a children's book and speak their language so they understand it and find it fun and engaging, but at the same time, you want to share important principles and truths."
The goal was not to write sports stories. Not at first. The Dungys wanted to provide life lessons to all children, and sports gave them the right framework.

A rich Delawarean tried to buy US senate seat

Texto completo: Caleb R. Layton, longtime Sussex County politician, in an obvious jab at T. Coleman du Pont's offer to build a highway from one end of Delaware to the other, declared in January 1917, "I, for one don't want any millionaire building highways for me ... A better patriotism, a better spirit, would be to put on our statute books a law to make everyman in Delaware pay his just share of the taxes. Then we will have boulevards galore."
According to the Philadelphia Evening Journal, Layton went on to say, "Many other improvements can be made in the state, and it will leave a sweeter taste in the mouth, for we will not be taking bones from a rich man's table."
Two decades earlier, Layton was an ally of millionaire John Edward Addicks, and the Sussex County politician had no qualms about taking "bones from a rich man's table."
Late in the 19th century, before electricity came into common use, cities were lit by natural gas; and John Edward Addicks monopolized the natural gas works in Wilmington and elsewhere, earning the nickname, "Gas" Addicks.
With little political experience, but armed with wads of cash and the scruples of an unregulated capitalist, Addicks launched a bid to become one of Delaware's two United States senators.
The New York Times noted: "He conceived the idea of buying a seat in what was and is in his eyes the finest club in the world. If he had then or has now any idea of entering the Senate as an actual legislator and deliberator, he has kept that idea secret."
In the late 19th century, anyone with a delinquent debt could be barred from voting. Poor residents of Sussex County were also discouraged from voting by a burdensome poll tax.
In addition, when some African-Americans attempted to pay the poll tax, the tax collector closed his office so that the tax could not be paid.
Addicks was no friend to Sussex County's African-American and poor white citizens; but he believed that he could use their desire to vote to his advantage.
As Addicks embarked on his quest to buy a Senate seat, he threw many bones from his rich table. He paid the delinquent debts for a host of voters to earn their support. Addicks paid the poll tax for many poor citizens of Sussex County and enabled many African-Americans to vote for the first time.
To insure that he got what he paid for, Addicks hired workers to "assist" his supporters in the voting booth. At that time, United States senators were elected by the state legislatures, and Addicks tossed his money bones to a number of politicians, including Georgetown's Dr. Caleb R. Layton.
Unlike Addicks, Layton was a consummate politician who held a number of offices in the Republican Party.
When Layton saw the wealthy businessman's growing support among Sussex County voters, the Georgetown politician became the chairman of the Addicks County Committee, the personal representative of Addicks in Sussex County, and a director of the Bay State Gas Company, for which Layton was paid an annual salary of $2,500 a year.
As a director for the gas company, Layton did little or no work, but he earned his salary drumming up support for Addicks.
Addicks' attempt to buy his way into the Senate United ended in failure. The millionaire and Layton had a falling out; and by 1917, Layton was smugly dismissive of the use of private money for public projects, such as the Du Pont Highway; but it was not so long ago that the Sussex politician was taking an annual $2,500 bone from the rich table of John Edward Addicks.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD DROPS OUT OF TITLE X: Planned Parenthood will be forgoing as much as $60 million annually from a federal family planning program that will carry new anti-abortion rules.
"Planned Parenthood is still open. We are continuing to fight this rule in court," said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president of the organization, said in a call with reporters Monday. She said the organization would do everything it could to make sure that clinics could stay open.
The Trump administration gave healthcare providers until midnight Monday to comply with a new rule that says organizations that accept federal family planning grants cannot directly provide patients with an abortion referral. Critics of the rule call it a "gag rule" because they say the government is forcing them to keep information from patients.
How the grants work. The grants, which amount in total to $286 million a year, come from what is known as the Title X program. They are used to pay for birth control, testing of sexually transmitted diseases, and cancer screenings for 4 million low-income adults and are not permitted to go toward abortions. Still, abortion foes and the Trump administration have said that the money is fungible and shouldn't be used to prop up abortion providers.
The Trump administration’s response. Shortly after Planned Parenthood publicly announced its decision, Mia Heck from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health said that organizations had the choice to accept the Title X grants already when they knew what the terms would be.
“Some grantees are now blaming the government for their own actions — having chosen to accept the grant while failing to comply with the regulations that accompany it — and they are abandoning their obligations to serve their patients under the program," she said.
What comes next. The case will head before a panel of judges on Sept. 23, which could again block the rules and allow Planned Parenthood to start receiving funding again. Planned Parenthood warned that without the Title X funding, people will be forced to wait longer for care and will have to drive further distances in certain parts of the U.S.
The Trump administration will also require abortion services to be housed in separate facilities from birth control and other services, but that requirement won't take effect until next year.

‘HOSPITAL COMPARE’ WEBSITE HEADED FOR A MAKEOVER: By 2021, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will make changes to the methodology behind the website, which allows patients to compare the quality of different hospitals. “CMS is empowering patients to make informed healthcare decisions, leading providers to compete on the basis of cost and quality,” CMS Administrator Seema Verma said in a statement. The agency is continuing to gather feedback on the exact changes it will implement and will put out a proposal next year.
TEEN SPEARHEADS A LEGAL ATTACK AGAINST VAPING GIANT JUUL LABS: Nineteen-year-old Christian Foss and attorneys filed suit against Juul for splashy ad campaigns that target minors and for concealing how much nicotine is in the vaping concentration in a Juul device. Foss said he has become fully addicted to nicotine having started using the device at 16, and he wants to represent all minors who have allegedly been misled by Juul’s advertising. The suit claims Juul violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, by taking a page out of cigarette makers’ playbook of using advertising to target kids.
IMMIGRATION-RIGHTS ATTORNEYS SUE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FOR DENYING MIGRANTS ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE: Several groups that advocate for immigrant rights are suing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security for denying migrants in detention centers medical and mental health services in 158 centers around the country. Attorneys at the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center, and Disability Rights Advocates brought the class-action suit on behalf of 15 immigrants who have experienced delays in getting care or negligence while in detention.
BRAND-NAME DRUG PRICES ARE STILL CLIMBING, BUT AT A SLOWER RATE: Since the start of 2019, drug prices have risen at a slower rate and not risen as often as they used to, according to an Associated Press analysis. The biggest companies increased their prices primarily in January, rather than the traditional three times per year. Still, there were 37 price increases for every decrease since January. “This rhetoric around drug prices may be starting to bend the curve, but we’re not getting to the point of actual decreases in the total cost of drugs,” Adrienne E. Faerber, who teaches health economics at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, told the AP.
KAMALA HARRIS IS UNEASY ABOUT SANDERS’ "MEDICARE FOR ALL" PLAN, A BILL SHE COSPONSORED: Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris said at a Sunday fundraiser in East Hampton, New York, she has “not been comfortable with Bernie’s plan.” Harris, the first cosponsor of Bernie Sanders’ proposal, has gone back and forth on healthcare policy since launching her campaign. First, she pledged to outlaw all private insurance plans. Now, she will allow private insurers to administer plans that are paid for by the government, in a way similar to how Medicare Advantage operates.
Sanders snapped back at Harris in a subtweet: After her Hamptons fundraiser, Sanders tweeted that he would never take money from billionaires in the Hamptons. But if he ever were to visit, he would tell those billionaires: “We must pass a Medicare for All system to guarantee affordable health care for all, not just for those who can afford it.” He didn’t directly address Harris in the tweet.
FDA APPROVES NEW MEDICATION TO TREAT A COMMON TYPE OF PNEUMONIA: The Food and Drug Administration approved Xenleta Monday to treat adults who contract pneumonia when not in the hospital. “This approval reinforces our ongoing commitment to address treatment of infectious diseases by facilitating the development of new antibiotics,” Dr. Ed Cox, director of FDA’s Office of Antimicrobial Products, said in a statement.
CONGRESSMAN ASKS NIMH WHEN THEY’LL PUT AN END TO PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS ON ANIMALS AHEAD OF TUESDAY’S PETA PROTEST: Democratic congressman Brendan Boyle on Monday asked the director of the National Institute of Mental Health when the agency will phase out animal testing for psychological illnesses. His letter to Director Joshua Gordon comes a day before the PETA protest at the National Institutes of Health’s BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group meeting. The protest will feature a person in a full mouse costume leading a demonstration against what PETA neuroscientist Dr. Katherine Roe calls “scientifically worthless experiments that torment mice and fail humans suffering from mental illness.”

Texto completo: Continuing a recent trend of major institutions and bodies of government re-evaluating their artistic acquisitions, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City is currently trying to determine definitively whether a number of antiquities it has gained ownership of in the last 30 years were obtained as the result of looting by Subhash Kapoor, a formerly-powerful alleged art smuggler. Kapoor, who is currently awaiting trial on smuggling charges in India, was charged in July with helming a multinational operation that trafficked thousands of stolen items over the years; items that were valued at more than $145 million cumulatively.
The official complaint filed this year by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office charges that Kapoor’s smuggling ring stole thousands of objects (Terracotta rattles, ceramic pots, sculptures of deities, etc.) from Afghanistan, Cambodia, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Thailand. Next, the complaint continues, Kapoor’s organization would forge documents that made these artifacts seem officially obtained and finally sell them to collectors, museums and independent art dealers. “As we have since learned of the multiple law enforcement actions, and in the spirit of our enhanced procedures over recent years, we are now seeking to identify additional provenance information,” the Met told the New York Times in a statement.

A cursory search of Kapoor’s name on the Met’s website indicates that the museum does indeed have a great deal of art donated by him in its possession, although most of it is not currently on display. One example: a stunning, late 19th or early 20th century painting entitled Krishna and Radha Standing on a Lotus is credited as a gift “of Subhash Kapoor, in memory of his parents, Smt Shashi Kanta and Shree Parshotam Ram Kapoor, 2008.”
It’s as yet unclear what the Met—or more precisely, CEO Max Hollein—will do with the acquisitions that can be potentially traced back to Kapoor, but it’s likely that the museum will follow in the footsteps of institutions like Christie’s and the Parisian Quai Branly museum and attempt to return the artwork to its place and owner of origin.

Texto completo: The 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first African slaves in Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America, has occasioned some somber reflection - and some contentious debate - on the history of slavery in America. Increasingly, the prevailing view among progressives, including Democratic presidential candidates such as Sen. Kamala Harris of California and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, is that the United States was founded on slavery and built on the backs of the enslaved. This perspective is also reflected in "The 1619 Project," a package of features in the latest issue of The New York Times Magazine exploring the way America was shaped by slavery's legacy.
Where many see an essential and belated reckoning, critics such as conservative pundit Erik Erickson see an insidious attempt to delegitimize America and destroy its foundations. Are these critics raising a valid point, or dismissing the black experience to preserve a comforting myth of the American founding as a lofty endeavor?
There is no question that Americans have often failed to grapple with terrible pages in our history. Generations learned whitewashed (as it were) versions of history that glossed over the brutalities of slavery and Jim Crow. But today, we risk replacing one mythology with another that demonizes America and its achievements.
Thus, the Times' "1619 Project" presents some fascinating and important material - but it also relies on contested, often dubious scholarship to argue that slavery was the cornerstone of the founding and that key features of American society today are shaped by slavery.
The introductory essay by Nikole Hannah-Jones tells the moving story of her father's devotion to an America that treated him as a second-class citizen. Hannah-Jones rightly asserts that the United States was "founded on both an ideal and a lie" - a declaration of liberty, equality and inalienable rights by men who denied all these to the enslaved humans in their midst. But she goes further to claim that protecting the institution of slavery was, in fact, "one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain."
While a few revisionist historians have made this argument, it is contradicted by vast evidence. Yes, antislavery sentiment was starting to brew in England at the time, but it was brewing even more in America, where the first abolitionist society was formed in Philadelphia in 1775, and it surged with the Revolutionary War. After independence was won, Northern states moved one after another to outlaw slavery, and all states except South Carolina banned the importation of slaves.
Jones makes an inspiring point when she says that blacks who demanded their freedom played a key role in forcing America to live up to its ideals. But her narrative also suggests that these ideals were not merely marred by hypocrisy but deliberately crafted as a cover for slavery's preservation. It's an approach that has caused some social media users to declare that honoring the founders is no different from honoring Hitler.
We live in a time when a resurgent far right more or less transparently questions the ideal of a multiracial democracy, claiming that America was founded as a nation for whites. Is it wise for progressives to play into their hands by essentially validating that narrative, or to make ordinary Americans feel that patriotism is being made politically incorrect?

'Trickle down' theory's broken premise

Texto completo: One of the biggest lies foisted on the American people is that as rich people get richer, we all benefit -- the so-called trickle-down theory.
For decades, working families have been told not to worry about the growing wealth gap between the nation's haves and have-nots. A rising tide lifts all boats, we've been told with encouraging smiles and pats on the back.
The magnitude of the deception borders on monstrous.

William Darity, a professor of public policy at Duke University, said it's "nonsensical" to think that greater wealth for the rich translates to improved fortunes for everyone else.
"Otherwise we would not have observed such an obscene increase in the degree of income inequality that has restored the magnitude of levels that existed on the eve of the Great Depression," he told me.
"I have not seen anyone make a serious claim for a trickle-down effect with respect to wealth."
Put simply, there is no empirical evidence -- none whatsoever -- that trickle-down economics delivers as promised, bringing more jobs, higher pay and better conditions to millions of people.
The reality is that as the rich get richer, the rich get richer, full stop. They buy more houses and cars and boats and stuff.
Yes, that has a positive impact on makers of luxury goods. But it's not in any way the shared prosperity implicit in the trickle-down pledge.
The latest indicator that things are terribly out of whack came in a report last week from the Economic Policy Institute, which found that compensation for American chief executives increased by 940% between 1978 to 2018, while pay for the average worker rose by a miserable 12% over the same 40-year period.
Average pay for CEOs of the 350 biggest U.S. companies hit $17.2 million last year, the researchers found. Put another way, compensation for CEOs is now 278 times greater than for ordinary workers. That's a stratospherically larger income gap than the 20-to-1 ratio in 1965.
"This escalation of CEO compensation, and of executive compensation more generally, has fueled the growth of top 1% and top 0.1% incomes, leaving less of the fruits of economic growth for ordinary workers and widening the gap between very high earners and the bottom 90%," the report concluded.
Much of the blame for the trickle-down lie goes to conservative economist Arthur Laffer, godfather of "supply-side" economics, a.k.a. "Reaganomics." He argued with an easy-to-understand graph -- the Laffer curve -- that as tax rates go down, government revenue goes up.
This, of course, is magical thinking. Yet it has served as the intellectual basis of virtually all Republican economic policies since the 1970s, and was the primary justification for the party's most recent tax cuts for wealthy corporations and individuals.
On Sunday, President Trump dismissed growing speculation about a recession by insisting his tax cuts, and the miracle of trickle-down prosperity, will keep the economy humming.
"Consumers are rich," he said. "I gave a tremendous tax cut and they're loaded up with money."
In fact, consumer sentiment fell this month to the lowest level of the year.
As for the tax cuts, the Treasury Department reported last week that the U.S. budget deficit soared by 27% to $867 billion over the first 10 months of the fiscal year.
That was due in no small part to Trump's tax cuts doing not what Laffer predicted but what all sensible economists said would happen: Government revenue fell off a cliff.
The deficit is projected to top $1 trillion for the entire fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The last time that happened was in the aftermath of the Great Recession.
On a smaller level, Republicans turned the state of Kansas into laboratory for trickle-down economics, with the goal being to prove conclusively that if you aggressively cut taxes, the economy will rev like a mighty engine.
What happened, needless to say, is that revenue shrank, the state's bond rating plummeted, and draconian cuts were made to schools and infrastructure. The Republican-controlled state Legislature finally rolled back the tax cuts in 2017 and started scrounging to close a $900-million budget shortfall.
"A healthy economy depends on a functioning government," said Owen Zidar, an associate professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.
"Not being able to finance a quality education system and other priorities can lead to lower economic performance when tax revenues are too low," he said. "At current tax rates, there's no credible evidence that tax cuts pay for themselves."
Economists say the wealth gap is now the greatest since the Gilded Age of the late 19th century, when the richest 10% owned roughly three-quarters of the nation's wealth, and the bottom 40% had virtually nothing.
It's currently estimated that the richest 200,000 families own about as much as the bottom 90% of households combined.
How do you fix that? Conservatives would say you should cut taxes so you'd get more money into the hands of more people.
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox News on Sunday this is what the Trump administration is considering.
"Let's let people keep more of what they earn," he said. "That's the supply side of the Laffer curve. We believe in that."
Belief is required because there's no evidence to support the idea.
What the evidence does show is that large-scale tax cuts lead to more debt, deficits, budget cuts and economic uncertainty as a greater share of financial resources is devoted to paying off interest on loans from our trading partners.
UC Berkeley's Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society has some smarter suggestions:
* Raise the minimum wage, which could help nearly 4.6 million people out of poverty.
* Expand the earned income tax credit, which could lift roughly 4.7 million children above the poverty line.
* Make the tax code more progressive, which is to say, have the tax burden fall more heavily on those who can afford it, particularly through a higher levy on capital gains.
That last proposal regarding progressivity is the most important. As the rich have accumulated a greater share of the nation's wealth, they've simultaneously succeeded in lowering their tax obligations.
From 1940 to 1980, the tax rate for the super-rich never dropped below 70%. For much of the 1950s, it was above 90% -- although, like today, most rich people used a variety of techniques to lower their tax bills, such as tax shelters and offshore accounts.
The top tax rate is now 37%. However, few if any billionaires pay even that much.
For example, Trump, while enjoying the life of a jet-setting businessman, claimed $1.17 billion in losses from 1985 to 1994, which allowed him to skip income taxes for eight of those 10 years, according to IRS tax transcripts obtained by the New York Times.
In June, Trump awarded trickle-down proponent Laffer the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
Trump praised Laffer's "brilliant theory," and said the value of trickle-down economics has been proved "over and over again."
It hasn't. Just the opposite.
Over and over again.

With Troop Buildup on Border, China Sends Stark Warning to Hong Kong

Texto completo: SHENZHEN, China -- The Shenzhen Bay Sports Center rises along the shore with the green hills of Hong Kong visible across the water. It normally bustles with a variety of youth sports programs and dance, art and language academies, including one that advertises a "Hong Kong Style Education."
In recent days, however, it has become a staging ground for olive-green military transports and armored personnel carriers that arrived on Aug. 11 and disgorged hundreds of security officers from the People's Armed Police, a Chinese paramilitary force, who are loudly running through daily exercises and drills.
By massing the troops within view of Hong Kong, the semiautonomous territory convulsed by protests, China's Communist Party is delivering a strong warning that the use of force remains an option for Beijing. It is also a stark reminder that military power remains a bedrock of the party's legitimacy.
"It's a credible threat," Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California, said. "The Chinese government does not want to leave any doubt that, if necessary, it will act."
China's leader, Xi Jinping, has governed with an increasingly iron fist, including over the military. The deployment does not appear to be the prelude to a military intervention in Hong Kong, but few analysts expressed doubt that China would act if Mr. Xi believed the country's sovereignty over the territory was jeopardized.
"How can he regard the Hong Kong movement as a pure democratic movement?" Tian Feilong, executive director of a research institute on Hong Kong policy in Beijing, said in an interview. Mr. Xi is likely to perceive the protests not just as a call for democracy in Hong Kong, but also as an effort to topple the Communist Party itself, he said. "He is very politically alert."
Mr. Xi's government, he said, has most likely completed preparations for an intervention but is holding off as long as the local authorities manage to keep the protests contained. That calculus could change, he and other analysts said, if the protests succeed in crippling the government or other institutions, like the courts, which will soon begin hearing the first cases of those arrested in the demonstrations. In what some observers see as a worrying sign, officials in Beijing have called the protesters' actions "close to terrorism."
The use of force, however, would be fraught with risks for Mr. Xi, who is already juggling economic headwinds and deteriorating relations with the United States under President Trump.
The country and the party are still haunted by the use of the People's Liberation Army to crush the Tiananmen Square protest movement 30 years ago this summer, which resulted in international isolation and sanctions. A military crackdown could spell the end of Hong Kong's role as an international financial center and the unique political formula under which Beijing grants the territory freedoms unseen on the mainland.
"The military solution would have many urgent and disruptive effects," said Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing. "It would be political suicide for the Communist Party of China and the 'one country, two systems' arrangement of Hong Kong."
More nationalistic voices have brushed aside such fretting, noting that China is a much stronger and diplomatically confident nation than the one that endured international opprobrium after the Tiananmen crackdown.
"The Hong Kong matter will not be a repeat of the political disturbance of 1989," Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper, wrote Friday in an editorial, referring to the year that military troops in Beijing crushed the Tiananmen protests. It said Beijing had not decided to use force to intervene in Hong Kong, but had the legal right to do so if needed.
"Washington will not be able to intimidate China by using the turmoil 30 years ago. China is much stronger and more mature, and its ability to manage complex situations has been greatly enhanced," the editorial said.
The deployment in Shenzhen was clearly meant to focus attention in Hong Kong and beyond. A white bridge that connects Shenzhen to Hong Kong is only two miles down the road.
The message was amplified by no less than Mr. Trump, who disclosed on Twitter that American intelligence agencies had spotted the Chinese troops massing at the border. "Everyone should be calm and safe!"
It remains to be seen how effective Beijing's posturing will be. The authorities have from the start misjudged the depth of the anger driving people into the streets. While the deployment and increasingly blunt warnings from officials have rattled nerves, they seem to have had little impact on those who view the struggle as one crucial for preserving Hong Kong's freedoms.
The growing threats of military action came as violent clashes have escalated. Public anger on the mainland spiked last week when protesters at Hong Kong International Airport tied up and beat two men from China.
Three days after protesters defaced the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong with paint and graffiti on July 21, the chief spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense curtly noted that the People's Liberation Army had the authority to intervene in the territory, if requested, to keep order.
The law that details relations between Hong Kong and the army limits its role to external defense, but allows it to intervene, when sought by Hong Kong's leaders, to maintain public order or assist in cases of natural disasters.
The Hong Kong garrison of the People's Liberation Army is based in what was formerly the British military headquarters. The garrison includes 19 sites around the territory, but many of its soldiers -- estimates of the total vary from 6,000 to 10,000 -- live and train in bases across the border in Shenzhen.
"Those who want to stir up unrest should know that Hong Kong has a P.L.A. garrison," Han Dayuan, a law professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said during a government-organized news conference. "They should consider that for a moment when there is turmoil, there is also a need to resolve it quickly."
The deployment of the People's Armed Police, though, shows Beijing has options other than the army. The armed police force has a mission of maintaining internal security on the mainland, including responding to terrorist attacks, riots and rebellions.
It was founded in 1982 and has 1.5 million members, making it bigger than most militaries in the world. It has in recent years been deployed extensively in Xinjiang, where the government has harshly cracked down on what it views as the threat of Islamist extremism among Uighur Muslims.
As part of Mr. Xi's efforts to streamline the military command structure, a core part of his consolidation of power since 2012, the People's Armed Police was put last year under the leadership of civilian party authorities and the Central Military Commission, which he controls as its chairman.
Video of its deployment in Shenzhen appeared in China's state media within hours of the arrival of the vehicles at the stadium on Aug. 11. The reports said the troops there were taking part in a drill across all of Guangdong Province.
The troops at the stadium appear to have settled in on its grounds. Backpacks and other personal equipment could be seen neatly arrayed in the stadium's causeways, while officers milled about during breaks from drills, which could easily be heard, if not seen, from the streets around the stadium.
One officer, when asked, said the deployment was a summer training exercise.
There appeared to be little effort to disguise the activity. The People's Daily posted a video late Saturday showing the force in Shenzhen standing in formation and conducting mock clashes with protesters wielding sticks. One officer with a megaphone warned in Cantonese, the dialect spoken in Hong Kong: "Stop the violence, repent and be saved."
The exercises do not seem to have resonated in Hong Kong, suggesting that Beijing's messaging could be falling short.
For now, analysts said, officials in Beijing appear willing to watch and wait, continuing to offer support for Hong Kong's beleaguered leaders, to dangle carrots and sticks at business and cultural leaders, and to try to undermine public support for the protests. Giving in to the protesters' demands would be an unacceptable sign of weakness for them.
Mr. Wu, the analyst in Beijing, said the government's overriding goal now was "to prevent Hong Kong's movement from spreading to the Chinese mainland."
That effort at least appears to be succeeding here in Shenzhen, a factory town that kicked off China's remarkable economic transition 40 years ago and that now has aspirations of being a global high-tech hub.
Two rivers and Shenzhen Bay separate the city from Hong Kong. So does a heavily fortified border with passport and customs checks at six crossing points. There is also a cultural and political gulf that has barely narrowed since Hong Kong was returned to Chinese control in 1997.
Shenzhen does not feel like a city mobilized for military action. Several people, when asked, said they had heard little of the protests, or declined to discuss them.
Others expressed support for Hong Kong's police. Cathy Huang, who is 23 and works for an insurance company, said mainlanders attached "more importance to the police" than people in Hong Kong did.
"It is not that it cannot be solved by force," she said in a shopping center a short drive from one of the border crossings. Her view starkly contrasted with that of many of Hong Kong's protesters about excessive use of force, which has now become one of the complaints driving more protests.
"It depends on the attitude," she said. "To a certain extent, we would even support the police adopting slightly harsher measures."

Texto completo: A few years ago, I took a call at the nature center about a big snake in Tekakwitha Woods Forest Preserve. The caller was pretty rattled, and she wanted someone to "do something."
We naturalists are pretty used to snake calls. I calmly suggested, "It could be a fox snake. Not at all dangerous." As I began to launch into the benefits of native snakes, she interrupted. "No! It’s really big!"
One of our rangers had received a similar call and was already out looking for the suspect serpent. He spotted some kids clustered around a tree with mouths agape and easily homed in on the problem.
There, coiled on a branch, was a REALLY big snake. It was a four-foot ball python. The source of the exotic reptile could only be a pet owner who didn’t want it anymore.
Castoff critters are a local and a worldwide ecological problem. In the case of the Tekakwitha Woods python, no harm was done (that we know of). An animal control expert captured the snake, which was put up for adoption with a more responsible owner. But untold numbers of pets released in natural areas are not retrieved. Scads of them reproduce and wreak ecological and economic havoc.
Take Chance the Snapper, the headline-grabbing gator in Chicago who held media attention last July. An anonymous pet owner released it in Humboldt Park. A coldblooded creature, Chance would have little chance of survival in our brutal winter, but he could do significant damage to wildlife, people and property in the meantime.
Chance evaded capture for a week. Finally, the city of Chicago brought in the big guns, hiring a gator-trapper from Florida with a price-tag upward of $30,000.
Less ominous than an alligator or a python on the loose is the common goldfish. Yes, the tiny orange fish that you brought home from the pet store in a plastic bag can become a 10-pound monster in the wild.
"Goldfish are one of the world’s worst invasive aquatic species," according to an article in The New York Times. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources reported that goldfish are present in almost all waterways of Illinois.
What makes little Swimmy so pernicious in the wild? Goldfish are omnivorous and fecund — in other words, they’ll eat anything in their path and make tons of babies. They roil up the stream bed and muddy the waters for native species that need clear streams. They also carry diseases that are easily transmitted to native fish.
Other animals frequently let loose in natural areas are frogs, birds, and turtles. Lots of turtles. I once watched a woman release an unwanted red-eared slider in the salt marsh where I worked in the San Francisco Bay Area. I couldn’t stop her in time. This eastern, freshwater turtle wasn’t long for the world in the salt marsh.
The best turtle release story can be traced to Al Capone. The Chicago Tribune reported, "In November 1930, a ‘deluge’ of box turtles was ‘mysteriously let loose’ on South Michigan Avenue ... The owner of those turtles … was none other than Al Capone. Capone had attempted to cash in on the increasingly popular sport of turtle racing, hoping to feature it at his speak-easies. … The legendary mobster had an underling purchase 5,000 turtles in Oklahoma. When the venture didn’t pan out, a frustrated Capone had his henchmen dump the turtles, which was how 2,000 of them turned up on Michigan Avenue, and another 3,000 or so surfaced in Cicero."
Scarface’s motives aside, why do people release pets in the wild? Boredom, perhaps? Kids easily tire of sedentary pets. (Box turtles are famously unexciting.) Parents don’t want to clean or feed them. There’s also the expense. Keeping pets costs money, and resentment grows along with the dollars spent on the darn critter.
Like the turtle in the tank, a pet owner finds himself between a rock and a hard place. The animal’s gotta go, but what are the options? Euthanizing the pet seems barbaric and heartless. (And what would you tell the kids?) That leaves the Free Willy solution. Return the animal to the wild and watch it swim/fly/crawl into the sunset.
Hold on a minute. Releasing a pet may seem like a gesture of love, but, in reality, it’s cruel. It’s also illegal in natural areas. The wild is no ecological nirvana for an animal born and raised in captivity.
"The fallout can be catastrophic," according to a July 2019 National Geographic article. "If the animal doesn’t die as a result of predation, exposure, or starvation, it may find a mate, proliferate, and become an invasive species."
What’s the solution? Naturalist Pam Otto with the St. Charles Park District has solid advice.
"First and foremost, realize what you’re getting into before you ever bring the critter home," Otto says. "Budgies, goldfish and rabbits live upward of 10 years; snakes and salamanders over 20 years; turtles anywhere from 30 to 80-plus years, depending on species. Getting an animal when it’s young means you’re signing up for (a long) period of caretaking and responsibility. Instead of getting a hatchling snake, adopt one that’s 15 years old. It will still have 5 to 10 good years left. Boom! You’ve cut your time commitment in half."
If you must part with your pet, Otto says, "Rescue groups are an option. Besides the Chicago Herpetological Society, we’ve worked with Friends of Scales, Fur Angels and the Greater Chicago Caged Bird Club. These are all-volunteer organizations that house homeless pets in foster homes and adopt out via application."
Sometimes pet stores will take healthy, older pets as display animals, she added.
In our heart of hearts, most of us want to do right by the animal. Remember, most pets are not equipped to survive in the wild. Those that do become pests in no time. Say goodbye in a way that respects your pet and the natural environment.

John Coltrane, 'Blue World'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Last year we got "Both Directions at Once," an album culled from previously unheard studio recordings that John Coltrane made in 1963 with his classic quartet. On Sept. 27, Impulse! will release "Blue World," another collection of tracks that -- like the "Both Directions" material -- the group recorded in one day at Rudy Van Gelder's famed studio, and Coltrane never seems to have thought of much again. This time the year was 1964, and the group was making the soundtrack for a Canadian new-wave film, "Le Chat dans le Sac."
The first single available from "Blue World" is its title track: a modal, one-chord retrofit of the Harold Arlen-Johnny Mercer standard "Out of This World," which Coltrane retitled here, almost certainly for copyright reasons. (This was an independent session, conducted without the involvement of Impulse! or its executive, Bob Thiele, who typically produced Coltrane's albums during this period.)
Musically, the alterations Coltrane made to the piece were minimal: He slowed it down just a notch from the version he'd recorded in 1962, for the album "Coltrane," and removed a short passage in which the band dips into Arlen's original chord changes. That leaves us with a coolly swinging, mid-tempo groove in Coltrane-esque 6/4 time. Jimmy Garrison's bass sits high up in the mix, as if to emphasize the earth and salt of the world -- as much as its liquid blues. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
Rosalía and Ozuna, 'Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Almost no young musician working in pop music has more promise than Rosalía, the Spanish flamenco-trained singer with thrilling ideas about avant-garde pop. And while she explores those ideas in her own work, she is also collaborating widely with performers from a range of Spanish-language styles -- earlier this year, there was "Con Altura" with the reggaeton superstar J Balvin, and now she's released "Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi" with the post-genre singer Ozuna. The latest one is breezy and sweet, edgeless, barely testing either of them, vocally or emotionally. Songs of this sort threaten to render her supernatural talents merely ordinary, especially if accolades for operating at half-speed discourage her from going all in. Fingers crossed that doesn't happen. JON CARAMANICA
Normani, 'Motivation'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The track blends the cadences and bump of '90s R&B with the aesthetics of 2019's most rap-savvy pop singers -- it's no surprise Ariana Grande is a writing collaborator here; the video is a delightful showcase of the onetime Fifth Harmony member's arsenal of dance moves. (Jump to the 1:56 mark for an impressive piece of basketball-related choreography.) CARYN GANZ
Young Thug, 'Lil Baby'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
From the new Young Thug album, "So Much Fun," comes the zenlike "Lil Baby." At the beginning, he whispers, "Buy a pink Mercedes," and by the end, he's declaring, "This year I'm seeing $ 32 mil/Last year I popped 35,000 pills." CARAMANICA
G&D, 'Peace Peace'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Welcome to the world, son/Now run," Dudley Perkins announces over a wobbly, clicketyclack beat produced by Georgia Anne Muldrow, the other half of G&D (and his life partner). "Police got a gun/A fight night after night, day after day." It's bleak at the outset, but by the end of the track a sense of hope and vision has prevailed, thanks to the wry realness of Perkins's rapping and the sun-sprinkled buoyancy of Muldrow's voice. "Peace Peace" comes from "Black Love & War," G&D's just-released second album. RUSSONELLO
Vivian Girls, 'Something to Do'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The band Vivian Girls plays a blend of contrasting moods: soothing but urgent, blurry but crisp, throwback but current. They released three albums between 2008 and 2011 before an extended hiatus and "Something to Do" is a preview of a new LP due next month: heaps of surf fuzz sandwiching harmonies and quick but potent major/minor gear shifts. GANZ
JPEGMAFIA, 'Jesus Forgive Me, I am a Thot'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A deeply uncategorizable and potently memorable avant-rap excursion from the Baltimore rapper JPEGMAFIA, "Jesus Forgive Me, I am a Thot" changes frequencies every few seconds -- belligerent, desperate, coy, abrasive, pleading -- over a luscious and slow-moving quiet storm beat. CARAMANICA
Swae Lee, 'Sextasy'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This song is called "Sextasy" and contains the lyric "Let me save you like a refugee." That is all. CARAMANICA
Girl Talk and Young Nudy, 'No Problem'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
One of the great pleasures of 2019 hip-hop has been the vocal tone of Young Nudy -- it's somehow knowing and sinister and whimsical all at once. His album "Sli'merre" is one of the year's best rap releases, and on "No Problem" he's just as strong, an eerie storyteller with one eyebrow arched. CARAMANICA
George Garzone, Peter Erskine, Alan Pasqua and Darek Oles, 'Dedicated to Michael Brecker'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A highlight of the new three-disc live set from these four jazz veterans is this tender ballad, written by the tenor saxophonist George Garzone in memory of his friend Michael Brecker, who was among the most influential saxophonists of the Baby Boom generation. (He died in 2007.) Playing in wistful, powdery tones, Garzone gently lifts the quartet off the ground as Alan Pasqua's piano and Peter Erskine's cymbals surround him in a wash. They're filling the air, but somehow they only affirm the feeling of lightness and ascent. RUSSONELLO

In 1969, Harlem Had Its Own Woodstock

Texto completo: Woodstock was big and messy, thrilling and stirring -- and summed up finally by Jimi Hendrix, whose festival-closing set included his towering, take-a-knee reading of the national anthem. It was an admixture of disaffection and patriotism, bold as love and black as hell. But Hendrix was one of the few black musicians at an event that has become a cultural touchstone for white America.
A hundred miles to the south of that sprawling rural rock 'n' roll assembly, black folks were building their own musical commons. The Harlem Cultural Festival of that year, which would come to be known as "Black Woodstock," had, on its surface, little in common with the upstate hootenanny. Held in Harlem at Mount Morris (what is now Marcus Garvey) Park, it was a self-consciously urban affair, a concert series rather than a one-off, and already in its third year. Co-sponsored by the New York City Parks Department and Maxwell House, the General Foods subsidiary, that year's festival consisted of six free Sunday afternoon concerts held between June 29 and August 24. The total attendance was some 300,000 people strong.
With the Caribbean singer Tony Lawrence at its helm, the festival was a sustained, communal activity and cultural interaction where enterprising street vendors got what The New York Times referred to as their "legitimate hustle" on. A vibrant cross-section of city folk -- brothers in dashikis (like Jesse Jackson, who spoke at one of the concerts), young sisters in smart shifts and older ones in church hats, men in fedoras and well-pressed, button-up shirts -- all listened with a combination of focus and ease.
"The scale and the diversity of the audience" was a thing to behold, says Neal Ludevig, the curator and co-producer of this year's 50th anniversary "Black Woodstock" event.
Iterations of the Harlem Cultural Festival were held in 1967 and 1968, but the 1969 events were the apex. Atop the rocks and down in the grassy field, they were showing up to watch a roll call of black popular music luminaries move through tight sets covering beloved repertoires. This was Harlem's sonic playground, and it featured the likes of the gospel crossover sensation Edwin Hawkins, the blues icon B.B. King, the avant-garde jazz activists Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach, the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela, the groovy black pop ambassadors The 5th Dimension, the Motown up-and-comers Gladys Knight and the Pips and the youthful Stevie Wonder. The comic vets Moms Mabley and Pigmeat Markham supplied the standup relief. And the crowds responded -- looking on reverentially, dancing with one another around the edges of the park.
Photos from The Times's archive capture the reverberations of an event that was a casual thing of beauty, where black folks moved en masse through the streets and into the park, improvisationally responding to one another, forming circles of joy and conviviality and reveling in outdoor leisure.
One shot from the 1967 festival stands out for its crispness and arresting power. It features a girl -- donning high summertime attire, a sleeveless top and shorts, hair braided to the back -- hugging the railing to the stage, leaning in -- looking. She's watching something before her. Someone is holding her attention, maybe dazzling her imagination.
Excerpts from the TV producer Hal Tulchin's 40 hours of footage of the 1969 festival (which remain largely unseen) show a reverential crowd, keeping time with Nina Simone, the "High Priestess of Soul," as she opened her four-song set on Aug. 17 with a new single, "Revolution." It was a country-meets-Tin Pan Alley protest jam informing white folks that "The only way that we can stand in fact/Is when you get your foot off our back" -- bluntly capturing the sentiment of the moment. (Simone closed out her performance by reading the fiery poem "Are You Ready, Black People?" The Last Poets' David Nelson's spoken-word call-to-action, asking of the crowd, "Are you ready to smash white things, to burn buildings?")
Tensions had been running high in the city from spring into summer as the first anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination passed and 21 Black Panthers were indicted on charges of planning a bombing campaign across Manhattan to mark the occasion. The police even refused to provide security for the event, and the Panthers stepped in to fill the void.
The people showed up to a concert experience that thrived amid grief and persistent rage. Backed by a reform-minded Mayor John Lindsay, who'd built avenues of trust in Harlem by walking its streets on more than one occasion, the festival stood as a symbol of hope and everyday placemaking. Lindsay's belief that "We can lick the problems of the ghetto, if we care," morphed into the concert poster's slogan, "Do you care?" Lindsay was introduced as "the blue-eyed soul brother, " and the gospel great Mahalia Jackson -- who would join the newly solo vocal powerhouse Mavis Staples for a duet -- spoke confidently of his impending victory.
Those who turned out in Harlem bucked the malicious stereotype of "the black mob." They gathered peacefully with no incident -- conjuring an energy akin to that of their Bethel, N.Y., hippie brethren -- open and ready to ride the wave of a local black sound utopia. They were the living embodiment of Sly and the Family Stone's "everyday people." From 1972's Wattstax in Los Angeles to 1973's Soul at the Center events at Lincoln Center, from Diana Ross's heroic 1983 rain-soaked performance in Central Park to Dave Chappelle's 2004 rousing neo-soul-fights-neoliberal-gentrification Block Party, the idea of the large-scale African-American pop concert as community revival, sustenance, triumph and renewal is a recurring phenomenon.
The Harlem Cultural Festival was arguably one of the first of its kind to promote black pop as transformative urban event, as a site to be inhabited as well as a sound to be experienced, and the key to new neighborhood connections and collaborations. Observes Ludevig, there remains the "irreplaceable notion that you cannot replace the live experience ... there's something about being in a space and experiencing it firsthand ..." that is utterly singular and potentially restorative in the life of a community. For black folks, the added power and energy of coming together in a place where one could not only see, hear and feel blackness onstage but also participate in a marketplace of neighborhood business owners was its own form of sustainability.
Such a legacy lives on most notably in today's venerable and beloved Afropunk festival (which is not affiliated with the 50th anniversary Harlem Cultural Festival event). Now a global phenomenon in its 15th year, Afropunk's Brooklyn extravaganza began as "a social experiment," according to Matthew Morgan, one of the founders. To Morgan, the center of community "is a marketplace, a business, and a way for people to trade," which is why his concerts, like the Harlem event half a century ago, place so much emphasis on not just music but black business and "socio-economic empowerment."
It's a spirit as old school as peace and love. But here it's infused with Afrofuturist language and sensibilities of the now, a belief in the insurgent possibility of "the black hacker" who "disrupts the network," "codes the culture" and "erodes the grid erected as a cage," as Morgan puts it, all in the pursuit of vibrant new-world building.
Surely some of the seeds for such a movement were planted back in '69, particularly when Simone chose as her final song a felt and pointed rendition of another new number, one she'd written in honor of her dear friend, the playwright Lorraine Hansberry, who had died some four years earlier. A love letter to the next generation and a book of instruction, "To Be Young Gifted and Black" was the kind of anthem meant to reach that little girl in the crowd who was hanging on her every word. "Open your heart to what I mean," sang Simone. "We must begin to tell our young/There's a world waiting for you/Yours is the quest that's just begun." Out on the field, as she emphatically reminded the masses that "your soul's intact," the universe was wide open.

Texto completo: Second opinions
The New York Times' mission to transfer some of its most popular columns to the small screen continues with "Diagnosis," a new series in which writer Dr. Lisa Sanders uses crowdsourcing to help figure out medical cases that have even left doctors at the Mayo Clinic scratching their heads. It's "House" without the snark.
Now streaming on Netflix
The outsider
"This Is Patrick Swayze" spotlights some of the late actor's most celebrated films, including "Ghost" and "Dirty Dancing." But the documentary is just as interested in proving Swayze was even more macho in real life than he was on the screen, taking blows to the ribs during "Road House" fight scenes and jumping out of planes for "Point Break." Demi Moore and Minnesotan Kelly Lynch are among those still in awe.
8 p.m. Sun., Paramount Network
Up, up and away
Aisling Bea is the writer and star of "This Way Up," a brilliant new comedy about an English teacher who leans on sarcasm while recovering from a nervous breakdown. The best moments of this six-part gem come when Bea shares the screen with her on-screen sister, played by "Catastrophe" creator Sharon Horgan. Whether they're bickering about boyfriends or butchering the Cranberries' "Zombie," their love for each other shines through. So do the laughs.
Starts streaming Wed. on Hulu

Texto completo: EVERYTHING
IS COPY
Last summer I went on a couple of dates with a fellow runner who had, decades before, headed directly from high school to low-level employment at a big company. He learned on the job, mastered skills, made money and now spends his time on a range of hobbies.
As a university professor, I generally hang out with folks who have had plenty of schooling. Many of my students worked in the world before they decided to come back for a degree. But this man had zero interest in formal education. That made me wonder about the value of what I do.
In short, is a college degree worth it?
Like many of those who forego university, the guy had an autodidact's thirst for knowledge. He taught himself skills from baking bread to house restoration. He is more competent at many things than I am (though that's a low bar).
But he could not write a simple sentence. His emails and texts were so riddled with errors the messages were obscure. When he expressed himself in conversation, he said things that made no sense. Instead of deepening thoughts, he simply repeated himself.
He'd fallen for a number of trendy fads backed up by pseudo-science in poorly written audiobooks. When he talked about what he'd learned, I saw that he imbibed information with a wholly uncritical eye. He couldn't assess the credentials of authors or unmask bias. He didn't know how to weigh sources.
I asked myself if college would have been useful for him.
He seemed to have done just fine without a degree, at least financially. But when you learn on a job, you are a fed a party line. You must fall in or be left behind. If you start challenging the way things are done, you risk jeopardizing your future.
College is the opposite of that. You're taught to question, to come up with your own ideas and bolster them with evidence. You learn that everything - from history monographs to organic chemistry texts - is undergirded by an argument, either explicit or implicit. You are taught to ferret out foundations and test if they're solid.
What I found lacking in this man, and in others who haven't had the privilege of formal education (and, in truth, plenty who have) was that he didn't know how to think critically, hadn't read broadly and couldn't write a sentence to save his life.
Once someone experiences a degree of success, they're often reluctant to think about what they might still be missing. This guy was unaware of how much he didn't know.
In today's economy, a degree in creative writing, history, classical philology, art or philosophy can seem luxuriously frivolous, and, to some students and their worried parents, like a space-holder in the unemployment line.
Of course there's no guarantee that having a degree means that you've actually learned anything. Sometimes my worst students are the "good kids" who have learned to do everything they think the teacher wants in ways that show no real intellectual engagement. They've marched along like little soldiers, fighting for grades and never stopping to think.
On the other hand, my best students are often military vets who get out of the service with a work ethic that astounds me, show a rare ability to receive constructive criticism and often have a reflexive need to challenge received wisdom. They're no longer company men and women; they cherish the opportunity to express their views. It is a pleasure to have them in class, questioning me and everything we read.
The man I briefly dated and I were never going to be a good match. While I appreciated his enthusiasm, talking to him was like being around a teenager and brought out in me an unattractive condescension. Teens tend to be passionate. And often dead wrong. Their worlds can be small and narcissistically confined. It's fun to poke them, to watch them grapple with different ways of thinking, to witness their intellectual growth.
But in late middle age, brains are less plastic and egos more fragile. A man who never learned to read analytically, write fluently and think critically might be able to make money, but he won't be a good citizen. He won't be able to make informed decisions when faced with propaganda and alternative facts. And he's unlikely to hold anyone's romantic interest.
But there's something else you get when you go to a university: Exposure to people unlike you. Eli Saslow's 2018 book, "Rising Out of Hatred," shows how a kid named Derek Black started college as the face of young white nationalism - his godfather was David Duke - but on campus his first friend was a Peruvian immigrant. He was invited - and went - to Friday night Shabbat student dinners. He studied history. He changed.
After the 2016 election, Black renounced his former racist beliefs in a New York Times op-ed. No one had tried to indoctrinate him to some kind of "liberal agenda"; he was simply presented with people and ideas he'd never before encountered and had a chance, away from his family, to make up his own mind.
That's the value of college.

Texto completo: Gaining competitive advantage, better serving customers and standing out from the pack can feel just about as challenging as running a double marathon ... barefoot. The difficulties are exacerbated if we find ourselves in mature industries with deeply entrenched market leaders possessing the resources of a small country. How can we compete and win when facing such formidable opponents?
Take the shoe industry, for example. Going up against Goliaths like Nike, adidas and Reebok could seem like a suicide mission. But not to New York-based entrepreneurs Waqas Ali and Sidra Qasim, who recently launched Atoms (atoms.com), a shoe startup with a creative twist.
Atoms doesn't offer hundreds of different styles, boasts no celebrity endorsements and doesn't have a catchy tagline. Instead, it boldly entered the race by doing something small.
Realizing that shoes rarely fit perfectly and that we humans often have two different size feet, Atoms offers shoes by the quarter-size. After you select your color and inform the company of your usual size, they mail you six shoes in quarter-size increments. When the shoes arrive, choose the ones that fit best (each foot can be different) and the remaining four shoes are returned to Atoms. Shipping both ways is free, and the process is dead simple.
While Atoms' micro-innovation of quarter sizing doesn't have the same innovative impact of curing disease or inventing a new industry, the small-dose creativity is already leading to outsized results. Only three months into operations, the company is chalking up meaningful sales numbers, winning the hearts of customers and gaining extensive media coverage.
Too often, we feel like we can be innovative only if we change the world with an idea that creates a seismic shift. But when giant-magnitude breakthroughs feel out of reach, let's focus our creative energy on high frequency, tiny ideas. If everyone in our organizations becomes an everyday innovator, we can unlock the collective creativity of Mozart, DaVinci or Picasso. Instead of looking for the single, enormous idea, try scouting for the little ones.
Your own micro-innovation could be a simple change to your hiring process, a hack in your sales efforts or a tweak to your internal meetings format. Each new concept need not move mountains to deliver a momentous impact, especially when injecting high doses of these baby breakthroughs.
Atoms nailed the fit, not only for shoe customers but also discovering where the company can win in a highly completive industry. Following in those footsteps with your own micro-innovations, you may quickly find yourself walking a new path toward success. As the saying goes, "if the shoe fits...."

Texto completo: LAS VEGAS – The Dog Whisperer is coming to Nevada, and he's got a story to tell.
Cesar Millan, the New York Times bestselling author of eight dog books and host of "Cesar 911," next month will bring his one-man show, "Cesar Millan – My Story: Unleashed," to a Las Vegas stage.
The Dog Whisperer's story centers on his journey from life in Sinaloa, Mexico, to crossing the border with $100 in his pocket to becoming a world-renowned dog (and people) specialist with a client list including Oprah, Mark Zuckerberg, Jerry Seinfeld, Scarlett Johansson, Steve Wynn and more.
Millan's Las Vegas residency runs Sept. 12-18 at the MGM Grand's David Copperfield Theater. Tickets, starting at $45 plus tax and fees, are already on sale.
The Dog Whisperer spoke with the USA TODAY Network about what people can learn from pets, the importance of being vulnerable and the healing power of stories.
Pets teach people to live their best lives ... Cesar Millan: Animals live a very healthy, positive and loving lifestyle. Most humans want to achieve that – but most people postpone that.
If you observe dogs or cats you're going to see when they wake up in the morning, the first thing they do is stretch. The second thing they do is walk around. That's how they find food and water. The fourth thing they do is rest. The stretch is what people call yoga. Walking around is what people don't do. And rest is what people call mediation – and then sleep.
So the five body motions that dogs do is stretch, walk, run, rest, sleep. When we do that, it allows us to be fit and healthy.
Animals don't follow drama. Animals don't care about negativity. Animals don't commit crimes the way humans commit crimes. And animals would never follow instability. We're the only species that follows unstable leaders. We're the only species that follows instability. We're also the only species in the world to use medications to go to sleep.
Animals live a very healthy, positive, loving lifestyle. And that's what every human wants. But most people go after money, fame and power. Money, fame and power brings stress. Dogs teach you.
The Dog Whisperer trains people – not pets ... Millan: It's a big mistake thinking we need to train dogs before we train ourselves. Everybody knows to run a business you have to train yourself. You can't just say you're going to run and business and not be trained to run a business.
To run a marathon, you have to train yourself to run a marathon. But when it comes to a dog, people think, 'I have to train the dog.'
I came to America to learn from Americans how to train dogs, because I grew up watching 'Lassie' and 'Rin Tin Tin' – and I thought every dog in America was like Lassie and Rin Tin Tin. To my surprise, it was the opposite. That's when I said I'm not going to train dogs, I'm going to train people.
On the importance of being vulnerable ... Millan: Empathy and compassion is something men have to practice more than women. For me, it's just a step. I want to inspire a population of males to open up and be vulnerable and really speak about where you came from – the pain and your accomplishments.
What's happening right now in America, what these people are doing is shutting down emotions. They're closing down empathy and compassion. They're not allowing themselves to be vulnerable and somebody to listen to them or speak about it and say, 'Let me help you, my friend. Let me change your mind.'
Maybe you need more exercise so you can drain some of that pent-up energy that's negative that is being trapped inside of you. For me, being vulnerable is a big step for me to share with honesty and integrity and to be loyal to my story.
On why people should listen to the Dog Whisperer's story ... Millan: At this moment in life, when we don't feel safe, we don't feel peaceful, we don't feel the love, you need to get inspired. You need to hear somebody's story – from poverty, from immigrant, from life and death situations on the border, from having one of the most iconic dogs in the world after Lassie and Rin Tin Tin – Daddy.
The people that inspire the most are the one's that come from nowhere. You need to have one of those stories where you at least at home can create safety, peace and love.
One of the things that animals feel immediately when they enter a new home is, 'Do I feel safe? Is this house peaceful? Do I feel the love?'
My clients love dogs, but the dogs don't trust and respect them. Mr. [Steve] Wynn is my client. A very powerful human. Presidents are my clients. Kings are my clients. But the dogs don't know. People are going to be very surprised and very touched by how I bring what I have learned from dogs and life and how I stay focused and motivated to make this country different when it comes to living with a dog.
On how vulnerability can be powerful enough to stop mass shootings ... Millan: Those people that did the massacres. If they're vulnerable about what they feel about racism, about race – it's the beginning of detoxing yourself from it. But you choose to hold it and shut down and you don't exercise love, you don't exercise empathy and compassion. Being vulnerable can be lifesaving.
Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
"It's a big mistake thinking we need to train dogs before we train ourselves," says Caesar Millan.

Texto completo: It was an exhausting week in Donald Trump World. So many outrages, so little time!

The political universe now seems (understandably) fascinated with one of the 45th American president's latest lunacies, his determination to – somehow – pin the demise by suicide of sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein on some sort of conspiracy engineered by the notorious and nefarious Bill and Hillary Clinton, otherwise known as the 42nd American president and his wife.
Then the political lens took a slight detour to focus on the arrogance of new Trump immigration czar Ken Cuccinelli, who late last week decided to rewrite the moving Emma Lazarus poem on the base of the Statue of Liberty that has inspired people around the world for more than a century. Ken's somewhat less poetic version, at least as I understand it:
“Don't send me any tired, poor huddled masses.
They can breathe – or not – elsewhere.
The wretched refuse, homeless and tempest-tossed are free
To teem on any shore they want as long as it's not ours.
Send instead those with advanced degrees and golden bank accounts
Who are yearning to invest on our fortified shore.”
Yeah, the meter's off, but that's not all that's amiss. While we're all tut-tutting at the petty malice of Donald Trump, we're missing the deep damage to our country being done in his name, whether with or without his actual knowledge. Such as the destruction of more than 50 years of legislation that has materially advanced the health, welfare and prosperity of ordinary Americans.
Latest target in his sights? Turns out our self-proclaimed “great environmentalist” president's latest Big Idea is to gut the overwhelmingly popular Endangered Species Act (pushed and proudly signed by Richard Nixon, who was – despite his other sins – a real environmentalist).
Now, if there is anything that has been true since Christopher Columbus set foot in the New World, it is that successive waves of explorers, adventurers and settlers not only exploited and sometimes murdered the land's indigenous inhabitants but heedlessly and quite deliberately despoiled and even destroyed the continent's abundant wildlife for food or profit or often for just fun.
Many animals were under serious siege for years, but the poster critter for the dangers of unfettered species exploitation is the passenger pigeon. Or, rather, was the passenger pigeon, a North American species once considered the continent's most abundant bird, numbering in the many millions.
The birds traveled and roosted in gigantic groups, often darkening the landscape as they flew low overhead. As late as the mid-nineteenth century, enormous flocks could block out the sun for hours. And they were prized for their meat and their feathers.
But because they moved and roosted in such gargantuan numbers, they were easy to kill. There were so many, people thought, they could never be wiped out, and so they were hunted and slaughtered unceasingly, thousands at a time, as “civilization” moved west.
Passenger pigeons were gone from the wilds by the early 1900s, and 105 years ago, in 1914, Martha, the last bird in captivity, died at the Cincinnati zoo. She had never had a fertile egg.
This irrevocable eradication of an entire species from the planet was an early impetus for the creation of laws to protect wildlife. Another was the near loss of the American bison. Millions once roamed the prairie in thundering herds but by 1889 wanton mass killing had reduced their number to fewer than 1,000 – and a large number of those were in captivity.
Today, thanks to conservation and breeding programs there are said to be about 500,000. And, of course, we saved the celebrated American Eagle by banning DDT in 1963, when its numbers were down to 487 nesting pairs. By 2007, there were nearly 10,000.
But, politically, Americans move slowly, and it took the passage of more than half a century, two world wars and a major depression for the conservation ethos to take thorough root.
In the late 1960s and early '70s, Congress passed and President Nixon signed a constellation of wide-ranging conservation laws. They included the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and – drumroll here! – the Endangered Species Act.
The laws have been under assault by various special interests ever since, but they've all endured more or less broadly intact and earned much public appreciation to become the bedrock supports for a whole universe of laudable reforms. Until now.
Now comes Trump in the person of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt – a former lobbyist for timber and mining companies as well as for gas and oil interests – to propose helpful “improvements… to increase effectiveness and transparency” in the way the law is applied.
But Lisa Friedman, a longtime reporter on climate policy and related issues for the New York Times, describes how the “improvements” are a bold attack on existing law. The proposal would significantly weaken the basic law and make it more difficult to protect wildlife from climate changes.
As she summarizes things, the new rules “would make it easier to remove a species from the endangered list and weaken protections for threatened species, the classification one step below endangered.” And regulators would be allowed, for the first time, to take economics into account – for example, will revenue be lost if a species deserves protection? Is it worth it?
“Critically,” she writes, “the changes would also make it more difficult for regulators to factor in the effects of climate change on wildlife when making those decisions because those threats tend to be decades away, not immediate.”
Friedman concludes that “overall, the revised rules appear very likely to clear the way for new mining, oil and gas drilling, and development in areas where protected species live.”
A host of conservation organizations agree with her.
Bernhardt is Trump's guy, reflecting the contempt Trump – who, I suspect, had never got closer to real wildlife than maybe encountering an errant field mouse darting across one of his prize golf courses – seems to have for the real natural fauna of our country.
And so the ordinary American should ask – repeatedly – why, why, why is it seemingly the instinct of Donald Trump and his acolytes to destroy the real America he's sworn to cherish and protect?

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In August 1619, a ship carrying more than 20 enslaved Africans arrived at a coastal port in the British colony of Virginia. The people on board were sold to colonists, marking the beginning of a more than two-century-long institution that would radically alter and continue to inform the identity of a young nation.
This month is the 400th anniversary of that ship's arrival. To commemorate this historic moment and its legacy, The New York Times Magazine has dedicated an entire issue and special broadsheet section, out this Sunday, to exploring the history of slavery and mapping the ways in which it has touched nearly every aspect of contemporary life in the United States.
The 1619 Project began as an idea pitched by Nikole Hannah-Jones, one of the magazine's staff writers, during a meeting in January. Her proposal was clear and ambitious: to dedicate an issue of the Sunday magazine to examining the ways the legacy of slavery continues to shape our country. Its implications, particularly for a newspaper that continues to face criticism for its past and present coverage of black Americans, were huge.
"I have spent every moment of this project keenly aware of what it means to be doing this in The New York Times," Ms. Hannah-Jones, who won a MacArthur Grant in 2017 for her work on American segregation, said in an interview. "It's very powerful, and it's very fraught at the same time."
The magazine staff was immediately on board. "It was an opportunity for us to do something that was necessary," said Jake Silverstein, the editor of the magazine.
Those involved knew it was a big task, one that would require the expertise of those who have dedicated their entire lives and careers to studying the nuances of what it means to be a black person in America. Ms. Hannah-Jones invited 18 scholars and historians -- including Kellie Jones, a Columbia University art historian and 2016 MacArthur Fellow; Annette Gordon-Reed, a professor of law and history at Harvard; and William Darity, a professor of public policy at the Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity at Duke University -- to meet with editors and journalists at The Times early this year. The brainstorming session cemented key components of the issue, including what broad topics would be covered (for example, sugar, capitalism and cotton) and who would contribute (including Linda Villarosa, Bryan Stevenson and Khalil Gibran Muhammad). The feature stories were then chiseled by Ms. Hannah-Jones with the help of Ilena Silverman, the magazine's features editor.
Almost every contributor in the magazine and special section -- writers, photographers and artists -- is black, a nonnegotiable aspect of the project that helps underscore its thesis, Ms. Hannah-Jones said. The magazine recruited talents like the artist Adam Pendelton, whose piece opens Ms. Hannah-Jones's lead essay, and the photographer Djeneba Aduayom, whose photo essay about the ancestry of a group of Howard University Law School graduates closes the issue. Dannielle Bowman shot the cover photograph, which is a view of the water just off the coast of Hampton, Va.
"A lot of ideas were considered, but ultimately we decided that there was an undeniable power in narrowing our focus to the very place that this issue kicks off," said Jessica Dimson, the deputy director of photography of the magazine. "Dannielle Bowman's solemn photograph of the water is not just symbolic, but it is also a document of living history."
Nearly every piece in the issue is anchored by a contemporary image -- a constant reminder that even though slavery was formally abolished more than 150 years ago, its legacy has remained insidious. Each decision, from which kind of fonts to use to the illustrations, was an attempt to balance the events of the past with their present-day implications. Poems and short stories, specifically created for this project by some of the most influential black artists working today, such as Jesmyn Ward, Barry Jenkins and Lynn Nottage, populate the pages between each essay, offering a kind of literary timeline of black life in America over the last 400 year
In the time that the issue was coming together, through a series of conversations between Mr. Silverstein; Ms. Hannah-Jones; Ms. Silverman; Ms. Dimson; Gail Bichler; Kathy Ryan, director of photography; and Caitlin Roper, the editorial director of The New York Times Magazine Labs, Ms. Hannah-Jones's initial pitch morphed, and expanded, into a special project, something that would go far beyond just one issue of the magazine and involve other departments at The Times.
"I like the notion that a project is a kind of activity that you engage in toward a goal, and that's the best way I can think of to describe what this is," said Mr. Silverstein.¶¶
The special section, which was spearheaded by Ms. Roper and Deb Bishop, the team's art director, went through several iterations before it was decided that it would focus on painting a more full, but by no means comprehensive, picture of the institution of slavery itself.
"The idea was to use historical objects and visuals from the National Museum of African American History and Culture as a jumping-off point to pull readers in and begin to tell them this history," said Ms. Roper.
The broadsheet special section has two components: A reported essay by Nikita Stewart, a reporter on The Times's Metro desk, examining why Americans are so poorly educated on slavery, followed by a history of slavery written by Mary Elliott, curator of American slavery at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, and Jazmine Hughes, a writer and editor at The Times Magazine.
The project also includes a multipart audio series with The Daily featuring Ms. Hannah-Jones, a page dedicated to understanding the significance of 1619 in the upcoming issue of The New York Times for Kids, and a partnership with the Pulitzer Center to create a curriculum that will be distributed in schools across the country. The Times has also printed hundreds of thousands of extra copies of the magazine and special section to be distributed for free at libraries, museums and schools.
Of course, this is only the beginning. The 1619 Project is first and foremost an invitation to reframe how the country discusses the role and history of its black citizens. "As much as I hope white readers will read it and have their minds blown, I hope that black people will read it, and feel a sense of ownership over this country and a sense of pride in our resilience," Ms. Hannah-Jones said. "I hope to reframe the way we see ourselves in America."

Texto completo: By John Surico; Photographs by George Etheredge
"On any person who desires such queer prizes," E.B. White wrote in "Here is New York," his 1948 love letter to the city, "New York will bestow the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy." It's a strange fact: that among 8.6 million people and countless more visitors, a person can find solitude en masse. There are ways to get away without going anywhere.
But in certain pockets of this city, this peace and quiet can take a different form. New York is home to some 30,000 acres of parkland, a third of which is considered 'natural areas' -- forests, rivers, wetlands, marshes, beaches alike. And deep inside, a city within a city can be found, where it can feel as if it's all yours for the taking.
A hike in New York's urban wilderness offers a glimpse at a city that many New Yorkers tend to overlook, or know very little about -- one that stands in stark contrast to congested streets, and crowded sidewalks. It is scenery that we seem to decamp to upstate, on Long Island, across the Hudson -- everywhere else but here. But with a recent historic injection of city dollars into parks, impending plans to better chart this natural panorama, and a surge in paid-for "glamping," it has never been a more opportune time to get out there and explore.
The Bronx
Distance: 8 miles
Getting There: 5 Train, at 241st Street
Best For: Kayaking, swimming.
Despite its reputation, the Bronx is one of the greenest boroughs, with a quarter of its land dedicated to parks, including Pelham Bay Park, the city's largest. But its true wild side can be found on the Bronx River Greenway, where Bronxites can seek refuge in the city's only (and recently restored) freshwater river on small kayaks, or just by jumping in. Follow the river to its end, where it feeds the East River and newly built waterfront parks, or choose between two trails that overlook the floodplains of the Bronx River Forest. The parkway's sounds will recede in the distance.
Queens
Distance: 14.6 miles
Getting There: 7, Main Street-Flushing
Best For: Nature Walks, Waterfront
When work started on the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge in 1901, most of Queens was farmland, and sparsely populated. Today, that bucolic past lives on through the Eastern Queens Greenway. Beyond Flushing Meadows-Corona and Kissena Park, this section of the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway, a 40-mile path for cyclists and hikers -- is consumed by the natural southern forest of Cunningham Park. The defunct Vanderbilt Motor Parkway offers a canopied trail among backyards, leading to Alley Pond Park, one of the city's premier natural preserves. There, visitors can get lost journeying to Alley Creek, Oakland Lake, and the Alley Pond Giant, a tulip tree that is believed to be the city's tallest and oldest living organism. And up along the waterfront, make room for sunset photos at Fort Totten, with the Throgs Neck Bridge standing tall in the horizon.
Manhattan
Distance: 6 miles
Getting There: B/C train, 110th Street-Cathedral Parkway
Best For: The view
Upper Manhattan is home to most of the borough's living wilderness: its only remaining natural forest, hillside scrambles, and saltwater marshes. (Yes, in Manhattan.) The Giraffe Path (not an officially designated trail) captures a cross-section; created by Mindy Thompson Fullilove, a clinical psychiatrist deemed "The Town Shrink" by The New York Times, the unmarked trail starts at the northern edge of Central Park and climbs up through Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Park, Jackie Robinson Park, Highbridge Park and Fort Tryon Park, home to the Cloisters. From this elevation, the cityscape appears below the horizon, its views seen without the aid of a rooftop or a drone.
Brooklyn-Queens
Distance: 10.1 miles
Getting There: J, Cleveland Street
Best For: Forestry
Cemeteries and tangled parkland demarcate eastern Brooklyn and central Queens. The Brooklyn-Queens Greenway ropes through Highland Park for a 1.2-mile trip around the decommissioned Ridgewood Reservoir, a body of water that has since flourished with wetlands and native flora. Streets connect its sister green, Forest Park, where the path turns to wild fields. Sidling along train tracks, the moderate Blue Trail cuts into the park's hallmark: Queens' largest continuous oak forest. The glaciers that created the landscape are also responsible for its kettle ponds, which aid the trail's tranquillity.
Staten Island
Distance: 8 miles
Getting There: A number of bus lines at the Staten Island Ferry stop nearby, including the S91 to Marsh Avenue/Windham Loop.
Best For: Elevation and escape
The s0-called forgotten borough is easily the greenest, with a third of its acreage dedicated to parks -- and the world's largest landfill, at Freshkills, on its way to becoming the city's largest park built in over a century. The Staten Island Greenbelt -- a constellation of several parks and natural areas in the center of the borough -- embodies that title.
Adventurous hikers should follow the 8-mile Yellow Trail, which ascends more than 400 feet and ends at the city's highest natural point: Todt Hill. Down below, the thatched terrain of woodland and lakes are far removed from Staten Island suburbia, providing sights of the borough's honorary beast: deer. Once off the trail, make sure you stop at the Corleone family home, featured in "The Godfather." When in Staten Island, right?
Photograph Hike in New York City? Yes, all you need to do is go to the stoplight and turn far, far right. Above, Young Trini cools off at the Bronx River Forest, along the Bronx River Trail. (MB1); Above, the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway ends with photo-ready views of the Throgs Neck Bridge; far left, the greenway passes residential sections; and it was cool-down time in Fort Totten Park.

The great Western public land robbery

Texto completo: Imagine if the head of Philip Morris were put in charge of the American Cancer Society. Imagine he had spent his career trying to fight cancer cures, while promoting one of the world's leading carcinogens. For good measure, he mocked the mission of his new employer and insulted the prayers of those looking for hope.
No, I'm not talking about Ken Cuccinelli, the acting chief of federal immigration services, who wants to rewrite the poem on the Statue of Liberty to say something like: Keep out, wretched masses. Only well-off whites are welcome here.
The gallery of awful human beings, monumental incompetents, wife-beaters, frauds and outright criminals appointed to high positions in the Trump administration is large and varied. As wanted posters, they would fill an entire post office wall.
But you have to go pretty deep into the ranks of the Worst People to find someone equal to the man Donald Trump has now put in charge of your public lands - William Perry Pendley. This is another Onion headline that writes itself: Trump's pick for public lands doesn't believe in public lands.
The man now overseeing 248 million acres owned by every American citizen is a mad-dog opponent of the very idea of shared space in the great outdoors. He has spent his professional life chipping away - in court, in public forums, in statehouses - at one of the most cherished of American birthrights.
It's easy to overlook the latest villain from this White House because the pipeline from hell just keeps churning them out. At the top, the occupant of the Oval Office never stops debasing his office: the racism, the nut-job conspiracy theories, the thumbs-up pictures with newly orphaned babies - and that was just during the last week or so.
But behind the tragicomedy of this presidency, some laser-focused opportunists have been cleaning up. Opponents of public health and safety, of clean water, open space and a chemical-free food chain have never had a better chance to run the show.
This week, it was a rollback of the Endangered Species Act, the most powerful environmental law in history, a statutory savior of bald eagles, grizzly bears and countless other vital links in the web of life. Could anything be more Trumpian than going after the law that saved the national bird?
Weakening the Endangered Species Act by executive fiat is illegal on the face of it, but the law has never stopped this administration cold in its tracks. While the courts sort it out, the natural world slips further into peril. In May, a United Nations report found that 1 million plant and animal species are on the verge of extinction. And for those of you who think you can take refuge in one of the new gilded bunkers built for the rich and apocalyptic, this report had direct implications for human survival as well.
The Trump strategy is to destroy from within. He has a secretary of state who doesn't believe in diplomacy, an attorney general who scoffs at lawbreakers in the executive branch and now a man who opposes public lands to run the Bureau of Land Management, which oversees an area nearly 50% larger than the state of Texas.
Pendley spent decades suing the government for trying to protect fish and wildlife and clean water. "The Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold," he wrote in 2016. He's also expressed sympathy for the deadbeat rancher Cliven Bundy, a hero of anti-public land terrorists. And he's mocked Native American religious claims to sacred sites.
Now, he's free to fulfill the wish list of his former industrial clients. He's the land bureau's acting director, just like Cuccinelli at immigration. It's another Trump tactic to put people in temporary charge of important arms of government, hacks who could never be approved by Congress. In the short term, they do enough damage to satisfy their big-money handlers.
Pendley was given this powerful perch by way of executive order orchestrated by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas lobbyist who is now doing the work of his ex-clients on the taxpayer's dime.
Americans, by huge margins, love their public land - a sentiment shared by Trump voters. In the West, where the bureau's land includes prime habitat for wildlife, and a favored open range for hunters, anglers, hikers and birders, Trump's policies could cost Republicans Senate seats in Montana, Colorado and even Texas.
But what's good in the political backlash to bad policies still leaves us at a dangerous moment for nature. Trump has gutted two national monuments in the West, the largest environmental rollback in history. And he's given fresh life to a colossal mine that could imperil the world's largest wild salmon fishery, in Alaska's Bristol Bay.
I was in Montana last week, sitting around a campfire after a day spent hiking and swimming in a public forest full of summer enchantment. My Montana family members and I were talking about how the rich pay $1,500 a day to go "glamping" in this Last Best Place. We had it free - the forest, the river, a meadow bursting with wildflowers and huckleberries - for now.

Texto completo: While white settlers were initially invited to Texas by the Mexican government to boost population growth during the early 19th century, many didn’t follow the legal requirements. They flooded in illegally, before eventually edging Mexican residents of Texas out of the territory entirely.
And though the state's borders were established during the mid-19th century, that boundary wasn’t closely enforced until more recently, according to Carlos Vélez-Ibáñez, founding director of the Arizona State University School of Transborder Studies.
Vélez-Ibáñez said southern parts of the region have always been bustling with transborder communities, such as El Paso, where the city’s residents live in a bilingual, bicultural community alongside Ciudad Juárez, Mexico.
He said that the name El Paso is actually short for “el paso del norte,” or the northern passage, adding that the Spanish coined the name due to the area’s reputation as a frequent migrant stop for northbound colonists. Last year, nearly 12. 4 million personal vehicles crossed the Paso del Norte International Bridge that separates the two cities.
Texas state Rep. Leo Pacheco, D-San Antonio, said he has the fairest skin of his eight siblings and is often seen as passing for white. He is a direct descendant of the Canary Islanders of Spain who founded San Antonio, Texas in 1731, as well as neighboring Native American tribes.
Pacheco said he always believed he was Mexican, until he conducted a genetics test to learn he was, in fact, 30. 8 percent Native American and 60 percent Iberian.
“It was more of a label that was given to us by the Anglo society,” Pacheco said of the his Mexican identity.
He said his pale skin and red hair have given him insight into the bigotry within his home state, albeit in conversations behind closed doors. Since Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, this racist rhetoric has gotten worse, he said.
Many feel emboldened by Trump, who launched his presidential campaign in June 2015 by calling Mexican immigrants "rapists. " That rhetoric has persisted throughout his presidency. Last week, The New York Times reported that Trump's re-election campaign has already run more than 2,000 ads on Facebook that feature the word "invasion. "
“They’d say these things in front of me, and then have a concerned look when they’d see I wasn’t laughing,” Pacheco said. “The sentiment has been there all along, but now they think it’s okay to be racist because of our leadership. ”
He views the country's demographic changes in this region as simply a righting of what has been taken from brown people on the continent for generations. The U. S. Census Bureau has predicted that the majority of the country will be comprised of current minority populations by the year 2050.
“This land was the brown people’s land to begin with,” Pacheco said. “It’s only returning to its natural state of order. ”
Patricia Perea, 43, is descended from people who lived in the Llano Estacado, a region that includes parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas Panhandle. A first-generation college graduate, Perea decided to become a lecturer in the Chicana and Chicano Studies Department at the University of New Mexico because, when she was younger, she said she felt discouraged by her teachers from learning about Mexican American and Native American history in the region.
“The thing that’s probably the most maddening is that, as Latinos or Latinx, we’re never thought of as being older members of U. S. history,” Perea said. “We’ve been here hundreds of years, so it’s frustrating to always be put in terms of immigrants. ”
According to a report released by the Pew Research Center in 2017, 34. 4 percent of Hispanics in the United States are immigrants, dropping from 40. 1 percent in 2000. Roughly 65. 6 percent of Hispanics in the U. S. are native-born citizens.
“Whether it’s New Mexico or any place in the Southwest, a lot of Mexican Americans, like people in my family that have been here over a few centuries, we’ve worked in communities with people who are more recently from Mexico or Central America, so a lot of us are intermarried,” Perea said.
From an early age, Charles Dominguez, 23, can recall being chastised by classmates. They told him to “go back to where [he] came from,” despite the fact that he was already there. In reality, Dominguez’s family line predates the Gadsden Purchase in Arizona.
They identify as Mexican American, a combination of the family’s past and present. As he’s gotten older, Dominguez, a student at Arizona State University, has come to cherish his family background, becoming involved in political activism for immigration and Latinx issues in his home state.
“This is my home,” Dominguez said. “My family has been here for generations. ”

Is 'Racing' Milo Ventimiglia's George Clooney moment?

Texto completo: When Milo Ventimiglia was in third grade, he applied to his school's honors program. After the testing was complete, his parents were told that their son wasn't as inherently gifted as the other young candidates. Compared to his bright pupils who'd scored perfectly, Ventimiglia had only managed to get roughly 70% of the answers correct.
"But I would work and work and work until I got a 100," he recalls. "The program head said that my work ethic exceeded that of the naturally smartest kids who came through. So they put me in the honors program."
This story has become a part of Ventimiglia's foundational identity. He defines himself as the guy who will work four times harder than anyone else. Yes, he recently earned his third Emmy nomination for his portrayal of beloved father Jack Pearson on "This Is Us." But acting doesn't necessarily come easy to him, he says. After 12-hour days on the NBC set, he drives home to his place on the Westside, showers, eats dinner, and starts studying his script -- "for one, two, three hours sometimes." Then again in the morning.
"People look at me from the outside and go: 'You've got a dream. You've got it easy,'" he says, "No. This is ... hard."
It's a narrative that helps to explain why, at 42, Ventimiglia is just now starring in his first studio film. He's been a steady presence in Hollywood for more than two decades, best known as a television actor: Before "This Is Us," he had memorable roles on the long-running series "Heroes" and "Gilmore Girls." But "The Art of Racing in the Rain," now playing in wide release, marks new territory for Ventimiglia. The movie -- based on Garth Stein's 2008 novel, which spent three years on the New York Times bestseller list -- is told from the perspective of a dog watching his owner, a race car driver, try to balance a Formula One career and a family life. (Ventimiglia plays the driver; Kevin Costner voices the soulful golden retriever.)
The part was initially slated for Patrick Dempsey, himself a professional racer, who optioned Stein's book shortly after publication. But as the project stalled -- going into turnaround at Universal Pictures before ultimately landing at Fox 2000 -- the "Grey's Anatomy" veteran aged out of the role. He agreed to produce the movie instead, and in early 2018 the search began for a new star.
Coincidentally, the hunt began just as Ventimiglia's most iconic "This Is Us" turn was about to air: the post-Super Bowl episode in which the Pearsons' family home goes up in flames due to a faulty slow cooker, and Jack dies from a heart attack after inhaling too much smoke.
"We had just seen him run out of a burning house with a dog in his arms and everyone was like, 'He's so right for this on so many levels,' " says director Simon Curtis, remembering the casting meeting with producer Neal Moritz and Fox 2000 head Elizabeth Gabler.
"So Neil grabs his phone and just calls Milo's agent right there," Gabler continues. " 'Hi, it's Neal Moritz. Can you tell me when Milo's hiatus [from 'This Is Us'] is?' He found out his hiatus was perfectly timed; Milo read the script that night and committed the next day."
Growing up, Ventimiglia glorified movies. He dreamed of being 40 feet tall on the big screen _ being the guy whom people left their homes and paid money to see. But as he established himself as a television actor -- and the era of prestige TV came to pass -- the desire to chase a film career evaporated.
Still, he liked "The Art of Racing in the Rain" and the idea that he could play "a different version of the man [he] was already playing on TV -- a good guy."
"I feel like actors worry so much about being typecast, so they go against type," Ventimiglia says. "Jack is such a beloved character, I wasn't going to play someone so horrible. Why? I think we need more good guys out there."
Ventimiglia is obsessed with the notion of "good guys" -- of playing them and of being perceived as one in his off-screen life. On this Friday night, bouncing between various promotional events for his new movie, he pulls up at the Four Seasons in his black Porsche. (A publicist notes that he eschews studio-offered chauffeurs, instead opting to drive himself everywhere.) Inside, at the hotel's restaurant, he asks the waitress to clear the dinner table and tells her the space will only be used for conversation.
"I'll leave her a nice tip after," he says. "I waited tables. I understand what it's like when someone comes in and it's like, 'Oh, you're just gonna sit and drink water.' " Ventimiglia knows that when people on the street look at him, they see Jack Pearson. And Jack is a hard guy to live up to.
"My comment is always, 'Hey, I was here first,' " he says, half-kidding. "I just came from a bookstore event, and some guy said to me, 'Hey, man, I really enjoy your acting. You play such a great father.' He was with an older gentleman and I go, 'Is this your dad?' He was, so I said, 'Yeah, but you've got the real deal right here. Look at you and how courteous you are introducing yourself to me. You must have been raised by a good man. So you've got the real Jack Pearson right there.' "
Ventimiglia is close with his own father, Peter, a businessman who once sold equipment to printing presses; The Times was one of his dad's clients. But unlike the character he has become so identified with, the actor himself is not married and does not have children. It's a "massive responsibility," he says -- one he thinks many take too lightly before they understand what they're getting into.
"I just don't think I'm there yet," he says. "Will I ever be ready? Who knows. Would I be a good dad? I'm sure I would. Hopefully. I came from a good father and good parents. I think it's in my DNA to do it, but I haven't yet."
Despite his personal life, being on "This Is Us" allowed audiences to see Ventimiglia in a paternal light. He was able to display his protective qualities -- his confidence in leading a group.
"The show allowed an audience to look at me and not see Jess or Peter," he says, referring to his prior television characters. "It allowed people to go, 'Oh, who's Jack? Not Milo --Jack.' Because we spanned decades and went from Jack in his 20s to Jack in his 50s, people just bought in. 'Oh yeah, Ventimiglia? I can see him at 54.'
"Right now," he continues, "what I have going for me is playing America's favorite dad -- and we on 'This Is Us' have an audience. And hopefully the bosses at these film studios are going, 'Well, wait a minute, not only is that a popular show -- so there's a lot of eyeballs on him -- but he's talented.' "
Curtis, the filmmaker behind "The Art of Racing in the Rain," calls Ventimiglia's casting in the movie his "Clooney moment -- when an actor very well known on TV emerges as a film star."
"Like George Clooney, it just took a certain maturity and body of work for Milo to get his movie," Gabler says. "Tom Cruise started out basically as a teenager and had that movie right off the bat. Brad Pitt got it from a supporting role in 'Thelma and Louise.' But Milo is somebody who has had a chance to really live his life. He can walk the line as a real guy's guy with physicality who also has emotion and sensitivity."
Still, Ventimiglia insists he's not trying to capitalize on his "This Is Us" heat: "There's no striking while the iron is hot. It's hopefully gonna be hot for a while."
Instead, he says, he's focusing on moving away from his try-hard mentality. He's testing out what it's like to not accept every project that comes his way because he feels he needs to be working.
"I mean, I'm 42 this year. I really, really know who I am and I really know what I can offer a project," he says. "Which is an interesting shift as an actor.
"I'm not leaning forward on my toes. I'm not sitting back on my heels. I'm just flat, feet on the ground, ready for anything that comes at me."

Festival Latino organizers celebrate diversity following attacks

Texto completo: Entering their 8th year of festivities, Festival Latino organizers are preparing for their biggest year yet with a full week of activities—a change from their regularly scheduled single-day celebration of Latinx heritage.
For some organizers, this year also feels different for reasons outside their control.
Although anti-immigrant sentiment may not be new for Latinx people in the United States, several incidents over the past year have reached a boiling point. Examples include the shooting in El Paso, which targeted Latinx people, and anti-immigrant rhetoric voiced by the Trump administration as recently as this week.
Instead of dwelling on concerns, participants and organizers, who may feel fear or not, are focusing instead on sharing Latinx culture and their love for this country.
"We need to keep going. We can't go into the shadows. We can't silence ourselves," said organizer Manny Galvez. "We are excited and so happy to show everyone the festival."
Galvez said this year the week of cultural activities will start August 19 and finish August 25. It will have the same day-long celebration on August 24, as well as a movie screening and art events throughout downtown.
A long-time participant in the festival, visual artist Miriam Alarcón, said while she feels an omnipresent fear among Latinx people, it remains her goal to integrate the community with the city.
She recalled last year, when Galvez changed the date of the festival to support the family of Mollie Tibbetts. After the University of Iowa student was found dead, police arrested and charged Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, in connection with her death.
The political debate over Rivera's legal status in the country and several social media posts which encouraged people to "hunt illegals in Iowa" led Galvez to postpone the event.
Another festival participant, Adriana Hurtado, also said this year feels different. She's excited, but not as much as she has been in years past. A mother of two, she has found herself questioning the safety of the event.
"I could stay home and hide but I feel like we shouldn't be ashamed of who we are," she said. "I feel like we should be proud as Hispanics, as Hispanic-Americans."
Iowa City Police Sgt. Derek Frank said the department appreciates the opportunity to participate. Regarding safety concerns, he said it's important for people to be vigilant.
"With recent incidents such as these being on the mind of so many lately, the ICPD feels strongly that we should be present and available for the duration of this event," he said.
He added, that as always, people should be observant and report any suspicious behavior or situations to the police department.
The determination expressed by festival organizers and participants was echoed in a letter of solidarity published today by 200 Latinx entertainers and activists in the New York Times and several newspapers nationwide.
It's a letter of support for U.S. Latinos who feel "terrified, heartbroken and defeated by the barrage of attacks." The writers reference the shootings and an immigration raid in Mississippi, as well as anti-immigrant sentiments from the government including words from the president.
While campaigning in 2016, Trump referred to Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and as president, he's referenced migrants coming to the country as forming "an invasion."
"We have been smeared by political rhetoric and murdered in violent hate crimes. We have been separated from our families and have watched our children caged," the letter said. "But, we will not be broken. We will not be silenced."
Similarly, Galvez said, at this moment, a simple act of putting on a festival has become an act of resistance. But it's also more than that.
"The most important is the love," he said.
"The love we have for our culture and this country. And the happiness to show who we are."

Texto completo: HARRISBURG - At the end of a week that saw two mass shootings in Philadelphia, Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order Friday intended to reduce gun violence in the state.
The order requires state agencies to collect more data about gun violence, instructs state police to boost their monitoring of hate groups and white supremacists, and increases efforts to help local police departments respond to threats of mass shootings.
It also increases efforts to promote a program that allows people to send text messages to alert law enforcement to "suspicions of mass shootings" and creates a council of criminal justice experts and lawmakers to study gun violence and provide policy recommendations.
"Too many Pennsylvanians have died from gun violence. Too many have lost loved ones to gun violence. Too many live every day in fear of being shot on the sidewalk, in their neighborhood, at a grocery store, at school or at a concert," the governor said during an emotional signing ceremony inside the Capitol.
As Mr. Wolf signed his name to the order with a fine-point black marker, a slew of cabinet officials and Democratic state lawmakers flanked him. Many of the legislators came from urban areas, such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where residents have experienced both mass shootings and daily violence.
Sen. Anthony Williams, a Philadelphia Democrat, said the signing was emotional for him. Six Philadelphia police officers were shot on Wednesday, and five other people were wounded in a separate shooting in Philadelphia on Thursday.
Mr. Williams praised the governor for taking "the politics out of whether you have the right to have a gun or not" and recognizing "the dignity of human beings is first and most important."
Rep. Dan Frankel, whose district includes the Tree of Life synagogue in Squirrel Hill where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting Oct. 27, echoed those words.
But Mr. Frankel, like others present, also called on lawmakers to address gun control bills when they return from summer recess. When he meets with constituents, for whom in many cases the Squirrel Hill shootings are still fresh, "The one thing I hear consistently is, 'What are you going to do about it?'"
Mr. Wolf's executive order makes several changes that do not require approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature, according to his office. It comes at a time when public pressure is mounting across the nation, and particularly in Democratic circles, for politicians to address gun-control measures in the wake of a series of deadly shootings.
Mr. Wolf's order creates new divisions within existing state agencies, such as the Department of Health and the Commission on Crime and Delinquency, to focus specifically on finding ways to reduce gun violence. It creates a special council, consisting of criminal justice experts and lawmakers, and tasks them with forming policy recommendations. It also designates former Philadelphia police Commissioner Charles Ramsey as the governor's senior adviser on such issues.
The new efforts will roll out as Mr. Wolf and other Democrats negotiate with Republican leaders on several gun-control bills. Democrats who joined Friday's signing ceremony called for universal background checks, requiring safe-storage devices and mandating the reporting of lost and stolen guns, among other measures.
Republican leaders have signaled their willingness to discuss some measures. The conversation this fall is expected to focus on a "red flag" bill, which would give judges wider latitude to temporarily confiscate guns.
Some Republicans have noted that high-profile shootings involve suspects whose criminal records should have prevented them from obtaining guns. And they have expressed a desire to preserve the constitutional rights of gun owners who abide by the law.
"We understand that we cannot take action that will criminalize the millions of Pennsylvanians who responsibly and legally own firearms," said Jennifer Kocher, a spokeswoman for Senate Republicans.
Still, Democrats are urging action. As tears ran down his face, with his voice raised, state Rep. Jordan Harris, a Philadelphia Democrat, urged his fellow lawmakers to pass stricter gun control laws.
"We have to do something, something to address the pain and the carnage that far too many of our citizens are dealing with."

Texto completo: After the birth of her second child, Erica Jefferson of Rapid City, S.D., was faced with a choice: Pay her student loan bills or pay more than $ 1,000 a month for day care. She chose the latter.
Keeping her job -- she works as a claims processor for a funeral insurance company -- was a necessity. Her husband, a veteran, was injured in the military and cannot work or physically care for their 18-month-old.
"That became a real struggle for us," she said.
Having already exhausted her ability to defer her student loans, she opted for forbearance, a repayment option that typically requires only interest payments, but fell behind on those payments as well.
"My kids, they always have clothes on their backs, new shoes -- they're always well fed -- but for me ...," her voice trailed off. "I have to pay day care. I have to pay rent."
Ms. Jefferson, 32, is certainly not alone in the struggle to pay for child care. While there has been a lot written about the high costs of child care in general, we wanted to learn more about how day care and preschool expenses are affecting parents right now.
NYT Parenting worked with YouGov, an international polling and market research company, to create a brief online survey that offers a quick, informal snapshot of the costs faced by parents of children around the country enrolled in preschool or day care. Of the 1,027 parents who responded, 28 percent reported that day care and preschool expenses were a "very significant financial strain," and 20 percent reported going into debt to manage these expenses.
[ Finding the right day care can be a long journey.]
According to YouGov, the median amount spent on preschool and day care was $ 400 a month, and 22 percent of the parents said they spend $ 1,000 or more.
YouGov collected the data between Aug. 1 and 6, drawing respondents from a database of 1.2 million people who agreed to take online surveys. The survey represented parents from a cross-section of the country, about half of whom reported living in a city.
One limitation of the study, aside from its small sample size, was the use of unverified self-reported data gathered online. In addition, when the respondents were asked about their day care and preschool costs, they were not asked to distinguish whether their costs derived from day care, preschool or both.
The survey did not include costs associated with nannies or babysitters, which can also drain a family's finances.
Child care has become one of the biggest expenses faced by families in the United States. According to the Economic Policy Institute, annual infant care, on average, costs thousands of dollars, ranging from about $ 5,400 in Mississippi to more than $ 24,000 in Washington, D.C.
[ 6 things parents do that drive day care workers crazy .]
The costs are so great, they can absorb one person's entire salary.
Maya Polack, 35, of Scotch Plains, N.J., left her career as a high school teacher in 2014 after her family was confronted with the high cost of child care.
"We looked at day care costs and quickly realized my salary would solely be for day care, gas, mileage, etc.," she said. "So we had to ask ourselves: Do I love work enough? Because I would be working to keep our son in day care."
Ms. Polack, now a mother of three, said she made the right decision for her family.
"In the end, it's wonderful because I get to watch these three crazy monsters grow up," she said. "For me, going back to work wouldn't be a break from the kiddos but rather dealing with 200 more kiddos. And I really don't see how I could have been a great teacher while being a great mother because of how much time is carved out for the students."
Other parents said they try to navigate the huge burdens of child care by spacing their children far enough apart to minimize day care costs.
Despite the high costs involved, day care workers barely make a living wage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average hourly wage for child day care services is $ 11.11.
Kristy DeConti, who owns Natural Learning Community Children's School in Weatogue, Conn., has a master's degree in early childhood special education and two decades of experience working in child care. Her yearly salary amounts to about $ 30,000, she said, and her seven employees earn between $ 13.25 and $ 16.50 an hour.
"I struggle with the same things everybody else does. I have $ 40,000 in student loan debt. I have two children. I have to pay for before- and aftercare for my older one," she said. "But I don't think people see that side of it."
Ms. DeConti's 3-year-old attends her day care, which saves money, but also reduces the number of children she can enroll.
"If I filled that spot, then that's almost $ 13,000 more that I could be making a year," she said.
Connecticut voted this year to raise the state minimum wage to $ 15 by 2023.
"I mean, I just don't even know what I'll do," Ms. DeConti said. "Each year we're trying to slowly increase tuition so we don't lose a lot of families, but at the same time me and my family are barely surviving financially because of that."
As for Ms. Jefferson in South Dakota, she said she fell so far behind on her federal student loans that this year the Internal Revenue Service took her entire $ 8,000 tax refund, money her family was counting on to replace a car that had broken down.
But in recent months, after earning extra money from overtime, Ms. Jefferson has begun making payments toward her student loans again. Her family's budget still remains tight.
"I'm supposed to get paid tomorrow," she said in an interview last week. "And right now I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to pay some of the bills, and buy food and diapers.

Mass shootings? Blame enough for all

Texto completo: Violent video games don't kill people. They are not what drive shooters to commit mass shootings. But they are among many contributing factors to these senseless acts, including violence as depicted on TV and in movies; an environment of aggressive and violent behavior at home, school, and elsewhere; and even prevalent media coverage of mass killings and other violence.

That's not something we want to hear following the horrific mass killings in El Paso and Dayton, as our political leaders, pundits, lobbying groups, and even media outlets play their versions of the blame game.

Surely there's an easy cure-all answer like, as many have suggested, cracking down on Hollywood and/or the video game industry and how they glorify violence. But there's not - at least, not one that NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre will want to hear.

"Ideally you focus on all the factors" including violence in video games and movies, as well as domestic and other real-world violence, said Brad Bushman, professor of communication at Ohio State University. "But if you have to choose one, [gun control is] the one to focus on."

Yes, if you want to limit and hopefully end these mass shootings, then stop selling and manufacturing the weapons used to commit these acts, as in Dayton, where, armed with an AR-15-style pistol, Connor Betts fired dozens of shots in 30 seconds, killing nine and wounding 27 before police shot and killed him. He had the capacity to fire 250 rounds, Dayton Police said.

Frankly, I was ready to climb aboard the "back off of video games" bandwagon and mount a vigorous defense of the industry with this column. And then I talked with Bushman and Eric Dubow, a distinguished research professor in Bowling Green State University's department of psychology and a research professor at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research.

The pair recently conducted a study on risk factors for youth violence and came to the same conclusion as so many other studies: there is no single root cause for violence, particularly when it comes to acts of mass killing.

Yes, violence in the media does have an impact, as noted consistently in studies from decades ago, Dubow said, including a Surgeon General's report that found high levels of exposure to TV violence was "a" cause of aggressive behavior, but not "the" cause.

"To blame all of the mass shootings or all of the violence in society on one factor is foolish," Dubow said. "Many factors lead to aggressive behavior, not just one. ... When these combine and accumulate, over time we're going to see aggressive and violent behavior.

"But that's separate from mass shootings."

In fact, those same factors are prevalent throughout the world, and yet, as the New York Times reported, there have been 32 mass killings by firearms in the United States this year, with a mass killing, as defined by the Justice Department, "as three or more killings in a single episode." But because the definition of what is and isn't a mass killing is variable, the numbers are often adjusted according to politics and other factors.

While everyone agrees we have a problem with mass shootings, we lack the consensus and moral fortitude to truly take those steps to prevent them. Yes, we need to consider how we portray and glorify violence in video games - for example, in one study Bushman lead, they found that "exposure to violent video games increases children's dangerous behavior around real firearms" - but curbing access to these kinds of weapons is the first, easiest, and most logical step to take.

At least, it should be.

"We know for sure gun laws reduce gun-related deaths in the U.S.," Bushman said. "There's no doubt about that fact. Gun laws work.

Texto completo: El magnate Jeffrey Epstein acabó con su vida ahorcándese en la celda del Centro Corrección Metropolitano de Manhattan (Nueva York) . La oficina forense de la ciudad hizo público este viernes el análisis que deriva de la autopsia.
La muerte del multimillonario de 66 años había cuestionado cómo un preso acusado de abuso de menores y tráfico sexual pudo escapar de una cárcel para delincuentes de alto perfil . Las teorías de la conspiración rececorrieron las redes sociales y los platós de televisión de algunas cadenas conservadoras. Hasta el propio Donald Trump compartió la acusación infundada que responsabilizaba a Bill Clinton de la muerte del magnate, amigo de ambos presidentes.
La Oficina de prisiones comunicó en el momento de la muerte que la causa había sido un “aparente suicidio”, pero eso no acalló planteamientos más o menos inverosímiles . Más aún cuando la autopsia no se reveló el domingo, tal y como se había anunciado.
A lo largo de esta semana han crecido las críticas hacia la cárcel que hasta el capo de la droga Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera tachó de “tortura” y donde el acusado no estaba bajo vigilancia constante por riesgo de suicidio, a pesar de haber intentado acabar con su vida dos semanas antes de su muerte. En su lugar, el régimen de supervición requería una visita de los oficiales cada media hora. Pero el cuando hallaron su cuerpo hacía tres horas que nadie pasaba por su celda y más tarde se reveló que uno de los dos agentes que lo supervisaba no tenía la formación necesaria .
Incluso el fiscal general de Estados Unidos, William Barr, denunció serias irregularidades en una cárcel federal que está bajo su propia supervisión. Un representante anónimo del personal de la cárcel también se quejó de las condiciones de trabajo del lugar ya que los trabajadores se ven obligados a trabajar turnos dobles y triples. Por otro lado, Epstein había estado varios días sin compañero de celda, pese a las exigencias federales.
Ya este jueves The Washington Post y The New York Times adelantaron que la autopsia había hallado varios huesos rotos en el cuello del preso. Ese anuncio volvió a avivar las especulaciones de homicidio por estrangulamiento . La forense principal de la ciudad de Nueva York, Barbara Sampson, dijo entonces que ningún factor aislado de una autopsia puede proporcionar una respuesta concluyente.
Epstein estaba acusado de crear una red de tráfico sexual de menores hace una década en sus mansiones de Nueva York y Florida, y se había declarado inocente de los cargos. El millonario ya había afrontado acusaciones similares en Florida en 2008, aunque entonces llegó a un acuerdo con el fiscal Alexander Acosta, posteriormente secretario de Trabajo en la Administración de Trump, que tuvo que renunciar a este cargo por el escándalo desatado por un pacto secreto ocultado a las víctimas.

Texto completo: A year ago today, more than 200 newspapers across the U.S. ran editorials decrying President Donald Trump’s repeated application of the term "enemies of the people" to describe the press and reinforcing the need for a vibrant free press in a healthy democracy. There is still cause for concern.
Since that show of solidarity, the U.S. has fallen three places in Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index ranking. We’re now 48th out of 180 countries surveyed.
Data compiled by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker points to an escalation in violence: By April, there had been 10 reported attacks on journalists this year alone and 46 since 2017, including a reporter in California who was struck in the face and had her phone stolen as she interviewed voters.
It’s not just the U.S. In some places, threats against journalists are now "occupational hazards" — in Brazil, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have attacked members of the media both online and physically.
And President Trump continues to attack the media, revisiting the "enemy of the people" slogan in June when he accused The New York Times of a "virtual act of treason." Such attacks, whether from the president or any person in power, must be resisted.
The press is not perfect, to be sure. But to vilify the entire institution because of its imperfections poses a very real danger to America’s freedom.
In one of our first editorials on the topic in December 2016, we weren’t necessarily thinking of physical harm when we warned that the assault on the press is dangerous. We wrote: "It undermines our democracy.
"It allows those in power to say, ‘Ignore the facts no matter what the facts may be.’ "It allows partisans of both parties to say, ‘Believe in my distortions because you agree with my ideology.’ Or, ‘because you agree with my cult personality.’ "It allows anyone who screws up to say, ‘The problem’s not me; the problem’s the messenger.’ " The "enemy of the people" refrain can provide a useful political rhetorical slogan. But repeating such a slogan, a practice common among history’s strongmen, and infusing it with a tone of legitimacy is not a harmless political device.
Writer Richard Frankel described the impact in a June 9 article for Salon: "After all," he wrote, "enemies are not debated. Enemies are not reasoned with. One doesn’t compromise with an enemy. An enemy is confronted, is combated, is neutralized, and ultimately, an enemy is destroyed. The point at which politics shifts from truth to lies, from opponents to enemies, is the point at which democracy dies."
That distinction, that warning, is as important to remember today as it was a year ago.
Facts matter. Support a Free Press.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke is coming to Mississippi Friday, according to his campaign.
O'Rourke, a former U.S. representative from El Paso, Texas, had taken a break from campaigning after 22 people were gunned down in a Walmart at the city on the U.S.-Mexico border.
O'Rourke's campaign said he will "offer the Jackson, Mississippi, immigrant community support" after federal agents raided chicken processing plants in Morton, arresting nearly 700 people suspected of being in the country illegally.
O'Rourke said Thursday immigrants had been "terrorized" in recent days — both by the El Paso shooting, and during the federal raids in Mississippi.
"Six hundred people who came to this country for the privilege of working the toughest, s---tiest jobs, that no one else here would allow their children to work — in chicken processing plants, in picking cotton, in working in the gym, working two or three shifts, maybe making a minimum wage, if they are lucky," O'Rourke said. "Far too often, their immigration status is used as leverage against them to pay them something far less or nothing at all. The kind of modern day bondage that is taking place right now in America."
Details of the visit According to an email from his campaign, O'Rourke will visit a Hispanic grocery store in Canton at 10:30 a.m.
There had been a second event planned for the afternoon at a Hispanic outreach center run by the Methodist church, but that event was canceled.
"Due to security concerns, Beto will be meeting with families in private," said Lauren Hitt, a campaign spokeswoman.
The raids detained mostly Latino workers in what marked the largest workplace sting in at least a decade. Of those, about 300 were given future court dates and released, but they can't return to work.
O'Rourke, who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2018, has struggled to break into the top tier of Democratic candidates for President.
The New York Times reports that O'Rourke is now framing his campaign "as a moral crusade against" President Donald Trump.

Here to Help; One Thing You Can Do to Counteract Climate Change

Texto completo: Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
By Susan Shain
You bring your canvas bags to the grocery store. You walk to work. You've cut back on the hamburgers (and the cheese plates, too). But you want to do more to fight climate change. Specifically, you want to do more with your money.
You could purchase carbon offsets. Or, you could support politicians who believe in climate change. Or, you could just donate to your favorite green nonprofit. But what makes the most sense?
Though giving is highly personal and there's no single right answer, Rachel Cleetus, an economist and policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said she would first funnel her money toward politicians -- both local and national -- who would most likely be proactive when it comes to the climate. That's because, although we have the technology to transition away from fossil fuels, Dr. Cleetus said, "the biggest stumbling block to bold action has been a lack of political will."
Rob Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University and chairman of the Global Carbon Project, agreed. While he said he supported carbon offsets, calling their purchase "the most concrete thing you can do with your money," Dr. Jackson said they aren't "changing the system as quickly as we need the system to change."
There is, of course, an element of risk involved in political donations. Your dollars could ripple outward, helping to incite a revolution, or they could vanish into the ether, paying for a Facebook ad no one clicks on. And, even a dynamic candidate could prove ineffectual once in office.
That's basically the opposite of a high-quality offset: In that case, you know what you're getting but the effect is unlikely to multiply.
Still, Dr. Jackson said, "we're at such a critical juncture" with the climate that he'd take the risk of a political donation.
"What we need today is a way to leverage our funds into greater action," he said. "If I had just one $ 500 check to write, I could offset part of my emissions and feel good about that and have done something meaningful. But it won't change the political layout of our country."
Politics not your thing? Dr. Cleetus would focus next on grass roots climate organizations, particularly those led by young people. Youth-led groups, she said, bring "moral clarity" to the issue of climate change, which means they could shift the needle on policy and public opinion. "This is really about a shared common destiny for our children and our grandchildren," she said. "So I think calling attention to their voices is really, really important."
You could also seek out organizations that focus on food waste, forest protection and restoration, girls' education or carbon pollution.
These are the areas that Project Drawdown, through analysis of data from research organizations and peer-reviewed studies, has identified as having the "largest global potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon," according to Crystal Chissell, the organization's vice president of operations and engagement.
Whichever path you choose, be sure to tell your friends and family why you're giving, and encourage them to take whatever action they can.
"This is not a challenge we can overcome as individuals," Dr. Cleetus said. It's only "by pooling collective resources, whether it's time or dollars or political action, that we will get to solutions."

I was in Plymouth, England, this week to speak with Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who has helped spark a global youth movement. She set sail Wednesday afternoon during a brief pause in the day's rain. Destination: New York City.
You probably know by now why she is sailing. Ms. Thunberg doesn't fly because of aviation's outsize carbon footprint. She takes pains to say that she is not prescribing to others what they should do or whether everyone should give up flying or go vegan. She says she is doing this because she wants to.
There are at least three things on her agenda when she gets to New York City. A global youth strike is planned for Friday, Sept. 20, which she expects to join. The next day, she plans to participate in the United Nations youth summit, along with an estimated 600 others from all over the world. On the following Monday, she will address the United Nations climate summit.
The secretary general, António Guterres, has warned that he does not want world leaders to simply say the right things at the climate summit, but instead make specific commitments to transition away from a fossil-fuel powered economy. Mr. Guterres has repeatedly said that he wants countries to stop building new coal plants and using government money to subsidize them.
What will they actually promise? We don't yet know. Expect some pledges to bring down their national emissions to net zero by 2050. "This is a big opportunity for those world leaders who say they've been listening to us to actually show that they've been listening to us, to actually prove that," Ms. Thunberg told me the day before she set sail.
We spoke on the boat that will be her home for the next two weeks: a racing yacht with solar panels known as the Malizia II. We will update you when she arrives.

Greetings. We got a lot of mail about last week's item on swapping, sharing and donating household items. A couple of readers pointed out that we could have mentioned the Buy Nothing Project.
They're right. So, here it is: The Buy Nothing Project is a worldwide network of community "freecycling" groups. People request what they need and others get rid of stuff they no longer want. Groups are closed, so you have to request membership for your area, and you can only belong to one area. Check it out at buynothingproject.org.
Thanks for reading, and see you next week.
We'd love your feedback on this newsletter. Please email thoughts and suggestions to climateteam@nytimes.com .
If you like what we're doing, please spread the word and send this to your friends. You can sign up here to get our newsletter delivered to your inbox each week.
And be sure to check out our full assortment of free newsletters from The Times.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa - U.S. Rep. Steve King on Wednesday defended his call for a ban on all abortions by questioning whether "there would be any population of the world left if not for births due to rape and incest.
Speaking before a conservative group in the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale, the Iowa congressman reviewed legislation he has sought that would outlaw abortions without exceptions for rape and incest. King justified the lack of exceptions by questioning how many people would be alive if not for those conceived through rapes and incest.
"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that? King asked, according to The Des Moines Register, which covered the event. "Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that.
He added: "It's not the baby's fault for the sin of the father, or of the mother.
A King spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.
The nine-term Republican congressman, who represents a sprawling, largely rural 39-county district, has been criticized repeatedly for comments he's made over the years, especially on issues related to race and immigration.
Shortly before the November 2018 election, The Washington Post reported that King met in Austria with the far-right Freedom Party, a group with Nazi ties. King said the meeting was with business leaders, including one person from the Freedom Party, but the newspaper stood by its story.
Soon after the election, King was quoted in a New York Times story saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive? The comments were denounced as racist and led the House to vote 424-1 to rebuke King. Republican leaders also stripped him of his committee assignments.
Although King has usually breezed to victories in the conservative 4th Congressional District, he narrowly won his last election over Democrat J.D. Scholten.
This year, several candidates have said they will challenge King for the Republican nomination, including conservative state Sen. Randy Feenstra. Scholten also recently announced he'd again run for the seat.
After King's comment Wednesday, Feenstra said in a statement, "I am 100% pro-life but Steve King's bizarre comments and behavior diminish our message & damage our cause.
Scholten also criticized King.
"Yet again, Steve King puts his selfish, hateful ideology above the needs of the people of Iowa's 4th District. Excusing violence - in any way - is entirely unacceptable, Scholten said in a statement.
In a tweet, U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in House leadership, called King's comments "appalling and bizarre and added "it's time for him to go.
Several Democratic presidential candidates noted King's comments and urged people to contribute to Scholten's campaign.
"You would think it would be pretty easy to come out against rape and incest, one of the presidential candidates, Pete Buttigieg, said in a statement. "Then again, you'd think it'd be pretty easy to come out against white nationalism.

Texto completo: Lake County State’s Attorney Mike Nerheim announced a lawsuit Tuesday against e-cigarette manufacturer Juul Labs, contending the company "intentionally created addicted teen customers to continuously come back looking for another fix." The merits of the specific case against Juul will be sorted out in court, but there is a broader reach to the alarm bells that Nerheim is sounding. In short, teen vaping is here, it’s dangerous and it poses the threat of a broad epidemic.
Illinois lawmakers recognized that truth when they included e-cigarettes in a new law that prohibits the sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products to anyone under 21 years old. Juul, it is worth pointing out, has launched major ad campaigns with some of the nation’s largest print and online news organizations declaring its support for such restrictions on the sale of vapor products.
The sincerity of Juul’s appeal may be open to question, but there’s no room for doubt that it and Illinois’ new regulations are running several steps behind the e-cigarette monster that is rampaging through suburban middle and high schools.
At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, Stevenson High School senior Vrushali Thakkar described classrooms in which students use e-cigarettes when teachers leave the room. A New York Times story this week reports the son of an anti-e-cigarette activist describing the flavors he and his friends prefer and the appeal to some kids of products whose higher nicotine content provide "a bigger head rush."
But, evidence isn’t merely anecdotal. The National Institute on Drug Abuse cites studies showing that more than 16% of high school seniors — and nearly 10% of eighth-graders have used e-cigarettes in the past month. Another National Institutes of Health survey found that about 37% of high school seniors reported vaping in 2018. The figure was 28% a year earlier.
While vape companies like to declare that their product is intended only to help people stop smoking, they may be working toward the precise opposite. The NIH report points to studies showing that nearly 31 percent of students who vape graduate to traditional cigarettes and tobacco products within six months.
According to The New York Times, Trump administration health officials recognize the problem and are considering counter measures. The outgoing FDA commissioner proposed isolating e-cigarette products at retailers where they won’t be accessible to teenagers and requiring merchants to demand purchasers show identification.
If adopted, such measures may be a start. But the situation also requires a broader societal response. Nerheim predicted Tuesday that "it will take years" to overcome the impact e-cigarettes have made on the present generation of teenagers. That is not going to happen merely by punishing companies that have made impressionable children think it’s harmless and cool to use their dangerous product. It also requires broad recognition by all of us of the need to make them realize that neither of those things is true.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – The Quality Rock & Roll Revue features soulful rock and roll songs from throughout Nick Lowe's career—including his biggest hits—as well as selections from two recent EPs recorded with Los Straitjackets. Los Straitjackets provide backup for Nick as well as perform a short segment of their own instrumental surf guitar twangers.
CAPA presents Nick Lowe's Quality Rock & Roll Revue starring Los Straitjackets at the Davidson Theatre (77 S. High St.) at 8 p.m. Sept. 24. Tickets are $35 and $40 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at (614) 469-0939 or (800) 982-2787.
Lowe has made his mark as a producer (Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, Pretenders, The Damned), a songwriter of at least three songs you know by heart, a short-lived pop star, and a long-term musicians' musician.
From 1995's "The Impossible Bird" to 2011's "The Old Magic," Lowe has turned out a fantastic string of albums, each one devised in his West London home and recorded with a core of musicians who possess the same veteran savvy. Lowe brings wit and understated excellence to every performance, leading Ben Ratliff of the New York Times to describe his live show as "elegant and nearly devastating."
His new four-song EP, "Tokyo Bay," features Los Straitjackets as his backing band.
Los Straitjackets are the leading practitioners of the lost art of instrumental guitar. With the music of the Ventures, The Shadows, and with Link Wray and Dick Dale as a jumping-off point, the band has taken their unique, high energy brand of original rock and roll around the world. Clad in their trademark Lucha Libre Mexican wrestling masks, the "Jackets" have delivered their trademark guitar licks to 16 albums, thousands of concerts, and dozens of films and TV shows.
Their most recent album, What's So Funny 'Bout Peace Love & Los Straitjackets, consists of instrumental covers of Nick Lowe songs.

Salisbury native gets $725K in suit against neo-Nazi

Texto completo: "There is power in sharing your story, especially given the national climate right now. You have to engage in these conversations to move forward."
Taylor Dumpson
When one Salisbury native became the first black woman to serve as student government president at American University, it wasn't ribbons and posters catching the nation's eyes in 2017.
It was bananas and threatening messages hung from nooses around the Washington D.C. campus on her first day in office.
But she might be getting some closure this week.
Taylor Dumpson won a lawsuit Friday against the neo-Nazi website operator who organized an online harassment campaign against her.
A federal judge granted default judgement to the Wicomico High School graduate, awarding her more than $725,000 after The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin and a follower failed to respond to her lawsuit, according to the Associated Press.
Along with compensatory damages of $101,429.28, punitive damages of $500,000 and attorneys' fees and costs of $124,022.10 awarded, the judge also entered a restraining order against Anglin, his Moonbase Holdings limited liability company and Brian Andrew Ade.
Anglin had posted an article about the hanging installations, directing followers to "troll storm" Dumpson on social media, and according to her lawsuit, the publisher directed his known neo-Nazi site's readers to cyberbully her.
The lawsuit states that for days after the article was published, Dumpson was attacked with hateful comments on multiple social media platforms.
Dumpson lost an unhealthy amount of weight as a result of the article. She "experienced flashbacks, nightmares, depression, anxiety and disordered eating, and engaged in avoidance behavior, as a result of these events," according to the lawsuit, as previously reported by Delmarva Now.
But she also took the experience as a chance to empower others — looking to inspire people to confront hatred and injustice nonconfrontationally.
Dumpson was interviewed about the incident and her resolve by CNN and national publications including the New York Times and Washington Post, and recorded a stand-up discussion on TEDx Talks in June 2017, as previously reported by Delmarva Now.
"There is power in sharing your story, especially given the national climate right now," she told Delmarva Now back in 2017. "You have to engage in these conversations to move forward."
Dumpson also said her journey to embrace diversity and social justice started in one corner of Salisbury — Wi-Hi.
"Wi-Hi introduced me to social justice before I understood the meaning of the phrase," she said in 2017. "It sparked my interest in things like redistricting in Wicomico County and how we fund our education system."
Dumpson made her way to the private university after graduating, and she continued to promote tolerance and inclusiveness — eventually opening the conversation on a national scale that summer.
She ultimately left the post — receiving treatment for post-traumatic stress according to her suit — but her case was reportedly meant to show people will be held accountable for their unlawful attacks to a person online.
Now, her representation says this ruling should send a loud message to other white supremacists.
"They can and will be held accountable for hateful activity that constitutes unlawful discrimination, no matter whether it occurs online or in the real world," Kristen Clarke told the AP, serving as president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
"There is power in sharing your story, especially given the national climate right now. You have to engage in these conversations to move forward."

New calls for Steve King's resignation

Texto completo: "What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?"
Rep. Steve King
U.S. Rep. Steve King told the Westside Conservative Club on Wednesday that humanity might not exist if not for rape and incest throughout human history.
"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?" he said in Urbandale. "Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that."
The Kiron Republican was discussing his defense of not allowing exceptions for rape and incest in the anti-abortion legislation he tried to pass in Congress. Republican leadership had prevented bills he sponsored on banning abortions from advancing through the House, despite GOP support for the measures, King said.
Just because a conception happened in bad circumstances doesn't mean the result isn't a person, King, who is Catholic, argued.
"It's not the baby's fault for the sin of the father, or of the mother," he said.
King went over his positions on abortion and a variety of other issues, including immigration, guns and more, when he talked to a group of 50 people at the Machine Shed in Urbandale at a breakfast meeting.
He also discussed the criticism he faced over a New York Times quote on white nationalism and white supremacy in January. He said he was told by political insiders that there was a plot to take him out of power.
He cited state Sen. Randy Feenstra's Jan. 9 campaign announcement, a day before the Times quoted King saying "white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
"People think it was an organic media feeding frenzy, but no, it was orchestrated from the beginning," he said Wednesday. "They had told me, 'Heads up before Christmas: They're going to try to drive you out of office and get you to resign.' Within 24 hours, you had people saying 'resign, resign, resign.' Why? Because the New York Times misquoted me?"
King said there was a plan for President Donald Trump to criticize him as well, but he met with Trump and said there's "no signal from Donald Trump that he's anything other than supportive of me."
That didn't stop other members of his party from coming after him, he said. Multiple high-level Republicans decried King's comments in January and others have publicly supported Feenstra's primary bid.
King was also removed from his House committee assignments by U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Later in January, the House passed a condemnation of white supremacy and white nationalism.
While he does not support the "odious ideology" of white nationalism, King said he supports his defense of the West, calling the United States "the flagship for Western civilization."
Some Westside Conservative Club members, like Rick Herron, a 72-year-old Clive resident, said they liked what King had to say. Herron said he has been a supporter of King's policies in the past, but was glad to get the chance to hear the "white nationalism" controversy story from his perspective.
"I did get a little better understanding of what he went through, in terms of the 'Never Trumpers' attack on him and setting him up for condemnation," Herron said. "You expect the Democrats to attack him, but not the Never Trumpers — members of his own party."

"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?"
Rep. Steve King
"It's not the baby's fault for the sin of the father, or of the mother," U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Kiron, said Wednesday in defense of his anti-abortion bill that did not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.

Texto completo: After finding housing for more than 200 people who have been staying in an emergency shelter at the Portland Expo, city officials said Wednesday they will meet a looming deadline to move all migrant families out of the professional basketball arena by the end of Thursday.
Officials also said they now hope to avoid moving any of the remaining families to another temporary overnight shelter in the Salvation Army gym.
Since early June, 437 people - mostly asylum seekers from Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo - have flowed into the city from the southern U.S. border and arrived at the Portland Expo, which the city converted into an emergency shelter to handle the sudden influx. City officials say they need to close the shelter Thursday so the facility can be turned back over to the Maine Red Claws basketball team, which plans to resurface the basketball court before the beginning of its training camp.
Families who have not been moved into apartments or host homes by Thursday will be moved to Portland's Family Shelter or, if there is no room available there, into the gymnasium at the Salvation Army.
Officials in Portland and nearby communities, immigrant community leaders and nonprofit groups have been working intensely to find permanent or temporary housing for the 132 people who remained at the Expo at the beginning of this week, a difficult task given the tight housing market in southern Maine. By Wednesday afternoon, the number of people at the Expo had dropped to 118 and more were expected to move into temporary housing or host homes by Thursday afternoon.
City Hall Communications Director Jessica Grondin said 212 people have been placed in temporary housing in multiple communities in southern Maine. City funding and the state's General Assistance voucher program helps pay for rents. An additional 30 families have moved into temporary host homes, according to the Greater Portland Council of Governments, which helped to set up and coordinate the program.
'now it's manageable'
On Wednesday, 12 people moved out of the Expo into housing in Scarborough, while another 28 more were expected to move Thursday into temporary housing in Brunswick and Bath. Families have also moved into temporary housing in Lewiston and Portland.
Papy Kashama Bongibo, president of the Congolese Community of Maine, said he believes only three to five families will still be waiting for temporary housing by Thursday afternoon.
At the Expo on Wednesday afternoon, a handful of parents packed suitcases and bags while their children played nearby. Dozens of cots used by families that have found other housing were stacked along one wall. At the back of the gym, children crawled into forts they made out of suitcases, sheets and overturned portable cribs.
Grondin said the temporary shelter at the Expo will begin closing after lunch is served Thursday.
The prospect of using the Salvation Army gym has been a source of concern. Unlike at the Expo, families would have to leave the Salvation Army gym from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and would sleep on floor mats instead of cots. Meals have also been served at the Expo, while people who stay at the Salvation Army gym would have access to breakfasts and dinners at the city's General Assistance office nearby.
By Wednesday afternoon, Grondin said the city may be able to avoid using that facility entirely because the remaining families may be able to stay at the Family Shelter, which provides beds and 24-hour access.
Bongibo said he was scared there would be a large number of families with no place to go during the day, and has been reaching out to churches in the community to see if they have space. But he said Wednesday he is relieved that so many have found temporary housing.
"Now it's manageable. We can find a space for them," he said. "As a community, we're trying to do what we can to help."
Bongibo said he has spoken with many of the asylum seekers who had been staying at the Expo and heard no negativity from them about their new housing arrangements. The families that have moved into host homes are excited to be welcomed by the host families, he said.
"They're giving families a chance to start a better life," Bongibo said of the host families.
'we are feeling thankful'
Families inside the Expo on Wednesday were nervous about sharing their stories with reporters and several declined to be interviewed.
One Congolese family that did agree to share their story through an interpreter said they are grateful for the kindness and generosity that Portland and Maine have shown them.
Mao and Makina, who gave birth to a child on the Mexican border three months ago, will be moving Thursday into a host family's home in Brunswick. They've never been to Brunswick before, but say they have heard good things about the town. They declined to give their last name.
"We are feeling thankful to the city of Portland. The end of something is always better than the beginning," said Mao, who plans to study computer science. His wife, Makina, says she wants to study the English language so that she can share it with her newborn and 6-year-old daughter and to use her skills to communicate with her fellow Americans. She also wants to study to become a nurse.
"I love America. I used to dream of moving to America," she said.
Margaret Born, a 23-year-old New Hampshire resident who grew up in southern Africa, has been volunteering two or three days a week to play with children at the Expo. After reading a New York Times article about the influx of asylum seekers in Maine, she felt compelled to volunteer because she speaks French and Portuguese.
As asylum seekers packed belongings and talked to city employees, Born sat on the floor in the middle of the Expo to play with three small children. The children, who have been attending summer school in Portland, have shared with her their excitement about new backpacks and colored pencils, while their parents enthusiastically practice English with her, she said.
"This space was really hard for them. There's no privacy and no quiet," Born said. "The parents are so exhausted. They have to navigate this whole new world with a language they barely speak."
After the shelter at the Expo closes Thursday, city employees will continue to locate housing for the families that remain in the city's shelter system. Some of the nearly $1 million donated to the city to help asylum seekers was used to hire two extra housing counselors and two extra financial eligibility specialists, Grondin said.

Stacey Abrams thinks she oughta be vice president, and the media is playing along

Texto completo: Now we know why failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams blitzed newsrooms this week.
She is auditioning to serve as vice president to whichever 2020 Democratic primary campaign makes her the most attractive offer.
“I would be honored to be considered by any nominee,” she said in an interview published Wednesday by the New York Times.
She said earlier during an address Tuesday at the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades convention in Las Vegas, “There are only two things stopping us in 2020: that people have a reason to vote, and that they have the right to vote. I’ve decided to leave it to a whole bunch of other people to make sure they have a reason to vote.”
Almost immediately after Abrams announced she would not run in 2020, several Democratic primary candidates lined up to thank her for her service, to congratulate her for being a leader, and to send out none-too-subtle VP feelers.
“We can't solve any of the challenges we face — from health care to gun violence to climate change — without fixing our democracy. Thank you, [Stacey Abrams], for your leadership,” former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke said on social media.
Sen. Kamala Harris said later in a radio interview, “I am a big fan of Stacy Abrams. I came down to Georgia to campaign for her, and she would definitely and should be on anybody's list, including mine, but I got to win it first before I have that conversation."
Prior to having her noncandidacy reported eagerly by the New York Times, Abrams’ team made sure that the way was paved first with exceptionally deferential media profiles and softball media interviews. Just this week alone, Abrams starred in a glowing New Yorker profile, a glowing Vogue profile, a glowing New York Times op-ed, a glowing Washington Post news report, and several friendly appearances on cable news.
Abrams announcement this week that she is open to serving as vice president, after saying the exact opposite in March, has been greeted with predictable giddiness by some of the #Resistance regulars.
"YIPEEE!!!" tweeted the Washington Post's self-declared conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin.
“A ticket of [Kamala Harris] and [Stacey Abrams]?” asked Columbia professor and Foreign Policy contributor David Rothkopf. “They wouldn't just beat Trump. He'd turn to dust the moment he heard that was the ticket. It's a whole different world, folks. They would obliterate him. And we would all be the beneficiaries.”
Sure thing.
As best I can tell, excitement for Abrams comes primarily from the press and politicos. Admiration for the failed gubernatorial candidate does not appear to extend too far beyond these circles. In fact, her overall approval rating in her own state, where she lost her gubernatorial bid by tens of thousands of votes, last measured at roughly 44%, down from 51% in January, according to a survey released in April by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
The survey, which was conducted between March 24 and April 8 and surveyed 774 registered voters in Georgia, also found her disapproval number in the state increased in that same time period from 40% to 44%.
These are not terrible numbers, but this is not exactly rock star material either.
All of this is to say: The hype surrounding Abrams possibly joining a 2020 Democratic campaign as a vice presidential candidate may be in the heads of the same members of the press who are all too eager to overlook her failures while also indulging her in her election-truther conspiracies.
And if you are wondering how press-generated excitement has worked out in the past for Democratic media darlings, look no further than failed Georgia congressional candidate Jon Ossoff, failed Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, failed Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, and failed Texas Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke.

Prison negligence is responsible for Jeffrey Epstein's death

Texto completo: The most important prisoner in the United States reportedly killed himself, and investigators want to know how. But the answer is pretty easy.

According to a new report by the New York Times, two staff members charged with guarding Epstein’s cell fell asleep and failed to check on him for three hours. After Epstein was found dead, they falsified records to hide their mistake. The two employees, along with the warden of the prison, have been placed on administrative leave and could face additional consequences depending on the conclusion of the Department of Justice’s investigation.

Epstein, 66, had been accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls and was awaiting trial in New York when he reportedly hanged himself with a bedsheet. The financier was connected to many rich, powerful people, including Bill Clinton, Britain’s Prince Andrew, and President Trump. What he could have told prosecutors has led many to question the legitimacy of his alleged suicide.

But so far, the facts point to the routine negligence and carelessness of public employees charged with caring for prisoners. In the Atlantic, Ken White shared 32 stories of gruesome prison deaths that evince a pattern in the U.S. prison system. Guards often show little concern for the individuals they’re charged with watching and protecting, and prisons rarely have the resources necessary to properly care for prisoners.

Should we have expected Epstein to be any different? Perhaps. He was a monster who deserved to face justice, and the dirt he could have revealed would have been catastrophic. But to argue Epstein should have been an exception is to admit there’s a systemic problem he should never have faced. Epstein simply gave it a face.

Epstein’s death should anger us all — not just because a man escaped justice, but because our system failed, as it has thousands of prisoners. Justice demands answers, and it will get them. But don’t be surprised if they’re not the wild theories being throw around.

Negligence has taken the lives of many prisoners. Epstein might just be the most famous.

Texto completo: JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Donald Trump Jr., visiting Indonesia's capital on Tuesday to promote two Trump-branded resorts, defended his father, President Trump, and their family's company against allegations that their global business presented conflicts of interest for the president.
The president's son, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said that the company had walked away from deals that could have made tens of millions of dollars so as not to create the appearance of any improprieties.
"We made a very conscious decision of the family not to do that right now," he told reporters. "We have turned down a lot of deals."
He also defended his father against any suggestions that the family's international business interests could affect his foreign policy.
"He wouldn't make decisions on a country based on a real estate deal," Mr. Trump said. "I would like to shut down that nonsense right here."
Mr. Trump was in Jakarta for a private event with wealthy prospective buyers to promote the sale of residential units at two planned luxury resorts in Indonesia that have yet to be built.
He and his billionaire business partner, Hary Tanoesoedibjo, chairman of the MNC Group, held a news conference to extol the virtues of the two Trump-branded resorts, one in Bali and the other at Lido, south of Jakarta. The resorts will include hotels, golf courses and residential units.
After Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he said in a Twitter post that he would embark on "no new deals." But the Trump Organization said it was keeping the Indonesia projects because Mr. Trump had signed binding contracts with Mr. Hary in 2015.
Mr. Trump initially reported receiving between $ 2 million and $ 10 million for the projects. The agreement does not call for the Trump Organization to put up any money.
The two projects have been slow to progress.
Mr. Trump Jr. and Mr. Hary were vague on specifics Tuesday, and reporters were not shown a promotional video for the projects that was shown to guests at the event.
But Mr. Hary said he expected both projects to be completed in three years and valued them together at $ 1.7 billion.
The Trump International Resort, Golf Club and Residences Bali is planned for the site of the former Nirwana Pan-Pacific Hotel overlooking an iconic temple, Tanah Lot, a popular tourist destination. Building near the sacred site is controversial, but Mr. Hary has promised to abide by Bali's strict setback and height regulations.
The Nirwana was demolished last year to make way for the new project. A reporter who visited the site in April saw no sign that construction had begun.
Trump International Resort, Golf Club and Residences Lido, to be built about 45 miles south of Jakarta, is to be part of a larger project known as Lido City, which is to include a theme park, hospital, restaurants and other facilities. The 7,400-acre project is billed as a "Live, Work and Play destination."
Mr. Hary said work on the Lido golf course was 80 percent complete and that construction of the resort buildings would begin after it was finished. He offered no similar details for the Bali project.
Last year, the MNC Group said it would receive $ 500 million in financing from an arm of Metallurgical Corporation of China, a state-owned construction company, to build the theme park.
The deal falls under the umbrella of China's Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious plan to spread money and influence by financing infrastructure and other projects worldwide, a high priority for China's leader, Xi Jinping.
Mr. Hary said the theme park and the Trump resort were not connected and that China would not provide financing for the Trump-branded project.
According to an MNC presentation in February, the Lido project is slated to have a 120-room hotel, an 18-hole golf course designed by the professional golfer Ernie Els, and a complex of 438 luxury villas and condominiums.
The Bali resort is to include 368 luxury condos and villas, a 150-unit hotel and an 18-hole golf course designed by the golfer Phil Mickelson.
Mr. Hary, who heads his own political party, the United Indonesia Party, or Perindo, was a candidate for vice president in 2014 and has talked of running for president. But he backed President Joko Widodo in his successful re-election campaign this year.
He insisted that his business and political activities did not overlap. "The business with the Trump Organization has nothing to do with my political career," he told reporters.
There have been local media reports that Mr. Hary's daughter, Angela Tanoesoedibjo, may be in the running for a position in Mr. Joko's new cabinet. The president's office has not confirmed that she is under consideration.
Even so, Mr. Hary's partnership with the American president appears to have produced little political benefit for either Mr. Trump or Mr. Hary, Indonesia's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, said last year in an interview with The New York Times.
The vice president, whose term ends in October, noted that Mr. Trump's business interests in Indonesia were not huge, relatively speaking, and said that Mr. Hary had not influenced diplomatic ties with the United States.
Indeed, Mr. Trump's behavior has baffled many Indonesians who follow events in America.
"Many think he is weird, an unusual president," Mr. Jusuf said. "Let's see how a president controls a country with Twitter."
In recent years, the projects in Indonesia have been small revenue generators for the Trump Organization, producing just $ 210,000 in 2018, according to President Trump's 2018 financial disclosure, released in May.
The event in Jakarta comes as the Trump Organization has publicly struggled to keep the family business growing in the two and a half years since Mr. Trump moved into the White House.
In the United States, the Trump Organization has backed away from plans to start two new hotel brands, Scion and American Idea.
It has also seen the removal of the Trump name from a half a dozen properties, including Trump SoHo and Trump International Hotel and Tower in Panama City, Panama.
Even new projects are delayed. Trump Tower Punta del Este in Uruguay is already nearly three years behind schedule.
But the Trump Organization has continued to push ahead, particularly with the small number of international projects that had already been under contract before Mr. Trump was elected president.
Besides the project in Uruguay and a recently completed building in Manila in the Philippines, the other major ongoing international projects include a second golf course in Dubai, several residential towers in India and the two projects in Indonesia.
Donald Trump Jr. has been the lead salesman for the Trump Organization's projects in Asia, an assignment that brought him last year to New Delhi, Kolkata, Pune and Mumbai in India.
That trip generated controversy when he was scheduled to give what sounded like a policy speech on relations between India and the United States. But the topic of the speech was ultimately changed, and he proclaimed that the trip to India was about family business, not foreign policy.
In Jakarta, Mr. Trump said that the Trump Organization's decision to forgo big business opportunities overseas was not being properly recognized.
"We could have kept doing deals," he said. "The media is never going to give us credit."

Texto completo: Not long after news that a shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, left at least 22 people dead, reports started swirling that the suspect had posted a manifesto on 8chan, an online forum.
Law enforcement officials are investigating a document posted there that is believed to be authored by the suspect, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius. The text contains racist rhetoric, blaming immigrants and Latinos for taking away jobs from Americans. It was uploaded fewer than 20 minutes before the shooting, according to CNN.
This isn't the first time 8chan has been tied to a mass shooter this year. Suspects in attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, and a synagogue in Poway, California, also are believed to have posted hateful manifestos on the site.
The Jewish Telegraphic Agency spoke to experts on extremism to learn more about 8chan, how it differs from similar forums and why it became a venue of choice for hate.
What is 8chan?
8chan is an online messaging forum created in 2014 by a computer programmer to protest censorship on another messaging board called 4chan. The programmer, Fredrick Brennan, was upset that 4chan banned discussions of Gamergate, a campaign to harass several women in the video gaming industry. Unlike other online forums, such as Reddit, 8chan lacks moderation measures meant to curb hateful content. It is rife with racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism posted by users. The site has a ban on illegal content but it is not closely enforced. Child pornography has been shared frequently on the site.
How does 8chan compare to other sites?
Keegan Hankes, a research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, calls the site "one of the most violent and racist online spaces that we track."
"What's actually really dangerous about this forum is not just that all of these hateful ideologies are present, but that they are all interwoven together and they're part of the same toxic community at once," Hankes told JTA.
There are many sites that are home to hateful rhetoric, including comparatively mainstream sites such as Reddit, or more fringe forums such as 4chan and Gab. Hankes said 8chan has created a community that "celebrates mass casualty violence."
"This is not an accident that we've seen many manifestos posted to the site in the immediate moments before a mass casualty," he said.
Oren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, said few conversations on the site do not contain bigotry.
"You can be sure that if somebody starts a thread about fluffy bunnies, it will be only a couple of posts before that devolves into hate as well," he said.
Why do attackers post on 8chan?
What makes the site so dangerous is that potential attackers aren't just looking to share their thoughts with like-minded people. They also aim to inspire others to commit violence, experts say.
"The fact that 8chan is used as a place to disseminate these hateful explanations for violence is because those shooters know and hope that the users will copycat," Segal said.
Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog that monitors conservative media, said that recent rhetoric in conservative media outlets has further emboldened users.
Carusone said there has been a shift in the past decade from conservative media echoing establishment ideas to ideas originating on fringe sites like 4chan and 8chan.
"When Tucker Carlson gets up there and warns about invasions and 'great replacement,' and that immigrants are going to make us dirtier, they see a lot of that stuff as a wink and a nod - as a demonstration that these major influencers across the sector are trying to encourage them to keep at their work," he said.
The "great replacement" is a widespread conspiracy theory that the white race faces a genocide due to immigration by people of color and Muslims.
What actions are being taken to stop hate on 8chan?
The CEO of Cloudflare, an internet services provider, announced that it was terminating its services to 8chan. The CEO, Matthew Prince, said the decision was motivated by the El Paso and Pittsburgh attacks. But he also said he did not think Cloudflare's decision would have a significant impact.
"While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online. It does nothing to address why mass shootings occur," he said.
Following Cloudflare's decision, 8chan found a replacement provider, Voxility, but that company pulled its services shortly after. Without a provider, 8chan goes dark.
Brennan, 8chan's founder, has even called for it to be shut down.
"It's a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there," Brennan, who no longer has control of the site, told The New York Times. "And you know what? It's a negative to them, too. They just don't realize it."
Some argue that shutting down sites like 8chan makes it harder for law enforcement to monitor the extremists who use them. But Hankes said it is helpful in decreasing hate on the internet.
"Any action that limits their impact and limits their reach is valuable," he said, "because this is so widespread and has been allowed to spread with very very little oversight on the internet for so long."

N.Y. Times demotes editor after controversy

Texto completo: The New York Times demoted one of its Washington editors on Tuesday as punishment for sparking controversy last week with tweets about Democratic members of Congress and for a related run-in with an author.
The editor, Jonathan Weisman, came under fire for tweets questioning whether Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) actually represented the Midwest and whether Reps. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) and John Lewis (D-Ga.) represented the Deep South, given that their districts are primarily urban and heavily minority.
Weisman said he was questioning whether the districts truly reflected the broader politics of their regions, which are predominantly white and more rural. He deleted the tweets after they were roundly criticized as racist.
He later asked author and Times contributor Roxane Gay for an "enormous apology" in an email after she called him out for those tweets and for criticizing him for identifying another congresswoman as African American without mentioning that her primary challenger is also African American. Gay posted Weisman's email to her and her assistant and criticized him for his "audacity and entitlement" for contacting her and her publisher to demand the apology.
A Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, said Weisman had apologized to Executive Editor Dean Baquet for "his recent serious lapses in judgment," but that he has been demoted and will no longer edit the newspaper's coverage of Congress. The Times didn't specify what Weisman's duties will be. The paper also said he would no longer be active on social media.
Baquet himself was on the defensive Monday as he fielded questions, comments and criticism for more than an hour in a newsroom-wide staff meeting. The Weisman affair was part of the discussion, as was a now-infamous front-page headline ("Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism") that appeared in the Times print edition last week. The headline inspired cancel-my-subscription outrage among liberals who said it soft-pedaled Trump's role in creating the very conditions he was claimed to be addressing in the wake of mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.
The internal dissension and various controversies reinforced the contentious atmosphere that seems to surround the Times.
In the age of Trump, no other news organization has taken quite the battering from the left and right as has the Times. The conservative faction is led by Trump, who regularly bashes the paper as "the Failing New York Times" and repeatedly smears it as "Fake News." But as last week's headline mini-flap demonstrated, liberals seem impatient with the Times, too, sometimes flaying it for not pushing back on Trump more aggressively in its news coverage.
More so than CNN, more than The Washington Post, more than any other mainstream news organization, the Times seems to be the sum of journalism's hopes and hatreds.
After hearing from his staff on Monday, Baquet was reflective, not defensive on Tuesday.
"I do accept that the Times draws more criticism because it has a special role in the journalism hierarchy," he said via email. "And we work really hard to earn that role. If we have a special status, it is partly because we have such an unusually wide breadth of coverage, which brings us praise as well as controversy across a wide swath of topics and countries.
"People hold us to a high standard because they want us to be better. I get that. And I want to listen to that view with humility."
Trump (who on Tuesday retweeted an old video clip of conservative gadfly James O'Keefe ambushing Baquet) has a long and rocky relationship with the paper, dating to his earliest days as a New York real estate developer in the 1970s ("He is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford," began a 1976 Times profile). But the greatest friction and agitation have come since 2015, when Trump launched his presidential campaign.
The Times (along with The Post) has landed scoop after scoop about the Trump campaign and his administration's inner workings, dysfunction and corruption. It has also been a leader in revealing Trump's personal deceptions; its multiple stories on Trump's history of business troubles and tax evasion, for example, have been unmatched for depth and breadth and unchallenged in their veracity. The latter have sparked state and federal investigations. Trump reserves special animus for Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman, whose coverage has unsettled him.
Such journalism has naturally prompted Trump Twitter tirades against the paper, but it also never seems to be enough for the opposition, the progressives who oppose Trump.
Many of these readers still seem sore about the Times's focus on Hillary Clinton's email server, and its limited coverage of the FBI's investigation of Trump's relationship with Russia during the 2016 campaign. In any case, Trump's fury at the Times is often matched by his ideological opposites. Among those calling out the paper for its "unity" headline last week was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), the liberal firebrand: "Let this front page serve as a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by - and often relies upon - the cowardice of mainstream institutions," she tweeted over an image of the Times's front page, which was later amended amid the social-media furor.
Times staffers say the constant criticism and agitation is background noise that doesn't deter them from doing their jobs, despite the somewhat restive mood at Monday's staff meeting.
"I think there was an editor who said, 'We're not at war, we're at work,' " said veteran Times staff writer John Schwartz, quoting a maxim coined by The Post's executive editor, Martin Baron. "People are angry, but you can't let that distract you from doing the work you do."
Schwartz added, "I'm not sure why we're so important to so many people emotionally, but it seems like a good thing on a lot of levels. It means you mean something to people."
Times White House correspondent Peter Baker said the newspaper "should be open to constructive criticism. It helps us do our job better. If people have thoughtful critiques of a story or a headline, we should listen respectfully and evaluate them on the merits. . . . What we shouldn't do is let the noise overcome our journalistic values."
Baker said, "It seems to me that some people want us to be something we're not - to take sides, specifically to take their side. We're not cheerleaders for the president nor are we the opposition."
Baquet said the paper will continue to pay attention to its critics on social media ("some of our most thoughtful critics and readers are there"), but won't be swept away by its rolling tides of sentiment.
A native of New Orleans, Baquet said he hears "different voices" when he goes back to the neighborhoods he grew up in. "Those voices are often less strident and self-assured, and frankly more empathetic than many of the ones I hear on social media," he said. "I want those in my head, too."

Texto completo: The police did not identify the gunman's motive but said he had been obsessed with mass shootings.
The gunman in last week's massacre in Dayton, Ohio, texted his sister and another victim minutes before the shooting, the Dayton Police Department said in a news conference on Tuesday. The police also said the gunman was obsessed with mass shootings, but they declined to say what motivated the attack.
With the help of extensive video surveillance, the police offered an updated timeline of the gunman's movements and actions in the hours before he killed nine people and wounded 17 others outside a bar in the city's popular Oregon entertainment district on Sunday, Aug. 4.
The police said the gunman went to the district on Friday night and returned with his sister and a friend at 11:04 p.m. on Saturday. "He was not unfamiliar with this territory," Chief Richard S. Biehl said.
After visiting a bar with them, the gunman left after midnight, the officials said, walking past a police vehicle to go to his car. They said he went there about 15 minutes before the shooting to retrieve an AR-15-style rifle, ammunition and body armor. He returned wearing a dark hoodie and carrying a backpack, which contained the weapon, they said.
His sister was among the first people he shot, Chief Biehl said. Though the gunman knew where she and her companion were, he said the department could not conclusively say whether she was a target.
"We have radically different views in this regard," he said of the many officers who reviewed the video evidence. "Based on the evidence of that night, I don't think we can make that call."
The gunman started shooting at 1:05 a.m., striking 26 people in 32 seconds before he was fatally shot by an officer. The chief added that the gunman did not wear his body armor in the most protective manner.
"Their response was crucial," Chief Biehl said of his officers. "Their response was immediate. Their response was effective. And their response was compassionate."
Chief Biehl did not say whether any victims were struck by bullets fired by his officers, leaving that ruling to the coroner's report.
The chief said that there was some evidence of drug paraphernalia in the gunman's car, and that he was awaiting toxicology reports to state whether there was evidence of drug use. He said the gunman had "undergone some treatment" but would not elaborate.
Female classmates of the gunman have said he threatened women with violence, but the chief did not speak about a specific motive during Tuesday's news conference.
"There's this history of obsession with violence and violence ideations, a discussion of an interest in mass shootings and the expression of a desire to carry out a mass shooting," Chief Biehl said. "I think that should be enough thematically that you should get a pretty clear picture of what was going on here."

DONALD TRUMP CAN DO NO RIGHT HIS SPEECH DESERVED PRAISE, BUT DIDN'T RECEIVE IT.

Texto completo: When the El Paso shooter's manifesto was first reported, it was an excellent time to disengage not only from social media, but also from its nominally more responsible relatives, the news giants. It was instantly obvious that 1) President Donald Trump would be blamed for the shooting; 2) he would be called upon to unite us; and 3) no matter what he actually did, he would be blamed again for giving a lousy response.
The media demanded Mr. Trump denounce white-supremacist thinking in his speech last week. So he did exactly that. He said, "in one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy," using the specific words for which the media had clamored. He gave a speech that would have been lavishly praised had a Democrat given it. But Mr. Trump is a Republican and Republicans can do no right.
Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto used to have a running gag about how the media covered awful news when Barack Obama was president: "Why do bad things always happen to him?" Mr. Taranto would sardonically inquire. National calamities were framed as matters that did unfortunate harm to Mr. Obama's reputation and even unsettled his vacations. "The war in Afghanistan follows Obama to his vacation in Hawaii," read the Washington Post headline on a 2016 story about the deaths of six soldiers, for which, as commander in chief, Mr. Obama was ultimately responsible.
If, say, Mitt Romney or George W. Bush had been president on Aug. 3, each of them would also have been blamed for inspiring the El Paso massacre, and whatever either of them said afterwards would have been labeled grossly inadequate, or worse. The major difference is that the magma-hot temperature of many of Mr. Trump's public remarks and tweets is considered by the media to give them license to be equally intemperate, even if it means making themselves look foolish.
The shooter specifically said his views predated Mr. Trump's rise, and he cited everything from Dr. Seuss's "The Lorax" to college debt to universal-basic-income proposals in his rather wide-ranging explanation of his murderous thoughts, but as his manifesto intersected with Mr. Trump's rhetoric via the single word "invasion," the media figured they might as well shift the blame to Mr. Trump, as though Mr. Trump were the first president to use overwrought language.
I would have been pleased if Mr. Trump had taken a moment to apologize for his intemperate use of the word "invasion" and acknowledged the humanity of illegal immigrants while maybe even admitting that this class of people isn't actually more criminally inclined than Americans. But, had he done so, would the media have responded with a hearty "Attaboy, Mr. President?" You and I both know the answer. The six-column headlines would have read, "President Virtually Admits Inspiring El Paso Shooter."
In short, this president can do no right, ever. Whether he is turning it up to 11 or dialing it down to three, he knows from experience the media will react with the same supercharged hostility. He knows from the popped balloon of the two-year Robert Mueller extravaganza that at no point will the media even admit to overplaying their hand; when one scandal peters out, they'll simply keep the hysteria level at Defcon 3 while shifting the new source of alleged crisis to some silly thing the president said on Twitter or, if all else fails, to a deliberate misconstruing of fact. "Trump falsely says the Constitution gives him 'the right to do whatever I want,'" the Washington Post reported breathlessly on July 23, though Mr. Trump was clearly referring to the power to fire Mr. Mueller, which he did in fact enjoy. As long as Mr. Trump resides in the White House, the media can never concede that any condition other than a state of emergency obtains in the United States of America.
After Mr. Trump condemned racism and bigotry, the New York Times changed its headline from "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM" to "ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS," shifting the goalposts before our very eyes, as though Mr. Trump were obliged to have as much hatred for a fundamental American right as Times readers do. Kirsten Powers, on CNN, said the speech amounted to "the arsonist saying they want to help put out the fire ... at a minimum it should make him feel some sort of culpability ... he is not in a position to be claiming to be condemning white supremacy." So Mr. Trump isn't allowed to condemn white supremacy? Max Boot, in The Washington Post, said Mr. Trump is"leading our country to destruction," which sounds even more overwrought than Mr. Trump's reference to 2016 crime levels as "American carnage." Mr. Boot added on CNN, "To contribute to the slaughters in the streets, he cannot then say, 'I condemn racism and white supremacy and violence.'" So Mr. Trump is a contributor to slaughter. And he should also just shut up about it. As if a silent Mr. Trump wouldn't be generating headlines attacking him for keeping his counsel.
The endlessly repeated replay to which we are all being subjected is beyond tiresome. An intemperate president creates an intemperate media, which makes such a spectacle of its hostility to him that Mr. Trump fires back, which in turn raises the media's dudgeon level from "high" to "ludicrous." After El Paso, or any similar calamity, we need our media to be extra-sober, extra-judicious, more measured and cautious than they are on their best days. We need calm. Instead, what do we get, every time? A food fight.
Why are we so divided, the media ask? Talk about arsonists saying they want to help put out the fire. CNN and other news organizations turn a handsome profit by marketing non-stop emergency, panic and revulsion. Admitting that Donald Trump is not to blame for everything that goes wrong, or that even the president occasionally gives a reasonably OK speech, would be bad for business. It might be good for everyone's blood pressure, but there's no longer much of a market for being reasonable.

Texto completo: DES MOINES -- Bernie Sanders examined the butter cow. He power-walked by the Ferris wheel. He gobbled a corn dog.
He spoke to almost no one.
Most presidential candidates use the 10-day Iowa State Fair to showcase their retail campaigning skills, because it is one of the best opportunities to meet a wide cross-section of voters before the caucuses in February. Mr. Sanders's approach to the event on Sunday -- stride briskly, wave occasionally, converse infrequently -- underscored how he has grounded his campaign in championing ideas rather than establishing human connections.
His lectern-pounding, impersonal campaign style served him well during his first presidential run, especially here in Iowa, where his near-victory in the caucuses against Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of State, transformed him into a threat for the Democratic nomination.
Yet even as his campaign seeks to project its strength in early primary states, there are signs -- in Iowa polls, conversations with local officials and discussions with dozens of voters -- suggesting that Mr. Sanders, 77, may be struggling to gain traction in the state that fueled his political rise.
[ Which candidates have qualified for the September Democratic primary debates? ]
It is a dynamic that was perhaps most evident last weekend at the state fairgrounds: As voters talked up first-time presidential candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Mr. Sanders was often an afterthought.
Some voters cited Mr. Sanders's age. Others said they wanted to elect a woman. Many praised his ability to push the party to the left but said it was time for someone else to claim the progressive mantle.
"I'm liking Elizabeth Warren," said Danielle Hensley, a 22-year-old student from Iowa City, after casting her presidential vote at the fair's highly unscientific corn kernel poll. Ms. Hensley supported Mr. Sanders in the caucuses four years ago; now, she explained, she sees him as "a 2016 candidate."
It is still early in the primary season, and Mr. Sanders and his aides dismiss outright any notion that his Iowa campaign has lost momentum, repeatedly asserting that the campaign is well positioned for the long haul. They remain confident that they can energize first-time caucusgoers who were too young to cast their votes four years ago. And they brush off a recent poll that showed Mr. Sanders slipping in the state, saying that it does not capture the views of younger voters, working-class Democrats and others who are not yet paying attention to the race -- groups that the campaign sees as a big part of his base.
"We're feeling really, really good," Mr. Sanders told reporters after his turn at the fair's political soapbox. "I think we're going to win here in Iowa."
During a conference call with reporters on Monday, Mr. Sanders's advisers pushed back against doubts about the strength of the campaign, insisting that most polls still have him in second place, and noting that he enjoyed a boost in support in surveys taken after the second Democratic debates. They also maintained that voters trust Mr. Sanders on health care, which his team argues is the most important issue to the electorate.
Mr. Sanders has some significant advantages in the state.
Through the end of June, he had an estimated 7,000 individual donors in Iowa, according to an analysis of campaign fund-raising records by The New York Times, by far the most of any candidate. And he maintains an army of die-hard liberal foot soldiers who are more than eager to propel him to the convention. On Friday, before the state's annual Wing Ding dinner in Clear Lake when supporters for the various candidates typically gather and chant outside the event as a show of force, Mr. Sanders's team boasted that their volunteers had instead knocked on every Democratic door in the town. He plans to return to Iowa next week for what will be his eighth trip to the state since announcing his candidacy in February.
But the landscape for Mr. Sanders is vastly different than it was four years ago. Nearly two dozen candidates are now vying for the nomination. And unlike in 2016, when he had the liberal populist message to himself, there are now many other progressives who have adopted a similar agenda. There is also a surging energy among young activists for diversity, female candidates and generational change.
At the same time, several Iowa Democratic officials said they were miffed by Mr. Sanders's campaign, which they see as operating as something of a lone wolf.
Jeannine Grady, Democratic chairwoman in Marshall County, where Mr. Sanders defeated Mrs. Clinton in the caucuses in 2016, said Mr. Sanders's campaign is not following the traditional campaign playbook of staying in close contact with county chairs.
Though running an unconventional, outsider campaign had worked for him in the past, she said, it may not work this time, especially now that his message is no longer novel and voters have so many other candidates on offer.
"I don't believe it's possible for him to run an insurgent campaign like he did four years ago," said Ms. Grady, who caucused for Mr. Sanders in 2016. "Part of being an insurgent is being relatively unknown. He can't now be unknown."
[ The race is fluid, and other things we learned from the July Democratic debates. ]
"Sanders is running on the fumes of his last campaign," said William Baresel, Democratic chairman in Floyd County. "And weakness is starting to show in get-out-the-vote efforts they have done."
Sanders allies say it is precisely that willingness to operate outside the established political system that is part of Mr. Sanders's appeal, especially for those who believe the current system is broken and requires wholesale change.
Pete D'Alessandro, who ran Mr. Sanders's Iowa campaign in 2016 and is now a senior adviser, stressed in an interview that the campaign was working behind the scenes to woo voters who had not yet tuned in to the political process.
"If we do as a team what we're supposed to do each day, we will be in a position to talk to that voter who can't engage right now when they're ready to engage," he said. "Then you'll see a whole different dialogue going on."
And he suggested that Mr. Sanders should not be measured by the usual political metrics for success.
"The reason that I'm not concerned is I know at the end of most days, we sit around as a senior staff and we say, 'We just won today,"' he said.
But if the stakes are high for every presidential candidate in Iowa, they are even more elevated for Mr. Sanders: Many political observers say success for him in 2020 is predicated on a repeat strong performance in the caucuses.
And as he traveled across Iowa ahead of his visit to the state fair, Mr. Sanders declared that he planned to win not just the Iowa caucuses, but the nominating contests in New Hampshire, Nevada and California as well.
Though he has faced some criticism for adhering strictly to his message, it is, perhaps above all, his constancy that has loyal fans still flocking to his events -- he had one of the biggest crowds at the fair -- and pledging their allegiance.
Waiting to hear Ms. Warren speak at the fair on Saturday, Misty Cornelius, 38, of Des Moines, said she remained "a strong Bernie supporter" -- a declaration confirmed by the glittery "Bernie 2020" tattoo she bore on her chest.

But there were also skeptical voices.
"He's unrealistic," said Michael McDonald, 64, of Altoona.
"I like Bernie, but he seems a little too old, honestly," said Andrew Ball, 22, of Iowa City.
Teresa Brumer, a 51-year-old dental assistant from Urbandale who caucused for Mr. Sanders in 2016, said she wanted to see if Mr. Sanders was "the same man as he was four years ago."
He was, she said after hearing him speak. But she was now also considering Mr. Buttigieg.
Reid Epstein, Lisa Lerer and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Des Moines, Matt Stevens from New York and Rachel Shorey from Washington.

Texto completo: The United States ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell shared with his Twitter followers on Sunday that he had been blocked by prominent MSNBC and NBC News personalities Kristen Welker and Chuck Todd.
"Chuck & Kristen love to 'debate' the issues," Grenell said in a tweet with screen captures of the Twitter block warnings. Grenell, a long-time Republican, was previously the spokesman for the United Nations before being appointed as the U.S. Ambassador to Germany by President Trump in 2018. TweetKristen Welker and Chuck Todd have both been openly critical of Trump and his administration in their posts, often remarking that the president espouses racist and homophobic views.
Grenell, the highest ranking openly gay official in the Republican Party, is often critical of perceived media bias on his Twitter account. Earlier this year, Grenell was tapped by the Trump administration to lead the effort to decriminalize homosexuality in nations where it is still illegal.
"Barbaric public executions are all too common in a country where consensual homosexual relationships are criminalized and punishable by flogging and death," Grenell said in a February response to reports that Iran had executed young, gay men. "Politicians, the U.N., democratic governments, diplomats and good people everywhere should speak up — and loudly."
As a gay U.S. ambassador, Grenell has faced opposition from German officials in his post. "Any U.S. diplomat who acts like a high commissioner of an occupying power must learn that our tolerance also knows its limits," said Wolfgang Kubicki of the Free Democratic Party while calling for Grenell's removal from Germany.
Grenell, 52, also shared that he had been blocked by Mark Landler, who covers foreign policy for the New York Times. "Mark Landler covers foreign policy for @nytimes. But he's interested in covering the issues...he says," Grenell said in a tweet. Tweet

Texto completo: BEIJING — The death toll from a typhoon sweeping across China's east coast rose to 30 Sunday, with at least 18 missing, after downpours forced more than a million to leave their homes, the state news media reported. Nearly 5 million people in Zhejiang province have been affected by Typhoon Lekima, which made landfall early Saturday, the reports said. Many of the deaths occurred near Wenzhou, when the collapse of a natural dam set off a flash flood.
The typhoon, with winds of up to 116 miles per hour, caused major disruption, with thousands of flights canceled and trains suspended. In Zhejiang, the typhoon damaged 34,000 homes, said Xinhua, the state news agency. Officials in Linhai cited the worst flooding there in 70 years, with water as high as 36 feet.

FROM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC, GULF DIVIDING DEMOCRATS APPEARS TO BE A WIDE ONE

Texto completo: Sara Innamorato wants health care for all. Joe Biden does not. She wants to decriminalize the border and said "welcome" to those immigrants crossing illegally. Mr. Biden said, "It's a crime."
It's hard to believe, but these two people claim to be in the same political party. Ms. Innamorato sits with the Democrats state Legislature. Mr. Biden, the former vice-president, wants to run against President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. If he does so, Ms. Innamorato would have to support him. Imagining herself smiling in front of a "Biden for president poster" leads to a very clear reaction: She breathes a long sigh and said: "It will be really hard"
You could say the Democratic Party prizes a huge variety of opinions. Or you could say: The Democrats are split. Watching the debates of their candidates for the presidential election attacking each other more than Mr. Trump, it seems, that the gulf dividing them is huge. At least that's what it looks like from an European angle, or to be more concrete, from Germany.
Sometimes it clears the vision to take a step back. So looking at the United States through the eyes of a European there arises a thought: Maybe Mr. Biden and Ms. Innamorato shouldn't be in the same party. Maybe a party system, where a voter's choice basically is limited to only two parties, is not adequate anymore for a society getting more diverse and polarized. Catch-it-all parties like the Democrats have a hard time these days, not only in the U.S. But in other countries with a multi-party system like Germany, people have other options. In the U.S. they don't.
It almost seems a little absurd: The U.S. embraces competition and freedom of choice almost like no other nation. In supermarkets people can choose between a hundred different types of toothpaste - but when it comes to politics there are just two options. And this in times where the country and the two major parties are splintered like they haven't been in a long time. How can that work?
Ursula Münch knows both sides of the Atlantic. The political scientist from Germany did research in the U.S., published books on American politics and now is head of a political academy in Munich. At first Ms. Münch does what scientists often do: She warns not to compare apples and oranges. What seems alarming in Germany can be totally fine in the U.S. The system in Germany requires parties to vote united in parliament. In the U.S. the need for congressmen and women of the same party to act conjunct is not as huge. So them being divided must not be as precarious as in Germany, said Ms. Münch. But: Yes, there is reason to worry as "the separation especially in the Democratic Party has never been as extreme as now," she said. She can only think of one time when it was similar: In the 60's, when Democrats from the North and the South almost split over Civil Rights issues. Back then for the first time, the Democrats were divided because of ideology. Now they are again.
Tough compromises
The difficulty with ideological disputes is that compromise is quite hard. Ms. Innamorato, for instance, said about health care for all: "We can't keep doing what we did. It will cost people their lives." How can you compromise on a matter of live and death? The same applies to immigration policy. How can you compromise on questions of human rights? On top of the ideological division comes another one, said Ms. Münch: the division between the Rust Belt and Sun Belt regions. In Germany richer states transfer money to poorer states, so even though the differences are not gone, they are better balanced than in the US where such a system isn't as advanced.
So politics are more divided in the U.S., but the possibilities to reflect these differences in the political system are less. In Germany, it's not unusual that new parties emerge and actually will have a say in politics some day. The best example are the Greens. They formed in 1980, were part of the government in 2011 and now polls show the best results they have ever had.
"In Germany we can copy social milieus better," Ms. Münch said. It's an "advantage," that the Americans seem to find attractive. According to a 2018 voter survey from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, 68% of Americans say a third party is needed. It's the highest popularity in 20 years. According to Ms. Münch, this wish will never come true as the constitutional hurdles to change the election system are too high. It seems that Americans have to live with their two-party system and the consequences.
"Either you vote one of the two parties or your vote is for the garbage can. Of course frustration is incredibly high," Ms. Münch said. For her that's one of the reasons why voter participation is so low in the U.S. Frustration also gets fed by the fact that a party like the Democrats can never please everyone. Either the moderates or the liberals will be disappointed. That leads to the infinite compromise. Voters want a clear position. There are few things that annoy people more than a politician that never makes a clear point, but tiptoes around it. At least that's what recent events in Germany imply. One of the main reasons why the popularity of the Greens has skyrocketed is: They speak their mind. That's why liberals like Ms. Innamorato argue against a "middle of the road approach". As a Democratic candidate "it's your job to be a leader, not to be liked and please everyone," she said. Being a supporter of party left-wing candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Political scientist Ms. Münch disagrees.
She said it makes it shake her head thinking of "how Democrats right now just pass by the main orientation of the voters. Nominating a woman from the left wing belonging to the elite is not the smartest thing to challenge Trump." While Ms. Innamorato sees the largest opportunity for the Democrats in the group of non-voters, Ms. Münch said: "Addressing minorities does not help as they often do not vote." Saying this she points to another disadvantage of the US system: There is no real party leader. In Germany every party has a strong figure on the top (of course voted democratically). "That is what the Democrats could need right now. A person in a powerful position in the party preventing them from going further in the wrong direction."
There's another aspect, the two disagree on: Ms.Innamorato still has hope, that the Democrats could overcome their division. She suggests they concentrate on the basic needs of working people like housing or health: Ms. Münch on the other hand said: "What unites the Democrats is their common enemy - Trump." Her vision for the future is not that pleasant: Democrats will polarize even more without Trump, she said, and people could get more and more frustrated not having another option for which to vote.

Texto completo: John L. Evans Jr.,consulting unit chief for a global investment firm; former congressional staffer: Now marks the 50th anniversary of Elvis' hit song, "Suspicious Minds." Let's use the famous ditty as a construct for our present political reality. "We're caught in a trap. We can't go back .... We can't go on together, with suspicious minds." What The King of Rock and Roll is saying - trust is imperative for the ongoing health of any relationship. So how does one make more trust? One part of the answer is straightforward: spending time together, in play, not doing the work at hand. And sprinkling in dashes of vulnerability, of what's really happening in life. Our political leaders are not doing this. We indeed are caught in a trap till that starts happening.
Glenton Gilzean Jr., president/CEO, Central Florida Urban League: The Orlando Sentinel recently wrote about the Electronic Arts "Get in the Game" program in Maitland that encourages local girls to design and build video games. Their goal is to encourage more female involvement in the tech sector by pairing mentors with students, sparking creativity and developing basic skills. In two years, the program has expanded from 10 to 15 girls and its popularity is a testament to the evolution of the industry. I hope that EA considers expanding this initiative to other communities, giving youth across Central Florida a chance to get a taste of this growing sector and Get in the Game.
Jeff Hayward,president and CEO, Heart of Florida United Way: The zoo is a great place to learn and enjoy family time. Due to the variety of services the zoo provides, certain sounds, smells, and sights could pose as a challenge to those experiencing sensory overload. The Central Florida Zoo and Botanical Gardens is now a certified sensory inclusive facility. With an increase of certified sensory theme parks and recreational parks alike, this is great news as our community strives to be accommodating for all to enjoy. As we move toward the future, we hope to see an even greater increase of certified sensory inclusive facilities throughout Central Florida.
Eric Jackson,president/CEO, Total Roof Services Corp.; board member, Children's Home Society of Florida: I'm from Dayton, Ohio, and luckily, I lost no one Aug. 4. But one friend, an insurance executive by day who fronts a local blues/rock band, finished playing in the Oregon District at midnight just down from Ned Peppers. They packed up and left minutes before the shooting. Another friend, who works for me in Orlando, was back home in Dayton. He left a pizza joint by Ned Peppers an hour before the shooting. Another friend, a business executive in Orlando, was exiting a cab at Mandalay Bay in Vegas when the shooting started there. If nothing changes, the luck will run out!
T.J. Legacy-Cole,political organizer/community activist: In a political climate of hypersensitivity, legendary comedian and TV show host D.L. Hughley took to the stage at the Orlando Improv to speak unapologetic truth. I had an opportunity to catch up with the two-time New York Times bestseller backstage to ask his thoughts on what a potential Donald Trump reelection would say about America. He didn't mince words with his response. "That it's America! I think what people are having a hard time grappling with when you consider that 45% of Americans don't consider Trump a racist; that means a lot of white people have either heard or said something worse. So I think having a president as a racist is the newest retro."
Cole NeSmith,executive director, Creative City Project: The biggest arts story in the last few weeks is the relationship between Dr. Phillips Center and its arts partners. I know that each of these organizations works every day to create a strong framework to ensure their own thriving. And, from where I sit, I see the challenge here - promises made, current revenue realities, venue capacity changes. The list goes on. In this case, we have two sides in tough positions with valid issues. Data, facts and and figures aren't going to resolve this problem. It won't be solved on a ledger sheet. It will be solved by people coming together for a greater good. Potentially at great sacrifice. And I hope those conversations happen sooner than later.
Michael Slaymaker, professional fundraising executive: Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was in Central Florida. He held a high-ticket event and a modest-ticket event. The Plaza Live Theater was filled with standing room only. People say "he is too young." The age limit to run is 35. Anyone thinking he is too young is practicing age discrimination. "Gay people aren't electable." Commissioner Patty Sheehan, Senator Barney Frank and many others prove these naysayers wrong. Buttigieg was polished, compassionate and intelligent. His gun reform ideas resonated with the crowd who included the mayor of Parkland and Pulse survivors.
Michael Zais, Political blogger for the Drunken Republican: While I won't regurgitate the plethora of stats related to mass shootings that'll make your eyes glaze over, consider this single one ... according to an FBI study, mass shootings make up less than 1% of all U.S. gun homicides. I am not minimizing the horrific nature of mass shootings ... and Florida has suffered greatly. I understand the "sensational" aspect, vis-a-vis the subsequent political outrage and media coverage ... but less than 1%? Really? Are the lives of the other 99% worth any less? Why do we just see a mere fraction of that outrage at the black-on-black gun homicide epidemic in places like Chicago and Baltimore? What say you, politicians and media?

Trump’s ‘crushing price’ to Republican Party

Texto completo: Words matter. And leadership matters. Words from leaders especially matter.
We need to hear today the words of Abraham Lincoln, the young Republican Party’s second presidential nominee and its first president, who appealed to the best instincts of the human spirit as the better way to navigate through the storm of national division he faced.
In the conclusion of his majestic first inaugural address of 1861, Lincoln invoked symbolic images to forge a rhetoric of unity. Its final passage has found its place as American scripture: “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”
Then, in his second inaugural address of 1865, after years of bloody civil war and with every reason to boast triumphantly or foment contempt and derision of his vanquished Southern countrymen, he said instead, “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.”
By all measure, those words have power. They move people. They are carved in stone, engraved in hearts, memorized by schoolchildren. They transcend in a spiritual way. They matter.
Now, by contrast, the leader of the Republican Party and the president of the United States leads by dividing, deriding, and debasing. It’s gross understatement to say his words are crass, ill-conceived and wholly forgettable. The more damaging thing is that he works actively to rip apart civic bonds, to tear down, to separate and to make distinctions between who rightly belongs in this country and who doesn’t.
Instead of rhetorically binding up wounds, he inflicts them.
As Peter Wehner of the Ethics and Public Policy Center stated in a June column for The New York Times, “(President Donald) Trump has flipped the Republican Party from outward looking to inward looking, from the champion of an open society into the cheerleader of a closed one, from optimism to pessimism. (It’s a long road to travel to get from ‘Morning in America’ to ‘American carnage.’) A party that once claimed to abhor ‘identity politics’ now relies on them as its closing argument in elections.”
By its refusal to confront the insidious flaws and failures in Trump’s character and behavior, today’s Republican Party is, as Wehner states, “complicit in the debasement of American culture and politics.” And even worse, many of Trump’s “most vocal and prominent evangelical supporters, because of their rank hypocrisy, are doing more to damage Christian witness” than so-called relativism ever could.
Wehner continues: “Beyond that, in their ferocious defense of the president, Trump supporters are signaling that decency is a form of weakness, that cruelty is a welcome and highly effective political weapon and that the low road is the preferred road. At one point, Republicans were willing to tolerate Mr. Trump’s brutish tactics and reprehensible character as the price of party loyalty; today many of them seem to relish it. They see the dehumanization of others as a form of entertainment.”
I agree with Wehner that this brings “a crushing price,” to the Republican Party and is forcing young people and voters elsewhere. “The Trump ascendancy has made far too many Republicans increasingly contemptuous of serious intellectual and policy argument, indifferent to empirical truth and disdainful of governing,” Wehner notes. “They prefer to turn politics into an ongoing freak show.”
Wehner, who has served in three previous Republican administrations, tries to conclude his piece on an upbeat note: “There also may be still, small voices out there who believe in healing and renewal and who know that those can't begin until the party rejects the malignancy of Trumpism and embraces the belief that politics is not only a necessary activity but a noble calling.”
I urge Republicans, and all Americans, to remember the towering Lincoln. He stands so tall in the pantheon of our history because he knew real power: words matter, even after lives expire.

Before jail suicide, Jeffrey Epstein was not closely monitored

Texto completo: NEW YORK — It was Friday night in a protective housing unit of the federal jail in lower Manhattan, and Jeffrey Epstein, the financier accused of trafficking girls for sex, was alone in a cell, only 11 days after he had been taken off a suicide watch.
Just that morning, thousands of documents from a civil suit had been released, providing lurid accounts accusing Epstein of sexually abusing scores of girls.
Epstein was supposed to have been checked by the two guards in the protective housing unit every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not followed that night, a law enforcement official with knowledge of his detention said.
In addition, because Epstein may have tried to kill himself three weeks earlier, he was supposed to have had another inmate in his cell, three officials said. But the jail had recently transferred his cellmate and allowed Epstein to be housed alone, a decision that also violated the jail’s procedures, the two officials said.
At 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, guards doing morning rounds found him dead in his cell. Epstein, 66, had apparently hanged himself.
The disclosures about these seeming failures in Epstein’s detention at the Metropolitan Correctional Center deepened questions about his death and are very likely to be the focus of inquiries by the Justice Department and the FBI.
Officials cautioned that their initial findings about his detention were preliminary and could change.
The federal Bureau of Prisons has already come under intense criticism for not keeping Epstein under a suicide watch after he had been found in his cell on July 23 with injuries that suggested he had tried to kill himself.
The law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said that when the decision was made to remove Epstein from suicide watch, the jail informed the Justice Department that Epstein would have a cellmate and that a guard “would look into his cell” every 30 minutes.
But that was apparently not done, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the death was still under investigation.
The city’s chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, announced Sunday night that her office had conducted an autopsy of Epstein, but she declined to release a determination about the cause of death.
She said a private pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden, who was hired by Epstein’s lawyers, had observed the autopsy examination.
The medical examiner is confident the cause of death is suicide by hanging, but she wants more information from law enforcement before releasing her determination, a city official said.
Senior law enforcement officials, members of Congress and Epstein’s accusers have all demanded answers about why Epstein was not being more closely monitored. On Sunday, the Bureau of Prisons offered no explanation for why Epstein was left alone and not checked on.
Epstein’s death has also unleashed a torrent of unfounded conspiracy theories online, with people suggesting, without evidence, that Epstein was killed to keep him from incriminating others.
Over the years, Epstein’s social circle had included dozens of well-known politicians, business executives, scientists, academics and other notables, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew of Britain and Leslie H. Wexner, the retail billionaire behind Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works.
Investigators are expected to focus intensely on the timeline of what happened in the period after Epstein was found semiconscious less than three weeks ago in a shared cell, with bruises on his neck, after a judge denied him bail.
He was placed on a 24-hour suicide watch and received daily psychiatric evaluations, the law enforcement official said.
But six days later, prison officials determined he was no longer a threat to his own life and put him in a cell in the protective housing unit with another inmate, a prison official familiar with the incident said.
It is standard practice at the Metropolitan Correctional Center to place people who have been on suicide watch with a cellmate, two people with knowledge of Epstein’s case said. The theory is a cellmate can provide company to someone who may be suicidal, helping them stave off depression, and can also alert guards in an emergency.
But Epstein’s cellmate was moved out of the protective housing unit, leaving him alone, the prison official said.
Bureau of Prison officials said it is standard procedure for guards in protective housing units to check on inmates every half-hour.
It remained unclear why that procedure was not followed in Epstein’s case. Like many federal prisons and detention centers, the jail has been short staffed for some time, union leaders have said.
The two guards on duty in the protective housing unit where Epstein was housed were both working overtime, the prison official with knowledge of the incident said.
One of the corrections officers was working his fifth straight day of overtime, while the other officer had been forced to work overtime, the official said.
Eric Young, president of the national council of union locals that represents guards at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, said there were cameras in hallways and common areas, but not in the cells of the unit where Epstein was being held.
“From the moment you walk onto that property, you are under camera surveillance,” Young said, adding that there should be video evidence of when the last checks were made and of anyone who approached Epstein’s cell.
Young said overnight checks in the protective unit are typically done every 30 minutes, but sometimes the schedule varies a bit, so that inmates cannot precisely predict when guards will come by their cells.
Young would not discuss whether the two guards on duty at the time of Epstein’s death were doing regular checks on him.
But Young said he was certain that Epstein was in the cell alone — and nearly certain Epstein had a cellmate after he was removed from suicide watch.
“I can tell you it is unequivocal that he was in a cell by himself,” Young said. “I can tell you Epstein didn’t have anyone in the room with him when he committed suicide.”
Built in 1975, the Metropolitan Correctional Center is an imposing 12-story brick building at 150 Park Row, a stone’s throw from the two federal courthouses in lower Manhattan. It holds about 800 people in 10 housing units, most of them awaiting trial or sentencing.
Some of its wings — notably the 10 South special housing unit — have severe security measures, and have housed high-profile defendants over the years, among them Gambino boss John Gotti, terrorist Ramzi Yousef and Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo.
An investigation by The New York Times last year showed that federal prisons across the country, including the Metropolitan Correctional Center, have been dealing with rising violence as staffing at the centers has dwindled.
Questions about the safety of such prisons arose late last year when James (Whitey) Bulger, the notorious Boston gangster, was brutally murdered in a West Virginia prison shortly after being moved there.
Cameron Lindsay, a former warden at the federal jail in Brooklyn and four other centers, said senior officials at the MCC made a series of mistakes in handling Epstein.
Lindsay said Epstein should not have been taken off suicide watch, even if the prison’s chief psychologist had determined it was safe to do so. With a high-profile inmate, the warden should have erred on the side of caution and kept him under close surveillance, separate from other inmates, Lindsay said.
“A psychologist is going to think one way, but a warden needs to think a different way,” he said. “You have to take the conservative, safe route and keep an individual like this on suicide watch.”
Lindsay pointed out that Epstein was also at risk to be attacked by other inmates because of the nature of the allegations against him. “In the subculture of prisons, it’s a badge of honor to take someone out like that,” he said.
Other former prison officials also questioned the jail’s decision to put Epstein on suicide watch for such a short period of time.
Though it is not uncommon for an inmate to be on suicide watch for less than a week, that is typically done in cases when an inmate receives bad news in court or from family — not soon after a suicide attempt, said Bob Hood, a former chief of internal affairs for the Bureau of Prisons.
In Epstein’s case, not only did he apparently attempt suicide on July 23, but humiliating information continued to be released to the public through news outlets, Hood said. That would normally have prompted prison officials to keep him under closer surveillance, not remove him from the 24-hour-a-day suicide watch, he said.
“Why he was taken off suicide watch is beyond me,” Hood said. He added, “A man is dead. The Bureau of Prisons dropped the ball. Period.”

Texto completo: After quietly jailing hundreds of suspected illegal immigrants for federal authorities over a year and a half, the Norfolk sheriff hasn't held any for nearly six months. And he's privately said he will let the city jail's agreement with the federal immigration agency lapse, according to one activist.
The last Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee came to the Norfolk jail on Feb. 22, a week after The Virginian-Pilot published a story exposing that, between September 2017 and February, the Sheriff's Office held some 830 people arrested by ICE.
Despite having held no detainees in months and saying ICE is no longer sending them to Norfolk, Sheriff Joe Baron insists his contract with the federal agency is still going. As the second year of working with ICE comes to a close, Baron said through a spokeswoman that he's reviewing the contract to see if it "serve(s) in the public interest" as he decides whether to renew it for a third.
One activist who's talked with the sheriff told The Pilot that Baron said he plans to stop holding detainees for ICE when their contract expires in September. Ofelia Wattley said the sheriff, on at least two separate occasions, told her that he won't renew the contract, but wants to do so quietly.
After the first Pilot story ran, the heat intensified on Baron. Dozens of protesters picketed and protested a City Council meeting, urging the city's elected lawmakers to push Baron to end the detentions.
The council has no formal authority over the sheriff, who is independently elected. But most if not all members of the council, like Baron, are Democrats in a city where Republican Donald Trump got less than 30% of the vote for president in 2016.
One council member said he'd support a resolution calling on the sheriff to stop working with ICE, although the council has considered no such statement. A band of activists - including Wattley - started calling, emailing and meeting with Baron, pushing him to end his contract with ICE.
In emails to multiple people who'd asked him to stop working with ICE, Baron replied by saying ICE was no longer sending detainees to the jail. But the sheriff didn't explain why the agency would stop sending them if the contract was still active. When asked by The Pilot, Baron, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment.
The Sheriff's Office spokeswoman, Deanna LeBlanc, said the sheriff also wouldn't discuss any private conversations he'd had with Wattley.
ICE wouldn't explain either; spokeswoman Carissa Cutrell wouldn't answer questions about whether Baron or anyone else at NSO had asked them to stop bringing detainees to the Norfolk jail, or told them NSO would no longer accept them.
In an email to anti-ICE activist Katherine Kaywinnet, who had asked him about the contract's future, the sheriff said his office "will not make any public statement which may harm our relationship with any other law enforcement agency." But in that same email, along with others, Baron also told anti-ICE activists that the jail hadn't accepted any detainees since February and ICE was no longer sending them.
In September 2017, the sheriff agreed to house ICE detainees for up to 72 hours each for $44.50 per person per day, until ICE officers could transfer them to one of their long-term facilities. In a December 2018 interview with The Pilot, Baron argued housing detainees protects Norfolk residents from "some bad characters." It's brought in cash. ICE has paid more than $380,000 to house some 830 detainees at the Norfolk jail, although state officials siphoned off most of that.
"The system is full"
But no detainees or ICE money has gone to the jail in nearly six months, right when ICE needed every bed it could get. That agency and Customs and Border Patrol were scrambling to find places to put immigrants flooding across the southern border in record numbers, many of them asylum-seekers from Central America trying to escape gang violence, sexual abuse, death threats and unrelenting poverty.
The flow of migrant families swamping the border reached record levels in the spring, with February totals 560% above those for the same period last year, according to an April New York Times report.
Border Patrol agents arrested nearly 150,000 people in May - the highest monthly total in 13 years, according to a July 9 New York Times article. That number dropped to about 104,000 in June, but the Department of Homeland Security told The Times that, still, the surge of migrants had overwhelmed facilities along the border.
The nation's top border official warned the U.S. immigration enforcement system at the southern border was at "the breaking point," according to a March Washington Post article. As a result, he begrudgingly announced Border Patrol agents would release asylum-seekers into the country instead of handing them over to ICE.
Trump addressed the crisis. "The system is full," he said during an April visit to the border in California. "We can't take you anymore."
Even before the spring surge, ICE officers were feeling overwhelmed at the border, and looking at the Norfolk jail as a way to alleviate a small part of it.
On Jan. 10, ICE official Chad Byrne emailed Col. Michael O'Toole, Baron's No. 2, asking if the Norfolk jail could house detainees the following week. Byrne appears to specify a number of detainees he wants to bring. The sheriff's office redacted the number, saying it was part of a report that ICE had "submitted in confidence" and that because it was part of a "specific tactical plan," disclosing it would jeopardize the safety of law enforcement or the public.
Byrne, an assistant field office director based in the Richmond area, told O'Toole he was helping sister ICE offices at the border. He said ICE needed a place to book and hold detainees for a couple days before transferring them to its long-term facility in Farmville.
O'Toole, a month after an extensive interview with The Pilot about holding ICE detainees at the jail, told Byrne they couldn't because the sheriff's office was replacing its kitchen floor and preparing food offsite.
"This directly ties ... the Norfolk ICE contract to the situation of asylum-seekers at the border," said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, legal director for the nonprofit Legal Aid Justice Center's immigrant advocacy program. "It's not just about immigrants apprehended in Virginia."
On Feb. 8, Byrne reached out to O'Toole again, asking if high-level ICE officials could come to the Norfolk jail in late May for a tour, something Byrne said would streamline the approval process when ICE wanted to send the sheriff's office a large number of detainees. O'Toole never replied by email but, according to LeBlanc, he called back to tell Byrne the jail was in the middle of a large-scale remodel and couldn't increase the number of detainees they would hold at a time.
ICE officials never toured the jail, LeBlanc said.
On May 29, as a record-number of immigrants were crossing the border, an ICE assistant field office director emailed O'Toole, asking if he had time to talk about bed space. O'Toole didn't reply to that email, either, but LeBlanc said he called the assistant director back and reiterated they wouldn't raise the number of detainees.
Partnerships with local jails are an important part of ICE's detention network, said Randy Capps, a researcher at the non-partisan think tank, Migration Policy Institute.
Capps said authorities can plan ahead for raids like those Wednesday in Mississippi, where 680 workers at food processing plants were arrested on immigration charges, or a Virginia operation that netted 132 arrests last year.
But ICE always needs some breathing room for situations that are tougher to predict, like the number of immigrants crossing the border, Capps said. Having space in local jails gives the federal agency flexibility.
Private assurances, public silence
As the sheriff's office fended of ICE's requests for places to put detainees, Hampton Roads activists had been pressuring the sheriff to kill the contract with ICE.
The activists - some of whom dubbed their efforts "De-ICE Norfolk" - talked of meeting with Baron as a group, but could never get the sheriff to agree to it. Instead, several of them met one-on-one, or emailed him. They considered reaching out to priests at Baron's church to get them to apply pressure.
If Baron does renew the contract? "Then we show up with the signs that have his face next to Trump's that he's so afraid of," Robert Brown said at a meeting of about 30 other anti-ICE activists late last month. If they still don't get what they want, they've discussed mounting a campaign to oust Baron from office when he's up for re-election in 2021.
In six months, it's unclear if the activists have been successful; even they disagree about what's been accomplished, if anything. One part of the "De-ICE" group is happy to let the sheriff stay quiet, so long as he doesn't renew the contract and his work for ICE fizzles. The other faction wants Baron to publicly announce he will end the contract, so they can point to that pledge if he reneges.
Private assurances aren't good enough for the latter group. Jena Garren is one of them. At a meeting in late July, she summed up a sentiment shared by many of them:
"There's zero accountability for him to actually make good on that promise."
But Capps said Baron is in a tough spot - neither in a very liberal state like California or New York, where refusing to work with ICE would play well, nor in a conservative state where he could proudly boast of such a partnership.
The sheriff might be walking a tightrope, trying to appease left-leaning voters and fellow Norfolk Democrats by ending the contract, while also maintaining a working relationship with ICE by not shouting about it from the rooftops. That way he can team up with ICE in the future on "defensible" projects like jailing violent criminals and gang members, Capps said.
"From a political point of view, (staying quiet about ending the contract) may be a smart move," he said.
Garren and company are following a playbook that's worked in other cities across the country, Capps said. Uncomfortable with the Trump Administration's immigration policies and facing pressure at home, leaders in California, Oregon and Northern Virginia cities and towns decided in recent years to kill ICE contracts similar to the one the Norfolk sheriff has.
It's hard to change federal immigration policy, especially if you're far from Washington, D.C., Capps said. But local officials like Baron are much more impressionable. They're elected and answerable to voters, who they might run into outside their office - or at the grocery store.
"That pressure can be quite effective," Capps said.

Texto completo: Karl Marlantes says his penchant for writing long novels comes naturally: He has much to tell through his stories and the undercurrents he masterfully weaves just below the surface.
His latest case in point is his second novel, "Deep River," which fills more than 700 pages as it winds its way through the tale of three sibling Finnish immigrants in early 20th century America.
His award-winning debut novel, "Matterhorn: A Novel of the Vietnam War," was a New York Times bestseller that also had much to say, as Karlantes draws on his own experiences as a highly decorated U.S. Marine during that conflict; and his autobiographical "What It Is Like to Go to War" explores his personal impressions on war.
An Oregon native, Yale graduate and Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, he now lives in rural Washington.
What influenced your interest in history, and the specific time and location of "Deep River," set in the Pacific Northwest from 1893 to 1932?
I've always loved reading history. It provides great lessons for anyone who cares to think about what has gone on before. One of the quotes in my non-fiction book, "What It Is Like to Go to War," is from Otto von Bismarck: "Only a fool learns from his own mistakes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others." That time period was also interesting to me because it was, in my opinion, the time of most dramatic change. My grandmother went from no electricity, no running water, horses and buggies, to freeways and landing on the moon. The question of how to adapt in a human and loving way to changing technology is still with us, and still inadequately answered.
The book chronicles the saga of two brothers and a sister who are forced to leave their farming life in Finland and migrate to a logging and fishing community in Washington state to escape the harsh Russian occupation of their homeland. The siblings come to America with differing dreams and personalities: there is Aino, the activist who was introduced to socialism at age 13 by her teacher; Ilmari, a blacksmith with dreams of church building; and Matti, the fortune-seeker. Tell us about each of these characters and their ultimate roles.
All of us adopt a stance toward life, based on such things as character, aptitude, and what happened to us as we were growing up. Kierkegaard refers to the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious. These stances are how we deal with such imponderables as our own death and destiny.
Aino is an atheist – she firmly believes no one is coming to help, so we must build heaven on earth, in her case through communism and then the IWW (International Workers of the World). Her brother Matti learns early that rich people suffer much less than poor people. He is like many Americans who think we can just take out an insurance policy against mortality by driving virtually indestructible SUVs to soccer games. Ilmari is traditionally religious. There is a heaven, and we'll all get there, but in the meanwhile, there are some serious unanswered questions, like why some children suffer and go to heaven just like the ones who don't. He moves from traditional Christianity to an amalgam of Christianity and mysticism, which has been my own spiritual journey.
The characters are also highly influenced by their counterparts in The Kalevala. Aino who refuses marriage to an older man through suicide; Matti, hot-headed Lemminkäinen; Ilmari, the powerful blacksmith; Ilmarinen, who forged the magic sampo, the mill that grinds out eternal bounty; and Jouka, who echoes Joukahainen, the celebrated minstrel.
Explain "sisu" and its importance in the lives of the characters in "Deep River."
Sisu is what won "The Winter War of 1939" against the overwhelming might of the Russian army. As a child, if I fell and hurt myself and even started to whimper, my mother or grandmother would ask, "Where's your sisu?" I would find it and not whimper. It's courage, stubbornness, stoicism, many such traits combined and very hard to define.
In the lives of my characters, it is a major force in surviving, getting done what must be done to put food on the table, standing up against odds that any reasonable person would run from. Sisu is not reasonable. And, as Vasutäti points out, it is not always applicable.
Along with your debut book "Matterhorn," you are developing a reputation for lengthy, robust narratives that fully develop your characters, their timelines and their settings – and both are packed with historical details and sweeping landscapes. Did you set out to produce epic works (that would rise so quickly to bestseller status), or did your stories just work themselves out to be generous volumes?
I swear I'll correct that image with my next novel, but then again, stories tend to just keep happening to me while I'm writing. I never set out to write epic works. I do know, however, that among my favorite novels are "War and Peace," "Anna Karenina," and "The Brothers Karamazov," all hefty volumes. As a reader, I like to get into a world, and if the writing is good, feel disappointed when I leave it. So, in that respect, long novels are good. I am also much taken by true epics, the "Táin Bó Cúailnge" of the Irish, the "Song of Roland" of the French, "The Iliad and Odyssey" of the ancient Greeks, "The Aeneid of the Romans," and "The Kalevala of the Finns."
Many reviews note that "Deep River" is, in part, somewhat of a comment on today's political state in America. Could you address that?
The two major protagonists, Aksel and Aino, are almost allegorical figures for this tension in American political life between the collective and the individual. We seesaw between the two, The Great Society followed by Ronald Reagan and The Roaring Twenties followed by The New Deal.
Aksel and Aino both learn that they need each other to make it through life. It's called compromise, something we have lost in today's political scene. There are many parallels between the time of the novel and now, not even remotely allegorical: wars being fought that involved no immediate threat to our own security, opposition to those wars being characterized as unpatriotic, giving up individual privacy and freedom to the Espionage Act of 1917, which was sold to protect us from "bolshevism" and used to crush the IWW in the name of national security, and the Patriot Act of today, which was sold to protect us from terrorists and justified by the same reasoning, horrible income inequality, the struggle to make a living wage, the unconscious destruction of our natural environment, the problems associated with immigration, false stories in biased newspapers, all compounded by a feckless federal government.

Pig-napping and the ethics of 'ag-gag' laws

Texto completo: Last week in Mankato, I ate my first plant-based "Impossible Burger." I could barely tell the difference between it and beef as far as taste was concerned; the texture, though, was more like grilled meat loaf.
I still prefer a sirloin burger on my backyard barbecue.
Like many carnivores, I don't think about the life of the steer when I check the fridge for condiments.
Animal activists (not to mention vegans) say that I should.
This brings us to a case in North Carolina, reported by the New York Times, in which activists concerned about antibiotics in hogs actually kidnapped one to showcase its maltreatment. The animal was stolen from an operation under contract with Smithfield Foods, the country's largest pork producer.
Iowa's newly enacted ag-gag law, also known as Senate File 519, was created for such infractions. An earlier version, under appeal, was deemed unconstitutional because of First Amendment concerns. The revised law criminalizes intrusions as aggravated and serious misdemeanors whenever a person or group uses deception to infiltrate livestock facilities with the intent to cause physical or economic harm.
The ACLU has argued that the law creates a new crime, "agricultural production facility trespass," and violates First Amendment protections, including "exposés, boycotts, and protests of agricultural facilities, even though those activities may injure a business's profits and reputation."
Investigative reporters sometimes use deception to inform the public about wrongdoing or spurious practices that injure others. There is even a name for such stealth: "undercover journalism." Those who suffer economic harm can sue for libel. If truth prevails, the media outlet wins.
Activists have the same rights. They blog and utilize digital applications to document (and some allege, doctor) content.
The livestock industry has argued that animal-rights advocates manipulate reports. In the case of the North Carolina pig-theft, Smithfield Foods alleged that perpetrators doctored video footage in the past to "mislead the public and gain attention for its activist agenda, which includes 'total animal liberation.'"
North Carolina has one of the toughest ag-gag laws on the books. Business owners can sue offenders at a rate of $5,000 for each day a person gathers information or records video without authorization.
As a journalism educator, I support First Amendment arguments. I also worry that ag-gag laws have unintended consequences of implying something is amiss at production facilities; if not, why the fuss?
Agriculture in Iowa has operated for decades on the ethical concept of trust.
Courts will decide whether Iowa's law is constitutional. Similar laws have had mixed results. Legislation was defeated in 18 states, enacted in six others, and ruled unconstitutional or under litigation in five more.
What is legal, however, may or may not be moral.
All ag-gag laws pivot on the concept of deception, a broad ethical construct. It entails a person passing off something as true and authentic knowing of its falsehood and inauthenticity.
Deception masquerades under varied guises. It is one thing for an animal-rights activist to seek employment at a hog facility under false pretenses and another to burgle a pig.
Deception involves the "means" used to commit an act, which can be moral, immoral or amoral. Ethicists typically consider whether means justify ends. Some argue that deception, in and of itself, taints the act in the eyes of others, regardless of moral intentions. Questions arise. Were there other ways to gain the information rather than fabrication, stealth or theft, for instance?
Sometimes, journalists argue, no other means are at their disposal. They employ that argument so often that there is a name for it: situational ethics.
Animal-rights activists embrace that tenet. Many believe in their cause so fervently that they willingly accept consequences for infractions. Participants in the North Carolina pig heist were asked: "Does everyone feel comfortable with the possibility of doing jail time?"
When someone accepts consequences for actions, laws may not matter. The conscience has its own constitution.
Likewise, livestock producers have consciences, too. They work hard for a living, pay taxes, contribute to the economy, follow myriad regulations and fulfill a public demand.
Now we come to the meat of the matter.
Many Iowans don't ponder the life of a pig at the State Fair when they chomp Chop on a Stick. True, they can consume an Impossible Burger. (Vegan pork and chicken are next on the menu.) But Americans savor their pork with per capita consumption averaging 50.8 pounds in 2018. Demand has necessitated the need for large commercial production facilities rather than smaller operations on family farms. That's where the focus has been concerning animal rights. The public plays a role because of appetite.
The lesson here is not the legality of Iowa's ag-gag law whose intent is to safeguard a vital part of our economy. The ethical issue involves the degree of deception on a case-by-case basis and whether any legislation can prevent a person motivated to commit violations and accept consequences, as happened in North Carolina.
That's the situation.

What the principal used to tell the kids at Columbine

Texto completo: Thursday, August 8, 2019, an unidentified 20-year-old man wearing camo clothes, a bulletproof vest; carrying 100 bullets, a rifle, and a second gun, walked into a Missouri Walmart. He was spotted immediately by an off-duty firefighter with a concealed carry permit who held a gun on the 20-year-old until police arrested him.
No shots were fired. No one was killed.
In 1997, 16-year-old Mississippi student Luke Woodham "woke up, stabbed his mother to death, then came to campus carrying a .30-30 lever-action rifle," reports The New York Times. Woodham shot a student and, as he was reloading, Assistant High School Principal Joel Myrick, who heard the shot, ran to his truck, grabbed/loaded his Colt .45 handgun, held Woodham at gunpoint, and stopped the shooter.
I wonder. Is the answer to stopping shooter rampages stricter gun control laws? Or is the answer to better enable skilled, trained gun owners to carry concealed weapons in public places?
Actually, I think the last thing America needs now is more hasty, politically motivated, unconstitutional, gun control laws. There are too many poll-driven politicians and agenda driven media spokespeople -- many with questionable judgement -- at the forefront of this serious discussion.
I've met people who, as New York City high school students, carried their rifles from home, on the subway or bus, along the sidewalk, to their school rifle club meetings. These kids weren't going on public shooting sprees.
The same types of stories, minus the subways, are told about life with guns in Maine. I'm sure all the states were the same. In truth, most gun owners in America are responsible, law abiding citizens.
How did America get from there to here?
Frank DeAngelis was principal at Columbine High School during the 1999 shooting massacre that killed 12 students and one teacher. One of the shooters confronted, shot at, and missed Principal DeAngelis when the shooter was distracted by another teacher who he shot and killed.
In a recent Team Never Quit podcast, hosted by two US Navy SEALS, DeAngelis was asked, What do you feel is the solution to this? Where do you think we need to be looking on this?
"One of the things that really worried me, especially after Parkland, is when you had people coming out, and some politicians, stating that, 'If we had tougher gun laws I can guarantee you there's never going to be another school shooting or an act of violence.' And that's just one piece to the puzzle. There's not just one thing," DeAngelis answered.
The Columbine principal also cited the change in nuclear families. A baby boomer, DeAngelis grew up in a home where his mother was able to stay and raise the kids.
Today, DeAngelis sees "a lot of kids being raised by aunts, uncles, grandparents."
First and foremost, he said, "Kids need to feel safe, and kids need to feel wanted."
DeAngelis said we also need to look seriously at mental health, at threat assessment programs, and social media's impact on kids. "Social media plays such a major part. We need to know what our kids are doing with social media, [both] positive and negative," he said.
DeAngelis raised a point new to me. He said, "We talk about these shootings that have continued to happen, but how many have been stopped because of things we're doing differently now that were not in place [during Columbine]?
"The media does not let us know how many [shootings] have been stopped. They don't report that there have been thousands of school shootings stopped because we are informing our kids," he said.
"I would be willing to bet, in any schools around this country, students know before adults do a lot of times because of social media," DeAngelis said, adding, "We cannot underestimate what I used to tell kids at Columbine: If you see something, say something. If you hear something, say something."
Scott K. Fish has served as a communications staffer for Maine Senate and House Republican caucuses, and was communications director for Senate President Kevin Raye. He founded and edited AsMaineGoes.com and served as director of communications/public relations for Maine's Department of Corrections until 2015. He is now using his communications skills to serve clients in the private sector.

Texto completo: Former classmates of the man accused of Ohio’s largest mass shooting this week said his behavior in high school raised red flags that, if properly addressed, might have prevented the tragedy.
The Dayton Daily News and WHIO TV and Radio on Friday filed suit to compel the Bellbrook-Sugarcreek school district to release the records of Connor Betts, the 24-year-old who opened fire early last Sunday morning, killing nine people in the Oregon District before Dayton police shot and killed him.
CNN, WCPO-TV, the Cincinnati Enquirer, the New York Times Co. and others have joined the legal action against Bellbrook-Sugarcreek Local Schools and Douglas Cozad, superintendent of the school district.
“We are seeking these records to help our community understand to the highest extent possible what preceded this awful event,” said Daily News Editor Jim Bebbington. “Classmates have indicated Connor Betts exhibited some violent tendencies in middle and high school through things he said and threats he made. We are seeking these records so we can better understand what was done in response to these behaviors. This is all in hopes that this information can help inform a discussion for our community as we all seek to prevent anything like this from happening again.”
The district released a statement Friday afternoon confirming it would not release records related to Betts, a 2013 Bellbrook High School graduate.
“The mandate to Ohio schools is that we must not divulge confidential student records without clear consent from the student or parents, and we have not received such consent,” Liz Betz, president of the Bellbrook-Sugarcreek Board of Education, said in a statement. “We know everyone is trying to make sense of the devastation that occurred, but we cannot bypass the law, plain and simple.”
The district said it is cooperating with the FBI and local law enforcement investigations.
Classmates said that Betts was removed from a Bellbrook High School bus by police because he created a list of people he said he wanted to kill.
Warning signs
One classmate told the Dayton Daily News Betts described to her fantasies he had of tying her up and slitting her throat. The woman, now 24, said she and her parents reported it to police but they did not take it seriously.
“In the days following that senseless attack, the public has learned that Betts displayed troubling warning signs (or ‘red flags’) that, perhaps if acted upon sooner, may have avoided this tragedy,” says the complaint for writ of mandamus that Cox Media Group Ohio, including WHIO-TV and the Dayton Daily News, and other news organizations have filed.
“Relators seek records about these events, as well as any other incident reports, disciplinary actions and other related records,” states the filing in the Second Appellate District Court of Appeals.
“The records are potentially a significant contribution to this local and national conversation,” the filing said. “Respondents’ failure to comply with their legal obligations under Ohio law should not be tolerated. The community and the country at large deserve to know why this tragedy happened, what might have led to it and what may be done to prevent future tragedies.”
To protect privacy
The district denied the release of any records, citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
“News organizations have contended that the federal and state protections afforded in regards to student records expire upon the death of the student, which would mean that the families and estates of all students who pass away, regardless of the manner of death, would be entirely without recourse with respect to those records,” Tabitha Justice, an attorney for the school district, said in the district’s statement Friday.
“The fact of the matter is that this interpretation is not consistent with the plain language or intent of those laws,” Justice said. “Those laws are in place to protect the privacy of students and families, and that is what the district intends to do.”
Phone and email messages were left for Cozad on Friday afternoon.
Appropriate action?
Ken Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, outlined a few of the important questions that need answered to determine “if school officials took the appropriate action with this shooter.”
“If the shooter actually was expelled from school for an extended period of time due to threats, was he referred for professional mental health evaluations and services? If he returned to school following an expulsion, under what conditions, monitoring, and support was he allowed to return?” Trump said.
One former classmate, Mathew Terry, said Betts once pulled a knife out of his pocket and held it inches away from Terry’s throat the summer before their freshman year.
Terry did not tell police about the incident until months later when Betts’ hit list became known.
Terry nearly testified in court, but Betts took a plea agreement, Terry said.
The Dayton Daily News has not been able to access Betts’ juvenile court records, with the Greene County Juvenile Court clerk only providing the newspaper with the section of state law dealing with records expungement.
Threat assessments
Schools, meanwhile, are increasingly creating threat assessment teams, training and protocols, according to Trump.
Trump said best practices were identified 20 years ago after the Columbine shooting.
“As time passed and new generations of school leaders have emerged, we have found less formalized approaches to threat assessment in schools,” he said. “Attention to this area has been resurrected in recent years following the Sandy Hook and Parkland school shootings.”
Charlie Russo, University of Dayton Panzer Chair in Education and research professor of law, sees sees an opportunity for policy makers to put money toward mental health services in K-12 education, possibly incorporating mental health professionals in the classroom.
“If we don’t put some money into it where we know there’s a need we may save a little in the short run, but what happens when one of these tragedies explodes in our faces like this? We have to decide where we’re going to spend the money,” he said.
‘A lot has changed’
Betz said the safety of student “is and always has been our highest priority.”
“The truth is, Connor graduated from Bellbrook High School over six years ago; I’m sure a lot has changed in Connor’s life between now and then, just as a lot has changed in the way that schools approach safety, wellness and mental health awareness,” Betz said.
On Thursday evening, Betz and Cozad read statements to the crowd at Bellbrook Middle School.
“With unity we will face this tragedy together. We have a strong community and at times like this we must band together to stay strong to support one another,” Betz said.
Cozad told the crowd staff will receive crisis training when school resumes Aug. 14.
“We want to make sure our schools are safe and welcoming for all those who enter through our doors,” Cozad said. “This means that we try our best to provide an environment that encourages creativity, compassion and innovation, but this also means that we continuously monitor and improve the safety precautions we implement on our campuses.”

A quandary for Never Trumpers

Texto completo: The Democratic debates have been hard on Never Trumpers. The small but vocal group of Republicans and former Republicans who oppose President Donald Trump has watched in horror as Democrats veered leftward, embracing "Medicare for All," virtually open borders, sky-high taxes and other positions no conservative could ever accept.
The Never Trumpers see disaster coming in the form of the president winning re-election over a Democrat who moved too far left for the American voter.
So they issue warnings. The Democrats’ performance in the most recent debate was "worse than farcical," The New York Times’ Bret Stephens wrote. "It’s tragic. It will make the Trump campaign’s job of selling the president as the non-insane option in next year’s election shamefully easy."
Bill Kristol, the former Dan Quayle aide who founded the now-shuttered Weekly Standard, tweeted, "Best moment in this debate: ‘It’s time for closing statements.’" After the first debate — a widely watched event that gave voters across the nation their initial impression of the Democratic field — some Never Trumpers were deeply alarmed.
"Trump wants to portray Democrats as open-border socialists," wrote The Washington Post’s Max Boot. "And in their eagerness to court progressive primary voters, the candidates are playing into his hands."
The fretting and complaining, coming from people who had been Republicans until Trump came along, set some liberals on edge.
"I, for one, have pretty much had it with the chorus of center-right voices braying that the Democrats are heading for certain doom ... if the party picks a nominee who actually embraces the party’s ideals," wrote the Post’s Eugene Robinson, adding that "Never Trump Republicans and independents may be shocked to hear this, but the Democratic Party is likely to nominate a Democrat for president."
The pushback served to highlight the Never Trump dilemma. First, they went through a torturous process searching for a candidate to support in the 2016 election. Now, it’s happening again.
The 2020 problem is twofold. The first part is that there is no hope of challenging Trump within the Republican Party structure. As sitting president, Trump controls the Republican National Committee and has the support of the vast majority of GOP voters.
The second part is the depressingly woke Democratic field. Only a few Never Trumpers would be able to support a Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris. Some would probably be happy with Joe Biden, but perhaps more the Biden of their memories than the man who will have to move far enough left to capture the Democratic nomination.
The fact is, barring some extraordinary event that no one can predict, the 2020 presidential race will be between President Trump and a Democratic challenger.
Trump will be chosen by Republicans. The Democrat will be chosen by Democrats.
And one of the two will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2021.

Replacement For Spy Chief As the No. 2 Steps Down

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Thursday abruptly decided to install Joseph Maguire, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, as the acting director of national intelligence after Dan Coats steps down from the post next week.
Mr. Trump announced his decision to elevate Mr. Maguire, a retired vice admiral who once led the Navy's Special Warfare Command, on Twitter shortly after confirming that Sue Gordon, the nation's No. 2 intelligence official -- who by law had been in line to temporarily take over as director -- would instead depart with Mr. Coats on Aug. 15.
Ms. Gordon, who served more than 30 years in intelligence posts at the C.I.A. and other agencies, informed Mr. Trump of her decision to retire in a letter on Thursday after it became clear that he would not permit her to rise to the position of acting director.
"As you ask a new leadership team to take the helm, I will resign my position," she wrote, adding: "I am confident in what the intelligence community has accomplished, and what it is poised to do going forward. I have seen it in action first-hand for more than 30 years. Know that our people are our strength, and they will never fail you or the nation. You are in good hands."
The sudden shuffle in the highest ranks of the intelligence community added to the turmoil since Mr. Trump announced on Twitter on July 28 that Mr. Coats would leave and that Representative John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican who is an outspoken supporter of the president, would be his nominee for the next director.
But last Friday, Mr. Trump dropped his plan to nominate Mr. Ratcliffe after it came to light that he had exaggerated his counterterrorism experience as a former federal prosecutor, and as concerns mounted among lawmakers of both parties that he lacked qualifications for the job.
In his initial Twitter announcement, Mr. Trump suggested that Ms. Gordon might not become the acting director until a new one was confirmed, notwithstanding the succession statute. The New York Times reported last Friday that the White House had decided not to let Ms. Gordon become the director, although she had not yet been formally informed of that choice, and that the administration had requested a list of other senior agency officials, a suggestion that it was searching for a different successor.
The signs of turmoil prompted lawmakers of both parties, including those leading the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senators Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, to issue strong expressions of support.
Mr. Burr called her departure "a significant loss" for the intelligence community.
"In more than three decades of public service, Sue earned the respect and admiration of her colleagues with her patriotism and vision," he said in a statement on Thursday. "She has been a stalwart partner to the Senate Intelligence Committee, and I will miss her candor and deep knowledge of the issues. I look forward to seeing what new challenges she will tackle next."
Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who leads the House Intelligence Committee, portrayed the ousters as a "devastating loss" that threatened the intelligence community's ability to provide independent analysis and judgment to policymakers.
"Gordon brought decades of experience and encyclopedic knowledge of the agencies to bear, and her absence will leave a great void," he said. "These losses of leadership, coupled with a president determined to weed out anyone who may dare disagree, represent one of the most challenging moments for the intelligence community."
In a sign of how Mr. Trump's circle viewed Ms. Gordon, the president's son Donald Trump Jr. expressed opposition to her on Twitter last week, referring to John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director during the Obama administration and a frequent Trump critic. The younger Mr. Trump spoke of "rumors about her being besties with Brennan and the rest of the clown cadre."
A federal statute says that if the intelligence directorship becomes vacant, the deputy director -- Ms. Gordon -- shall serve as acting director. But the law appears to give the president much more flexibility in choosing whom to appoint as the acting deputy if the No. 2 position is vacant.
That legal structure creates a loophole for a president who wants to evade the apparently strict limitations on who can become acting director: If both positions are vacant at the same time, the president can temporarily install someone to his liking in the No. 2 position who then will rise to serve as the acting director by virtue of the vacancy at the top.
Under the law that created the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, if the position of deputy director is vacant, Mr. Trump can temporarily install as the acting deputy director any sufficiently senior official in the intelligence community, or anyone else currently serving in a Senate-confirmed position in the broader executive branch.
Mr. Maguire, whom the Senate confirmed to lead the National Counterterrorism Center in December, would qualify by either method.
In a statement, Mr. Coats praised Ms. Gordon's three decades of service, while also saying he was "pleased" that Mr. Maguire would serve as the acting director.
After The Times reported that the White House would not let Ms. Gordon become the acting director, Mr. Trump claimed to reporters that he was still considering her for the role. But she made clear to colleagues that she would resign rather than be fired if the president decided he wanted to install someone else in her role so that person could become the acting director. Less than a week later, she was out.
Earlier last week, in an apparent sign of hostility, Mr. Trump did not allow Ms. Gordon to personally deliver a recent intelligence briefing after she arrived at the White House, according to a person familiar with the matter.
A spokeswoman for the Office of the Director of the National Intelligence said at the time that Ms. Gordon had not been blocked from attending any recent briefing, but she declined to comment about what had happened inside the Oval Office.
In recent days, Mr. Burr has suggested that Mr. Trump consider nominating the retired admiral Michael S. Rogers, who ran the National Security Agency and the military's cybercommand from 2014 to 2018, along with two other prospects, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Pete Hoekstra, the American ambassador to the Netherlands and a former Republican House member from Michigan who led the House Intelligence Committee, is said to be another candidate.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Beehive Books Seeks out Unusual and Unlikely
BOOKS
WALK INTO THE former Reformed Episcopal Church of the Atonement in West Philadelphia, and you hear the unmistakable sounds of construction work. The century-old structure, which is now home to two day care facilities, will also soon have 21 loft apartments.
Inside, a spiral staircase leads to the office of Josh O'Neill, 37, co-founder of Beehive Books. For the past three years, the publishing company has made a name for itself with crowdfunded books with high production values, focusing particularly on comics and graphic art.
The office, which O'Neill thinks might once have been home to church bells, is Beehive's base of operations. It's a space crowded with books, the walls covered in framed cartoons and comic strips. The top of a decorative electric fireplace is lined with O'Neill's personal collection. A few of those books were picked up at yard sales, but many were inherited from his great-grandfather, Hirsch Stalberg.
Several of the texts were published in Philadelphia. Some came from small, local presses made possible by a subscription-based model that allowed customers to finance a book's creation. It's a parallel not lost on O'Neill.
"They basically have the same business model as we do. They have a small, committed audience that is willing to spend money before the book exists," he said. "So I appreciate that we're continuing this forgotten tradition."
O'Neill described his journey into publication as a "weird sideways stumble." He grew up in New York City, raised by a Jewish mother and Catholic father. As a kid, he was obsessed with newspaper comic strips. But as his parents only subscribed to The New York Times, which didn't have a comics section, he had to get his fix from his grandmother in Philadelphia.

"I was just completely obsessed with them. I like'them all, even the ones that were not funny, that were just bad. I just liked that format. Anything that was like a comic, I would read," O'Neill said.
That passion led O'Neill to pursue a career in writing comics. He moved to Philadelphia about 15 years ago to major in English with a concentration in creative writing at the University of Pennsylvania. While there, he got a job at Video Library, a video store that also happened to have a small selection of comics. At the store, O'Neill found a thriving comics artist subculture. He worked alongside Chris Stevens, another aspiring comic writer, and the two started to collaborate.
The store eventually went out of business, so O'Neill and Stevens acquired the inventory in 2010 and opened their own comic book shop called Locust Moon Comics.
The shop aimed to be a local mecca of comics culture, with book signings, talks, weekly drink-and-draw events and even an independent comics festival, which ran for four years.
One of Locust Moon's biggest projects was a collaborative book, Once Upon a Time Machine, featuring about 100 different artists' reimagining of classic fairy tales. It was published by Dark Horse Comics in 2012.
That gave O'Neill the "publishing bug."
Under the name Locust Moon Press and with help from collaborator Andrew Carl, the label began launching projects on the crowdfunding website Kickstarter. In 2014, a campaign was launched for Little Nemo: Dream Another Dream. The large-format book showcased the work of about 140 artists inspired by the classic Little Nemo in Slumberland comic strips. The campaign raised more than $150,000, and the book won two Eisner Awards for Best Anthology and Best Publication Design, in addition to a Harvey Award for Excellence in Presentation.
"This book was a crazy experience for us. And I got to work with people who I've been obsessed with since I was a little kid. There's a cartoonist in there who I grew up reading," O'Neill said. "It was the craziest thing we've ever done. It was the most unrealistic, most unfeasible seeming project."
They launched another campaign in 2015 to fund an anthology of works by legendary comics artist Will Eisner, who pioneered the art of the graphic novel and chronicled stories of Jewish New Yorkers. That campaign raised $50,000.
"So little is working in the publishing industry right now - it's like when you find a model that actually works, I'm amazed every publisher isn't doing this because it works great for us," he said.
In 2016 O'Neill closed the shop so he could focus on publishing full-time with Beehive Books. O'Neill handles the editorial side of the venture while business partner Maělle Doliveux oversees the art direction and production. One of Beehive's first projects was a book compiling Herbert Crowley' works. It raised about $125,000 on Kickstarter.
O'Neill is now working on growing Beehive's customer base as well as exploring a particular classic story in a different way. Bram Stoker's Dracula is told from varying perspectives through diary entries, letters, newspaper articles, phonograph recordings and so on. O'Neill wants to create a leather-bound briefcase filled with handwritten diaries and letters as in the book. The trouble is finding calligraphers who write in 19th-century styles. But the challenge is what makes it worth it, O'Neill said.
"It's not fun unless someone tells you that you can't do it," he said. *

Texto completo: People who exercise in the morning seem to lose more weight than people completing the same workouts later in the day, according to a new study of workouts and waistlines. The findings help shed light on the vexing issue of why some people shed considerable weight with exercise and others almost none, and the study adds to the growing body of science suggesting that the timing of various activities, including exercise, could affect how those activities affect us.
The relationship between exercise and body weight is somewhat befuddling. Multiple past studies show that a majority of people who take up exercise to lose less weight drop fewer pounds than would be expected, given how many calories they are burning during their workouts. Some gain weight.
But a few respond quite well, shedding pound after pound with the same exercise regimen that prompts others to add inches.
This variability interests and puzzles Erik Willis, a data analyst with the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For almost a decade, he and colleagues at the University of Kansas, the University of Colorado Denver and other institutions have overseen the Midwest Exercise Trial 2, an extensive examination of how regular, supervised exercise influences body weight.
In that study, about 100 overweight, previously inactive young men and women worked out five times a week at a physiology lab, jogging or otherwise sweating until they had burned up to 600 calories per session.
After 10 months of this regimen, almost everyone had dropped pounds. But the extent of their losses fluctuated wildly, even though everyone was doing the same, supervised workouts.
When, for a 2015 study, the researchers tried to tease out what had distinguished the biggest losers from those who had lost less, they turned up surprisingly few differences.
Flummoxed, Willis and one of his collaborators, Seth Creasy, a professor of exercise physiology at the University of Colorado Denver’s Anschutz campus, started brainstorming other possible, perhaps unexpected contributors to the enormous variability to weight loss.
They hit upon activity timing.
The science of chronobiology, which studies the ways in which when we do something alters how our bodies respond, is of great interest now. Many recent studies have looked at how meal timing, for instance, affects weight control, including whether exercising before or after breakfast matters. But far less has been known about whether the timing of exercise, by itself, influences whether people lose weight with workouts.
So, for the new study, which was published in July in The International Journal of Obesity, Willis and his colleagues sifted through their data again, this time looking at when people in the Midwest trial had shown up at the university lab.
In that study, participants could visit the gym whenever they wished between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., signing in each time, so researchers had plenty of precise information about their schedules. The scientists also had tracked everyone’s calorie intakes and daily movement habits throughout the 10 months, using activity trackers and liquid energy tracers. They knew, too, whether and by how much people’s weights had changed.
Now, they checked weight change against exercise schedules and quickly noticed a consistent pattern.
Those people who usually worked out before noon had lost more weight, on average, than the men and women who typically exercised after 3 p.m.
The researchers uncovered a few other, possibly relevant differences between the morning and late-day exercisers. The early-exercise group tended to be slightly more active throughout the day, taking more steps in total than those who worked out later. They also ate a bit less, although the difference amounted to barely 100 calories per day on average. Overall, such differences were barely discernible.
Yet, they may cumulatively have contributed to the striking differences in how many pounds people lost, Willis says.
Of course, this study was not large or designed from the start to delve into the chronobiology of exercise and weight. The researchers had not randomly assigned people to work out at particular times, so the links between exercise timing and weight loss they saw now in their reanalysis could be odd accidents related to individual participants’ preferences and schedules with little relevance for the rest of us.
Still, the statistical associations were strong, Willis says. “Based on this data, I would say that the timing of exercise might - just might - play a role” in whether and to what extent people drop pounds with exercise, he says.
But he also points out that most of those who worked out later in the day did lose weight, even if not as much as the larkish exercisers, and almost certainly became healthier.
“I would not want anyone to think that it’s not worth exercising if you can’t do it first thing in the morning,” he says. “Any exercise, at any time of day, is going to be better than none.”

Trump says HE’ll likely commute Blagojevich sentence Commute: ‘I

Texto completo: President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday that he is likely to commute former Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s sentence.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as they flew back to Washington from El Paso, Texas, the president hinted he was open to giving Blagojevich, 62, a break, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
Blagojevich has served about half of a 14-year federal prison sentence for corruption that included seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to become president.
"In the last hour of the flight, POTUS came back to the press cabin for a 45-minute off-the-record conversation. He then said the press could put one part on the record — that he is again considering commuting the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich," the pool report said.
"I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly; he was given close to 18 years in prison. And a lot of people thought it was unfair, like a lot of other things — and it was the same gang, the Comey gang and all these sleazebags that did it. And his name is Rod Blagojevich," the president said, misstating Blagojevich’s sentence.
"He’s been in jail for seven years over a phone call where nothing happens — over a phone call which he shouldn’t have said what he said, but it was braggadocio you would say. I would think that there have been many politicians — I’m not one of them, by the way — that have said a lot worse over the telephone."
The New York Times’ Maggic Haberman tweeted that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had pushed for a pardon, but aides instead persuaded Trump to agree to commutation.
In June 2018, Trump broached the possibility of freeing Blagojevich, suggesting the one-time "Celebrity Apprentice" contestant was convicted for "being stupid."
Wife Patti Blagojevich has waged a focused campaign — primarily in FOX News appearances and through social media — to appeal to Trump for clemency, the Sun-Times reported.
"His wife I think is fantastic, and I’m thinking about commuting his sentence very strongly. I think it’s enough, seven years," Trump said.
Contacted by a Sun-Times reporter late Wednesday, Patti Blagojevich was surprised to hear of the president’s comments but declined to comment.
The pool report did not mention why Trump wanted to discuss Blagojevich.
Blagojevich is scheduled to be released on May 23, 2024. He currently is serving his sentence in an Englewood, Colorado, facility.
In 2018, Trump first dangled the potential of helping Blagojevich. That prompted seven Republican House members from Illinois to urge the president not to commute the sentence after Trump raised the possibility of a clemency for the man he got to know on "The Celebrity Apprentice" in 2010.
Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill., organized the letter, which asked Trump, to "give thoughtful attention to our fear that granting clemency for the former governor would set a detrimental precedent and send a damaging message on your efforts to root out public corruption in our government."
In addition to trying to sell Obama’s Senate seat, Blagojevich was convicted of attempting to, among other counts, trying to shake down the CEO of Children’s Memorial Hospital for $25,000 in campaign contributions and threatening to hold up a bill to benefit the racetrack industry for $100,000 in campaign contributions.
The CEO of what was then called Edward Hospital in Naperville, Pam Davis, is credited with helping blow the whistle on Blagojevich. She wore a wire to record conversations with Blagojevich cronies trying to shake her organization down as the hospital tried for years to build a second hospital in Plainfield but was denied repeatedly from the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board.

Off Limits to Ghosn in Japan: His Wife

Texto completo: TOKYO -- There is a long list of things that Carlos Ghosn, the embattled former chief of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi auto alliance, is not allowed to do as he awaits trial in Japan. He cannot leave Tokyo. He cannot use the internet outside his lawyer's office. He cannot meet friends without informing the court.
And he cannot have any contact, whatsoever, with his wife.
On Tuesday, Japanese prosecutors again persuaded a Tokyo court to forbid all communication between Mr. Ghosn and his wife, Carole, while he is out on bail. The two have not exchanged so much as a word for more than 120 days.
Among the prosecutors' arguments: The couple could conspire to destroy evidence related to allegations that Mr. Ghosn enriched himself with Nissan's money, some of which may have found its way to a company that prosecutors say is connected to Mrs. Ghosn.
But their concerns about Mrs. Ghosn go beyond her ties to her husband. In a translated court filing reviewed by The New York Times, prosecutors argued that Mrs. Ghosn should not be allowed to meet with her husband because she had disparaged the Japanese legal system. She had complained "baselessly" to the press, they added, using interviews and op-ed articles to criticize the institutions that allowed Mr. Ghosn to be questioned without a lawyer and kept in jail for months.
Mr. Ghosn's case has cast a harsh and often unflattering light on Japan's criminal justice system. Media organizations have written much about his travails. Since Mr. Ghosn's release from jail in April, Mrs. Ghosn has helped to spur that coverage, denouncing what she calls unfair treatment of her husband.
That treatment includes forbidding the couple to have any contact. Mrs. Ghosn and the couple's lawyers say the stipulation, which is a term of Mr. Ghosn's bail, is a violation of his basic human rights, and they have filed a formal appeal to the United Nations over the matter.
Prosecutors justified the ban, in court filings, by saying that Mrs. Ghosn "has recently participated in media coverage to baselessly criticize Japan's criminal justice system and spread information disparaging its trustworthiness."
Her portrayal of the country's legal authorities constitutes a form of witness tampering, they wrote, arguing that it "may tacitly influence the concerned parties to support the defendant's side."
The comments were submitted to a Tokyo court in response to Mr. Ghosn's fourth request to be allowed to contact his wife. On Tuesday, the court denied a fifth request by Mr. Ghosn's lawyers to allow the couple to meet.
"This cruel separation with no end in sight is further evidence of his persecution under Japan's hostage justice system," Mrs. Ghosn said in a statement. "It is a vicious retaliation designed to break him." She said she had not had any contact with her husband, including phone calls or emails.
Prosecutors and the court declined to comment. Reached by telephone, a representative of the Tokyo district court declined to explain its rationale for denying Mr. Ghosn's request.
Mrs. Ghosn's last contact with her husband was in early April, when Japanese prosecutors burst into their Tokyo apartment at dawn. Mr. Ghosn was taken to jail, and the authorities seized Mrs. Ghosn's phones and one of her passports. No charges have been filed against Mrs. Ghosn, and she maintains her husband is innocent. Mr. Ghosn has denied all charges.
Mr. Ghosn was first arrested in November on suspicion of underreporting his compensation. During his stay of more than 100 days in jail, he was charged with three counts of financial wrongdoing. He was released on bail after paying a $ 9 million bond with strict conditions, including that he remain in Tokyo and be monitored.
The April raid came shortly after Mr. Ghosn had announced on Twitter that he would hold his first news conference about the case. The timing raised suspicion that prosecutors intended to silence him.
Prosecutors soon charged him with an additional crime. During his time as Nissan's chairman, they alleged, he had used a subsidiary to send payments to a business partner in Oman, who then sent money to a third company that Mr. Ghosn controlled.
Mr. Ghosn's treatment has provoked debate about the fairness of Japan's justice system, where defendants can be held for long periods without charges and are routinely questioned without legal counsel. Nearly 100 percent of criminal cases end in conviction, and most defendants ultimately confess.
Mr. Ghosn and his family have said the repeated arrests were a tactic used by Japanese prosecutors to coerce a confession from him.
The prosecutors' insistence that he not be allowed to meet with his wife is a continuation of those tactics and an attempt to chasten Mrs. Ghosn, according to one of Mr. Ghosn's lawyers, François Zimeray, a former French human rights ambassador at large.
"They cannot have the slightest contact," he said. "The intent is to silence her. To punish her."
Even in Japan, the situation is unusual, according to Yasuyuki Takai, a lawyer and former Japanese prosecutor. A court could theoretically prevent a married couple from having contact, but the situation rarely occurs, he said.
Another former prosecutor, Nobuo Gohara, said that Japanese law did not necessarily guarantee the right of defendants to meet with their family. But he wondered whether in this case the prosecutors' insistence on denying contact might be punitive.
"It's like a form of revenge" for the approval of Mr. Ghosn's bail, he said, a decision that prosecutors had repeatedly fought.
Since Mr. Ghosn's release, prosecutors have argued that Mrs. Ghosn is a "concerned party" and a potential witness to Mr. Ghosn's alleged crimes. If allowed to communicate, they said, the couple could coordinate their stories and destroy evidence. In their June filing to the Tokyo court, prosecutors wrote that Mrs. Ghosn had already "participated in destruction of evidence."
It is not clear what the prosecutors meant by the statement.
Mr. Zimeray said the assertion had no basis in fact. "In all other countries, one should expect prosecutors to ground such a serious accusation: What evidence? When? How?" he said. "We haven't received any detail, and this is pure fantasy."

How will we fight a war on white nationalism?

Texto completo: For Bloomberg
In the aftermath of the mass shootings in Ohio and Texas, a bipartisan consensus is emerging that America must wage a war on white nationalist terror.
There were editorials in the liberal New York Times and the conservative National Review. George P. Bush, son of Jeb and the Texas land commissioner, published an eloquent call to arms. Decrying the left for downplaying radical Islamic terrorism and the right for failing to confront the white nationalist variety, Bush wrote: “Both are evil, both are real, and both must be confronted and conquered.”
What Bush and others mean to say is that white nationalism, the warped ideology that claims (among other things) that non-whites are seeking to replace whites, is toxic and must be battled with the urgency of other political wars of the past. Think of the war against poverty or the war on drugs.
What the scourge of white nationalism does not demand, however, is the kind of shooting war launched after Sept. 11, 2001.
The current threat cannot be met with drone strikes against militia compounds in Idaho or public diplomacy campaigns to cleave non-violent white supremacists from violent ones. There will be no U.S.-led global war on white nationalism. The CIA will not be on the front lines.
Instead, the threat of white nationalism requires a law enforcement approach. So how is that going?
On the one hand, FBI Director Chris Wray recently testified that 40% of the bureau’s 850 domestic terrorism investigations involved individuals and groups motivated by racial hatred. In February, the FBI arrested a Coast Guard officer who had stockpiled arms and was plotting a race war. The country is fortunate he was arrested before he could carry out his plans.
Many of these attacks are harder to prevent. Unlike American recruits to the Islamic State or al-Qaida, white nationalist terrorists are usually not part of a formal group. The closest parallel would be the toxic Internet forums like 8chan, where the El Paso shooter is alleged to have posted his manifesto. Also, the bureau does not investigate ideologies, Wray testified last month, “no matter how repugnant.”
Civil libertarians would disagree with that assessment. A 2013 report from the American Civil Liberties Union found some political spying in the 2000s on environmental and peace groups such as Greenpeace and the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center.
Then there is the FBI’s aggressive posture against suspected radical Muslims. There have been hundreds of suspects charged with a conspiracy to aid foreign terrorist groups before committing an act of violence. Much of this is made possible by an aggressive approach to infiltrating and disrupting jihadist cells before they strike.
The argument now is that similar tactics should be unleashed against white supremacists. As the Times said in its editorial, “American law enforcement needs to target white nationalists with the same zeal that they have targeted radical Islamic terrorists.”
This is a fair point. The civil liberties of online bigots may need to be violated in order to prevent the next attack. But it’s also important to remember some of the lessons of the last war on terror — including the tendency to overreach. As a Human Rights Watch report put it in 2014, “In some cases the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individuals by conducting sting operations that facilitated or invented the target’s willingness to act.”
In the aftermath of the horror of El Paso, many Americans may be more willing to strike a bargain under which some innocent people have their lives ruined to prevent the next mass shooting. This instinct is understandable, but we should also be careful. The extraordinary powers granted to the FBI in a moment of crisis will inevitably be abused once the crisis has passed.

Texto completo: All people value their reputations. Most of us try to honor our reputations by following the rules, being decent people, and making ethical and moral decisions.
You can imagine how you’d feel if people started attacking you after you’ve lived a life that, while imperfect, was on balance an honorable one.
Imagine how you’d feel if a group of people in your hometown started saying that your entire life was a lie, that it was based on greed and exploitation, and that the world would be better off if you didn’t exist.
Imagine that it wasn’t only strangers in town who were making these allegations. Even those who knew you best, your family and your closest friends, began to wonder if somehow there was another side of you they weren’t familiar with.
That’s exactly what’s happening right now, and not to a person, but to our country. There is a powerful movement in America that’s telling the country that’s historically been referred to as a shining city on a hill and the greatest representative democracy the world has ever seen that it’s no good.
A loud group of professors, media moguls, social justice warriors, and elected officials are telling the world that this good and decent land was built on a lie, and that it’s the modern day equivalent of Nazi Germany. They’re even teaching our children that there’s nothing to be proud of in America.
This movement is trying to erase the symbols of our greatness and history, and to remove memorials to our founders and heroes. They’re trying to erase from the hearts of our children the natural love and affection that a child must feel for their nation if the nation is going to survive.
This movement used to be confined to the faculty lounges of elite universities and coastal cities. But now it’s seeping into the Heartland.
A city council in a small town in Minnesota recently voted to stop opening their meetings with the Pledge of Allegiance. Their pitiful excuse was that they want to be more inclusive. They later realized the error of their ways and reinstated the practice.
Reciting the Pledge of Allegiance is an inherently inclusive act. It’s a symbolic effort to include everybody in the American experiment. It’s a way of proclaiming that no matter what differences we may have, we are united as Americans.
Out West, a city school board has decided to spend more than half a million dollars to paint over historical artwork depicting the life of George Washington. Not Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, or some Civil War figure from the South, but George Washington — the father of our country and our first president.
The New York Times recently ran a video op-ed titled "Quit telling me America is great."
At Colorado State University, students have been asked not to utter the word “Americans,” in order to make the campus more inclusive to foreign students.
Ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, Nike caved in to the demands of its leftist brand ambassador Colin Kaepernick when they pulled shoes featuring what some said was the "racist flag" of Betsy Ross. That’s the 13-starred flag flown during the American revolution. No matter that the Betsy Ross flag flew at President Barack Obama’s 2013 inaugural. That was six years ago, before hating America became a cultural phenomenon.
Anybody who’s offended by the Betsy Ross flag must also be offended by the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the very founding of our nation.
Sadly, that’s true. Many people are. The liberals who control Charlottesville, Virginia, recently decided they will no longer recognize the birthday of Thomas Jefferson. That’s right, the author of the Declaration of Independence, and the man who founded the University of Virginia, located in Charlottesville, will no longer be tolerated there.
Remember when President Trump warned that attacks on Civil War monuments would eventually lead to attacks on the Founding Fathers and other symbols of our country? Clearly, he was right.
The political debate today should be about how, not whether, to make America great again. But instead we’ve been confronted with the idea that making America great again means all kinds of horrible things for women, minorities, and immigrants.
Most of us would consider a defamatory attack to be an attack not just on ourselves but also on our family and home.
In the same way, this defamation of America is an attack on the home of us all. Just as we’d fight back against those who defame us, we as a people must collectively fight back to save our country.

Democrats hate Trump more than they hate racism

Texto completo: Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke wrote on Twitter: "This president, who helped create the hatred that made Saturday's tragedy possible, should not come to El Paso. We do not need more division. We need to heal. He has no place here."
O’Rourke, at this point a mere nuisance candidate in the presidential race, set a standard for the nation in demonstrating that partisan hackery can transcend any national tragedy. No matter how many are dead, it’s never so many that he cannot stand atop their bodies and hurl down insults at the president he will not be running against in the 2020 general election.
But the real problem here is not O’Rourke’s desperate effort to turn this tragedy into a reboot of his flagging presidential candidacy. The real problem is that O’Rourke is far from the only Democrat currently wishing and praying for a sitting president to do badly by his nation and to harm America as a whole.
This was manifest on Tuesday, when Democrats and liberals staged a full-fledged online freak-out over the objectively factually accurate New York Times headline about Trump’s speech. The original headline merely noted Trump's message on Monday: that Americans should respond to what happened in El Paso by uniting against racism. Yet, Democrats weren’t even happy when the Times’ editors, offering no real explanation, replaced the headline with one that subtly editorialized against Trump.
It is good and healthy for the nation that a president should say what Trump said, especially a president previously accused of going soft on white nationalists. Love Trump or hate him, everyone who loves America must want to hear him condemn white supremacism and nationalism unequivocally, for all to hear. That is the best possible thing for him to say to the nation right now, that all people of all political persuasions can unite around this message.
There are surely Democratic voters of good will in this country. But the loudest voices on today's Left and in today’s Democratic Party hate Trump far more than they hate racism, and they are showing it now. The moment Trump tried to do something inarguably constructive, they stopped caring about racism’s harmful effects on the body politic and acted primarily from concern that this will hamper their ability to call Trump a racist.
They decided it’s a better use of their time and energy to frame half of their fellow citizens as Klansmen than it is to rally alongside them behind the common enemy of a violent racist ideology.
For anyone who cares about the common good, this nation desperately needed to hear Trump say what he said Monday. That’s exactly why we called upon him to say it. People needed to see Trump stand up and condemn white supremacism and white nationalism without holding back. And, as we argued, they would benefit from seeing and hearing him do it again and again and again, and doing it in El Paso, coming together with politicians with whom he strongly disagrees.
Like Bill Maher, who said earlier this summer that he's rooting for a national recession so that Trump will lose, O’Rourke and many of Trump's political adversaries masquerading as journalists seem too obsessed with bringing down Trump's presidency to want what's good for their country in the meantime.
Shame on all of them, and on all of the others who want the nation to be upset and fragmented and divided by tragedy, just so that they can sooner get the political outcome they are hoping for.

In 'A Pure Heart,' a family divided tries to put the pieces together

Texto completo: “A Pure Heart" begins with a news account, one that's become all too typical in spite of its atrocity: SUICIDE BOMBER KILLS 9 IN EGYPT. 
The author of this book, Rajia Hassib knows full well that we have grown accustomed to the clichés of terrorism: “. . . an improvised explosive device . . . ties to terrorist groups . . . extremists." Tucked within the expected details, however, is a fateful one about how the bomber had been profiled in The New York Times.
Cut to Rose, an Egyptian archeologist living in the West, gathering objects from her dead sister's Cairo bedroom: headscarves, a teacup, a necklace, two T-shirts, and a string of prayer beads that bear the 99 names of Allah — objects that reflect a specific young and devout, yet modern, Muslim woman.  
While everyone else assumes Gameela's death, 10 days earlier — she died in the the bombing from the news clip — can be chalked up to random violence, Rose has her doubts. She has the butterfly effect on her mind, afraid that if she can follow the tornado of Gameela's death backward to its origin, she won't like what she finds.
“A Pure Heart" is a timely, sweeping tale that examines the intersection of fate and choice, the pull of culture and identity, family and love. It takes us in and around the 2011 revolution in Egypt, through alternating points of view and alternating locations, with each character's story revealing how the pursuit of pure intentions is sidetracked until they reach the calamitous end. 
But it's in each of the characters' distinct stories — and in telling them each so skillfully, so movingly — that Hassib fulfills her mission to humanize the page-one news account, and to puncture our sense of moral certainty. 
At the center of the story are Rose and Gameela, two sisters who love each other but have kept a distance from one another. The consummate archeologist, Rose tells herself as she sifts through her sister's artifacts that the items might bring her sister's death into light: “Inanimate objects, as she once told her father when he asked about her work cataloguing artifacts, do speak, if they are only given a chance to."  
What Rose fears most is that her sister's possessions will tell a story about the choices Rose, herself, has made that may have endangered her sister — her marriage to an American journalist and his New York Times interview with the bomber are two that top the list. As Rose pieces together the hidden parts of her sister's life, it becomes apparent that the two represent the kinds of choices faced by modern Muslim women. 
Admittedly, they benefit from their upper-middle-class background and education, which provide them with choices. Rose's version of religious orthodoxy involved requiring her American, Christian suitor to convert to Islam before they married. Much more conservative Gameela, elects to wear a hijab — in spite of her parents' objections. 
Gameela is deeply conscious of her public and private observance of her faith. She's the one who connects us to the meaning of  jihad , reminding us several times throughout the story, that  jihad , to her, means an ongoing struggle to “be better, to do better, to let go of egotistical, selfish notions, to strive to be the best person one can be — a truly good person, a kindhearted, pure person." 
Hassib asks us to ponder action and reaction, and Rose struggles to understand what triggered what: Was it her suggestion that Mark return to Egypt to do some reporting because he “missed the revolution" so he could follow her to New York? Was it Gameela's profound commitment to lead an intentional and devout life while indulging herself in some personal — but very clandestine — happiness? Or was it Mark's own mission to make his mark writing about world events by looking deeply into the private lives of people? 
“Very few people can see the whole story when they are at its center," Mark acutely observes.  And that's the artistry of this novel: Each of the characters, in turn, is at the center; and each one, in a flawed and human way, is in pursuit of their own version of purity of heart. 
The suicide bomber, Saaber, whose name means “the patient one, the waiting one, like Job, who can withstand life's trials,"  is not just the main plot point in the story — the nexus of all the characters' paths — he's also well-drawn and compelling, one of several pieces of a complex story that showcases Hassib's skill at crafting convincing psychological shifts in her characters.
Might Saaber's destiny have been changed with a few tweaks — a less chaotic life, or more good fortune? Or could a simple act of kindness have been the butterfly effect that kept him from killing nine people? We cannot know, but the point of this beautifully written story is that you'll find yourself wondering.

Two US senators ask MLB commissioner Rob Manfred for data on fan injuries from foul balls

Texto completo: A pair of United States senators have written to MLB commissioner Rob Manfred asking any data the league may have gathered regarding which seats in stadiums are most vulnerable when it comes to being in danger of being struck by foul balls.
The request, made by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), comes in the wake of several incidents across MLB this season in which fans, usually younger in age, have suffered injuries after being hit.
In a letter obtained by USA TODAY Sports, Duckworth and Durbin suggested creating a public database to “help evaluate the voluntary safety measures that many teams are implementing. ”
“This will provide a more honest public dialogue and help protect baseball’s biggest (and littlest) fans,” they wrote.
The letter cites a 2014 Bloomberg News estimation maintaining that foul balls injure nearly 1,800 fans each season. The senators feel the public should have access to updated and accurate information.
Two incidents involved Chicago teams this year. In May, Albert Almora Jr. was left in tears after he lined a ball that hit a 2-year-girl who suffered a fractured skull in Houston. White Sox rookie Eloy Jimenez roped a foul that sent a woman to the hospital less than two weeks later.
FOUL BALLS: Here's a look at the 30 MLB ballparks and their safety netting
Both senators wrote to Manfred in June, urging the expansion of protective netting in all 30 stadiums. Now, they're taking the matter a step further.
“Disclosing that information would help inform fans and their families about the safest locations to sit," they wrote. "We appreciate the effort individual teams have taken so far for the safety of fans. Transparency benefits everyone in making informed decisions and preserves the integrity of the game.
"We currently rely on media coverage about foul ball injuries, which can lead to misinformation and confusion. "
Manfred has left the matter of netting in the hands of the individual clubs. So far, eight teams have agreed to extend the netting in their parks, with the Toronto Blue Jays becoming the latest team to do so. The White Sox have already extended the netting at Guaranteed Rate Field from foul pole to foul pole.

Plan your Christmas budget early to keep from overspending

Texto completo: Can you believe Christmas is right around the corner? It seems like we were just celebrating the Fourth of July, and now it's time for another Christmas season.
Okay, don't get mad and protest that I'm bringing up Christmas too early. Even though the actual holiday is still five months away, it's not too early to budget for it.
One of the most frequent stressors I hear about during the holiday season is overspending. So many people have the best intentions — and they want to give to as many people as possible — but those good intentions often come with a lot of bills in January.
If you're worried about overspending this Christmas, the fix is to do a Christmas budget. Here's how you make a very simple zero-based Christmas budget:
Step 1: Decide how much you can spend on Christmas gifts
I'm not talking about throwing Christmas parties or decorating your house. This is just about gifts.
Last year, 33 percent of Americans planned to spend $1,000 on Christmas gifts. Now, depending on your family and money situation, that might be a lot or not nearly enough. But chances are you don't have that kind of cash just lying around in your bank account, which is why you'll want to start putting a little bit aside each month starting now.
For example, let's take that number and reduce it a little. Let's say you budget $600 for Christmas gifts. That's the total amount of money you plan on spending on your family and friends this holiday season. If you start saving for that this month, you'll need to set aside $120 per month. That's if you do all your shopping in December.
Step 2: List the people you want to buy for, and how much you plan to spend on each
Your Christmas budget might look like this:
Kid One: $135
Kid Two: $135
Spouse: $50
Mom: $50

Step 3: Subtract all those numbers from the total amount you've budgeted for gifts
If you end up with zero, then you've perfected a zero-based Christmas budget!
Every dollar you'll spend is attached to someone's name, just like categories in a normal budget. It's that simple, and all you really need is a sheet of paper. If you prefer a digital budget, check out EveryDollar. It's the budgeting app I use.
Don't get too caught up in the specifics of this example. Your situation might be totally different. The main thing is being intentional, proactive, and precise with your spending. And when December comes around, your Christmas shopping experience will be much more merry and bright. You'll be checking everyone off your budget list, instead of spending first and worrying about the consequences later.
Merry Christmas in July, and happy budgeting.

Texto completo: Earlier this summer, the Internet debated the merits of the Aperol Spritz after the New York Times shocked the cocktail-loving world with an article calling the summertime classic "not a good drink."
Controversial opinions aside, the spritz has been a favorite late afternoon beverage of Italians for decades. Made with equal parts sparkling wine and the bitter aperitif Aperol, the cocktail is served over ice, topped off with a splash of soda and garnished with an orange slice.
One local winemaker wanted to bring the Spritz home to Arizona and so created a perfect cocktail for beating the desert heat. Meet, the Arizona-made Sonoran Spritz.
The idea behind the Sonoran Spritz Brian and Megan Ruffentine own and operate Garage-East, a wine tasting room located in Gilbert. The couple partners with Arizona winemakers to source grapes and base products, and finish production at the Gilbert facility.
Once the idea for the Sonoran Spritz struck the Gilbert locals, they traveled to Italy for research and discovered they prefer the slightly more bitter Campari Spritz to its more popular cousin.
An excess of white wine and a penchant for innovation inspired the Ruffentines to experiment with herbs and spices until they found the perfect recipe utilizing many local ingredients.
Thus, the sunny-orange Sonoran Spritz at Garage-East was born.
What's in a Sonoran Spritz? The Sonoran Spritz starts with a base of white wine. It is then combined with herbs and spices and left to mull for four days. A quick stir each day helps infuse the flavors of 19 different ingredients including rosemary from the bush in front of the tasting room, bay leaves from the Agritopia community farm, kola nut, wormwood, cocoa, marjoram and vanilla beans into the wine.
Next, natural dark red dye is added from cochineal bugs that turns a vibrant sunny orange when it hits the wine. Cochineal, which some might remember from when Starbucks announced it would color their strawberry Frappuccinos with the natural dye, is an FDA-approved way to color food and makeup.
But don't be put off by the cheery Fanta-esque color. This is no syrupy-sweet drink. Served in a large wine glass, the bubbly drink greets you with its smoky and earthy scent. Served over ice with a slice of lime, orange and an olive, this summertime sipper is both refreshing and complex.
One of the best parts about the Sonoran Spritz? If you love it, you can take some home with you.
"We 100 percent believe that wine should be able to go wherever beer goes, whether that's the lake or the mountains," Ruffentine says.
Customers can purchase individual bottles; cans, which serve two; a traditional wine bottle; or a large can called a crowler, which holds one and a half times what you can fit in a wine bottle.

Texto completo: Lawyers bringing a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America said Tuesday they believe they've turned up allegations of sexual abuse against more than 350 people not previously identified in files released by the organization.
Attorneys with the Abused in Scouting group filed a lawsuit Monday in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court, alleging a one-time scout leader sexually abused a minor identified only by initials.
The suit alleges that the abuse of the then-12- or 13-year-old victim by an assistant scout leader began in 1974 or 1975 and continued until about 1980.
It also says that the lawyers received allegations of abuse from their clients against more than 350 people involved with the scouts who had not previously been named.
The Irving, Texas-based scouts compiled so-called ineligible volunteer files for years on people considered to pose a risk of abuse, and about 5,000 of these files have been made public as a result of court action.
Monday's suit is claiming that the lawyers now have hundreds of names that were not in those public files. It does not list the names.
An email message seeking comment was sent to the Boy Scouts.
The lawsuit comes as states have begun changing their statutes of limitations to make it easier for long-ago victims of sexual assault can seek damages in court.
The Boy Scouts have said previously that when any volunteer is added to the database for suspected abuse, "they are reported to law enforcement, removed entirely from any Scouting and prohibited from rejoining anywhere."
China vows to counter if US places midrange arms in Asia
BEIJING - China said Tuesday that it "will not stand idly by" and will take countermeasures if the U.S. deploys intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific region, which Washington has said it plans to do within months.
The statement from the director of the Foreign Ministry's Arms Control Department, Fu Cong, follows the U.S. withdrawal last week from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a move Fu said would have a "direct negative impact on the global strategic stability" as well as security in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
Fu also advised other nations, particularly South Korea, Japan and Australia, to "exercise prudence" and not allow the United States to deploy such weapons on their territory, saying that would "not serve the national security interests of these countries."
Court allows Palin's lawsuit against NY Times to proceed
NEW YORK - The New York Times Co. must face a defamation lawsuit by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin over a 2017 editorial that linked her to the 2011 shooting of Sen. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a federal appeals court said.
The ruling is a win for the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, though the court said the bar remains high for Palin ultimately to prevail in the case.
The 21-page decision, which reinstated a lawsuit dismissed by a lower-court judge, is largely procedural, with the New York-based appeals court saying Palin's complaint "plausibly states a claim for defamation."
But it now allows her lawyers to obtain documents from The New York Times Co. and also question editorial page editor James Bennet.
Peter Strzok sues FBI for firing him over anti-Trump texts
WASHINGTON - A veteran FBI agent who wrote derogatory text messages about Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Tuesday charging the bureau caved to "unrelenting pressure" from the president when it fired him.
The suit from Peter Strzok also alleges he was unfairly punished for expressing his political opinions, and that the Justice Department violated his privacy when it shared hundreds of his text messages with reporters.
"This campaign to publicly vilify Special Agent Strzok contributed to the FBI's ultimate decision to unlawfully terminate him," the lawsuit says.
The complaint revisits a political drama that was seized on by conservative critics of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation as proof that the bureau was biased against Trump.
US envoy to Russia Jon Huntsman to resign post
WASHINGTON - Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, is resigning from the diplomatic post he has held for almost two years, a period marked by growing confrontation and friction between Moscow and Washington.
In a resignation letter sent Tuesday to President Donald Trump, Huntsman characterized his tenure as a "historically difficult" time in bilateral relations. He will depart Oct. 3.
Huntsman had resigned during his second term as Utah governor in 2009 and became the U.S. ambassador to China under the Obama administration. He left that post two years later for an unsuccessful run for president. When he became ambassador to Moscow, he said he would take the job for two years.
In his resignation letter Huntsman, 59, said he wanted to return "to reconnect with our growing family and responsibilities."
Trump, RNC challenge California law on tax returns
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits Tuesday against California officials, challenging a new law that would bar Trump from appearing on the state's primary ballot next year if he declines to disclose his tax returns.
The federal lawsuits, which were threatened last week when Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill into law, argue that the measure requiring presidential and gubernatorial candidates to release five years of tax returns runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution.
Newsom responded on Twitter to the lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento: "There's an easy fix Mr. President - release your tax returns as you promised during the campaign and follow the precedent of every president since 1973."
In Britain: A youth court in London ordered a teenager held on an attempted murder charge Tuesday for allegedly throwing a 6-year-old boy from a viewing area at the top of the British capital's Tate Modern museum.
The French boy was a short distance from his parents Sunday when he was picked up and thrown over the railing of the 10th-floor observation deck.
The police said other museum visitors stopped a 17-year-old British citizen from leaving until officers arrived, and that the two boys had no prior connection.
The 6-year-old is hospitalized in critical but stable condition with a sustained brain bleed and fractures to his spine, legs and arms.

Palin's Lawsuit Against Times Is Reinstated

Texto completo: Sarah Palin's defamation lawsuit against The New York Times Company was reinstated by a federal appellate court on Tuesday, with a three-judge panel ruling that a District Court judge was wrong to dismiss it two years ago.
The case involves an editorial The New York Times published in June 2017. Ms. Palin, the former vice presidential candidate, argued in her lawsuit that the editorial had incorrectly linked her to a 2011 mass shooting in which Gabrielle Giffords, then a congresswoman from Arizona, was severely wounded. Ms. Palin's political action committee had previously circulated a map of electoral districts, some with cross hairs on them, and she said The Times had connected the map to the shooting despite knowing that tie to be false.
The Times later issued a correction, saying there was no link between that political rhetoric and the shooting.
In August, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed the suit after an unusual evidentiary hearing in which James Bennet, the editor of the Times editorial page, testified. He said he had not intended to blame Ms. Palin for the shooting of Ms. Giffords, but rather to make a broader statement about the country's heated political environment. Mr. Bennet inserted the statements that Ms. Palin said were defamatory during the editing process.
On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that it was not for a judge to determine whether Mr. Bennet had acted out of "actual malice," meaning that he either knew that what he wrote was false or that he acted with "reckless disregard." The judges said that in light of Mr. Bennet's testimony, Ms. Palin's case remained "plausible."
"This is -- and has always been -- a case about media accountability," Libby Locke and Ken Turkel, lawyers for Ms. Palin, said in a statement on Tuesday. "We are pleased with the court's decision, and we look forward to starting discovery and ultimately proceeding to trial."
Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The Times, said, "We are disappointed in the decision and intend to continue to defend the action vigorously."

Long, Faltering Search For Federal Legislation On Background Checks

Texto completo: More than a half-century ago, the assassinations of a president, a senator and the nation's foremost civil rights leader led to the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968, a landmark measure that restricted some gun sales.
But President Lyndon B. Johnson was not happy. He had wanted to require a registry for all guns and licenses for gun owners.
[Explainer: What are 'red flag' gun laws, and which states have them?]
"The voices that blocked these safeguards were not the voices of an aroused nation," he lamented at the signing ceremony. "They were the voices of a powerful lobby, a gun lobby, that has prevailed for the moment in an election year." (Time magazine was equally lukewarm, calling the measure "better than nothing.")
[Video: 1968 - Lyndon B Johnson Signs Gun Control Bill - www.NBCUniversalArchives.com Watch on YouTube.]
Over the decades that followed, the cycle would repeat. High-profile shootings and mass murders would spur calls for tougher gun control measures -- from bans of assault weapons to curbs on ammunition -- and provoke defiance from the gun lobby.
While gun control advocates view no single measure as a cure-all, they see tightening background checks as one of the most basic steps to diminish gun violence. Most Americans support such efforts, polls show, but the National Rifle Association portrays them as an affront to the Second Amendment.
The debate was stoked anew after the weekend shootings that left 31 dead in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso. Democratic congressional leaders pressed for action on background checks Monday, but President Trump, a staunch N.R.A. ally, linked the topic to immigration, most likely dooming it.
In February, the House passed its first significant gun control measure -- background checks for a greater number of gun purchases -- in a quarter-century.
Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who survived an assassination attempt, called the measure a "testament to courage." The N.R.A. derided it as "a feel-good bill at best, a failure-in-waiting at worst." It never went anywhere in the Senate.
[Read our live briefing for the latest updates on the Dayton and El Paso shootings ]
The divide on gun policy is evident across the country. Many blue states are enacting stricter background checks and so-called red flag measures, which allow law enforcement officers to seize guns from those deemed to pose an imminent threat, while some red states have made it easier to carry concealed weapons.
Tougher federal restrictions could ensure more national consistency. Mr. Trump has signed modest legislation to prod more reporting to the background check system, but also reversed an Obama-era measure that used Social Security records to help flag people with disqualifying mental health issues.
After the killings of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, President Johnson settled for legislation that "falls short," he said at the time, even though it did tightly restrict interstate firearms sales. While gun buyers had to fill out questionnaires, there was no attempt at verification.
The current federal background check system stemmed from the so-called Brady Bill, named for James Brady, a press secretary to Ronald Reagan who was left disabled by an assassination attempt against the former president.
The 1993 legislation, which was supported by Reagan, set up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS. It was intended to screen out purchasers indicted or convicted of serious crimes, fugitives, drug addicts, veterans who were dishonorably discharged, or those "adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution."
Last year, nearly 100,000 firearm sales were blocked, according to the F.B.I., out of more than 26 million checks.
But not all purchases require checks. One of the House bills passed in February would require background checks at gun shows and on internet sites like Armslist, where private buyers and sellers can arrange to meet in person to complete a sale, or ship a rifle or shotgun within a state with no background check.
An analysis of Armslist purchases by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group, found nearly 1.2 million ads last year "for firearm sales where no background check" was required.
In a statement, Armslist said: "Many people choose to do background checks even when they are not legally required. Furthermore, just because a user posts something on the internet, does not mean a sale takes place."
The business also said traveling to a dealer for a background check imposed hardships "urban dwellers won't understand."
Gun control advocates point to cases where assailants with disqualifying backgrounds were nevertheless able to buy guns online.
A second House bill would increase the waiting period after a potential buyer does not immediately pass a background check. Under current law, those who do not immediately pass a background check can buy a gun after three days if the dealer has not been notified by the government why the check was held up. This circumstance, known as a default proceed, allowed Dylann Roof, who killed nine at a church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, to purchase a gun.
There is evidence that the current system, flawed as it is, has had an effect. A 2005 study by researchers at California State University, Chico, and New Mexico State University found that "states with less stringent background check policies also had higher rates of firearms homicides," while a 2008 study by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin found that background checks were associated with a more than 20 percent drop in firearm suicide and homicide rates among adults age 21 and older.
But researchers say that a tighter system with greater access to records and a broadening of the crimes that get flagged would make the system more effective.
Background checks are "clearly effective in reducing risk of violence among the people whose purchases are denied," said Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, an emergency room physician and director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis. "But there are problems in design and implementation that limit their effectiveness" and can prevent an impact from showing up in crime data.
"All of these problems are fixable," he added. Among other things, he believes that restricting sales to people convicted of violent misdemeanors and repeat drunken driving charges could improve the system.
The debate on background checks has largely played out at the state level recently. A number of states have moved to require background checks for private gun sales. California, New York and seven other states mandate that any transfer of a firearm be completed through a licensed dealer, while Maryland, Massachusetts and 10 other states require permits for at least some types of firearms.
Such measures are highly unlikely at the federal level, though, unless Democrats control all branches of government. But Mr. Trump did leave an opening on Monday for the red flag laws that give police extra powers to confiscate firearms.
The issue was highlighted over the weekend because the suspect in the Dayton shooting, Connor Betts, reportedly had been investigated for making a "hit list" of students while in high school and talked of killing himself and others.
Red flag laws have been gaining ground in some states. Connecticut was the first to enact such a law in 1999, following a mass shooting at the state lottery headquarters by a disgruntled employee with a history of psychiatric problems. In 2013, The New York Times examined gun seizures under the Connecticut law, finding that in a single year there were 180 confiscations, almost 40 percent from those with serious mental illness.
Whether an actual proposal in Congress emerges remains to be seen, though gun control groups have had some successes of late and the N.R.A. is beset by internal turmoil.
Laura Cutilletta, managing director of the Giffords Law Center, said that since the 2012 massacre of 26 children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., "there has been a steady climb upwards and we're not sliding back" when it comes to gun safety laws.
"Each time the public becomes outraged, the momentum pushes us forward," she said. "It's just very unfortunate that it takes mass shootings to make that happen."

Texto completo: The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Two of the largest U.S. newspaper companies have agreed to combine for roughly $1.4 billion, creating a new industry giant that hopes to manage the crisis of print's decline through sheer size.
GateHouse Media, a fast-growing chain backed by an investment firm, is buying USA Today owner Gannett, promising to speed up a digital transformation as readers shift online. The companies say they are committed to "journalistic excellence" - while also cutting $300 million in costs every year.
The resulting company would be the largest U.S. newspaper company by far, with a print circulation of 8.7 million, 7 million more than the new No. 2, McClatchy, according to media expert Ken Doctor.
Local papers, faced with the complex and expensive process of building digital businesses to replace declines in print ads and circulation, have been consolidating madly in recent years. Although papers with national readerships like The New York Times and The Washington Post have had success adding digital subscribers, local papers with local readerships find it much more difficult. Hundreds of such papers have closed, and newsrooms have slashed jobs.
According to a study by the University of North Carolina, the U.S. has lost almost 1,800 local newspapers since 2004. Newsroom employment fell by a quarter from 2008 to 2018, according to Pew Research, and layoffs have continued this year.
Both GateHouse and Gannett are known as buyers of other papers. Bulking up lets companies cut costs - via newsroom layoffs and other measures - and centralize operations. The combined company would have more than 260 daily papers in the U.S. along with more than 300 weeklies.
Those cuts could give the owners "a cushion of time" to figure out how to improve their digital businesses, longtime industry analyst Rick Edmonds of the Poynter Institute wrote Sunday.
But it's no panacea. "I don't think, just by these companies merging, they're going to somehow magically find a new business model, make everything all right and produce robust journalism at a local level," Butler University journalism professor Nancy Whitmore said. Still, a bigger, combined newspaper company could sell more national ads and boost their ad revenue, she said.
GateHouse's owner, New Media, is taking on new debt to get the deal done - a $1.8 billion loan from private equity firm Apollo Global Management. That will have to be paid back.
"We've been hearing for years and years about the glories of cost efficiencies," said Northeastern University professor Dan Kennedy, a proponent of local ownership for media outlets. But it's unclear, based on past media mergers, whether those savings will benefit the papers, its employees or their readers, he said.
He wonders whether combined companies make more or fewer cuts than they would have if they had remained separate.
Several experts said they do not expect the Justice Department to have an issue with the deal, as the two companies have papers in different markets. The companies expect it to close this year.
The combined company would take the Gannett name and keep its headquarters in Gannett's current home of McLean, Virginia. GateHouse's owner New Media is buying Gannett Co. for $12.06 a share in cash and stock.
Consolidation is nothing new to either company. Gannett's last big U.S. print purchase was in 2016, when it bought papers in the Journal Media Group chain for $280 million, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. Gannett also owns dailies in major cities such as the Detroit Free Press and Arizona Republic.
Its more recent merger efforts have been unsuccessful. It failed in an unsolicited bid for newspaper chain Tribune. Gannett then fended off an unwanted bid by MNG Enterprises, better known as Digital First Media, a hedge-fund backed media group with a slash-and-burn reputation for cutting jobs and letting papers wither.
GateHouse, a little-known name to U.S. readers, is also controlled by an investment company, but it doesn't have the same scalding reputation as Digital First. It is owned by the publicly traded New Media Investment Group, which is managed by investment firm Fortress Investment Group. Fortress, in turn, is owned by Japanese tech giant SoftBank. Gannett and New Media said Monday that Fortress will no longer manage New Media after 2021.
GateHouse has grown quickly in recent years, and its buying spree includes the Palm Beach Post, bought last year for $49 million, and the Austin American-Statesman, on which it spent $47.5 million. It publishes 154 daily newspapers, most in small- and mid-sized towns.
Gannett shares added 29 cents, or 2.7%, to close at $11.04. New Media stock lost 81 cents, or 7.6%, to $9.89.

Huffman's 'Otherhood' finally coming out

Texto completo: Empty-nester mom movie "Otherhood" starring Felicity Huffman is finally hitting Netflix.
Pushed back from its original spring release due to the brouhaha surrounding Huffman's involvement in the college admissions scandal, "Otherhood" finally premieres on the streaming service Friday.
The film follows three moms – Huffman as Helen, Angela Bassett as Carol and Patricia Arquette as Gillian – as they struggle being left behind after their adult children begin to lead their own lives.
The friends don't quite know how to handle things now that they're "others" instead of mothers. The three women pack up and surprise their sons – who forget them on Mother's Day! – with a visit to New York.
"You know who you are without me," Carol tells her son. "I need to figure out who I am without you."
'Beginning rather than an ending'
In the film, Carol, a widow, decides she needs some time to figure out who she is when she's not a mother, and temporarily moves in with her son Matt (Sinqua Walls), a successful art director. He's not overly happy about it.
The movie is about the mothers' relationships with their sons, their deep friendship with each other, but also with themselves and what they want out of life, said executive producer Cindy Chupack.
"The women need to figure out who they are in this stage beyond motherhood – otherhood – which might be a beginning rather than an ending," Chupack told TV Insider.
Stars speak out on scandal
The movie production wrapped before the story broke about the scandal. But more recently her co-stars praised how Huffman handled being accused of paying $15,000 to have her daughter's SAT answers corrected.
While doing press for the movie, Arquette said she believes her co-star is "sincerely truly sorry." "I think she dealt with it the best way that you can deal with it, but I know she's probably carrying a lot of shame and guilt," Arquette told Entertainment Tonight.
Bassett told The New York Times, "We all make mistakes. None of us is perfect. She held herself accountable and didn't make excuses for her decisions, and I can only respect that."
Status of Huffman's legal case?
In May, a tearful Huffman, 56, pleaded guilty to charges in the nation's largest college admissions scandal, becoming the highest-profile defendant to admit to crimes in the blockbuster case. She is scheduled to be sentenced September 13 in federal court in Boston.
As part of a plea deal, federal prosecutors recommended she get a four-month prison sentence, substantially lower than the maximum of 20 years the charges carry.

Texto completo: They practiced for 2.5 hours in the blazing sun, then ran a half-dozen or so sprints up the Lions' conditioning hill, and when they were all finished, the New England Patriots gathered around their fearless leader Monday and serenaded him with a rollicking version of "Happy Birthday."
Tom Brady turned 42 years old over the weekend, and as he returns to the state where he plied his craft in college, it's worth taking a minute to appreciate just how incredible a run he's had.
The quarterback who once split time with Drew Henson at Michigan is now arguably the best player in NFL history.
He's a six-time Super Bowl champion and three-time league MVP. He hasn't had a losing season in his 18 years as a starter. He's on track to move into second place on the NFL's career passing list this fall. And maybe most impressively, he's the only player to go 12 rounds with Father Time and come away standing.
Brady showed some signs of aging last year, when he uncharacteristically threw 11 interceptions — imagine that being your low point — and the Patriots had fits and starts offensively.
But he caught fire at the right time, won his sixth ring, and on Sunday signed a contract extension that leaves his future after 2019 somewhat up in the air.
"It's really the reality for most guys in the NFL," Brady said Monday of a contract that gave him an $8 million raise but officially leaves him a free agent at season's end. "I don't want to think that I'm any different than anyone else. Football's a tough business, it's a production business and I'm ready to go this year and that's really what matters and that's where my focus is. It's a unique situation I'm in. My 20th year with the same team and I'll be 42 years old, so pretty much unchartered territory for everybody and I'm going to go out there and do the best I can this year and see what happens."
Brady once said he wants to play until he's 45 years old, and while he didn't quite double down on playing four more seasons Monday, he said he has "a great opportunity to prove to a lot of people that they didn't think I can do it and hopefully I can."
Quarterbacks nowadays tend to have more longevity than they did even a decade ago.
Drew Brees will play this fall at 40 years old, Philip Rivers turns 38 in December and Aaron Rodgers is closing in on his 36th birthday.
But there's something unique about Brady. While Brees saw his passing numbers dip late last season and Rodgers was hurt yet again, Brady is the type of quarterback who delivered some of his best performances in the playoffs.
Asked how he's been able to defy age and perform at such a high level this late in his career, Brady said it call comes down to taking care of his body.
"I wrote a book on it, literally," Brady said. His book, The TB12 Method, was a New York Times bestseller in 2017. "I live by it and I think it's given me pretty good results. I try to pass it on to the next generation so they don't have to go on through the same mistakes that I did, but everyone learns different ways and hopefully I can be an inspiration."
Brady's methods have rubbed off on others, even if not everyone subscribes to The TB12 Method itself.
Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford, who began working with Brady's throwing coach, Tom House, last offseason, spent a good five minutes chatting with Brady in between periods at Monday's joint practice between the Lions and Patriots.
Lions safety Tavon Wilson, who spent his first four NFL seasons with the Patriots, said he owns Brady's book and has put some of his former teammates' tips into practice.
"I'm definitely amazed at (how long he's done it)," Wilson said. "But seeing all the work that he puts in, day in and day out, I'm not really surprised."
Maybe no one else should be, either.
Brady is an assassin on the field, the competitive kin to Michael Jordan on the basketball court, yet someone his teammates — happy birthday! — clearly love.
He wins championships, that's a big part of it. He accepts coaching, that is, too. And there's no doubt that doing what he does at 42 years old endears him to teammates who appreciate and respect and fear and marvel at him all in one.
Brady came off that conditioning hill Monday bounding like a college graduate after commencement. He stopped to chat with Lions owner Martha Firestone Ford and her family for a few minutes, then he made his way over to the assembled media before signing a few autographs on his way off the field.
"That was a different rendition," Brady said of his teammates' singing. "Not the traditional happy birthday, but it was nice."
Fitting, too, because this 42-year-old is anything but a traditional quarterback.

Victoria's Secret Loses Its Chief Of Marketing

Texto completo: L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret, is losing its longtime chief marketing officer Ed Razek, a departure that adds to the turbulence at the once-dominant lingerie company.
Mr. Razek is retiring, according to a note sent to employees by Leslie H. Wexner, the company's chief executive.
Victoria's Secret -- which for years defined female sexiness for many Americans -- is struggling to reinvent itself in the #MeToo era. The company recently hired its first openly transgender lingerie model, Valentina Sampaio, 22, for a photo shoot. The Brazilian model's agent, Erio Zanon, said that Ms. Sampaio would appear in marketing for VS Pink, the company's athletic line.
The marketing executive made headlines last year when he said in an interview with Vogue that Victoria's Secret should not cast "transsexuals" in its fashion show "because the show is a fantasy." Mr. Razek later apologized for his "insensitive" remarks.
The departure also comes as L Brands rushes to distance itself from the scandal involving Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last month and charged with sex trafficking involving girls as young as 14. For many years, Mr. Epstein was a close personal adviser to Mr. Wexner.
The Times reported last month that L Brands executives in the mid-1990s had learned that Mr. Epstein was trying to pitch himself as a recruiter for Victoria's Secret models. They said Mr. Wexner was warned. Around the same time, a model said, Mr. Epstein lured her to his hotel room under the pretense of being a Victoria's Secret talent scout and then attacked her.
L Brands has said it hired outside lawyers to "to conduct a thorough review" into the relationship between Mr. Wexner and Mr. Epstein.
In his note to employees on Monday, which was reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Wexner said that "there are few with Ed's passion and talent in this industry." Mr. Razek's duties will be temporarily filled by Ed Wolf, the company's senior vice president of brand and creative, along with Bob Campbell, the vice president of creative for Victoria's Secret.
Mr. Razek's retirement was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
After joining the company in 1983, Mr. Razek has been key to developing the company's heavily sexualized lingerie campaigns and its annual fashion show extravaganza. But as retailers and media groups such as American Eagle Outfitters and Playboy began to shift away from overt displays of skin toward marketing that focused on body positivity, Victoria's Secret grew disconnected from the cultural zeitgeist.
In May, after nearly two decades of star-studded events, Mr. Wexner said that the fashion show would no longer air on network television. Last week, the model Shanina Shaik told The Daily Telegraph that this year's show was canceled entirely.
James A. Mitarotonda, who heads the activist investor Barington Capital Group, sent a letter in March to Mr. Wexner complaining about L Brands' poor performance. Mr. Mitarotonda wrote that Victoria's Secret needed to employ "a more inclusive marketing message" and that Mr. Razek "has done a poor job of stewarding Victoria's Secret's brand by failing to communicate a compelling, up-to-date image that resonates with today's consumers."
Mr. Razek wrote in a separate note on Monday that he had informed Mr. Wexner a few weeks ago of his desire to retire.
"It was a tough conversation to have because, as some of you must know, we have shared so much together for so many years," he wrote in the note, which he titled "So long partners" and which Mr. Wexner shared with employees.
"Still," he wrote, "it's time."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: 8chan, a hate-filled forum site where multiple suspected mass murderers have posted manifestos to cheers from their anonymous fellow users, has gone dark after losing access to crucial web infrastructure.
Cloudflare said late Sunday it would cease acting as 8chan's content distribution network and cybersecurity provider, one day after a gunman killed 22 people and wounded 26 others in El Paso minutes after apparently publishing an essay railing against immigration from Latin America. The move will probably make it difficult for 8chan to repel crippling distributed denial-of-service attacks until it's able to find a new provider.
But Cloudfare Chief Executive Matthew Prince said the move by his San Francisco firm was unlikely to keep 8chan offline for long, as the forum site may find another service provider.

"Unfortunately the action we take today won't fix hate online," he wrote in a blog post. "It will almost certainly not even remove 8chan from the Internet. But it is the right thing to do."
In a tweet, 8chan suggested the effects of Cloudflare's decision would be temporary, writing, "There might be some downtime in the next 24-48 hours while we find a solution."
The site did find a new provider, briefly, moving its domain name registration to Epik, a company whose CEO, Rob Monster, released a statement about the need to protect legal online speech and "not terminate accounts based on arbitrary reasoning or political pressure." But the reprieve ended when Voxility, whose servers Epik rents, booted it as a customer.
Prince had largely resisted the idea that his company should be responsible for policing the content of the websites it helps operate, although it did withdraw service from the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, in 2017 in the face of heavy pressure from activists and the media. (To get back online, that site since turned to BitMitigate, which was subsequently acquired by Epik.)
But 8chan has made itself uniquely radioactive. In the latest manifesto, which Prince said appeared to be authentic, the El Paso suspect saluted the perpetrator of the March 2019 massacre of 49 Muslims at a New Zealand mosque. The suspect in that attack allegedly posted a manifesto on 8chan explaining his motives. A man accused of killing one person and wounding three others in an attack at a Poway, Calif., synagogue in April also posted on 8chan beforehand.
Although Cloudflare took no immediate action in response to those attacks, in a blog post Sunday night, Prince said the pattern of extremists using 8chan to inspire one another had made it indefensible. "The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths," Prince wrote. "Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit.
"We reluctantly tolerate content that we find reprehensible, but we draw the line at platforms that have demonstrated they directly inspire tragic events and are lawless by design," he added. "8chan has crossed that line."
"Lawless by design" is apt. 8chan's founder, Fredrick Brennan, created the site after growing disillusioned with the top-down-control architecture of 4chan, another popular message-board site where extreme politics, inflammatory speech and trolling are the currency.
Brennan's innovation was to set up 8chan as a site where users could create their own message boards. His anything-goes ethos made it a natural home base for the instigators of the then-nascent phenomenon known as Gamergate, an explosion of hate and harassment aimed at critics calling for more diversity in video games.
But Brennan sold 8chan in 2015 to an entrepreneur based in the Philippines and has long since moved on in his own politics. Shortly after the El Paso shootings, he told the New York Times that he thought 8chan should be shut down entirely.

Texto completo: A photo of the front page of Tuesday's New York Times sparked immediate criticism on Monday night – including from several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.
The headline read "Trump urges unity vs. racism. " It comes after President Donald Trump addressed the nation after mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, that killed nine and 22 people, respectively.
The headline ran in the Times' first print edition and was changed in subsequent editions, The Times told USA TODAY in a statement Tuesday.
The original headline didn't sit well with a number of Democrats.
"Let this front page serve as a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by – and often relies upon – the cowardice of mainstream institutions," tweeted Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who told CNN over the weekend that Trump was "responsible for this," said via Twitter: "Lives literally depend on you doing better, NYT. "Please do. "
Fellow Democratic presidential candidates Kirsten Gillibrand and Beto O'Rourke – who called the headline "unbelievable" – also sounded off on Twitter.
Even a New York Times contributor was taken aback by the headline. Op-ed contributing writer Wajahat Ali tweeted: "I write for the NYT. This is a terrible headline. "
Trump has repeatedly faced criticism for his stance on immigration. He also recently tweeted four Democratic congresswomen should "go back" to the "crime infested places from which they came. "
Trump's tweets were condemned as racist by the U. S. House of Representatives.
The Times' headline was changed for the newspaper's next edition, reading "Assailing hate but not guns. "
Ali tweeted appreciation: "This one is on point! Thank you!"
"The original headline was flawed and was changed for all editions of the paper following the first edition," Danielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of Communications for The Times, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. "The headline in question never appeared online, only in the first print edition. "
As a result of the controversy, the hashtag #CancelNYT began trending on Twitter Tuesday afternoon as social media users expressed outrage about the headline. Many demanded the resignation of Times editors while pledging to unsubscribe from the paper and calling for others to do the same.
Some have criticized the hashtag, arguing The Times buckled too easily by changing the headline under liberal pressure.
Both front pages were shared by New York Times associate masthead editor Tom Jolly on Twitter.

GateHouse, Gannett to merge for $1.4B, build newspaper giant

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Two of the largest U.S. newspaper companies have agreed to combine for roughly $1.4 billion, creating a new industry giant that hopes to manage the crisis of print's decline through sheer size.
GateHouse Media, a fast-growing chain backed by an investment firm, is buying USA Today owner Gannett, promising to speed up a digital transformation as readers shift online. The companies say they are committed to "journalistic excellence" -- while also cutting $300 million in costs every year.
The resulting company would be the largest U.S. newspaper company by far, with a print circulation of 8.7 million, 7 million more than the new No. 2, McClatchy, according to media expert Ken Doctor.
Local papers, faced with the complex and expensive process of building digital businesses to replace declines in print ads and circulation, have been consolidating madly in recent years. Although papers with national readerships such as The New York Times and The Washington Post have had success adding digital subscribers, local papers with local readerships find it much more difficult. Hundreds of such papers have closed, and newsrooms have slashed jobs.
According to a study by the University of North Carolina, the United States has lost almost 1,800 local newspapers since 2004. Newsroom employment fell by a quarter from 2008 to 2018, according to Pew Research, and layoffs have continued this year.
Both GateHouse and Gannett are known as buyers of other papers. Bulking up lets companies cut costs -- via newsroom layoffs and other measures -- and centralize operations. The combined company would have more than 260 daily papers in the United States along with more than 300 weeklies.
Those cuts could give the owners "a cushion of time" to figure out how to improve their digital businesses, longtime industry analyst Rick Edmonds of the Poynter Institute wrote Sunday.
But it's no panacea. "I don't think, just by these companies merging, they're going to somehow magically find a new business model, make everything all right and produce robust journalism at a local level," Butler University journalism professor Nancy Whitmore said. Still, a bigger, combined newspaper company could sell more national ads and boost their ad revenue, she said.
GateHouse's owner, New Media, is taking on new debt to get the deal done -- a $1.8 billion loan from private equity firm Apollo Global Management. That will have to be paid back.
"We've been hearing for years and years about the glories of cost efficiencies," said Northeastern University professor Dan Kennedy, a proponent of local ownership for media outlets. But it's unclear, based on past media mergers, whether those savings will benefit the papers, its employees or their readers, he said.
He wonders whether combined companies make more or fewer cuts than they would have if they had remained separate.
Several experts said they do not expect the Justice Department to have an issue with the deal, as the two companies have papers in different markets. The companies expect it to close this year.
The combined company would take the Gannett name and keep its headquarters in Gannett's current home of McLean, Va. GateHouse's owner New Media is buying Gannett Co. for $12.06 a share in cash and stock.
Consolidation is nothing new to either company. Gannett's last big U.S. print purchase was in 2016, when it bought papers in the Journal Media Group chain for $280 million, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. Gannett also owns dailies in major cities such as the Detroit Free Press and Arizona Republic.
Its more recent merger efforts have been unsuccessful. It failed in an unsolicited bid for newspaper chain Tribune. Gannett then fended off an unwanted bid by MNG Enterprises, better known as Digital First Media, a hedge-fund backed media group with a slash-and-burn reputation for cutting jobs and letting papers wither.
GateHouse, a little-known name to U.S. readers, is also controlled by an investment company, but it doesn't have the same scalding reputation as Digital First. It is owned by the publicly traded New Media Investment Group, which is managed by investment firm Fortress Investment Group. Fortress, in turn, is owned by Japanese tech giant SoftBank. Gannett and New Media said Monday that Fortress will no longer manage New Media after 2021.
GateHouse has grown quickly in recent years, and its buying spree includes the Palm Beach Post, bought last year for $49 million, and the Austin American-Statesman, on which it spent $47.5 million. It publishes 154 daily newspapers, most in small- and mid-sized towns.
Gannett shares added 29 cents, or 2.7%, to close at $11.04. New Media stock lost 81 cents, or 7.6%, to $9.89.

YEARNING FOR YANG HE WON'T WIN, BUT HE CERTAINLY STANDS OUT

Texto completo: It appears that I'm most impressed by a candidate who I'm almost certain can't win. What a dilemma.
Every so often a candidate runs for president and ends up on the debate stage who so alters the thinking about not only the issues but also what it means to be a political thinker. This year that person is the entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
I first met Mr. Yang a couple months ago on the set of "Real Time with Bill Maher." We guests stood in a gaggle just before showtime and made nervous conversation. He struck me as completely relaxed, comfortable and sure of himself, not full of himself or trying desperately to impress.
I have been in journalism all my adult life, 26 years, and from the experience of meeting countless politicians I can tell you that this is rare. There is something overbearing about them. Greasy is the way I describe them: too slick and too slippery. They are also too forward - too in your face and in your space. What they consider connecting with people I consider glowering over people. What they consider their winning smile looks to me like a scary clown.
So yes, just the way he carried himself signaled that there was something different about this man. And during his opening interview on the show, while I was watching from the wings, I remember thinking to myself: This guy is impressive.
That was the same feeling I got during Wednesday night's debate.
Mr. Yang seems to always approach his questions and answers from a different perspective, from a higher intellectual and logical plane. His answers were short, pithy and clear as a bell. He is a futurist among conventionalists and Bolsheviks.
Mr. Yang is talking about a rise of the machines and valuations of uncompensated labor in a way that doesn't sound fanciful and outlandish but prudent and necessary. (I do think some of it is fanciful, by the way.)
I believe that this is his gift: His ability to explain things, to educate without sounding elitist, to tell you something you don't know without making you feel guilty for not knowing it.
Sure, I'm not certain America is ready for this $1,000-a-month scheme and his attempts to flip the Asian-guy-who-likes-math racial trope into a positive that works for him makes me uneasy every time I hear it.
But, when I see this guy - honest and unassuming - surrounded on a debate stage by these tacticians and poll watchers, the ones who shade the truth and blow with the wind, the ones consumed by ambition who think too much of themselves, he just stands out.
The fact that he doesn't wear a tie is just a visual reminder that he is a nonconformist - in the best way - to our political pageantry.
As Mr. Yang said in one of his last exchanges of the night:
You know what the talking heads couldn't stop talking about after the last debate? It's not the fact that I'm somehow number four on the stage in national polling. It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan, we're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV show. It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.
And that is the thing: Campaigns in general and debates in particular are reality TV. He is right. It's all a show. Candidates release a raft of detailed policy plans, but few voters actually read them. We overwhelmingly select our candidate because of the way they make us feel.
I don't think Mr. Yang has a shot at the nomination - I hate to have to say that because I don't want to dampen his prospects, but I genuinely believe it - but I certainly hope that he finds a way to stay in the race for a while.
This debate about the direction of the Democratic Party - what it believes and is willing to fight for - would benefit from the continued infusion of his fresh perspectives. And if he doesn't become the nominee, I certainly hope that he is included in any winning Democrat's cabinet.
Mr. Yang knows how to explain. In 2012, President Barack Obama dubbed former President Bill Clinton the "Secretary of Explaining Stuff." I think the next Democratic president should make that a real job and give it to Andrew Yang. America needs this guy.

Texto completo: LANSING — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer appeared to support a change in state law to issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, when she gave an impromptu interview to an immigrants rights organization during the Democratic presidential debates in Detroit.
"We need to ensure that everyone's got a path to getting a license, so they've got identification," Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a video released by the group Movimiento Cosecha after an organizer for the group asked her if she favored issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.
"That's something that's important to me, it's important to our economy, and it's important to the people of Michigan."
Michigan passed legislation to ban the practice in 2008 after Attorney General Mike Cox, a Republican, issued a formal opinion in 2007 saying undocumented immigrants could not obtain driver's licenses. Cox's opinion reversed a 1995 opinion from former Attorney General Frank Kelley, a Democrat.
Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Whitmer, would not answer directly Friday morning when asked whether Whitmer favors changing state law to allow undocumented immigrants to hold Michigan driver's licenses. But she did not deny the accuracy of the video and transcript released by Movimiento Cosecha.
"Not sure I'll have much more to add outside of what the governor said in the video about ensuring that undocumented immigrants have a path to getting an ID," Brown said in an email.
She did not specify what that path would look like or whether she was talking about a state identification other than a driver's license. In the video, Whitmer specifically referenced driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants.
A dozen states, including Illinois and California, plus the District of Columbia issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.
Proponents say allowing undocumented immigrants to hold driver's licenses would help Michigan's economy by making it easier for them work and pay taxes. They say it also would enable them to avoid being detained and deported in many cases, since a major reason for being detained is failing to produce a valid driver's license.
Opponents say the practice raises national security concerns and rewards those who do not observe all immigration requirements at the expense of those who do.
Republicans generally oppose licenses for undocumented immigrants, while Democrats are split on the issue.
In a statement on Twitter Friday, Michigan Senate Republicans said the entire chamber, including then Sen. Whitmer, voted unanimously in 2008 to withhold driver's licenses from "anyone in our state illegally."
"Gov. Whitmer should listen to Sen. Whitmer," the statement said.
Whitmer stepped into the contentious debate at the same time she has counseled Democratic presidential candidates to avoid veering too far to the left and to focus on "dinner table" issues such as wages and education. For example, in an interview with the New York Times, she was critical of instances in the first Democratic debate in Miami when candidates raised their hands to questions such as whether free health care should be provided to undocumented immigrants.
Brown, the governor's spokeswoman, said there is no inconsistency.
"This was simply the governor responding to a question from a constituent," she said.
Whitmer said in the interview with Movimiento Cosecha that Michigan fortunately has a secretary of state and an attorney general who "feel the same way" about the issue that she does.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson "has met with community leaders and legislators and stands with the governor in support of changing the law so that all individuals working and residing in our state may obtain a state ID or a driver's license for use in Michigan," said spokesman Michael Doyle.
Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, supports issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney said Friday.
Members of Movimiento Cosecha were arrested this week when they blocked the entrance to the Detroit-Windsor tunnel in an effort to raise awareness of immigration issues during the Democratic debates.
Dominique Leon Becerra, the group organizer who spoke to and recorded Whitmer, said they plan to make sure the governor follows through.
"No empty promises," she said in a news release. "We need to see real results and a plan to make driver's licenses accessible to our community now!"
The Michigan Catholic Conference has long supported issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants "as a matter of human dignity and the reality that transportation is necessary to get people to the places they need to be," said spokesman David Maluchnik.

Texto completo: Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, one of the oldest Roman Catholic girls' schools in the nation, has long celebrated the vision and generosity of its founders: a determined band of Catholic nuns who championed free education for the poor in the early 1800s.
The sisters, who established an elite academy in Washington, D.C., also ran "a Saturday school, free to any young girl who wished to learn -- including slaves, at a time when public schools were almost nonexistent and teaching slaves to read was illegal," according to an official history posted for several years on the school's website.
But when a newly hired school archivist and historian started digging in the convent's records a few years ago, she found no evidence that the nuns had taught enslaved children to read or write. Instead, she found records that documented a darker side of the order's history.
[Rachel L. Swarns will answer your questions on Monday at 1 p.m. Eastern on Twitter: @nytopinion]
The Georgetown Visitation sisters owned at least 107 enslaved men, women and children, the records show. And they sold dozens of those people to pay debts and to help finance the expansion of their school and the construction of a new chapel.
"Nothing else to do than to dispose of the family of Negroes," Mother Agnes Brent, the convent's superior, wrote in 1821 as she approved the sale of a couple and their two young children. The enslaved woman was just days away from giving birth to her third child.
Nuns disposing of black families? I have been poring over 19th-century church records for several years now and such casual cruelty from leaders of the faith still takes my breath away. I am a black journalist and a black Catholic. Yet I grew up knowing nothing about the nuns who bought and sold human beings.
For generations, enslaved people have been largely left out of the origin story traditionally told about the Catholic Church. My reporting on Georgetown University, which profited from the sale of more than 200 slaves, has helped to draw attention in recent years to universities and their ties to slavery. But slavery also helped to fuel the growth of many contemporary institutions, including some churches and religious organizations.
Historians say that nearly all of the orders of Catholic sisters established by the late 1820s owned slaves. Today, many Catholic sisters are outspoken champions of social justice and some are grappling with this painful history even as lawmakers in Congress and presidential candidates debate whether reparations should be paid to the descendants of enslaved people.
Their approaches vary in scope and some sisters have expressed misgivings, fearful that exposing the past may leave them open to criticism. But as they search their archives and reflect on the way forward, some religious women are developing frameworks that may serve as road maps for other institutions striving to acknowledge and atone for their participation in America's system of human bondage.
The Georgetown Visitation sisters and school officials have organized a series of discussions for students, faculty, staff and alumnae, including a prayer service in April that commemorated the enslaved people "whose involuntary sacrifices supported the growth of this school." They have published an online report about the convent's slaveholding -- an article by the school's archivist and historian also appeared in The U.S. Catholic Historian this spring -- and have digitized their records related to slavery, making them available to the public for the first time.

The Religious of the Sacred Heart, who owned about 150 enslaved people in Louisiana and Missouri, tracked down dozens of descendants of the people they once owned and invited them to a memorial ceremony in Grand Coteau, La. At the ceremony last fall, the nuns unveiled a monument to the slaves in the local parish cemetery and a plaque on an old slave quarters. They also announced the creation of a scholarship fund for African-American students at their Catholic school, which was built, in part, by enslaved laborers.
"It wasn't just a question of looking at the past," Sister Carolyn Osiek, the provincial archivist for the Society of the Sacred Heart United States/Canada, said. "It was: 'What do we do with this now?"'
Sister Osiek, who led the Society of the Sacred Heart's committee on slavery and reconciliation, said her order wanted the descendants to know that their ancestors had played a vital role in developing and sustaining the convent and school. (The Religious of the Sacred Heart are members of the Society of the Sacred Heart.)
"We couldn't have done it without you," she said, describing the message delivered to the descendants by the order's provincial leader. "For so long we haven't acknowledged you, and we're sorry about that."
But the soul-searching has not been universally embraced. Some descendants declined to participate in the ceremony in Louisiana, finding it too painful. And some nuns have expressed unease about the decision to unearth the past.
"A lot of communities now are very committed to dealing with issues of racism, but the fact is their own history is problematic," said Margaret Susan Thompson, a historian at Syracuse University who has examined Catholic nuns and race in the United States.
"They're beginning to confront their own racism, and their own complicity in the racism of the past," she said, "but it's a very long road."
Sister Irma L. Dillard, an African-American member of the Religious of the Sacred Heart, said that some white nuns felt reluctant to revisit this history because they feared "being seen as racist and bad." She praised the steps taken by her order so far and said she hopes more will be done.
She said that only one scholarship has been given so far, a gesture that she described as "a token."
And while she would like to see the order's history of slaveholding incorporated into the curriculum of the schools they founded, few of those schools have publicly acknowledged their origins, she said, despite the extensive research that has been done.
"Not one of the school websites has anything about enslavement," said Sister Dillard, who was also a member of the society's committee on slavery, accountability and reconciliation. "We've whitewashed our history."
At Georgetown Visitation, Susan Nalezyty, the school archivist and historian, discovered that the order's ties to slavery were much deeper than had been previously publicized. None of the official histories described the extent of the sisters' slaveholding or detailed the nuns' profits from the sale of humans.
And for more than a decade, the school's website hailed the Georgetown Visitation nuns for their "generosity of spirit" for teaching slaves to read, an anecdote that was passed down through oral tradition, school officials said. That language, which remains unsubstantiated, was removed from the website in 2017.
"The committee is happy, the school is happy to now have information so that we can speak on this history with authority based on what the documentary evidence tells us," Dr. Nalezyty said.
It is history that has largely faded from our public consciousness, even among many of the three million black Catholics who account for about 3 percent of Catholics in the United States.
Growing up in New York City, I lived just blocks from a convent that ran a bookstore and a community festival that became a highlight of my childhood summers. Catholic nuns educated my mother, my aunts, three of my uncles and both of my sisters. My mother and her family, who emigrated from the Bahamas to Staten Island, even lived for a time on a farm run by Dorothy Day, the founder of the Catholic Worker movement and a candidate for sainthood. The church we knew tended to Irish and Italian immigrants, their children and grandchildren, and a smattering of black families. We never imagined that any of its religious orders had ties to slavery.
Darren W. Davis, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame and a co-author of "Perseverance in the Parish?" about black Catholics, said that people often assume that most black Catholics are recent converts. But many belong to families that have passed down the faith from one generation to the next.
Some embraced the faith after landing in cities like Chicago and New York during the Great Migration that carried millions of African-Americans north, he said. Others have deeper roots. "Catholicism goes back centuries, especially in families from the South," he said.
In the early decades of the American republic, the Catholic Church established its primary foothold in the South, in communities where slaveholding was considered a mark of wealth and prestige for parishioners, clergy and nuns. It was not unusual for American-born priests and nuns to grow up in slaveholding families, and many orders relied on slave labor, historians say.
The Jesuit priests, who founded and ran Georgetown, for instance, were among the largest slaveholders in Maryland. And as women began to enter the first Catholic convents in the late-18th and early-19th centuries, some brought their human property with them as part of their dowries, historians say. (I stumbled across this history during my reporting on Georgetown.)
Wealthy supporters and relatives of the nuns also donated enslaved people to the convents. Meanwhile, Catholic sisters bought, sold and bartered enslaved people. Some nuns accepted slaves as payment for tuition to their schools or handed over their human property as payment for debts, records show.
Mary Ewens, the author of "The Role of the Nun in Nineteenth Century America," found that seven of the eight first orders of Catholic nuns established in the United States owned slaves by the 1820s. In a more recent study, Joseph G. Mannard revealed that an eighth order did as well, at least for a time.
"They really came to define Catholicism in the United States," Dr. Thompson said of these early Catholic nuns. "Between 1810 and 1820, sisters came to outnumber priests in the United States. They set the foundational patterns for what sisters did in the U.S."
Some nuns expressed distaste for slavery while others described their reluctance to sell the people they owned, and records document some efforts to keep families together.
Sisters from both Georgetown Visitation and Sacred Heart united families in which the husband was owned by the nuns and the wife was owned by someone else. In each case, the sisters purchased the wives to bring the family together. (The Georgetown Visitation nuns bought the family's children as well.) The Carmelites of Baltimore cared for some elderly slaves when they grew infirm. The Sisters of Charity of Nazareth in Kentucky remained so connected to their former slaves that scores returned, with children and grandchildren, to celebrate the convent's centennial in 1912.
But Dr. Mannard, a historian at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and other researchers have found that the nuns' financial needs -- and the appeal of unpaid labor -- often trumped any reluctance to traffic in humans.
"In spite of my repugnance for having Negro slaves, we may be obliged to purchase some," Rose Philippine Duchesne, who established the Society of the Sacred Heart in the United States, wrote in 1822. A year later, the Sacred Heart sisters in Grand Coteau purchased their first person, an enslaved man named Frank Hawkins, for $ 550.
In 1830, the Carmelite sisters cited concerns about having to undertake "the disposal of our poor servants" to help explain their reluctance to move to Baltimore from their plantation in rural Maryland. But they dropped those objections after learning that the sale would help pay off their debts and allow them to keep their rural estate. They sold at least 30 people, Dr. Mannard said.
Nearly a decade later, the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph's in Emmitsburg, Md., founded by Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first native-born American to be canonized as a saint, agreed to follow the counsel of their religious superior who told them they could sell their "yellow boys" at 10 to 12 percent profit "without doing an injustice to anyone."
As for the Georgetown Visitation nuns, the profits from slave sales would become a vital lifeline during a period of expansion. In the 1820s, the sisters embarked on a building campaign, which left them saddled with debt. To ease the financial strain, they sold at least 21 people between 1819 and 1822, the records show.
When some buyers dawdled in making payments, the sisters took them to court, Dr. Nalezyty found.
The Sisters of Charity of Nazareth in Kentucky, who owned 30 people at Emancipation, were among the first sisters to seek to make amends. They joined with two other orders -- the Dominicans of Saint Catharine and the Sisters of Loretto -- to host a prayer service in 2000 where they formally apologized for their slaveholding. In 2012, the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth erected a monument at a cemetery where many of the enslaved people were buried. So far, they have identified three descendants of the people they once owned.
"Their contributions had been ignored," said Sister Theresa Knabel, who researched the order's history and reached out to descendants. "We needed to know who they were, know their names, know their story and make them visible."
Roslyn Chenier, an African-American software consultant in Atlanta, learned that her forbears had been owned by the Religious of the Sacred Heart when she was contacted by Sister Maureen J. Chicoine, who has researched the history of the order and has identified dozens of descendants.
"I was amazed, amazed," said Ms. Chenier, who attended the ceremony organized by the sisters in Grand Coteau last September. "It was very emotional."
Ms. Chenier gave up practicing many years ago. But some of her relatives remain devout. Learning that their ancestors were owned by nuns astonished them. But it hasn't shaken their faith, she said. It hasn't shaken her strong Catholic identity, either.
That doesn't surprise Father Gregory C. Chisholm, a black priest who heads the St. Charles Borromeo, Resurrection and All Saints parish in Harlem. He has had a number of conversations about Catholic slaveholding. The conversations are often painful, he said, but few black people are surprised to hear about racism among the clergy.
Older people still remember the days of segregated pews and segregated churches, he said. Others have encountered racism within their own parishes and within their own religious orders, even as they cherish the blessings that Catholicism brings to their lives.
"This whole thing reveals the ways in which the religion has failed us in some way," said Father Chisholm, who says he is encouraged by the church's recent efforts to acknowledge its past. "It's hard. It's difficult. But it's good. It's a way for our church to be renewed and that's what it has to be. It has to be renewed."
In November, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops addressed slavery in a pastoral letter that discussed racism within the church and asked for forgiveness. In 2017, Father Timothy P. Kesicki, president of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States, apologized for the 1838 sale of enslaved people that helped keep Georgetown University afloat.
The sisters say they still have work to do. At Georgetown Visitation, a committee is focusing on embedding the history more deeply into the school curriculum. The Sisters of Charity of Nazareth are creating a permanent exhibit on their campus that will highlight the contributions of African-Americans to their congregation. The Religious of the Sacred Heart are weighing additional steps to promote inclusion and diversity and to eradicate racism within their order and in the schools they sponsor.
Sister Dillard and other members of her committee have already visited some of the schools founded by their order, sharing the history that their sisters have unearthed and urging young people to commit themselves to combating systemic racism.
She wants to make sure that students no longer grow up, as I did, without learning about the enslaved people who helped to build the church. She wants to make sure that we all know their names.

Booker blames Russians, GOP for party's Michigan loss, but evidence is lacking

Texto completo: "We lost the state of Michigan because everybody from Republicans to Russians were targeting the suppression of African American voters."
- Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), in remarks during the second Democratic presidential primary debate, July 31

These remarks jumped out at us during the second night of the debate, but we wanted to spend a little time digging into this before rendering a verdict on Booker's accuracy.
There is substantial evidence that Russia tried to discourage African Americans via social media from going to polls in 2016. In some states, Republicans arguably have tried to use tactics such as voter-identification laws to prevent or discourage people from voting - especially those who already are marginalized and less likely to vote, such as minority communities.
But what's the evidence that this perfect storm happened in Michigan in 2016 and denied the state's electoral college votes to the Democrats?
The Facts Regular readers know we place a high bar for this sort of claim. Correlation isn't always causation. Many factors - including even weather on Election Day - affect turnout. It's difficult to isolate specific reasons for increased or decreased turnout, so readers should be skeptical of politicians who attribute specific factors to it.
The race in Michigan was extraordinarily close. Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, by about 10,700 votes out of nearly 4.8 million ballots cast.
African American votes, or the lack of them, did make the difference in the state. Bernard L. Fraga, a political scientist at Indiana University, in his 2018 book, "The Turnout Gap: Race, Ethnicity and Political Inequality in a Diversifying America," calculated that if voter turnout rates by race had been the same in 2016 as in 2012, Michigan would have swung to Clinton. (Instead of losing Michigan by 0.2 percentage points, she would have won by 1.5 percentage points.) He notes, however: "In such a close election, any number of factors could have influenced the result."
One big factor: Barack Obama was no longer on the ticket. The New York Times, in its analysis of turnout data, said black turnout in 2016 was roughly what was expected before the election. "On average, white and Hispanic turnout was 4 percent higher than we expected, while black turnout was 1 percent lower than expected," adding that it "was significantly lower than it was four or eight years ago, when Mr. Obama galvanized record black turnout."
The newspaper noted that African Americans had a weaker track record of voting in elections when Obama was not on the ballot, and that the black turnout looked weak mainly in comparison with stronger turnout by whites and Hispanics. (Turnout was greater among likely white Trump supporters than likely white Clinton supporters.)
So, all things being equal, the loss of Michigan could be explained by weaker but expected black turnout and stronger but unexpected white turnout.
Now, let's look at what the Russians and Republicans did.
Several reports, including two submitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee, have detailed how Russia sought to exacerbate and exploit racial tensions in the United States via social media.
"Messaging to African Americans sought to divert their political energy away from established political institutions by preying on anger with structural inequalities faced by African Americans, including police violence, poverty, and disproportionate levels of incarceration," said a 2018 report published by the University of Oxford, which said blacks were the single group targeted most heavily by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian "troll farm" linked to the Kremlin. "These campaigns pushed a message that the best way to advance the cause of the African American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead."
A report by New Knowledge agreed. "Some of the most sophisticated IRA efforts on Facebook and Instagram specifically targeted Black American communities," the report said. "Although they produced content targeting many political and cultural groups, the IRA created a uniquely expansive, interlinked fraudulent Black media ecosystem consisting of their own sites interwoven with authentic Black media and Black-owned small businesses to a degree not seen with other communities or groups."
The report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III also highlighted the IRA's efforts to target African Americans through "purported Black social justice groups" such as "Black Matters," "Blacktivist" and "Don't Shoot Us," which alone attracted 250,000 followers. "Collectively, the IRA's social media accounts reached tens of millions of U.S. persons," the report said. "Individual IRA social media accounts attracted hundreds of thousands of followers."
As for Republicans in Michigan, we could not find any specific examples of laws enacted between 2012 and 2016 that could have reduced African American turnout. In fact, the Republican governor in 2012 vetoed a bill that would have required a photo ID for absentee voting.
However, the Michigan Democratic Party filed suit against the Michigan Republican Party, the Trump campaign and Trump adviser Roger Stone just before the election, alleging an effort to "threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting in the 2016 election." The suit was one of several filed in different states, but it did not have many specifics about Michigan. Instead, it was largely framed around an Oct. 27, 2016, report by Bloomberg News that quoted an unnamed Trump official as saying: "We have three major voter suppression operations under way" targeted at white liberals, young women and African Americans.
The suit also noted that Trump regularly claimed fraud would occur at the polls and urged his supporters to monitor precincts in minority neighborhoods - an effort echoed by Stone with a website called StopTheSteal.org. The website sought to sign up Trump supporters who would volunteer to fight voter fraud. (A grand jury has indicted Stone on charges of witness tampering, obstructing an investigation and lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks, and there are signs the Justice Department is still investigating StopTheSteal.)
About 88,000 Michigan voters in the 2016 election did not cast a ballot for president, compared with nearly 50,000 in 2012, while 5 percent opted for a third-party candidate, compared with 1 percent in 2012. That could suggest disillusionment, perhaps spawned by Russian propaganda or other suppression efforts.
Nevertheless, election experts say they see little or no evidence that the activities by the Russians and the Trump campaign actually swayed the election in Michigan.
"African American turnout in Michigan was down from 2012 to 2016, partially because it had previously risen for Barack Obama," said Matt Grossman, director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University. "Clinton also received a lower share of the African American vote than Obama."
"There were Russian-linked Facebook ads that targeted African American voters and voiced opposition to Clinton, but there is not strong evidence that they influenced many voters," he added. "I have seen little evidence that Republican voter suppression had a major effect in Michigan."
"There is certainly credibility to the idea that Russians targeted African Americans to suppress their vote. There's lots of evidence of that from the reports on Russian use of social media (such as in reports submitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee). It is also true that Republican legislatures and election officials in some states have passed laws and enacted procedures that appear aimed at making it harder for likely Democrats to vote, and African Americans are the most reliable Democratic voters," said Richard L. Hasen, professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine. "But I have seen no evidence that the extent of these activities in the state of Michigan were responsible for the depression of turnout in the African American community such that it swung the vote in Michigan to Trump."
The Booker campaign supplied us with a number of links about Russian and GOP activities, but none demonstrated that the purported suppression activities delivered Michigan to Trump.
The Pinocchio Test Regular readers know we have repeatedly knocked President Trump for confidently claiming Russian interference had zero effect on the election. This represents the flip side of the argument - Booker made the specific claim that Russian and Republican efforts to suppress black votes tipped Michigan into Trump's victory column.
With a narrow margin of less than 11,000 votes, anything is possible, but election experts say there is no evidence the Russian or GOP efforts were successful. Instead, the most likely explanation for the loss was that Clinton, not Obama, was on the ballot, so turnout by African American voters returned to pre-Obama levels.
Perhaps that's an argument for a black candidate like Booker to be on the ticket, but he's wrong to claim that the Russians and the GOP were responsible for Clinton's loss in Michigan. The burden of proof is on Booker, and he failed to back up his claim. He earns Four Pinocchios.

Texto completo: The process is much more easily corrupted than we think, say and Jon Tennant
In July, India's government dismissed a research paper finding that the country's economic growth had been overestimated, saying the paper had not been "peer reviewed." At a conference for plastics engineers, an economist from an industry group dismissed environmental concerns about plastics by claiming that some of the underlying research was "not peer reviewed." And the Trump administration - not exactly known for its fealty to science - attempted to reject a climate change report by stating, incorrectly, that it lacked peer review.
Researchers commonly refer to peer review as the "gold standard," which makes it seem as if a peer-reviewed paper - one sent by journal editors to experts in the field who assess and critique it before publication - must be legitimate, and one that's not reviewed must be untrustworthy. But peer review, a practice dating to the 17th century, is neither golden nor standardized. Studies have shown that journal editors prefer reviewers of the same gender, that women are underrepresented in the peer review process, and that reviewers tend to be influenced by demographic factors like the author's gender or institutional affiliation. Shoddy work often makes it past peer reviewers, while excellent research has been shot down. Peer reviewers often fail to detect bad research, conflicts of interest and corporate ghostwriting.
Meanwhile, bad actors exploit the process for professional or financial gain, leveraging peer review to mislead decision-makers. For instance, the National Football League used the words "peer review" to fend off criticism of studies by the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee, a task force the league founded in 1994, which found little long-term harm from sport-induced brain injuries in players. But the New York Times later discovered that the scientists involved had omitted more than 100 diagnosed concussions from their studies. What's more, the NFL's claim that the research had been rigorously vetted ignored that the process was incredibly contentious: Some reviewers were adamant that the papers should not have been published at all.
Similarly, fossil fuel industry interests have tried to distort the public debate on climate change by sponsoring research and exploiting the prestige of peer review, undermining the overwhelming scientific consensus on the topic. For many years, climate skeptics published studies in the journal Energy & Environment, which had little credibility among climate scientists, even though it had a peer review process. (One of its articles said inaccurately that the sun is made of iron.) Typically, in the peer review process, editors choose reviewers, and E&E's longtime editor, Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen, is an avowed climate change skeptic: "I'm not ashamed to say that I deliberately encourage the publication of papers that are skeptical of climate change," she told the Guardian in 2011. Indeed, in the early 2000s, when scientists were just figuring out how much humans were changing the climate, public figures such as Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-Ohio) began citing research published in the journal in the name of delaying political action.
A few years ago, it emerged that Willie Soon, a scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, had accepted $1.2 million from fossil fuel interests to publish studies, which he described as "deliverables," in academic journals. (Much of his research has argued that variations in the sun's energy can explain most recent global warming and that humans have had little effect on climate change, a thesis rejected by the majority of experts.) Peer review did not uncover these vested relationships: The editor of the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics told a reporter that it relied on authors to be truthful about conflicts of interest.
Just as peer review fails to detect funding sources, it often also fails to catch ghostwriting, in which companies draft articles for academics who go on to publish them under their own names, sometimes with few or no changes. The editor of one journal told the Senate Finance Committee in 2010 that he suspected that at least a third of the papers submitted to his journal were ghostwritten by public relations agencies and paid for by pharmaceutical companies. Such articles have appeared in dozens of journals, and ghostwriting scandals have involved professors at the University of Pennsylvania, Brown and Harvard. Last year, court documents revealed that Monsanto ghostwrote articles that were published in peer-reviewed journals to counter research on the carcinogenicity of the pesticide glyphosate and to attack regulatory bodies.
Peer review has also sometimes stymied important research. Senior scientists are more likely to be asked to assess submissions, and they can shoot down articles that conflict with their own views. As a result, peer review can act as a shield to protect the status quo and suppress research viewed as radical or contrary to the established perspectives of referees. A 2015 study of 1,000 medical journal submissions found that of the papers that were eventually published, the 14 that became the most frequently cited were initially rejected. Groundbreaking studies by Sir Frank MacFarlane Burnet, Rosalind Yalow, Baruch Blumberg and others were rejected by peer reviewers, yet later led to Nobel Prizes.
Scientists understand that, despite its limitations, we need peer review: It is hard to imagine how we would get along without it. They also understand that it's a human process and thus rife with human failings. But these subtleties are rarely communicated to the public. With more transparency about the publication process, we might have a more nuanced understanding of how knowledge is built - and fewer people taking "peer-reviewed" to mean settled truth.

An estate planning lawyer’s approach to blended families

Texto completo: This is part three in a series of five articles discussing the following case hypothetical from the various professional perspectives:
A and B are getting married. A has two kids from a previous marriage. B has one child from a prior marriage. They plan to have children together. A receives child support from a former spouse. A’s mother also lives with them and helps care for the children. B’s only child works in B’s business and both A and B hope their joint child(ren) will one day join the business as well. A and B have a lot to discuss!
The first thing I would tell A and B about their estate planning is “don’t try to plan for the next 20 years right now.” Trying to plan for too many “what ifs” can cause analysis paralysis. The best practice is to get a plan in place that addresses the “what ifs” of the next three to five years. That’s particularly true for A and B — newlyweds with a newly blended family. That’s why trusts are living documents — they need to be reviewed and adjusted over time as families, circumstances and laws change.
As long as you remain competent and alive, you can amend your trust. And if you don’t, well, you’ve put the right plan in place at the right time.
Currently, there are minor children involved. Were A to pass away, A may want or need to plan for the support and care of the children rather than B, who is likely self-sufficient and not dependent on A’s support at this early stage in their relationship. Later, when A’s children are grown and gone, A is more likely to want or need to provide for B.
B currently has to think about B’s business. In the event of B’s death, B may want to see B’s child carry on the business. If A needs an income stream from B’s estate however, an outright transfer of the business might not work. B’s options would include keeping the business owned by a trust with income paid to A, but with B’s child still running the business and getting a salary. Or, perhaps B can obtain life insurance that would pay to A and allow the business to be transferred to his child.
Life insurance or some other income stream (retirement plans, annuities, etc.) of B are useful here. If A is significantly younger than B, or close in age to B’s child, and B plans to provide for A first, then B’s child, there could be tension. A plan that has a child “waiting around for step-parent to die” can be an invitation to discord (witness the step-parent vs. children disputes of celebrities like Casey Kasem, Robin Williams and Glen Campbell).
If B has a stream of income that can be directed to either B’s child or A with the remaining assets going to the other of them, that can reduce tension. This may give the best hope for a continuing relationship between a child and a step-parent.
In the event of A’s death or incapacity, does the surviving biological parent (e.g. A’s ex-spouse) have custody of the minor children? If so, A may not be able to plan for B’s involvement with the children, but perhaps leaving money in trust with B as the trustee will at least assure some contact and oversight. If not, A will need to carefully consider whether A’s mother or B should be named guardian of the children.
At a minimum, A will want to get powers of attorney and health care directives for minors that allow for A’s mother and B to take care of the children in an emergency, including making health care decisions for the children if A is not able to.
If A and B should die together, who gets what and when requires careful analysis.
A’s children are younger than B’s one child, and if they have additional children in the future, the age gap will be greater. A and B can consider a “common trust” that holds all assets in one trust for the benefit of all children until the youngest child reaches a certain age or graduates from college.
The trustee makes distribution for “health, education, support and maintenance” of all the children, but is not required to do so equally. This gives the youngest child the same advantages as the older children for whom college, a car, perhaps a wedding, was already paid for prior to their parents’ passing.
When the youngest child reaches the stated age, the trust can be divided into shares for the children and distributed outright or over time when each child hits a certain age. The size of those shares is another area for discussion.
Does B’s child get half and A’s children split the other half? If A and B have a child together does that child get a portion of each half? The short-term answer is likely to be much different than the answer 20 years from now.
The decisions to be made will necessarily take into consideration whether there is a large disparity between the assets of A and B, and there are many formulas and approaches to deciding what’s “fair.”
I would say to A and B what I often say to my clients: This may be the first time you’ve had to design your estate plan, but your lawyer has done hundreds if not thousands of plans. No matter how complicated you may think your family is, it’s our job to help you figure out what works for your family, to provide some options for you, and get it all documented.
Then A and B can concentrate on the fun parts of their upcoming Brady Bunch life together. And I’d also say congratulations! And best wishes! And I’ll see you again in three to five years.

Texto completo: For the second set of Democratic debates, we knew we wanted to do something different. We had covered the first round -- back-to-back debates featuring 20 candidates -- in a single episode featuring Alex Burns that analyzed the meaning of what had happened onstage.
But as we looked ahead to the next 11 debates, we realized that experimentation was in order. Was there a different way to cover these? What could we say each morning that would not have been said elsewhere, over and over, the night before?
Our producer Andy Mills had an idea. The debates were scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. What if we waited until Friday's show to weigh in, not necessarily on the big moments of the debates, but on their overall format and structure and the logic behind them? We were intrigued.
Andy brainstormed with Reid Epstein, a campaign reporter who has covered presidential politics for years. The two discussed the history of debates and what made this year's so different. The story Reid told, about the Democratic National Committee's decision to create new qualifications for the debates and the consequences of that move, suggested Andy's intuition had been right. There was a story here -- and it was bigger than we thought: The D.N.C.'s new rules had generated unexpected and unprecedented changes to the campaign itself.
That spark eventually became the spine of Friday's episode, which Andy outlined on a whiteboard Wednesday morning with executive producer Lisa Tobin. (More on that process below.)
We briefly summarized the debates at the end of our Wednesday and Thursday episodes, using highlights from the night before. Then we put those moments into a much larger context in Friday's show.
We're eager to hear what you thought of the approach. After all, we have 10 more Democratic debates to go.

Secret episode ingredient: hot sauce
Andy Mills on what's happening in this photo (and his fondness for whiteboards):
"Of all the things I love about my job, perhaps my favorite thing is brainstorming with my brilliant colleagues. I love the sound of ideas being thrown around as the marker squeaks and scribbles on the whiteboard. I love the way that order begins to emerge from the chaos. I love the electric charge of discovering something truly surprising in a story that seemed tame and dutiful. I love the moment when we find that inside an important issue we want to cover, there's a plot! Inside a concept, a structure! This photo captures one of those moments as we were figuring out Friday's episode."

Making the interest rate ... interesting
Producer Clare Toeniskoetter on the opening of Thursday's show:
"As Michael pointed out on Twitter, interest rates may be the single most boring subject on earth (a claim not everyone endorses). We talked through how to liven up the topic and landed on using the Federal Reserve's news conference on Wednesday afternoon. The pros? It's a live event, and we can use the audio! The cons? It's still about interest rates.
"We decided to try something new. We would watch the news conference in the studio with a colleague, economics reporter Ben Casselman, who could help Michael unpack the news in real time -- kind of like two sports commentators, but with one (Michael) who doesn't know the rules."
______
On 'The Daily' this week
Monday: We asked Eric Holder, President Obama's attorney general, about his plans to fight partisan gerrymandering -- and why he says his efforts will benefit not only Democrats.
Tuesday: A risky software system on the Boeing 737 Max jet was implicated in two deadly crashes in five months. Why did federal regulators deem it safe to fly?
Wednesday: Alex Burns on Senator Kamala Harris's presidential run: "A lot of Democratic voters I talked to still feel like they don't totally have their arms around what the vision is supposed to be."
Thursday: The economy is in a historic boom. So why is the Fed acting as if it's not? Ben Casselman explains.
Friday: If you thought this week's Democratic debates felt like reality TV, you're not alone. Reid Epstein looks at the consequences of new debate rules in the era of cable news.

Texto completo: This past Tuesday and Wednesday may have been the last time that viewers nationwide saw Marianne Williamson warn of "dark psychic forces," John Delaney spar with Bernie Sanders on healthcare, or Kirsten Gillibrand condemn Joe Biden for a decades-old op-ed.
Only eight of the more than 20 Democrats aspiring to be their party's presidential nominee have qualified for the debate stage in September, and many others are not close to making the cut.
Higher qualification standards are set to slash the number of presidential candidates in the debate set for Sept. 12 and 13 in Houston to around 10.
Candidates must exceed 130,000 individual donors and receive at least 2% support in at least four qualifying primary polls but Aug. 28 to make the September debate, roughly double the standard for the first two rounds: 65,000 donors or 1% support in three polls.
There is a chance that the debate could take place over one night rather than two, but the Democratic National Committee has not clarified what number of qualifying candidates would trigger a second night of debate.
The eight candidates who appear to have qualified for the September debate, hosted by ABC in partnership with Univision, are:
Former Vice President Joe BidenNew Jersey Sen. Cory BookerSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete ButtigiegCalifornia Sen. Kamala HarrisMinnesota Sen. Amy KlobucharFormer Texas Rep. Beto O’RourkeVermont Sen. Bernie SandersMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren
Booker and Klobuchar are the most recent candidates to qualify, with Booker announcing Monday that he reached 130,000 donors and Klobuchar sharing the news on Friday.
Three candidates announced to being close or exceeding 130,000 donors but still need more qualifying polls by Aug. 28:
Former Housing Secretary Julián CastroTech entrepreneur Andrew YangHawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard
Gabbard most recently passed the 130,000 threshold, reaching the mark on Friday, campaign spokesman Cullen Tiernan told the Washington Examiner.
Castro and Yang each have three of the four needed qualifying polls, while Gabbard has one.
The Yang campaign on Tuesday accused the Democratic National Committee "political establishment" of "stacking the deck against" him.
Yang on Monday had announced that he met the four-poll standard, but the DNC then clarified to presidential campaigns that they could not count both a July 11 NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll and a July NBC/Survey Monkey national poll toward qualification due to a rule that the four qualifying polls must come from different sponsoring organizations or if by the same organization in different geographies. Yang received 2% in each of the two polls, and his campaign maintains that the DNC should count both polls because the Wall Street Journal is listed as an approved sponsoring organization.
The DNC's clarification only negatively affected Yang. All other candidates had either more than four other qualifying polls or did not receive 2% or more support in the two polls.
Only two other candidates have any qualifying polls: Tom Steyer, a billionaire investor and advocate for impeaching President Trump and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.
Steyer, who launched his presidential campaign on July 9 and plans to spend $100 million of his own money on his presidential bid, has two qualifying polls but had not revealed how many donors he has so far. His campaign has been spending $100,000 a day on Facebook ads, most of which ask for a $1 donation to help reach the donor threshold.
While Hickenlooper has one qualifying poll, he appears to be far from reaching the number of donors needed and has faced staff turmoil and turnover in his campaign. The New York Times estimated that he had around 15,000 donors as of June 30, about a ninth of the number he needs for September.
Candidates who have not yet announced reaching 130,000 donors or received any qualifying polls include Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (whose campaign said Thursday it was "just shy" of 100,000 donors), Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, spiritual author Marianne Williamson, and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who did not appear in either the June or July debates.
Those who miss the mark for the third debate could still qualify for the fourth round in October, which has the same qualification standards as the September debate. Missing out on a debate, however, is considered detrimental to a presidential hopeful's chances.

Playboy reporter Brian Karem says White House suspending his press pass

Texto completo: Playboy's White House correspondent Brian Karem said his White House press pass is being suspended.
"Received an email today shortly before 5 p.m. from the WH: as of Monday afternoon my press pass is suspended for 30 days," Karem tweeted.
Tweet
It was not immediately clear why. Karem has had a number of high-profile combative exchanges with members of the Trump administration.
Last month, he got into a confrontation with former White House staffer Sebastian Gorka following President Trump’s July 11 social media summit. Karem said the audience, which were mainly right-wing provocateurs and social media influencers, a “group of people that are eager for demonic possession.” A fight nearly broke out.
Gorka responded to the news no social media, tweeting, "Don’t be sad Brian. You’re still a punk."
Tweet
Back in 2017, Karem gained notoriety for going on a tirade during a White House briefing led by then-press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
“You’re inflaming everybody right here and right now with those words," he argued. "This administration has done that as well. Why in the name of heavens—any one of us, right, are replaceable, and any one of us, if we don’t get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not read us. You have been elected to serve for four years at least. There’s no option other than that. We’re here to ask you questions, you’re here to provide the answers, and what you just did is inflammatory to people all over the country who look at it and say, see, once again, the President is right and everybody else out here is fake media. And everybody in this room is only trying to do their job.”
Back in 1990, he was sentenced to six months in prison for refusing to give up the names of sources that helped him attain an interview with a man suspected of murdering a police officer, according to the New York Times.
Last November, CNN's Jim Acosta faced a similar fate. His press pass was revoked after an altercation during a press conference with the president. His press pass was ultimately reinstated after the network filed a lawsuit and a judge said that the reporter had not been afforded due process.

ATTACKS ON HARRIS' RECORD: ON TARGET OR NOT?

Texto completo: Kamala Harris faced a barrage of tough attacks over her criminal justice record at Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate, with two rivals accusing her of ramping up drug prosecutions, failing wrongfully convicted defendants and keeping inmates in prison for cheap labor.
While some of the broadsides from former Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii were on point, not all of their claims stand up to scrutiny.
The scrum represented the most prominent airing so far of criticism that has dogged Harris since she jumped into the presidential campaign in January.
"The people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor you owe them an apology," Gabbard told Harris.
Harris stood her ground, attacking Biden for his own history of supporting tough-on-crime bills in the Senate and, after the debate, laying into Gabbard for her past defense of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.
Here's a rundown of Biden and Gabbard's accusations and what they got right and wrong about Harris' record:
DISMISSED CASES
Joe Biden: Harris "had a police department when she was there that, in fact, was abusing people's rights. was told by her own people her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorneys like me that  the police officer did something that did not give you information of what would exculpate your client. She didn't do that. She never did it. And so what happened? Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough. And he freed 1,000 of these people. If you doubt me, Google 1,000 prisoners freed, Kamala Harris.' "
The facts: Biden is correct in describing the broad outlines of this episode, but he doesn't explain the full story and messes up many of the details.
The former vice president, who once served as a public defender in Delaware, is referring to a scandal Harris faced in her last year as San Francisco district attorney. A technician in the city's police drug lab had been skimming some of the cocaine she was supposed to test, possibly contaminating results.
Several members of Harris' staff had had concerns about the technician but continued to prosecute cases based on the lab's work and failed to tell defense attorneys about the issue for months. (Harris has said she wasn't told about the problem until it became public.) After blistering criticism from a state judge, Harris moved to dismiss about 1,000 drug cases.
At the time, Harris was slow to admit fault, with her office originally accusing the judge of bias because she was married to a defense attorney. But she took responsibility in an interview with The Washington Post this year, saying "The buck stops with me."
Some of the details Biden got wrong include: Harris' office moved for the cases to be dropped, not the judge. Not all 1,000 cases involved inmates who were "freed." The technician was not a police officer. And the judge in the case was a state judge, not a federal judge (and a woman, not a man).
DEATH ROW APPEALS
Tulsi Gabbard: "She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. In the case of those who were on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so."
The facts: Harris' attorney general office did block DNA testing that some legal observers believe could have helped overturn the murder conviction of a death row inmate who insisted he was framed.
Harris opposed efforts by lawyers for Kevin Cooper, a death row inmate from San Bernardino County, to get new DNA testing. In 2018, following a New York Times investigation into the case, Harris said she was wrong and called for further testing. Gov. Jerry Brown and his successor, Gavin Newsom, ordered additional testing to take place, which is still ongoing.
Her attorneys also defended several other convictions with serious problems. In one case, her office defended a murder conviction in which a prosecutor allowed false testimony in court. That provoked harsh criticism of her office from a federal appeals court panel, and Harris later changed her position, arguing for the conviction to be reversed.
INMATE LABOR
Tulsi Gabbard: "She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California."
The facts: It's false to say Harris kept prisoners incarcerated beyond their sentences. Lawyers in Harris' attorney general office did unsuccessfully argue against the early release of prisoners, citing needed inmate firefighting labor but Harris said they did so without her knowledge and publicly criticized the statement at the time.
In September 2014, attorneys for Harris argued in a court filing that the state should not free some prisoners as part of efforts to reduce prison crowding because it would negatively impact programs that put inmates to work fighting wildfires. That would "severely impact fire camp participation a dangerous outcome while California is in the middle of a difficult fire season and severe drought," the lawyers wrote. A judge ruled against Harris' office's request.
When the memo provoked headlines that fall, Harris spoke out against it and said she was not aware of it. "The way that argument played out in court does not reflect my priorities," she told the website ThinkProgress. "The idea that we incarcerate people to have indentured servitude is one of the worst possible perceptions. I feel very strongly about that. It evokes images of chain gangs."
MARIJUANA PROSECUTIONS
Tulsi Gabbard: "She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana."
The facts: This is a highly misleading statistic.
Gabbard appears to be referring to the number of Californians who were sent to state prisons for marijuana-related offenses while Harris was state attorney general. The conservative Washington Free Beacon reported this year that at least 1,560 people went to prison for pot during Harris' tenure from 2011 through 2016, citing reports from the California corrections department that are no longer available on its website. A department spokesman said it would take him several days to confirm those stats.
But the attorney general's office doesn't directly prosecute the vast majority of drug cases in the state. That's up to the individual district attorneys in each county. It's wrong to say Harris put those people in jail. Still, Harris did directly prosecute marijuana cases as San Francisco district attorney from 2004 through 2010. The DA's office has not yet released data about pot convictions during that time period.
While launching her attorney general reelection campaign in 2014, Harris let out a big laugh when asked by a local TV reporter about her opponent's support of legalizing pot for recreational use. This year, Harris has come out in support of decriminalizing marijuana on the federal level, proposing a sweeping plan last week to bring the cannabis industry out of the legal shadows. She said in an interview in February that she'd personally smoked weed as a college student "and I inhaled."

Every day from August 7 to 11, visitors at SoHo’s Leslie Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art will enter the museum upon signing a waiver acknowledging their consent and understanding of what will take place within the space. They’ll leave with a letter penned by artist Savannah Knoop. One of four performers slated for the museum’s group exhibition, “Arch,” Knoop will interact with consenting participants through the performance titled Tripod Sweep . Seeking consent through eye contact, those who agree will become a three-legged entity with the artist, who will enact a Brazilian jiu-jitsu movement. With the participant’s hip as the axis point, the artist pushes up and over the active person’s shoulders, using them as a temporary crutch to roam the museum together. “This not about winning or losing; you win by engaging,” said Knoop about the collective learning element of the engagement. “Visitors will sign a typical 8.5″ by 11″ letter written in legal language and leave with a personal one about someone’s experience in their body.”
The 38-year-old artist, who uses gender neutral pronouns, has the body of an athlete with muscular arms and a lean physic, moving with grace and swiftness during final preparations at their Bushwick studio. Physical training is rarely required for art; however, for Knoop, who has been practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu for a decade, marital arts is inseparable from creative expression. Their upcoming performance about challenging social decorum is the most striking fruition of their intertwined practices of art and sports.

Performance and jiu-jitsu have equally informed Knoop’s approach to modern-day interactions and helped them build a hybrid of strength and fragility. They studied performance art with pioneers such as Vito Acconci and Simone Forti, and now, the trust and harmony they encounter in martial arts helps them parse this background. Wrestling four to five times a week, Knoop finds comfort and community in a practice sometimes misunderstood with violence. Knoop recalled the first time they witnessed the softness that lies inside the sport, a decade ago: “During a demonstration, I saw a man fix his opponent’s undone belt and fell in love with that moment of tenderness.”
Collective empathy and public response are pertinent subjects for Knoop, who first came into public awareness with a storied literary hoax in the late 90s and early 2000s. The then 19-year-old artist was amidst the skyrocketed rise of an author named JT Leroy, whose 1999 debut novel, Sarah , chronicles the life of a boy and his relationship to his mother, who works as a prostitute in West Virginia. The book’s real author, Laura Albert, who wrote three novels under the pseudonym JT Leroy, needed an androgynous face to embody her novel’s gender-defying nature. She convinced her boyfriend’s teenage sibling, Savannah, who had just moved to San Francisco, to play the part.
By the time JT’s second book, The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things , came out in 2001, he was partying with Winona Ryder and Courtney Love. His reclusive, but grungy downtown profile was glossed by a glamorous red carpet appearance at the Cannes Film Festival for the book’s film adaptation in 2004. Soon after, a 2005 New York Times exposé uncovered the scandal and revealed the two figures’ real identities.
The book that Knoop eventually wrote detailing this incredible story of assumed identities and public trickery, 2008’s Girl Boy Girl: How I Became JT Leroy , inspired a film, titled JT LeRoy . It stars Kristen Stewart and Laura Dern as the odd couple in the warped tale of accidental fame. “Life is an ongoing progression and evolution, and we all find ways into ourselves in increments as we get older,” Stewart mused to Observer over the phone, speaking about how she approached the character, adding, “Changing doesn’t always necessarily mean that you’re correcting something that was wrong in your past.” Indeed, Knoop’s fluctuation between gender roles throughout this formative period in their life has shaped their art practice irrevocably, and certainly given them a perspective on asking for public trust that few have experienced. “This story is about truth and lies invented to protect the truth, which can be messy and not one way!” added Dern about the co-dependency and relationship between Savannah and Laura, who were at the time deemed con artists by the public.
“This performance is made through exchange and response, which can only be experienced if the viewer approves to participate,” said Knoop about the parallel between their upcoming performance and their incredible story of the public stunt. Agreeing with both actresses, Knoop noted that the movie shows there was no victim or villain in the dynamic between Laura and Savannah: “There was power struggle with a push-and-pull between the two over Savannah’s body.” Similar notions of empathy, redemption and trust now echo in Knoop’s Tripod Sweep , which awaits its participants for collaboration.
Tripod Sweep will occur at the Leslie Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art from August 7 to 11.

Texto completo: A "Manhattan Project" for artificial intelligence is how Demis Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind, described his company in 2010, when I was one of its first investors. I took it as figurative grandiosity. I should have taken it as a literal warning sign, because that is how it was taken in foreign capitals that were paying close attention.
Now almost a decade later, DeepMind is the crown jewel of Google's A.I. effort. It has been the object of intense fascination in East Asia especially since March 2016 when its AlphaGo software project beat Lee Sedol, a champion of the ancient strategic board game of Go.
Such feats notwithstanding, DeepMind, having now gone on three times longer than the original Manhattan Project, is not clearly any closer to its core goal of creating an "artificial general intelligence" that rivals or replaces humanity. But it is finally becoming clear that, as with nuclear fission before it, the first users of the machine learning tools being created today will be generals rather than board game strategists.
A.I. is a military technology. Forget the sci-fi fantasy; what is powerful about actually existing A.I. is its application to relatively mundane tasks like computer vision and data analysis. Though less uncanny than Frankenstein's monster, these tools are nevertheless valuable to any army -- to gain an intelligence advantage, for example, or to penetrate defenses in the relatively new theater of cyberwarfare, where we are already living amid the equivalent of a multinational shooting war.
No doubt machine learning tools have civilian uses, too; A.I. is a good example of a "dual use" technology. But that common-sense understanding of A.I.'s ambiguity has been strangely missing from the narrative that pits a monolithic "A.I." against all of humanity.
A.I.'s military power is the simple reason that the recent behavior of America's leading software company, Google -- starting an A.I. lab in China while ending an A.I. contract with the Pentagon -- is shocking. As President Barack Obama's defense secretary Ash Carter pointed out last month, "If you're working in China, you don't know whether you're working on a project for the military or not."
No intensive investigation is required to confirm this. All one need do is glance at the Communist Party of China's own constitution: Xi Jinping added the principle of "civil-military fusion," which mandates that all research done in China be shared with the People's Liberation Army, in 2017.
That same year, Google decided to open an A.I. lab in Beijing. According to Fei-Fei Li, the executive who opened it, the lab is "focused on basic A.I. research" because Google is "an A.I.-first company" in a world where "A.I. and its benefits have no borders." All this is part of a "huge transformation" in "humanity" itself. Back in the United States, a rebellion among rank and file employees led Google last June to announce the abandonment of its "Project Maven" A.I. contract with the Pentagon. Perhaps the most charitable word for these twin decisions would be to call them naïve.
How can Google use the rhetoric of "borderless" benefits to justify working with the country whose "Great Firewall" has imposed a border on the internet itself? This way of thinking works only inside Google's cosseted Northern California campus, quite distinct from the world outside. The Silicon Valley attitude sometimes called "cosmopolitanism" is probably better understood as an extreme strain of parochialism, that of fortunate enclaves isolated from the problems of other places -- and incurious about them.
A little curiosity about China would have gone a long way, since the Communist Party is not shy about declaring its commitment to domination in general and exploitation of technology in particular. Of course, any American who pays attention and questions the Communist line is accused by the party of having a "Cold War mentality" -- but this very accusation relies on forgetfulness and incuriosity among its intended audience.
Since 1971, the American elite's Cold War attitude toward China's leaders has been one of warm indulgence. In the 1970s and 1980s, that meant supporting China against a greater adversary, the Soviet Union. What is extremely strange is that this policy of indulgence continued and even deepened after the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991.
A few years after the Cold War ended, American leaders started treating China the way they had treated West Germany and Japan. We tolerated punishing trade deficits in the 1970s and 1980s to support those two allies, and we had strategic reasons to do it. As for building up China in the 1990s and 2000s, America's generosity was supposed to somehow lead to China's liberalization. In reality, it led to the transfer of our industrial base to a foreign rival.
In this sense, a zombie "Cold War mentality" never went away -- though it certainly stopped making sense. Only recently, with help from Mr. Xi's decision last year to, in effect, declare himself potential leader for life, has Donald Trump become the first president since Richard Nixon to pay attention and run a reality check on China.
Silicon Valley is not alone in its inattention to geopolitical reality; some on Wall Street have been eager to make excuses for Google's naïveté. The timing is not coincidental; just this week American officials met their Chinese counterparts in Shanghai to negotiate a trade deal.
The flip side of China's huge trade surplus has been America's huge current account deficit. All of the dollars we send abroad that never get used to buy American goods have to go somewhere, and most go through New York's money center banks on their way to buying financial assets. Since upsetting this imbalance is a threat to profits, Wall Street would prefer to cave on trade and keep Google's stock price high while they're at it.
But the banks' experience of the last few decades of globalization has not been representative. The trade deficits that brought flows of money to Wall Street took jobs and bargaining power away from the median worker.
Wages have been stagnant since the 1970s. The difference between our post-1971 era of globalization and the post-1945 midcentury boom is a breakdown in the relationship between the parts and the whole: An archipelago of inward-looking, parochial places like Wall Street and Silicon Valley have done exceedingly well for themselves while their fellow citizens have been left behind in a stagnant economy.
In the 1950s, the cliché was that "what's good for General Motors is good for the country." Google makes no such claim for itself; it would be too obviously false. Instead, Google says it is "committed to significantly improving the lives of as many people as possible"-- a standard so vague as to defy any challenge.
By now we should understand that the real point of talking about what's good for the world is to evade responsibility for the good of the country.

Texto completo: Two men sit across the table in a barren visiting room. One is straight-backed and impassive, the other slumped and absent. A third man comes in, raises the slouching one up, places the pair's hands into a clasp and angles their heads so they look at each other. Then he gently moves away.
Elsewhere, a group watches, from a short distance, someone sleeping on a narrow cot. People stare into peeling walls or out grimy windows. Figures come together tableau-like, as in silent chorus, and hold their pose.
Gestures do the talking in "Mirror/Echo/Tilt," the video installation that the filmmaker Melanie Crean, the visual artist Sable Elyse Smith, and the performance artist Shaun Leonardo have on view at the New Museum -- an unusually intimate meeting of art, education and social action.
Majestic and eerie, the 18-minute video features 22 participants in white Tyvek jumpsuits and, for some, carnival-like masks adorned with mirrored tiles. They enact scenes derived from their experiences with the police, courts, or jail, conveyed in a silent theatrical language where emotions hold sway.
Smaller screens around the gallery confront visitors with outtakes of this material. A resource room has a seminar table and a small library of books -- mostly on incarceration, as well as Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man," Joseph Campbell's "The Hero With a Thousand Faces," and "Don Quixote."
And beyond the museum, the artists have used the methods honed in the performance project to design a diversion program -- an alternative to jail time that young people facing misdemeanor charges in Brooklyn Criminal Court can complete to have their record sealed.
"Mirror/Echo/Tilt" joins a growing wave of art contending with the 2.2 million adults held in America's prisons and jails. In 2016, Andrea Fraser wired the empty fifth floor of the Whitney Museum with speakers that played ambient sound recorded at prisons. In recent months, Cameron Rowland's project "D37," at MOCA Los Angeles, laid out objects in a room that connected chattel slavery with today's police practice of asset forfeiture; "The Pencil Is the Key," opening this fall at the Drawing Center, will join works by artists around the world who were once prisoners.
"Mirror/Echo/Tilt" has its roots in a literary epiphany. In the summer of 2014, when Michael Brown died at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. -- three weeks after Eric Garner met a similar fate on Staten Island -- Ms. Crean was reading "Don Quixote."
In the furor over Mr. Brown's depiction in the news media -- including a New York Times profile that labeled the unarmed teenager "no angel" -- Ms. Crean, who teaches at Parsons School of Design, heard a resonance of Cervantes's classic novel and its absurdist plot. In the second half of the two-part epic, the characters Quixote encounters have read the first volume, along with a bogus "sequel," and they judge him on that basis.
"The character was defamed as being crazy," Ms. Crean said. "Don Quixote would show up in a town, his reputation would precede him, and he would have to confront it."
The lesson: Society narrates us into roles that can overwhelm us even when we struggle to break free. The stakes are especially high for people in the grip of the justice system, and neighborhoods subject to surveillance and overpolicing.
"Mass incarceration is a type of performance," Ms. Smith said. "There's posturing, there's labeling, all this theatricality, in the way that people either label demographics or play out the theater of oppression."
The three artists in "Mirror/Echo/Tilt" brought together deep, if unorthodox, expertise. Ms. Crean's past projects have built on social practice work with various groups in the city, for instance with spoken-word artists in the Bronx or young Muslim women in Queens.
The fast-rising Ms. Smith -- she was a 2018-19 artist in residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem -- mixes film, text and sculptural installation in her art, but has kept her focus on the culture of incarceration.
Mr. Leonardo explores race, gender and power through performance. In 2015 he developed "I Can't Breathe," a hybrid performance and self-defense class where participants learned the chokehold used on Eric Garner -- and how hard it is to defend against.
"I was interested in the principles of embodied performance," Mr. Leonardo said of taking part in "Mirror/Echo/Tilt." "How we can take information that would otherwise simply live in our minds and dislodge it and move it somewhere else."
Creating "Mirror/Echo/Tilt" was a gradual process. For several months in 2015, the three held weekly sessions with young people at a Bronx nonprofit, the Point. The next year, assisted by one of the Bronx participants, DeVante Lewis, they worked with a group returning from incarceration through the re-entry support organization Fortune Society.
The beginning was loose -- conversation, developing comfort with one another, sharing meals. Eventually a method emerged, as they considered emotions raised by incarceration.
The decision to go wordless in "Mirror/Echo/Tilt" followed naturally. "After just existing together, with personal narratives emerging, in order to organize ourselves around these stories we actually had to remove language," Mr. Leonardo said.
The locales where they filmed are pungent with history: They include the long-abandoned Bronx borough courthouse; the former Fulton Correctional Facility, also in the Bronx, a minimum-security prison closed in 2011; a long-sealed theater in the former Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital, now a city homeless shelter and intake center.
The buildings, like the performers, express a kind of identity in flux -- edifices emerging from carceral or related uses, if not yet stably dedicated to something else.
Four years in the making, "Mirror/Echo/Tilt" is complete as an art project, in the sense that it has produced a museum show. Outside, however, the work has only begun. Since late 2016 the three collaborators have worked with the artist nonprofit Recess and its partner, Brooklyn Justice Initiatives, on a diversion program for "court-involved" youth.
They have trained facilitators and written a curriculum that others can adapt. "Having an open-source receptacle for this information became a goal," Ms. Smith said.
Mr. Lewis, the participant from the Point who stayed for the rest of the project, shared that he grew up with family members "constantly going back and forth between prison and home" -- experiences that he avoided scrutinizing or talking about.
He had a background in acting, but this wordless method unlocked something new, he said. "It allowed me to present my full self, I guess." He added: "The best thing I could take away from it is that the body remembers."
Now working full time for an alternatives-to-incarceration program, Mr. Lewis is turning his attention to the impact of the court and prison system on young women -- the gender roles and the demands on their emotional labor -- and plans to work toward a syllabus.
"Mirror/Echo/Tilt" has taken shape in an ambiguous time. High-profile deaths of black men following encounters with police, which first prompted the project, have hardly abated. Yet alternative justice programs are spreading, reformers have won election in some cities as district attorneys, and prison abolition is no longer laughed away.
Ms. Crean cast the collaboration not as a work of protest, but rather of imagination.
"If there is a problem -- a system -- and one has to demonstrate how another way of being is possible, that's what artists and educators can do," she said.
The piece, she said, was at once art, education, a social intervention. "It can be accessed from any of those points," she said. "But for us it's all of those things."

Texto completo: The Defense Department missed a top Republican lawmaker's deadline to provide information about an FBI informant who was a source for the bureau's Trump-Russia investigation during the 2016 election cycle.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley wrote to then-acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper earlier this month seeking details about contracts the Defense Department's Office of Net Assessment had with Stefan Halper, a former Republican operative and White House aide who became a foreign policy academic with close ties to both American and British intelligence.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Halper had discussions with at least three Trump campaign members: foreign policy aides George Papadopoulos and Carter Page as well as Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis. The New York Times reported in April that the Justice Department inspector general was looking into his actions to see if he exceeded the scope of his assignment.
Grassley's letter, which cited concerns about whether the defense contracts "were used to support potential partisan political or other improper or wasteful activities," set a July 25 deadline. And while the Defense Department responded to the Iowa Republican's demand, Grassley's office said the department's response was inadequate.
“Senator Grassley received a response from DoD regarding his request for more information on the steps DoD has taken to address contract oversight and management failures that the DoD IG identified during a review of Stefan Halper’s contracts. DoD’s response failed to address the questions detailed in his original letter. Senator Grassley has reiterated to DoD that they must address all of his questions in writing and provide the requested documentation," Grassley said in a statement shared with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday.
A Defense Department representative confirmed receipt of Grassley's request and told the Washington Examiner, "As with all congressional correspondence, we will respond directly to the request."
Grassley's letter was a follow-up to a Defense Department inspector general audit, which he requested, of $1.05 million worth of contracts with Halper between 2012 and 2018 to complete studies related to Chinese military strategy, China's economy, and "the prospect of Russian-Chinese collaboration against the United States."
Noting how the audit said ONA was unable to provide "sufficient" documentation on Halper's work and travel expenses, which the watchdog found was commonplace for similar contracts, Grassley wrote the audit "revealed significant flaws in ONA’s contract management and oversight process that clearly indicate ONA’s internal controls over taxpayer-funded work are weak or non-existent."
Grassley demanded the Defense Department explain steps taken to address the inspector general's recommendations and ONA to provide a briefing to his committee's staff on the Halper contracts.
Grassley's request for an audit followed a Washington Times report in the fall of 2018 about a Pentagon strategist who was stripped of his security clearance after he complained to superiors about dubious contracts given to Halper. The report said the ONA strategist, Adam Lovinger, was a supporter of President Trump, and in an ethics complaint, his attorney said Lovinger warned his superiors about “sweetheart” deals for Halper and for a “best friend” of Chelsea Clinton, who is the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Halper was the director of American studies in the department of politics and international studies at Cambridge University, where he worked for years alongside Sir Richard Dearlove, who had spent decades with MI6 including as its director from 1999 to 2004.
Christopher Steele, who was hired by the Clinton campaign-funded opposition research firm Fusion GPS and was the author of the Trump dossier used in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications to target Carter Page, was in MI6 from 1987 until 2009. Dearlove has described Steele as the “go-to person on Russia in the commercial sector” and said his reputation is “superb.” Inspector General Horowitz is investigating allegations of FISA abuse and is expected to release his report after Labor Day.
Halper organized and hosted a series of Cambridge Intelligence Seminars that were attended by intelligence community members, academics, and researchers from around the world. One such seminar in 2014, put together by both Halper and Dearlove, was attended by then-President Barack Obama’s Defense Intelligence Agency Director Michael Flynn, who played a prominent role in the Trump campaign beginning in early 2016 and served a short stint as Trump’s national security adviser in 2017. Halper also reportedly ran into Page at Cambridge in summer 2016.
Dearlove is now listed as the chairman, and Halper is listed as a partner at the Cambridge Security Initiative, which states it “provides a unique link between the worlds of business, government, and academia with unrivaled expertise in security and intelligence issues.”

Jason Chaffetz: James Comey engaged in the same 'sneaky' behavior as Hillary Clinton

Texto completo: Former Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz said former FBI Director James Comey appears to have engaged in the same "sneaky" behavior as Hillary Clinton.
A new report said the Justice Department's inspector general referred Comey to Attorney General William Barr for likely leaking classified information when he gave a friend, after getting fired in May 2017, a memo that described a discussion he had with President Trump.
Although the DOJ has reportedly declined to prosecute, Chaffetz agreed that Comey was caught "red-handed" and connected Comey's actions to Clinton and the private email server she used during her time as secretary of state.
"Director Comey was so self-righteous in telling the world he didn't leak, he didn't do sneaky things, and that he knew the law better than anybody else. But when the FBI goes to your home and gets memos that reveal evidently we have to see if this is true, but confidential and classified information," the former Utah lawmaker told anchor Bill Hemmer.
He was referring to a disclosure by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which announced Wednesday it had obtained an FBI log about special agents arriving at Comey's home in June 2017 to retrieve his memos. The notes show Comey handed over four of them to the FBI agents, and he said to the best of his recollection two might be missing.
"One of the allegations in there, Bill, is that there were code names and the real names of people that were informants for the FBI," Chaffetz said. "You can't just take that information and put it into your own personal — have it personally. You just can't do that. And how ironic because that was the allegation against Hillary Clinton that there was classified information in a nonclassified setting. That's why the inspector general for the intelligence community made the recommendation to the Department of Justice to pursue an investigation of her."iFrame ObjectThe Hill reported on Wednesday that Inspector General Michael Horowitz sent a referral to the Justice Department about one of the memos Comey leaked to a friend. Although prosecutors found the watchdog's findings compelling, they decided against prosecution under classified information protection laws because of there being too much uncertainty surrounding Comey's intent. Comey has denied leaking classified information in his memos.
As chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Chaffetz was a leading investigator into Clinton's used of an unauthorized email server in the basement of her Chappaqua, New York residence. The FBI conducted its own investigation, and Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being "extremely careless" in handling information that was classified retroactively.
A month after he was fired, Comey testified to Congress he had leaked his notes to a friend to give to the media, hoping that it would spark a special counsel investigation. Then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel the day after the New York Times first reported on details from one of Comey's leaked memos, which claimed Trump pressed his FBI director to drop an investigation into his national security adviser Michael Flynn. That memo was classified as "confidential" — the lowest classification level — after Comey sent the information.
Chaffetz divulged a one-on-one conversation he had with Comey on handling classified material, stressing the dichotomy in the former FBI director's words and actions.
"We now know that Comey knew that the FBI had come and taken this information. But that is by its very definition sneaky in the way he did it but he also — you can't take classified information. I had a personal conversation, Bill, with Director Comey where he explained to me you can't read classified information and then summarize it in your own language and put it in a place that's not secure. You can't do that," Chaffetz said.
"I had a one-on-one conversation with him. We talked directly about that. He explained to me you cannot summarize classified information, put it in your own handwriting and then hold onto it personally. That's why he was pursuing Hillary Clinton but it appears he did the very same thing himself," he added.

Texto completo: A waterpark "tsunami" swallows dozens of swimmers, a super-Earth is discovered by scientists and a celebrity dancer opens up about her sexuality. Here’s today's news that everyone's talking about.
But first, a deadly tick bite: A New York resident has died from a rare virus spread by infected deer ticks. Here’s how to keep yourself – and your pets – safe from the disease.
Ashley Wagner: 'I chose to speak up'
Olympic figure skater Ashley Wagner came forward this week with a powerful story of sexual assault. In a first-person piece and pulls-no-punches video, Wagner detailed how fellow skater John Coughlin sexually assaulted her when she was 17 and Coughlin was 22. (Coughlin died by suicide in January. ) So why is she coming forward now? She says the #MeToo movement put her assault into context and because she wants to protect other young skaters. Wagner is the highest-profile skater to publicly share allegations of sexual assault in her sport.
"This is a pressure-cooker environment that will continue to create uncomfortable, inappropriate and unsafe workplaces unless something is done about it," she said. "I want kids to be able to stay kids in this sport. ”
Houston, we found a 'super-Earth'
A potentially habitable “super-Earth” was discovered just 31 light-years away from our own solar system, astronomers announced Wednesday. The planet, with the super catchy name GJ 357 d, is about six times bigger than Earth and orbits a dwarf sun, much smaller than our own, every 55. 7 days. The team of astronomers that discovered the planet said it could provide “Earth-like” conditions. But two questions remain: Is it actually habitable? And more importantly – if it shows signs of life – are we alone in the cosmos?
'This is not happening again!' They survived the Las Vegas shooting. Then they found themselves in Gilroy.
After surviving a horrendous mass shooting at a Las Vegas festival in 2017 that left 58 people dead, Alice Olive found solace in a Facebook support group for fellow survivors, where she met Christopher Cook and George Cook. Olive says it has taken her two years to get comfortable with the idea of attending another big outdoor music event.
In the end, she decided to join the Cook brothers at a local event last Sunday. The venue: the Gilroy Garlic Festival. Against seemingly impossible odds, the three survivors of the Las Vegas shootings – the deadliest single-day mass shooting in U. S. history – walked right into another massacre. Once again, they escaped alive.

Julianne Hough: 'I'm not straight'
Julianne Hough is opening up about her sexuality. The "America's Got Talent" judge told Women's Health that her journey of self-discovery came four months after tying the knot with husband Brooks Laich in 2017. “I [told him], ‘You know I’m not straight, right?’ And he was like, ‘I’m sorry, what?’ I was like, ‘I’m not. But I choose to be with you,’” she said. After opening up to her professional hockey player husband, she said the two have a more intimate relationship. “The more I dropped into my most authentic self, the more attracted he was to me," she said.

The Valerie Harper you might not know Another Viewpoint

Texto completo: For decades, millions of Americans have felt like they knew Valerie Harper from her TV role as Rhoda. Six years ago, we came to know Valerie in a new way as she shared what it was like to face terminal brain cancer.
There is still another role Valerie Harper played that deserves a spotlight even though she never did it for the credit. Let me tell you about the Valerie Harper you might not know.
In the first People magazine article about her 2013 diagnosis, Valerie said, "I just got a letter from a friend who's getting the Congressional [Gold Medal] in April. I hope I'm around then." She was. That friend was Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and Grameen Bank Founder Muhammad Yunus and his invitation begins to reveal the impact Valerie Harper's life has had.
Valerie has been a long-term supporter of empowering women through micro-loans for the poor around the world and of other issues benefiting families here and abroad. How long term? At a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing about micro-loans in 1987, former Republican Congressman Bob Dornan of California said, "I want to compliment my colleague Mr. Feighan (a Democrat of Ohio) and tell him what unusual lobbying his bill brings about. Sitting at home last week I got a call from a very important television star, Valerie Harper, otherwise known as Rhoda. And she said, 'I just know you're on this bill, Bob.' And I said, 'Well if I'm not, I'm going to get on it.'"
When Valerie Harper called Dornan and other committee members 32 years ago, about one million of the world's most impoverished people had access to a microloan. A third of a century later, the count has risen to more than 124 million very poor families.
Valerie wrote about the impact her mother's commitment to service had in her life when she wrote the foreword to my book Reclaiming Our Democracy: Healing the Break Between People and Government. "During the years I pursued my passion - a career in the performing arts," she wrote, "a little voice inside me asked. 'But is this of real value? Should I be doing something of more service - like my mom who is a teacher and nurse?'"
Valerie answered yes, and began using her celebrity to advance causes she cared about from the Equal Rights Amendment, to The Hunger Project, to ending homelessness in America.
"My celebrity became a tool I used to contribute to my community and my world," she wrote. "But I must make the choice to do so and find the means...."
"Her generosity toward people is overwhelming," said her husband, Tony Cacciotti, "she's always doing for others...."
I saw that generosity when Valerie and Tony jumped into action to support the Candlelight Vigils my organization, the anti-poverty lobby RESULTS, was organizing the week before the 1990 World Summit for Children.
I called Valerie to tell her about the upcoming summit and its intention to reduce the tragedy of 40,000 children dying each day from largely preventable malnutrition and disease. From my simple description came an avalanche of commitment. Over the next two months, she organized two briefings to bring celebrities onboard and a slew of national television appearances.
She also organized a full-page ad signed by 140 celebrities that appeared in the New York Times when Presidents Bush and Gorbachev were meeting in the U.S., urging the two leaders to attend the World Summit for Children. Valerie was on the phone day and night, talking to celebrities and their assistants about the summit and the ad. Signers included Frank Sinatra, Jackson Browne, Sting and Elizabeth Taylor, who gave her okay from a hospital bed.
The day after the ad appeared, UNICEF Executive Director Jim Grant wrote Valerie, Tony and their daughter Christina: "I returned last night from an encouraging audience with His Holiness the Pope on the future of the world's children and our joint efforts to make a difference. I returned to discover the New York Times advertisement. Clearly you and your colleagues have made a dramatic difference for the World Summit for Children and for children the world over."
Twenty-nine years after that summit, UNICEF reports that child deaths have been cut by more than half; more than 24,000 young lives are saved every day thanks to the programs for which Valerie and others advocated.
Valerie was no mere spectator to that change; she was one of the best supporting actors you could ask for. She didn't do it for applause or to get her name in lights, but at the final curtain call in this lifetime, she deserves a standing ovation for the difference she has made for millions of the world's poorest families.
Editor's note:A group of RESULTS advocates here in South Florida are carrying on her legacy in this work.
Sam Daley-Harris founded the anti-poverty lobby RESULTS, the Microcredit Summit and Civic Courage. Valerie Harper has served on the RESULTS board since 1986.

Takeaways: Buttigieg in second debate

Texto completo: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg didn't break much new ground on policy in the second Democratic debate, but he also avoided any stumbles.
Buttigieg led all Democratic primary candidates during second-quarter fundraising, but has consistently polled in the single digits, lagging behind the leading candidates. He is among several who were looking for breakthrough moments during Tuesday's nationally televised debate.
It remains to be seen what the voters think — and Wednesday's debate with 10 other Democratic candidates was still underway at deadline — but he certainly had time to make an impression. According to the New York Times, he had the third-most speaking time among the 10 candidates, lagging only the two most progressive candidates on stage, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
Here are the takeaways:
He took on Trump and Republicans He pivoted several times from questions to directly take on President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.
When asked about climate change, for instance, he said the candidates have similar visions. He then changed the subject to ask voters to how he'd look on stage next to Trump.
"Nominate me and you get to see the president of the United States stand next to an American war veteran," Buttigieg said, "and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was his chance to serve."
When asked about immigration, he said Trump could fix immigration now but needs to have a border crisis for political gain.
"We have a crisis on our hands," Buttigieg said, "and it's not just a crisis of immigration, it's a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border. It is a stain on the United States of America."
Republicans were targets too.
When asked about how he would retrain workers for 21st-century jobs, he pivoted to quote Scripture to criticize Senate Republicans for blocking a House bill that would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
"So-called conservative Christian senators," Buttigieg said, "right now in the Senate are blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage when Scripture says that whoever oppresses the poor taunts their maker."
He's been arguing Democrats should run on their faith.
When asked about age, he said anyone with the right vision could be president. Then he switched gears to chastise Republicans in Congress, who he said are enabling Trump.
He said they either "support naked racism in the White House or are, at best, silent about it."
Speaking directly to the camera, he told congressional Republicans "the thing you will be remembered for is whether in this moment with this president you found the courage to stand up to him or you continued to put party over country."
Stop worrying about what Republicans say He said Democrats spend too much time worrying about how their ideas will be portrayed by Republicans. Speaking on Democrats' support for various ways to expand Medicare, he said they should support the best policy.
"It is time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say," he said. "It is true if we embrace a far-left agenda, they are going to say we are a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they're going to do? They're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists. So let's just stand up for the right policy and go out there and defend it."
More on his thoughts on health care later.
He'd end the war in Afghanistan — quickly Buttigieg often says he'd put an end to "endless" wars without giving a specific timeline to withdraw from Afghanistan and Iraq. He was asked a leading question Tuesday about whether he would withdraw troops from Afghanistan in his first year of his first term. After a couple of prompts, he said he would.
He also said he thought he was going to be one of the last U.S. troops in Afghanistan when he served in 2014, a familiar refrain from his campaign.
He reminded voters he was there, recalling how terrible it was as a service member to hear news of someone killed, wondering if it was someone he knew.
'We're pretty close to the day when we will hear news of a casualty in Afghanistan who was not born on Sept. 11," Buttigieg said, using another familiar line from his campaign stops that usually draws gasps.
He also said he'd propose that Congress vote to send troops to war, and for operations that only last up to three years. He said he'd require any renewal to be authorized through a congressional vote.
Buttigieg distances himself from progressive candidates Warren and Sanders dominated the stage and both tried to make the case they're the ones with big ideas for the party going forward, especially on issues such as health care and education.
Buttigieg, though, said he wouldn't force everyone to go on Medicare. He would allow people to choose a public option for Medicare or keep their private insurance. He does think that, over time, everyone will choose Medicare.
When asked whether he'd tax the middle class to expand Medicare, he said he'd allow people to buy into it.
He also doesn't back free college or tuition forgiveness.
Buttigieg said he would compel states to make college more affordable and expand grant programs and a public-service loan forgiveness program. He said he also would stop for-profit colleges from taking advantage of people, especially veterans.
He tackled the South Bend police shooting Buttigieg said he's an urban mayor serving a diverse community with racial divides.
He said he wouldn't claim racism has ended on his watch, but he thinks the community has come together and progress has been made.
He said he's helped with housing in diverse areas, brought in the community to revise the use of police force and added public voices to a police oversight board.
He also referenced his Douglass Plan to end what he calls systemic racism in America's institutions, including involving health care, education and housing.
"If you walk into an emergency room and you are black, your reports of pain will be taken less seriously," he said. "If you apply for a job and you are black, you are less likely to be called just because of the name on the resume. It's why I propose to do everything from investing in historically red-lined neighborhoods, to build black wealth in home ownership to supporting entrepreneurship for black business owners."
He made a similar statement to the National Urban League last Friday in Indianapolis, at which point he promised he'd make the same statement to mostly white audiences that he was making to that mostly African American audience.
He wants to amend the Constitution Buttigieg said the country should eliminate the Electoral College, overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that allowed the expansion of corporate campaign donations and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural changes, by which he appears to mean adding more justices.
All of those would likely take amendments to the Constitution. He says people look at him funny when he suggests that's possible.
"This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that. And you're telling me we can't reform our democracy?"
Second night of the debate is Wednesday After a drawing, the mayor faced off with Warren, Sanders, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, author Marianne Williamson and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.
Wednesday's debate was to have featured former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Michael Bennett of Colorado, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.
Buttigieg is among a handful of candidates who already have qualified for the third round of debates in September by meeting certain fundraising and polling requirements. Fewer candidates are expected to reach those thresholds.
"The thing you will be remembered for is whether ... you found the courage to stand up to (Trump) or you continued to put party over country."

Texto completo: Well, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music ...
That old Three Dog Night song has a slow build, supple and sexy, not at all unlike the vibe you might experience as you sidle into Disney Springs' newest celebrity-chef enclave on a Saturday night. Jaleo has a jewel-toned hue. Crimson, or perhaps cherry.
No - sangria roja.
It seems rich enough to have a flavor, too. And it's only amplified when the dining room buzzes like the terrazas of Barcelona.
By now, you've likely heard of Chef José Andrés, but just in case, here are a scant few talking points from his resume: he's built tens of restaurants, received Michelin stars, earned multiple James Beard Foundation awards including "Outstanding Chef of the Year." He's been a Harvard professor, written New York Times bestsellers and - oh, by the way - he was recently nominated for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for his work with World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit he founded in 2010 that has since served millions of meals to people in the wake of disasters. That includes something like three million in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.
So, yeah. You may know his name.
The native Spaniard's cooking, however? Perhaps not.
Disney Springs is now home to the fifth Jaleo (the first opened the first in Washington, D.C. in 1993) and the buzz since the doors swung wide has been big enough to match the 22,000-square-foot space in which it is housed. Sinewy curves and quirky angles abound, along with citrus hues that match many of the flavors you'll find on the menu.
Lemon on oysters. Grapefruit-studded salad. Flan imbued with orange.
You'll find the essence of the latter filling your nose in spades should you choose the Inside Out cocktail as a liquid aperitivo ($14). I caught it on mine from across the table, so potent was the twist of orange peel that capped this amalgam of Spanish sweet vermouth, Penedés brandy, bourbon and Angostura bitters.
Less boozy but just as fruity are the sangria options. Roja ($10 glass, $24 half-carafe, $48 pitcher) or that made with sparkling Spanish cava ($12 glass, $32 half-carafe, $60 pitcher) will certainly have you feeling ready to explore the vast menu of tapas with a traveler's abandon. Crisp, light and colorful, these are streamlined versions of the drink to which you might be accustomed, mint-garnished and free of that familiar fruit flotilla.
Incidentally, just last week, Jaleo instituted Sangria Hour at its Disney Springs location, so thirsty guests can sample $6 sangria rojas, among other specials, from 3-6 p.m. daily.
Crisp as it is (especially at happy hour prices), the sangria has nothing on Jaleo's pan de cristal, though for fish lovers like me, the Anchoas don Bocarte version ($30) is the way to go. This dish pairs the bread, so phenomenally crusty, and its thick coat of fresh tomato with a full tin of oily-magical Don Bocarte Spanish anchovies.
Honestly, I could have this Omega-3 party-in-a-can for dinner every night, but I couldn't go to Jaleo without dipping my palate in the pool of molecular gastronomy and sampling their take on the liquid olives made famous by Spanish Chef Ferran Adrià. The Aceitunias modernas y clasicas ($12) features several alongside traditional olives stuffed with piquillo pepper and anchovy.
Modern science takes on a taste as old as time, to put it all Disney-like, using sodium alginate to create bite-sized balloons of olive juice that appear rather like the yolks of Seussian green eggs. Slurped from the spoon carefully, you can get a sense of its smooth texture and that of the liquid inside before it bursts into a briny bath for the tongue.
Interesting is a phrase I'd use before delicious - I'd reserve that for the actual olives - but worth the experience? For the curious and/or adventurous? A decided yes.
Same goes for the Ostras "Gin and Tonic" ($20), which were precisely that: delicate bivalves bathed in this classic cocktail so revered, and often fruit-infused, in Spain. Shellfish fans less adventurous might opt for the succulent Mejillones a la brasa ($15), a pound of Josper-roasted PEI mussels in a light broth permeated with basil (I'd have loved some of that pan de cristal for sopping with this).
With heavier dishes, like the aioli- and sauce-laden patatas bravas ($10) or Solomillo Ibérico al cabrales ($40, a pork tenderloin shareable for two to three people), I'd definitely recommend a lighter, crunchier contrast like the ensalada de remolacha con citricos ($13), wherein you'll find loads of that aforementioned citrus color and flavor.
Beautiful red beets top the crisp greens of this ample salad, along with delicate slices of orange and grapefruit, crunchy pistachios and a sherry dressing with creamy curds of sharp blue cheese.
Desserts, too - like the Flan al estilo traditional de mama Marisa con espuma de crema Catalana ($10) feature those citrus notes, employing actual oranges and the essence thereof in the Catalan cream foam. The pan con chocolate ($10) is a delight in which a lovely ball of dark, barely-sweet chocolate custard nestles up to its twin in brioche ice cream. Topped with a thin slice of caramelized bread and drizzled with olive oil, it's a dessert layered in tastes and textures.
You know, that same old Three Dog Night song ponders paradise and the Heartland right alongside España.
Well, I've never been to Heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
It seems incongruous, really, until you taste the Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo' ($11).
Big, fat, velvety-sweet dates. Wrapped in bacon. Lightly breaded. And deep-fried.
I've never been to Oklahoma, either. But, I hear the state fair delights can get pretty out there (last year's included deep-fried Buffalo chicken wing dip). And if there's a state fair in heaven, I'd bet anything Jaleo's datiles are a big hit on its cloud-laden midway.

Jaleo by José Andrés
Where: 1482 E. Buena Vista Drive in Orlando (inside Disney Springs)
When: 11:30 a.m.-11 p.m. daily
Cost: $9-75 (tapas, shareable)
Attire: Casual
More information: 321-348-3211; jaleo.com
Caption: Sweet-tart orange flavor pairs nicely with the caramel-creaminess of flan.
Fishy business: the pan de cristal (soooo crunchy) and Don Bocarte anchovies were a meal highlight for me.
At nighttime, Jaleo's interior color scheme really comes to life.

FIFA Quietly Considers Leaving Switzerland

Texto completo: Senior executives at FIFA, world soccer's governing body, are giving serious consideration to leaving Switzerland, the organization's home for nearly 90 years and where in 2015 some of its most senior officials were arrested in connection with a major corruption scandal.
Under Gianni Infantino, a Swiss administrator who was elected as president in 2016 after the fall of FIFA's longtime leader Sepp Blatter, FIFA has tried to move away from its past. Top leaders have been purged and efforts have been made to reform the organization and its decision-making processes, with varying degrees of success.
But after he was re-elected to a second term as president in June, Infantino tasked his top lieutenants with studying the viability of FIFA's leaving its glass-and-steel headquarters in Zurich. The discussion, which is still in its early stages, is driven by many factors, but two primary reasons are difficulties in hiring staff members from outside Europe and an acceptance that continuing to base its operations in a country with a reputation for corporate secrecy might not align with the goals of an organization trying to win back the public trust.
While FIFA has not made any public statements on the discussions, or the motivations behind them, two people familiar with the organization's plans told The New York Times that the organization is studying options for leaving Zurich. The plans could include leaving Zurich entirely or a partial relocation of operations, which could see FIFA open subsidiary offices in different parts of the world to give it better access to, and oversight of, its 211 member associations. Officials also have not ruled out maintaining the status quo, with all global operations handled from its current office.
The discussions with potential host countries and cities could be similar to those held by international corporations like Amazon, and just as in those competitions, a final decision most likely would depend both on practical concerns but also on what concessions FIFA can win.
FIFA was established in Paris in 1904 but moved to Zurich in 1932 because of Switzerland's location in the center of Europe, its political neutrality and because "it was accessible by train," according to a timeline on FIFA's website. In 2007, FIFA moved into its headquarters building on a hill overlooking Zurich, built at a cost of more than $ 200 million. The building, known as FIFA House, has several subterranean levels, including the marble-floored, soundproof room where its governing council holds its meetings.
Among the possibilities under consideration is a return to Paris, according to one of the people familiar with FIFA's thinking. But other locations are also under consideration with a number of factors expected to factor in any outcome, including proximity to a major international airport; what tax and visa status FIFA would be granted; and how local employment laws would affect FIFA employees and visitors. In recent years, FIFA officials have complained that Swiss law has made it difficult to recruit from overseas.
For Switzerland, which over decades has grown into the location of choice for international sporting federations, the departure of FIFA would represent a major loss, even with the organization's recent embarrassing scandals. Switzerland has long boasted of its ability to attract major sports organizations -- Lausanne, the home of the International Olympic Committee, actively recruits such organizations and has labeled itself "the Silicon Valley of sports" -- and highly paid employees provide a boost to the local economy.
Along with FIFA and the I.O.C., dozens of other regional and international sports bodies, both large and small, call Switzerland home. Their world here has been largely independent: they are lightly taxed, and for years they were exempt from Swiss anticorruption laws. The country even has its own arbitration court, the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is based in a chateau in Lausanne.
Sports organizations bring more than a billion dollars to Switzerland annually, according to a six-year study published in 2015.
"For a long time, we didn't have to do anything to attract them," Sabrina Attias, the city official charged with luring sports bodies to Lausanne, said in an interview with The New York Times in 2016. "Then we realized the opportunities and decided to be proactive."
Leaving Switzerland also may come as a relief to Infantino, who has found himself under siege in the Swiss news media recently over private meetings he held in 2016 with the country's attorney general, Michael Lauber. Revelations of the meetings led to the removal of Lauber from oversight of a Swiss investigation into corruption at FIFA that began in 2015 and has yet to result in any trials, much less a conviction.
The failure of the Swiss authorities to act in the corruption case has frustrated elements in FIFA's current leadership, who have privately expressed incredulity at the inaction given the amount of evidence obtained in raids on FIFA's headquarters.
Officials said they would not rush to make a decision on a possible move, though they acknowledged they did not feel any need to remain in Switzerland.

Texto completo: The New York Times theater critic Walter Kerr perhaps put it best in 1979: Hal Prince dared to "tread where his angels fear to follow."
It was that innovation across his four-decade career that won Mr. Prince an astounding 21 Tony Awards. The Times once heralded him as "the master of the towering bridge ('Evita'), the labyrinthine inferno ('Sweeney Todd') and the musical-within-the-musical ('Follies')."
His masterful experimentation with form, the larger-than-life shows he produced and directed, and his groundbreaking collaborations with some of the greatest composers of our time made him a tour de force -- the tour de force -- in his field.
[Read Hal Prince's obituary here.]
Mr. Prince's death on Wednesday at the age of 91 leaves a massive hole on Broadway (in his honor, theater lights will be dimmed at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday for one minute). The works he leaves behind, however, have unquestionably shaped the theater.
'Cabaret'
It goes without question that "Cabaret," a melancholy musical set in a nightclub during the rise of Nazism, wouldn't be "Cabaret" without Mr. Prince.
With his first directing hit -- which brought his first directing Tony Award -- Mr. Prince, also a producer of the show, left his creative fingerprints on every aspect of it. The cast's memorable centerpiece, the M.C., was a character entirely of Prince's creation, inspired by his time spent in Stuttgart while in the Army.
"I had hung out in a club called Maxim's in the basement of a bombed-out church, and there was a little M.C. with lipstick and eye shadow and false eyelashes, and he'd tell terrible tacky jokes," Mr. Prince recalled last year in his interview series, "The Hal Prince Talks." "And there were three very chunky girls in butterfly costumes dancing around him, and one drunk at the bar, and one drunk asleep at the table, and me in uniform, just thinking I'd been reborn and gone to heaven -- this is it."
'Company'
Mr. Prince left a legacy in the shows he created, both as director and producer, with Stephen Sondheim. Mr. Prince was "the most important single figure" in Mr. Sondheim's career, Meryle Secrest wrote in her biography of the storied composer.
Mr. Prince said the two met at the opening of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific" in 1949, according to the book. Over coffee soon after, they set a mutual goal to be the next Rodgers and Hammerstein.
In 1970, Mr. Prince directed and produced "Company," a reflection on married life in New York. In his New York Times review, Clive Barnes wrote that Mr. Prince failed to find structural unity between the scenes. But Mr. Barnes added, "I really believe a lot of people are going to love it." (The show has since become a treasured classic.)
'Follies'
Mr. Prince won a Tony for directing "Follies" in 1971, a show that nostalgically illustrated the grandeur of theater. The plot was centered on a group of former showgirls reuniting in a venue about to be demolished, but its larger themes were how we remember the past and make peace with the direction our lives have taken.
The production was exemplary of the concept musical format Mr. Prince was known for experimenting with: the idea of weaving a theme through a show's elements rather than solely relying on the plot to tell the story.
In The Times, Martin Gottfried called the show's experimental form monumental: "Its importance as a kind of theater transcends its interest as an example of a musical.
"Had it not succeeded so tremendously at what it was trying to do," he added, "the attempt alone -- the very idea -- would have made it a landmark musical."
'Sweeney Todd'
"Sweeney Todd," the gothic tale of a vengeful barber, brought Mr. Prince and Mr. Sondheim together again in 1978.
As the director -- a role that brought him another Tony -- Mr. Prince amplified the show's most grotesque elements, Richard Eder wrote in The Times's review. The effects, famously including a decent amount of throat cuttings, were powerful -- "sometimes excessively so."
'Evita'
Mr. Prince won a Tony in 1980 for his direction of "Evita," a collaboration with Andrew Lloyd Webber that chronicled the brief life of the Argentine political hero Eva Perón.
He helmed the show through its runs in London's West End and on Broadway. Though critics didn't revere the musical's reliance on narration, it was Mr. Prince's staging and leadership that propelled "Evita" forward.
"If your curiosity stays alive at 'Evita' in spite of all the undramatized hearsay that isn't going to satisfy it, it's due to the authoritative crackle of ringmaster Prince's whip," Mr. Kerr wrote in his review after the show made the jump to New York in 1979. "Listen, the whip says. You listen."
'The Phantom of the Opera'
"Phantom" certainly was -- and still is -- the most financially successful and longest lasting musical of Mr. Prince's partnership with Mr. Lloyd Webber. Beyond the commercial, however, Mr. Prince's creative influence has long left a mark on the production.
The show, a melodramatic backstage love story that Mr. Prince called "larger than life," was a characteristic project of Mr. Lloyd Webber. But it was Mr. Prince -- whom the Times critic Frank Rich called "a prince of darkness in his own right" in his 1988 review -- who elevated the show to a victory of dynamic stagecraft, Mr. Rich wrote. Mr. Lloyd Webber said in a statement on Wednesday: "Farewell, Hal. Not just the prince of musicals, the crowned head who directed two of the greatest productions of my career, 'Evita' and 'Phantom.' This wonderful man taught me so much and his mastery of musical theater was without equal."
'Fiddler on the Roof'
"Fiddler on the Roof" stands tall among Mr. Prince's producer credits. The story of a tradition-oriented Jewish family in a Russian village, drawn from the tales of Sholem Aleichem, won the Tony for best musical in 1965. (The show also won him a Tony for best producer of a musical, a separate category in that era.)
Mr. Prince also won a special Tony Award for "Fiddler" in 1972, when it became what was then the longest-running Broadway musical.
'West Side Story'
Mr. Prince stepped in as a producer, with his partner Robert E. Griffith, on what would become a landmark musical -- an urban adaptation of "Romeo and Juliet" told through rival gangs in New York -- after another producer dropped the project.
"West Side Story" wasn't showered with awards at the time, but it has certainly stood on its own since. New adaptations, for the stage and screen, are both in the works.
"History is littered with great works of art that got terrible reviews originally," Mr. Prince said in a 2008 interview. "And they survived."

Texto completo: I have been a professor in higher education for over 45 years, and never have I seen a single concept dominate the academy, as well as general society, as much as “diversity.”
“Diversity,” or as it’s usually discussed in academe, “diversity and inclusion,” ostensibly means the extension of fairness to professors and others who inhabit our field in hiring, promotion and tenure, teaching, and publishing opportunities.
It is officially defined by my national organization, the National Communication Association, in an innocuous way: “The National Communication Association defines diversity as a fair and just commitment to equity, access, and inclusion for all persons.” Then, the association argues disingenuously, “The NCA opposes efforts to eliminate or restrict policies or actions that are designed to foster the goal of diversity.”
In higher education practice, “diversity” means fairness for specific identity groups only: racial, gender, sexual orientation, country of origin. With rare exceptions, those are the only characteristics discussed in writing referencing “diversity.”
Most institutions of higher education define diversity without any reference to political diversity. The American Political Science Association talks about celebrating “differences:” “demographic, substantive, intellectual, pedagogical, methodological, and institutional," but not ideological differences. Nor would it matter if it did: There is virtually no place for conservatives in much of academia, especially in public institutions.
The statistics demonstrating anti-conservatism in the academy are never refuted and usually are ignored. In 2016 in the New York Times, Samuel J. Abrams of Sarah Lawrence College summarized research on faculty political preferences and found that the leftward tilt in social sciences and the humanities was getting stronger. Citing studies by the Higher Education Research Institute, he noted that the ratio of liberal professors to conservative professors nationally by 2014 “was 6 to 1; for those teaching in New England, the figure was 28 to 1.” When restricted to the humanities and social sciences, it is difficult to find self-defined conservatives, period, as they fear losing their jobs, or if tenured, their promotions, or if adjuncts, their connection to universities whatsoever. In one small study, history departments were found to have a ratio of 33.5 to 1 of liberals to conservatives.
In the NCA, conservatives are dropping out in significant percentages, if my conservative listserv is any indicator, and their absence is not regretted in the slightest by diversity-conscious colleges and universities.
Recently, the NCA’s listserv, called CRTNET (The Communication, Research, and Theory Network), has been printing extensive angry (liberal professors are usually outraged) exchanges regarding claims that the NCA’s “Distinguished Scholars” program has historically had too few African Americans accepted into their group. This has led to a lengthy colloquy about “diversity,” but again, only as it pertains to race, gender, and sexual orientation.
In none of the 30 or so interest groups’ posts on diversity is there even a mention of dedication to political or ideological diversity. In only one incongruous post, there is a statement from the Political Communication Division that doesn’t specify diversity as applying to liberal concerns.
What happens when one of the few conservatives in the NCA — say, the author of this piece — chimes in with a contrary reference, such as “…, the conspicuous lack of political diversity in our field has never troubled many [in the NCA]?”
This is not a shy bunch, yet there is no answer to the elephant (no pun intended) in the organization's front room. As indicated above, just like statistics on anti-conservative participation in higher education, conservatives’ complaints about lack of political diversity are rarely rebutted and usually ignored.
The next time you hear an academic carping about the lack of diversity and inclusion in the academy, ask him or her what the state of treatment of conservatives and conservative thought is in much of his or her field.
The liberal warriors in the academy do not object to a lack of diversity or the methods of exclusion practiced in higher education; they object exclusively to a lack of diversity and methods of exclusion regarding identity groups, wherein they do not typically occur.
As La Rochefoucauld observed, "Hypocrisy is a tribute vice pays to virtue."
Richard E. Vatz is a professor at Towson University, the longest-serving member of Towson’s University Senate. He is author of The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion (2019) and co-editor of Thomas S. Szasz: the Man and His Ideas (2017).

Texto completo: Farmington’s Walmart has been offering The Mueller Report for $11.98, a bargain for 728 pages in fine print. There’s no index so readers must read through hundreds of pages to locate what interests them. That makes me wonder about Walmart’s management. How many purchasers of this thick rectangle of tedium did they expect to attract in Farmington?
Back in April, before the full report was released impeachment zealots were disappointed at the Mueller’s failure to expose President Trump as Vladimir Putin’s tool. The publication the dull, dragged-out full report failed to energize the impeachment enthusiasts. So they built their hopes on Mueller’s personal testimony about Trump’s schemes to obstruct the inquiry.
Because few Americans have read Mueller’s report, the impeachers aimed to put it on television in a selection of prickly little pieces and get their star witness to confirm them. This, in turn, would provide the Muddy Stream Media with telling sound bites.
Unfortunately their star disappointed them. Here are some responses from prominent Left-lurchers:
Harvard’s leading Trump-hater, Professor Tribe: “Much as I hate to say it, this morning’s hearing was a disaster…Far from breathing life into his damning report, the tired Robert Mueller sucked the life out of it.”
Obama’s campaign strategist David Axelrod: “This is very, very painful.”
Michael Moore: “A frail old man, unable to remember things, stumbling, refusing to answer basic questions…”
Nick Kristov of the New York Times: “Robert Mueller was the most reluctant of witnesses at the Congressional hearings on Wednesday, and he sometimes seemed to be desperately hoping that SEAL Team 6 would rush in and extricate him from the tormentors interrogating him.”
Todd S. Purdum, writing in The Atlantic: “How did he look? (Old, halting, at times confused). What did he say? (Not enough). How did he say it? (Monosyllabically, whenever possible).”
They had to remind him six times to speak into the microphone. He looked lost while browsing the binder containing his report. He asked for questions to be repeated 48 times and dodged either 206 or 198 queries. He seemed to have only vague memory of the report’s contents.
If you assume that the primary objective of the hearings was to damage Trump, then they failed. According to the Nielsen statistics Mueller’s congressional testimony failed to match the viewers for other recent political spectacles. It had 13 million watchers as opposed to the 19.5 million who watched James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, describe his dealings with President Trump in June 2017.
More directly to the point a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, conducted immediately after the testimony, showed minimal impact on impeachment enthusiasm.
Mr. Purdum attempted a kind of rescue operation in “Robert Mueller and the Tyranny of ‘Optics’” His thesis is in his subtitle “The commentariat’s focus on performance over substance is the kryptonite of the modern media age.” This makes a lot of sense. The predominance of appearance in political discussion is not a boost to rational argument. On the other hand, Purdum’s objective is damage control. His effort to rescue some substance from the Democratic Party disaster carefully skirts around the fact that the Democratic strategy was to provide lots of useful optics to give some zip to he dull, drawn-out, complex report that few people will read despite Walmart’s effort to make it available.

Texto completo: The threat of natural disaster is often looming in the North Bay. From wildfires to earthquakes, we've compiled a comprehensive list of what you need to be prepared.
Overall preparedness kit:
Bring one gallon of water per person per day to stay hydrated in case of disrupted or contaminated water supplies. If you are evacuating your house, bring at least a three-day supply, according to the American Red Cross.
Pack nonperishable and easy-to-prepare food items , such as canned foods or dry mixes, according to Ready.gov. Make sure they are not spicy or salty, which often cause increased thirst. Bring a can opener, utensils or containers if needed.
Have a flashlight on hand, according to the Red Cross, in case the emergency occurs in the dark or in a power outage. Flashlights will allow you remain aware of your surroundings in these scenarios.
Purchase or pack a battery-powered or hand-crank radio , according to the Red Cross. A weather alert radio is best, according to Midland USA, because they'll notify you with updates regardless of the station you are listening to or if the power is on. The Red Cross encourages radios that can provide NOAA Weather Radio Alerts. Do not rely on your cell phone or the internet, as cell towers and networks are vulnerable during natural disasters.
Bring extra batteries that provide power for your flashlight, battery-powered radio or phone charger. If you lose electricity, these devices need to be reliable throughout the emergency.
A first aid kit with proper medical supplies is an absolute necessity in case of injury or medical issues. Essentials include moleskin fabric, liquid bandages, soft-wrap elastic bandages, micro pore paper tape, fabric adhesive dressings and various bandages, non-adherent bandage pads, a sterile gauze bandage roll, adhesive wound closures, triangular bandages, alcohol swabs and antiseptic wipes, packets of antibiotic ointment, burn ointment, eye wash, a thermometer, petroleum jelly, pain relievers, anti-diarrheal medications, antacids and laxatives, according to the New York Times and Frank Smyth, the executive director of Global Journalist Security.
Bring a seven-day supply of necessary medications and prescriptions, as well as additional medical items such as spare glasses, sanitary towelettes, tweezers and scissors to use in combination with your first aid kit, according to the New York Times.
The Red Cross also recommends a multi-purpose tool, such as a Swiss Army Knife or Leatherman multi-tool that will provide features such as pliers, scissors, knives, can opener, bottle opener, files and screwdrivers. If your tool is missing one or more of these features, it may be useful to carry a full-size version of the missing feature(s).
Having pliers or a wrench is necessary to turn off utilities, according to Ready.gov. Natural gas leaks and explosions are responsible for a significant number of fires following natural disasters. If you do not know how to shut off natural gas, contact your local gas agency for guidance in case of an emergency. Never attempt to turn the gas back on yourself.
Pack sanitation and personal hygiene products , such as moist towelettes, garbage bags, deodorant, toothbrushes and dental hygiene items and feminine supplies, says Ready.gov. If you are evacuated from your home, you may not have access to running water or a full array of hygiene products, so bring those that will keep you from encountering health problems or unsanitary situations.
Copy birth certificates , marriage and divorce papers, adoption papers, social security cards, passports, driver’s licenses and pet microchip numbers, which, according to Just Great Lawyers, are necessary family documents to have at all times. For financial documents, bring tax information, financial account numbers, income verification, insurance information and information about bills and obligations. Necessary legal documents include wills, living wills, power of attorney documents, trust documents, titles and deeds to property you own and naturalization or citizenship documents (if you were not born in the U.S.). Bring medical documents like your insurance and immunization information, allergy information, medications list and any other crucial medical records. Keep these documents in a fireproof and waterproof safe or keep them in a binder. Consider keeping computer backup disks of the documents or storing some of them in an off-site location. If you do not keep these personal records with you, you will be at the mercy of the office that issued them to get new copies.

Bring emergency contact information of family and friends so that you can stay in touch. USA.gov recommends you also sign up for alerts from the National Weather Service or getting the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) app on your phone for weather warnings and disaster, aid and shelter information.
Bring cell phones and backup chargers that do not require electricity (such as solar-powered or battery-powered chargers). These will be necessary to receive alerts and contact others, if cell service is or becomes available.
Pack extra cash or have a savings account with enough money, depending on the size of your family, for a hotel, transportation or food if you are evacuated. Store cash in a fireproof and waterproof box or container. Do not assume that banks will be open or ATMs will be available. Nerdwallet recommends creating an emergency fund of around $500, if possible.
The American Red Cross also recommends bringing an emergency blanket for warmth in case of a power outage, dangerously cold weather or simply for comfort. One blanket per person is ideal if you have the space and time to collect them in an evacuation.
Bring maps of your area so that you can find your way around and to a safe location without relying on your phone or a GPS.
Earthquakes
Before an earthquake:
Before an earthquake, the Red Cross recommends picking safe places in each room of your home, workplace and/or school. This is the place you could go during a quake, such as under a piece of sturdy furniture or against an interior wall away from windows or any furniture that could fall on you.
Keep a flashlight and a comfortable pair of shoes by your bed (and each bed in your family). If an earthquake occurs in the dark or at night, you do not want to risk stepping on debris or not being able to see if you need to leave the room afterward.
Practice drop, cover and hold on in each of your safe spaces. During an earthquake, drop where you are onto your hands and knees. Then cover your head and neck with your arms and, if you can do so while avoiding an area with more debris, crawl to a safe space. Then hold on with one hand if you are under a table or desk.
If you are seated and unable to drop to the floor, bend forward, cover your head with your arms and hold on to your neck with both hands.
Ready.gov recommends the following if you are in a special situation and cannot find cover under a piece of furniture:
If you're in a vehicle, pull over, stop and set your parking brake. Avoid bridges and overpasses if possible. Keep your seatbelt fastened until the shaking stops. Drive carefully afterward and avoid bridges, ramps or overpasses that may have been damaged. If a power line falls on your vehicle, do not get out.
If you are in bed, turn face down . Cover your head and neck with a pillow.
Do not run outside. If you are outdoors, do not go inside and stay away from buildings.
Do not get in a doorway. They are no more stable than any other structure.
If you or your family member is in a wheelchair or is using a walker with a seat, lock the wheels and remain seated until the shaking stops. Protect your head and neck with your arms or anything available.
After an earthquake, follow these Ready.gov and Red Cross recommended precautions:
Check yourself for injuries and get first aid if necessary, first. Then check for injured or trapped people.
Stay alert for small fires. They are the most common hazard after an earthquake.
Assume aftershocks will follow. Drop, cover and hold on during each.
If you have to leave a building after the quake, use stairs, not an elevator , in case of power outages or aftershocks.
If you are trapped, protect your mouth, nose and eyes from dust . Do not shout, but send a text, bang on a pipe or wall or use a whistle to help rescuers locate you.
Only use phone calls during emergencies. Text will be more reliable.
Continue to listen to local news reports for emergency information and instructions. Wear protective clothing during clean-up and avoid removing heavy debris alone.
After the disaster, register yourself on the Red Cross’ Safe and Well site to give your loved ones peace of mind. On this website, you can also search for loved ones.
Fires
To prepare for a wildfire, gather fire-specific emergency supplies, such as N95 respirator masks that filter particles in the air you breathe. Keep in mind issues with asthma or the needs of pets.
Pay attention to air quality alerts , such as the Air Quality Index on AirNow.
If possible, make sure your house number or address is clearly marked for rescuers’ operations. Keep your lawn hydrated and remove dead vegetation from your gutters and roofs.
During the fire, follow authorities’ instructions to evacuate , according to Ready.gov.
If you become trapped, call 911 and give your location. Emergency response may be delayed. Turn lights on to help rescuers find you.
If you are in smoky conditions but are not ordered to evacuate, stay inside in a safe location and do not use anything that burns, the Environmental Protection Agency recommends. Do not vacuum or smoke. Run your air conditioner to keep fresh air intake closed and the filter clean to prevent bringing additional smoke inside. Use the recycle mode on the air conditioner in your home or car, recommends the Red Cross.
The Red Cross adds to keep an eye on animals or pets , as hidden embers could burn them. Wet down debris to minimize breathing harmful particles. Wear gloves and sturdy shoes. Check for smoke and sparks in your neighborhood or home frequently. Wildfire winds can blow burning embers that may cause a fire.
Power outage
Remember that in the event of a power outage, communications, water and transportation may be disrupted, according to Ready.gov. Food may be spoiled, and water could become contaminated.
During an outage, keep freezers and refrigerators closed to keep your food as safe as possible . Use a thermometer in the refrigerator and freezer. When the power is restored, check the temperature. If it's above 40 degrees, throw out any meat, poultry, eggs, seafood or leftovers, as they will be unsafe, according to Electric Choice. Keeping canned foods in your pantry is always recommended as a back-up supply.
Do not use a gas stove to heat your home. Disconnect appliances and electronics to avoid damage that might be caused by electrical surges.
If necessary, create another plan to refrigerate medicine. Find out specific information for how long medications can be stored at higher temperatures, especially medications that are critical for life, according to Ready.gov.
If you have time, plan to have batteries and other alternatives to meet your everyday needs when the power goes out, especially during planned power outages such as those drafted by PG&E.
If heat or cold becomes extreme, go to a community location with power or consider going to an alternate location, if safe.

Texto completo: Our state's Democratic and Republican lawmakers don't agree on much, but they were in near total agreement earlier this year that male/female designations on single-user public bathrooms should be banned.
Senate Bill 556, an amendment to the Equitable Restrooms Act, required that the exterior signage on all such facilities in places of public accommodation indicate that they are gender neutral or "all gender." It passed the Senate by a vote of 53-0 on April 11, then passed the House by a vote of 109-5 on May 21.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the measure Friday, thus signaling an end to the absurd era when people felt bound to stand in line for a single-user bathroom that corresponded most closely to their gender identities while differently labeled bathrooms nearby stood empty.
As of Jan. 1, when the law goes into effect, Illinois will become the fourth state to have such a requirement on the books after California, New Mexico and Vermont. A growing number of cities, including Austin, Texas, Baltimore, Denver, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., have enacted similar requirements.
Have you been there, hopping from foot to foot and wondering if you'd get the stink eye if you ducked into the "wrong" restroom? Yeah, me too.
But this law will be good for more than just impatient men and women. It will provide straightforward restroom access for parents and children of different genders, and to caregivers and dependents of different genders. It will also be a boon to those who are gender-nonconforming and are put off by having to make the binary choice demanded by conventional signage.
The only thing odd about this law is that it isn't in effect everywhere and hasn't been in effect for decades. It wasn't until 2006 that Washington, D.C., passed what's often cited as the nation's first gender-neutral requirement for single-stall public bathrooms, even though most of us had been using non-designated toilet facilities for years on airplanes and buses, at one-bathroom small businesses and arrays of portable toilets at outdoor festivals.
Scholars have written a lot more than you might think about this general issue. "Sexism in the bathroom debates: How bathrooms really became separated by sex," published last year in the Yale Law and Policy Review, is a 63-page takedown of certain competing academic theories by George Washington University Law School professor emeritus W. Burlette Carter. Carter concludes that sex separation in "public intimate spaces ... dates back to ancient times (and is) rooted primarily in safety and privacy concerns" for women.
Safety and privacy are enhanced for all by Illinois' new law. And, for the record, that law is distinct from efforts to remove gender designations from multiuser public bathrooms, an initiative that has taken hold in certain college dormitories but seems unlikely to gain wider acceptance.
New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg attended the Netroots Nation gathering of progressive political activists in Philadelphia in mid-July and reported on "The Argument" podcast that organizers had labeled nearly all the bathrooms in the Pennsylvania Convention Center as "all-gender."
"But there was one bathroom in another part of the building that hadn't been converted," Goldberg said. "And it had, like, three stalls. And there was this huge line of women waiting to use it."
Not surprising. And Goldberg's experience suggests an argument for the gradual conversion of all public and office restroom facilities to long rows of floor-to-ceiling single-use stalls. Such arrays would also put an end to the hate-tinged debate about where transgender people should be able to relieve themselves as well as the fear that such people often have when in mutliuser public restrooms.
State Rep. Tom Morrison of Palatine, one of the five Republicans who voted against Senate Bill 556 in the House agreed in an email to me that it was "common sense" for single-occupancy restrooms to be open to anyone, but he added that he opposed the measure because he views the sign-change requirement as just another one of the "unnecessary, unfunded mandates" Springfield too often imposes.
While I grudgingly admire such consistent adherence to the small-government philosophy, I also note that a pair of such signs -- including Braille lettering -- costs as little as $33.24, a small price to pay for the comfort and peace of mind of so many.

Texto completo: Calling all Foodies: the largest food truck & music festival in southwest Ohio, Thomson Law StreetEats Miami, hosted by Miami Township, returns in a new location, featuring 25 food trucks and 15 craft and traditional beers – including a bonus stop by The Peach Truck from 3-4 p.m.
With four bands featuring everything from concert music to brand-new pop tunes to rock 'n roll, everyone is sure to find food, drink, and music to satisfy. The event will take place Saturday, Aug. 3, from 3-10 p.m. at Eastside Christian Church, 5874 Montclair Blvd, Milford, just off I-275, exit 57 in Miami Township.
In its seventh year, this food truck festival started with a dozen trucks that attracted a crowd five times what was expected – and they ran out of food in the first three hours. "That's when we knew we really had something," says Chris Hamm, Chair and one of the event founders. "We expected a couple thousand attendees, and we had that many in the first couple hours. We ended up having to grill burgers and hotdogs."
This year, the festival will be bigger and better than ever. "We've had over 12,000 people the last few years, and we expect close to 15,000 this year," Chris continues. "Our new location is right off the highway and has plenty of parking right around the festival, so it will be easy to get there. The trucks will surround a grassy area where people can eat, drink, and relax while enjoying the bands. We encourage attendees to bring folding chairs and blankets to make an evening of it."
There will also be a Children's Area sponsored by Scene 75 and Eastside Christian Church, with lots of fun, hands-on options to engage kids young and older.
Food options will include everything from hot dogs to tacos, barbecue to crepes, empanadas to mac 'n cheese to wings to poutine – and of course, a wide variety of dessert choices. There will be plenty of options for special dietary needs, such as gluten free and vegetarian/vegan. Four local breweries will offer craft and traditional beers. Non-beer lovers will enjoy Copa wines and seltzer, as well as soda and water.
Menu items are in the $5-7 range, and alcoholic drinks are $5-6. Non-alcoholic drinks are available for $3.
Music features local bands:
Milford High School Eagles Marching Band, 3-3:30 p.m.: Concert lovers will enjoy being among the first to hear the Eagles' 2019 show, "From Stone."
Natalie Brady, 3:45-4:30 p.m.: Milford jazz/pop singer Natalie Brady will debut several original pieces plus feature some current pop favorites.
Dancin' on Main, 4:30-5 p.m.: Milford dance studio Dancin' on Main will teach an easy and fun jazz/hip-hop dance to anyone who wants to join in.
Mojo Rizin', 5-6:30 p.m.: Local band Mojo Rizin' revives good old rock'n'roll.
Headliner Naked Karate Girls, 7-10 p.m.: The Best Band in the Galaxy , Naked Karate Girls puts on a show to end all shows, with lots of stimulation for the eyes as well as the ears.
StreetEats Miami benefits the Milford Miami Township Chamber of Commerce, serving businesses in the greater Milford/Miami Township area, and CASA for Clermont Kids, a l non-profit that advocates for local children.

Heimlich Heroes education program receives $45K in grants for school education Heimlich Heroes, a non-profit program of the Deaconess Foundation which prepares and trains people to recognize and respond to a choking emergency, has been awarded $45,000 in grant monies that will go towards continued outreach within local schools throughout the Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky region.
Grant funding comes from The Maxwell C. Weaver Foundation, The R.C. Durr Foundation, Inc., The Wohlgemuth-Herschede Foundation, and the Robert H. Reakirt Foundation.
Heimlich Heroes has trained and equipped more than 10,400 children across 34 schools in the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky region, and more than 180,000 people have participated nationwide to date. "Thanks to these generous foundations, our local schools — where budgets might not have room for extra programs like ours — can get in on the action," said program manager, Terri Huntington.
"This grant allows critical, life-saving skills to be taught at local schools. Children will gain confidence in themselves as they learn the signs of a choking emergency and the steps needed to respond with the Heimlich Maneuver," said Huntington.
"Specifically, the grants will allow local children to have interactive, hands-on practice with specially-made training dolls. Students will also receive other training materials, all of which will be at no cost to schools demonstrating financial need," said Huntington.
With offices located in Cincinnati, Heimlich Heroes was developed through a cooperative effort of Deaconess Associations, Inc. and the Heimlich Institute. The late Dr. Henry Heimlich developed the Heimlich Maneuver more than four decades ago, and the maneuver has saved hundreds of thousands of lives since.
Heimlich Heroes regularly works with the YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, American Heritage Girls, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and 4-H club leaders, teaching the choking safety and response lessons to children as young as 7 years old.
"School nurses and health teachers, scout leaders and other after-school youth organizations eagerly embrace the practical, hands-on training for their staff, students, and members," said Huntington. "Heroes really do come in all shapes, sizes, and ages. We're pleased that this funding will help us continue to equip people to save lives right here in our region."

UC Clermont hosts 'Drawings' exhibit The exhibition "Drawings," featuring sculptural sketches by artist Ed Smith, is on display in the Park National Bank Art Gallery at UC Clermont College through Aug. 27.
Currently gallery director of Marist Venice Biennale Program and professor of art at Marist College, Smith has been a visiting artist, lecturer, artist-in-residence, professor and distinguished visiting artist at American University, Boston University, Dartmouth College and a number of other prestigious institutions.
Smith is a member of the National Academy, a Guggenheim Fellow in Sculpture and Drawing and a member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors.
His work is represented in public and private collections in the United States and abroad and has been reviewed in the New York Times, Sculpture Magazine, The Baltimore Evening Sun, Art News, the Miami Herald and many other outlets.
He uses drawing to help discover and articulate sculptural images, sometimes doing hundreds of drawings to "find" an image. Wax models are then made and translated into unique small bronzes — sometimes up to 30 variations for one sculpture. "After these bronzes are cast I begin the larger sculptures with still more drawings," Smith said. "The constant work helps me to understand and personalize the image, to give it meaning and resonance. They are reminders that heroism is still possible and that ideas spring from labor."
The Park National Bank Art Gallery is located in the Snyder Building on the UC Clermont College campus in Batavia at 4200 Clermont College Drive. Gallery summer hours are Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m.–5 p.m., and Friday, 8 a.m. –4 p.m.

Cellphone keys starting to replace hotel room cards

Texto completo: The demonstration using the cellphone as a digital hotel room key didn't quite go as planned. The hotel manager held his phone up to the room's door lock and nothing happened. Realizing his Bluetooth was turned off, he tried again. Now the door's sensor flashed green, while the phone screen informed him that the door was unlocked.
Like the majority of travellers, I had never before used a mobile hotel key, even though the first version of the system was installed nearly a decade ago. Today, about 1 million hotel rooms worldwide are estimated to have some version of a lock that can accept a cellphone-generated digital key, according to Nicolas Aznar, president of the Americas division of the Swedish-based lock maker Assa Abloy. Hotels are accelerating the installation of these systems to increase revenue, drive customers to their loyalty sites, and offer a better guest experience.
The locks also accept card keys, so many hoteliers are promoting the mobile keys as an optional perk for loyalty members: When combined with online check-in, guests in countries that don't require a passport to be shown can go directly to their rooms without a stop at the front desk.
And, since the keys are downloaded electronically through a hotel app, the host has a presence on the guests' phones, and can offer other exclusive services, like promotions and a chat feature.
"Had my first hotel stay where human interaction was utterly unnecessary. Online booking, mobile check-in, mobile room key, and mobile checkout. I was a single smile and wave from not seeing a single hotel staff member my entire trip," Victor Wieczorek wrote on Twitter under the handle @vwieczorek.
The number of hotels in the United States that have digital keys available rose from 6% in 2016 to 17% last year, according to a survey by the American Hotel & Lodging Association. Marriott International, Hilton, MGM Resorts and Disney hotels are among the brands offering loyalty members the option of using digital keys at some properties.
Some, including Hilton and Marriott, only allow a single phone to receive a key during a stay, and other guests in the room receive card keys. Like the card keys, the digital keys can be used to access elevators, fitness centers, parking garages and other common areas. Some mobile keys require the user to touch a button on their phone screen to unlock the door, while others require that the phone be held up to the lock.
Digital keys are hugely popular with travellers in some areas, like Silicon Valley, but overall, only about 10% of all hotel guests use them, Aznar estimated.
"Every new technology generates a little fear," he said.
One of those who shied away during a recent trip was Lexi Galantino, 23, a San Francisco-based software engineer who specializes in protecting privacy. Galantino was set to try a digital key at a hotel in Kauai, Hawaii, in April, but as she was downloading the app, she opted instead for a card key.
"I was a little bit spooked by some of the security things," she said.
Last year, the Finnish cybersecurity firm F-Secure Corp. revealed that after thousands of hours of work it had found a flaw in an older model RFID-style digital hotel lock that could allow hackers to create a spoof master key. It worked with Assa Abloy to path the software, which was used in 42,000 properties in 166 countries, said Tomi Tuominen, of Helsinki, me of researchers. "We broke and then it got fixed," he said.
It will take years to know if other digital locking systems are secure, since there are so many manufacturers using so many different technologies, he said. On top of that, there are potential vulnerabilities in the apps that are used to access the keys, and in guests' phones themselves, he said.
Tuominen recommended staying with brand-nane hotels because they have the resources to keep their looks up-to-date. He also reminded travelers to keep their own phones secure and to use the security chain when they are in their rooms.
One thing that's certain, Tuominen said, is that plastic hotel keys with magnietic stripes are vulnerable.
"It's a known fact that you can always clone a mag stripe," he said. "Even if you don't clone it, there ere too many ways to target those type of locking systems." - (The New York Times)

Was Woodstock a mess or a miracle?

Texto completo: Woodstock, '69. Over the past 50 years, the legendary music festival has evolved into a narrative of biblical dimensions, touching on the miraculous and transcendent. People talk reverently about the pilgrimage to Bethel, N.Y., as though recounting a visit to Lourdes.
Which explains why original Woodstock cofounder Michael Lang is planning a 50th reunion of the festival on August 16th, 17th, and 18th, 2019, although recently the permit to host the festival in Vernon, N.Y., was denied over concerns about sewage, parking and road congestion. An effort is underway to move the anniversary festival to Columbia, Md., but nothing is firm yet.
Sewage, parking and road congestion was the last thing on our minds the morning of Aug. 16, 1969, when my cousin Bob and I rattled off to Bethel in Bob's old VW bug, happily ignoring radio announcements warning people to stay away from the festival.
Soon after we left, a newscaster interrupted the Rolling Stones on the radio.
"If you are headed to the festival, please turn around immediately. The New York State Thruway is backed up for miles."
Bob stepped on the gas.
By some miracle we managed to squeeze by police barricades, roadblocks and acres of abandoned cars.
Outside we followed a winding path through a wooded grove lit by hundreds of tiny lights, past colorful tents selling beads, moccasins and drug paraphernalia. Jugglers and magicians capered through the trees like woodland sprites.
"Far out! This is like a medieval fair," said Bob.
A few moments later we emerged from the woods. I stopped, stunned. Before us was a steaming jungle of 500,000 bodies pounding 600 acres of virgin farmland into mud.
If the twinkling fairytale forest was a medieval fair, this was Dante's inferno.
"This is cosmic. Look how great everyone is getting along!" Bob waved his arm toward the mass of humanity lounging topless on blankets, drinking wine and soaking up the sun.
In front of us a girl started screaming and flailing her arms.
"Another drug-freak out!" someone yelled.
Overhead helicopters whirred, airlifting performers in and the injured or panicked out. The slightly hysterical announcements booming over the P.A. system ramped up the intensity.
"If you're freaking out on the blue acid, go to the blue tent! The volunteers there are people who freaked out on the blue acid yesterday. And remember, never take drugs from strangers!"
By the time darkness fell on Max's farm, Governor Rockefeller had declared the site an official disaster area, and the army was airlifting in medical supplies, food and water. We had still not managed to hear any music or gotten anything to eat, and we were knee-deep in mud and human excrement. Even Bob agreed it was time to leave all the peace and love behind.
We left just before the Up-Against-the-Wall-Motherf*****s burned down the Food for Love concession stands.
For many, Woodstock holds a wistful allure, a longing for that lost weekend that blazed like a star over the fields of Bethel. "Woodstock" (the film) has further anchored the myth firmly in the cultural imagination. But you can't experience sewage, parking or road congestion in a movie. You can get a front-row seat to hear Joan Baez while lounging on your couch with a cold beer. It's, well, cosmic.
Two days after Woodstock, my cousin Bob was killed in a car accident. I felt heartbroken. But I also felt happy that he had been able to experience what, for him, was a spiritual and generational apocalypse. Now he was gone to that great Woodstock in the sky, where Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix would soon join him.
I think about Bob and the day we spent together at Woodstock often. I just hope that wherever Bob is now, he can hear the music.

Trump's racist tweets put GOP on the spot

Texto completo: Back in February, Rep. Elijah Cummings, a black Democrat, stood up for his friend, Rep. Mark Meadows, a white Republican.
Members of Congress were fielding the testimony of President Donald Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, when Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, accused Meadows of racism for trotting out a female black Trump appointee as a stage prop during the hearing. "My nieces and nephews are people of color, not many people know that," Meadows responded, fuming. "It's racist to suggest that I asked her to come in here for that reason."
Meadows, who recommended during the 2012 presidential campaign that Barack Obama be sent "back to Kenya," also reminded the House of what he described as his record of combating racism. He asked Cummings, chair of the committee convening the Cohen hearing, to strike Tlaib's comments from the record. "Mr. Chairman, you and I have a personal relationship that's not based on color," Meadows noted.
"If there's anyone who's sensitive with regard to race it's me, the son of former sharecroppers," Cummings replied. "You're one of my best friends, I know that shocks a lot of people. But you are. And I can see and I feel your pain." Cummings encouraged Tlaib to clarify that she wasn't calling Meadows a racist personally, calmed down Meadows himself, and then moved the hearing along.
Over this past weekend Trump put Cummings and his Baltimore district in his crosshairs, tweeting at him 17 times in a racially-charged salvo of alternately bigoted, hostile and inaccurate insults that commenced at 7:14 a.m. EDT on Saturday and concluded at 6:49 a.m. on Monday. Baltimore and its neighboring areas, the president allowed, were a "very dangerous & filthy place" and a "rat and rodent infested mess" where "no human being would want to live." Cummings was "incompetent" and a "brutal bully" responsible for Baltimore's problems, a "racist" who "spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people." As he has done before, Trump also retweeted the musings of a far-right British pundit who is a self-described racist to make his case against Cummings.
A broad, diverse swath of Baltimore residents and supporters responded to Trump by coming to Cummings' and their city's defense, acknowledging that Baltimore had myriad problems, including crime and poverty, but was hardly the noxious monolith the president was slagging. #WeAreBaltimore became a ubiquitous hashtag and a rallying cry on social media. Perhaps the most poignant and powerful voice in all of that was a CNN anchor, Victor Blackwell, who was born in Baltimore and noted during a pointed, emotional broadcast on Saturday that Trump frequently uses the words "infested" and "infestation" when describing the homes or countries of people of color.
"Donald Trump has tweeted more than 43,000 times. He's insulted thousands of people, many different types of people. But when he tweets about infestation, it's about black and brown people," Blackwell said. "There are challenges, no doubt. But people are proud of their community. I don't want to sound self-righteous, but people get up and go to work there. They care for their families there. They love their children, who pledge allegiance to the flag just like people who live in districts of congressmen who support you, sir. They are Americans too."
One person who has yet to speak out on Cummings' behalf is his good friend, Meadows. The congressman from North Carolina, like his entire political party, has remained silent while Trump -- an inveterate racist -- has spent yet another weekend targeting a high-profile Democrat of color in heinous, prejudiced ways. In that context, Meadows is a proxy for the lack of political courage and moral clarity in Trump's Republican Party.
Mick Mulvaney, the president's acting chief of staff, sat for an interview with Fox News on Sunday and said there was nothing racist about Trump's comments. "If I had poverty in my district like they have in Baltimore," Mulvaney said, "I'd get fired." (Mulvaney's old South Carolina district does have poverty rates like Baltimore's -- as do many of the rural, red state districts that Trump avoids criticizing).
Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, went on "Meet the Press" and simply pandered to Trump when the news show's host, Chuck Todd, asked him about the tweets aimed at Cummings. "I didn't do the tweets, Chuck, I can't talk about why he did what he did," Scott said. "But I am disappointed in people like congressman Cummings who are attacking border patrol agents."
And while the president was comfortable attacking a politician for Baltimore's woes, he couldn't find it in himself to hold the city's business community equally responsible. If he had, of course, that would have brought his son-in-law Jared Kushner's family into the line of fire. The Kushners own and operate low-income housing developments in the Baltimore area that have been plagued with allegations of legal abuses and have been fined by local authorities for more than 170 building code violations.
Trump's distaste for cities like Baltimore isn't new. During the 2016 presidential campaign he referred to inner cities as "ghettos" that were "more dangerous than some of the war zones." He also painted this portrait and made a promise: "The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We're going to work with the African American community and we're going to solve the problem of the inner city."
But the president has done little for troubled urban areas other than to use them as political punching bags from time to time. So what compelled him to lash out against Cummings and Baltimore this time?
Some of Trump's language and bile was clearly inspired by and directly lifted from a "Fox & Friends" segment that aired Saturday morning about an hour before he first tweeted about Cummings. The congressman has been an aggressive critic of the humanitarian crisis along the U.S. southern border that was sparked by the president's immigration policies, and it was the Fox piece that first tried to argue that conditions on the border were better than in parts of Baltimore.
The House Oversight Committee, which Cummings oversees, also voted recently to subpoena personal email and texts used by top White House aides, including Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump -- which undoubtedly bothers the president.
Finally, and most troubling of all, the White House has concluded that Trump's racist tweets and attacks on politicians of color may be an asset in the 2020 presidential campaign because it will resonate strongly "among his political base," according to The Washington Post.
All of this explains why Trump sprang into action over the weekend. But it's worth recognizing, too, just how comfortable the president has become with random bigotry, and with openly deploying a racism that has come naturally to him for quite some time. He might have checked himself if his party was more resolute, but he clearly understands that Meadows and the rest are there to empower him.

Texto completo: El mes pasado, Steven Romero celebró su sexto cumpleaños en Legoland en California. El domingo por la tarde, fue asesinado a tiros en el Festival del Ajo Gilroy en el norte de California.
En total, tres personas murieron y 13 resultaron heridas en el tiroteo , dijeron las autoridades. Se desconocen las identidades de las otras dos víctimas.
La policía disparó en apenas un minuto y mató al sospechoso que portaba un rifle de asalto, según un comunicado de la ciudad de Gilroy. Este lunes el atacante fue identificado como Santino William Legan . Se desconocen los motivos del crimen.
“No hay nada que realmente pueda hacer, además de tratar de estar con él hasta que pueda colocarlo en su lugar de descanso”, dijo el padre de Steven, Alberto Romero, a NBC Bay Area.
“Mi hijo tenía toda la vida por vivir y solo tenía seis años. Esto es todo lo que puedo decir.”
Romero estaba en casa con su hija de 9 años cuando se enteró del tiroteo. Steven había ido al festival con su madre y su abuela, que también resultaron heridas.
Romero dijo que la madre de Steven recibió dos disparos en la mano y cree que la abuela recibió un disparo en la pierna.
“Ojalá que detengan a los atacantes”, dijo Romero.
Justo después del tiroteo, Romero publicó una foto de Steven en Legoland, pidiendo a la gente que dé información sobre el tiroteo. Su cuenta ahora es privada.
Describió a su hijo como un niño enérgico que acababa de graduarse de la guardería y estaba a solo unas semanas de ingresar al primer grado.
Estaba “siempre feliz y siempre queriendo divertirse”, dijo Romero, mientras mostraba fotos del pequeño.
Entre los heridos estaba Lesley Sánchez, de 15 años, una porrista de la escuela secundaria Gilroy que estaba como voluntaria en el festival , según informaron miembros de la familia a The New York Times. Le dispararon en la cadera, pero pudo recibir visitas en su habitación del hospital el domingo por la noche, dijeron.
Julissa Contreras, una testigo que dijo que era una ex cadete de la policía, dijo en una entrevista el domingo por la noche que vio a “tu hombre blanco promedio” disparando lo que parecía ser un rifle semiautomático, “simplemente yendo de izquierda a derecha y disparando a quienquiera que podía, honestamente “.
“Definitivamente disparó más de 30 rondas”, dijo. “Fue como ininterrumpido, con dos, tres, cuatro disparos por segundo”.
Contreras describió al hombre como de unos 30 años, vestido con una gorra, gafas de sol deportivas y lo que parecía ropa de estilo militar.
“Parecía que podría trabajar en seguridad privada”, dijo. “Pero tenía como correas y clips, y estaba completamente preparado para lo que estaba haciendo. Absolutamente”.
Gilroy se encuentra a unos 30 kilómetros al sur de San José. El tiroteo tuvo lugar durante el Festival del Ajo Gilroy, un evento anual de tres días en Christmas Hill Park. Gilroy, de aproximadamente 60,000 habitantes, es un importante productor de ajo y hogar de trabajadores agrícolas y personas que se desplazan a empleos de tecnología.

Congo draws up new Ebola battle plan

Texto completo: Faced with an Ebola outbreak that sprawls over a vast swath of Congo, public health officials are conceding that their battle against the virus is failing and have proposed a comprehensive new strategy for ending the epidemic.
The plan envisions no longer treating the epidemic simply as a health emergency and reframing it as a regional humanitarian crisis. That may include more troops or police to quell the murders and arson that have made medical work difficult, and food aid to win over skeptical locals. And the country will deploy a second vaccine to form a protective "curtain" of immunity around outbreak areas.
The outbreak, which began almost exactly a year ago and was declared a global health emergency this month, is now the second biggest in history, with more than 2,600 cases and more than 1,700 dead.
The outbreak has persisted in part because of a fierce but hidden power struggle for control of the response inside Congo, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and interviews with Ebola experts.
The country's health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga, resigned Monday after a public dispute with donors at a World Health Organization meeting over whether to roll out the second vaccine, which he opposed. The effort to contain the outbreak will no longer be overseen by the country's health ministry but by an expert committee reporting directly to Congo's new president, Felix Tshisekedi.
Ilunga was the target of a scathing internal government report produced in April, just as new cases began soaring above 100 per week. The report was written by a commission convened by Congo's new president, some of whose members are now overseeing the response.
The report said "arrogant" national health officials took "an aggressive and ostentatious attitude" when they visited the outbreak area, renting deluxe hotel rooms and expensive cars and "brandishing large dollar bills" while local health workers went unpaid.
A spokeswoman for Ilunga called the report "weak." She said he had resigned not because of it but because the president had split the authority to oversee the outbreak response between his office and an independent commission, which she claimed was a violation of the Congolese Constitution.
Ilunga's departure pleased some donors and agencies supporting the fight against Ebola. The United States is by far the biggest donor. Tibor P. Nagy, the State Department's top official for African affairs, told a Senate subcommittee Wednesday that Ilunga's resignation "may be an improvement to the situation."
The country is seeking $288 million to implement its new Ebola strategy and is likely to get it. The World Bank recently offered $300 million, and the United States increased its previous giving by $38 million this week.
The new plan may include a campaign to win the hearts of the area's traumatized population by vaccinating against other diseases, offering hot meals and bulk food, deworming schoolchildren and even creating thousands of jobs.
International assistance efforts will no longer be directed solely by the WHO and its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, but by David Gressly, a former head of U.N. peacekeeping troops in Congo who was recently given charge of the entire U.N. response.
The strategy also envisions greater efforts to win the support of local officials, chiefs and religious leaders in the isolated eastern provinces, to negotiate a truce with armed groups, and to persuade people to accept vaccines and go to treatment centers.
Some 500,000 doses of a new Johnson & Johnson vaccine against Ebola will be introduced, and it will be used differently from the current vaccine, made by Merck. While Merck's single-dose vaccine is used to "ring-vaccinate" everyone around each known case, the new vaccine - which requires two doses given two months apart - will be deployed in areas farther away.
The idea is to encircle the outbreak with immunized people, especially among health workers. While the Merck vaccine has been given to Ugandan health workers on the Congo border, for example, the second vaccine will be deployed in Mbabara, a regional capital 60 miles away with a big-hospital that ill patients might travel to.
At its core, the political struggle within Congo pitted Ilunga, 59, who had been a minister since 2016, against Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director-general of the country's National Institute for Biomedical Research.
It also was a struggle between Tshisekedi and his predecessor, Joseph Kabila, 48. After 18 contentious years in office, Kabila stepped down last year and is now a senator for life. In December, Tshisekedi won a disputed election, beating Kabila's chosen successor. But since then, he has only slowly replaced Kabila's Cabinet ministers.
Ilunga, who visited the outbreak area several times, is respected by some Ebola experts. The head of one international agency, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid involvement in another country's dispute, called him "principled and data-driven."
Muyembe, 77, is an internationally respected authority on Ebola who has helped fight every outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1976, when the country was named Zaire.

The human cost of 5.6 billion pain pills

Texto completo: A Times editorial

The numbers are simply staggering. At the height of Floridas opioid crisis, 5.6 billion prescription pain pills were supplied to Florida. Between addiction and overdoses, untold lives have been shattered because regulators, drug makers, pharmacies and the government let the disaster spiral out of control. Inaction has a heavy price, it is a hard lesson society needs to learn as those suffering from addictions rebuild their lives.

There were more than enough pain pills to go around in Tampa Bay. From 2006 through 2012, 395 million pills were sent to Pinellas County pharmacies  enough to give every resident 61 pills a year. It was even worse in Hillsborough, with 565 million pills supplied  67 per person per year. And according to court documents in a major federal opioid lawsuit, one Walgreens in Port Richey was ordering 3,271 bottles of oxycodone a month, this in a town of 2,831.

Awakened to the crisis, doctors are now prescribing fewer opioids and finding other ways to offer patients relief from pain, state officials have set up databases that allow far better monitoring of opioid abuse, and attorneys general, including Floridas Ashley Moody, are going after pharmaceutical companies and suppliers in court. Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that deaths from prescription pain killers at long last may have dropped significantly for the first time in a generation. There were 12,757 fatal overdoses of prescription painkillers nationally last year, compared with 14,495 in 2017.

In the first half of 2018, total drug-related deaths in Florida did decrease by 5 percent compared with the same period in 2017. But that better news comes too late for the thousands who died or whose lives have been wrecked. During those six months, Florida reported 1,841 deaths caused by opioids, with fentanyl being the single worst drug, causing 1,101 deaths.

It is hard to believe it came to this. For example, the disclosures about the Port Richey pharmacy were reported by the New York Times from court filings in an Ohio case and included this email in January 2011 to a colleague from the woman who had the task of reviewing suspicious drug orders: I dont know how they can even house this many bottles to be honest. The Ohio lawsuit, scheduled for trial in October, is a major test that the presiding federal district judge hopes will persuade the sides to reach a national settlement.

Florida is doing some smarter things now. For one, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature have given the attorney general access to a state database that tracks prescriptions for serious drugs, from oxycodone to sleeping pills, with court approval. While keeping strong privacy protections, the database will allow Moody to pursue Floridas potentially multibillion dollar case against the nations largest drug makers and distributors, action that was begun in state court by her predecessor, Pam Bondi. For another, an emergency treatment called naloxone, which can reverse an opioid overdose in progress, is more widely in use and is saving lives. And new initiatives such as the just-formed West Central Florida Mental Wellness Coalition have set one of its missions to combat substance abuse issues, which affects one 1 in 12 residents. This is key, as too many addicts lacking treatment have shifted from oxycodone and hydrocodone pills to heroin or fentanyl.

These efforts are all worthy. Still, they are a reminder that its far better to prevent a problem than to have to cure it, and inaction can carry a heavy price.

Sex-sullied state park faces uncertain future

Texto completo: "This is one of those properties that doesn't really serve a purpose in the state park system anymore and a prime candidate to move to a different owner. That said, if somebody had a brilliant idea for what to do with Holman, we'd take that call."
Chris Havel
Oregon Parks and Recreation Department spokesman
EOLA
In the beginning, it was an idyllic patch of forest above the Willamette River where pioneers traveling west of Salem would stop, have lunch and get water for horses and oxen at a spring of renowned purity.But one of Oregon's first state parks ran into trouble as the Capital City grew and spread, devolving into a place overwhelmed by drugs and sex.The New York Times called it "A Park That Ran With the Wrong Crowd." Visitors told the Statesman Journal horrifying stories about public lewdness. State police arrested eight in a high-profile sting.And so, Holman Wayside State Park was sealed off by concrete barricades, its bathroom destroyed, and more than a century of public use largely ended.
"What we really need to do is reboot the park," Oregon Parks and Recreation Department spokesman Chris Havel told the New York Times in 2007. "The plan is to let the reputation die off a little bit, then come back."
The reboot never came to pass.
After a few ideas fizzled, Holman turned into something of a ghost park.
Blackberries and weeds are reclaiming the parking lot. A rusted water tank is covered by ivy. And a forested trail that climbs to views across the Willamette River ends at a sign saying, "Announce Yourself Here!" and a homeless camp.
Now, the 10-acre park is on what officials call a list of "non-essential" proprieties considered for disposal. That means it could be transferred to another owner, including an agency or county, or sold at auction.
"This is one of those properties that doesn't really serve a purpose in the state park system anymore," Havel told the Statesman Journal. "That said, if somebody had a brilliant idea for what to do with Holman, we'd take that call."
The early days Holman Wayside — or what remains of it — is located at the intersection of Doaks Ferry Road and Oregon Highway 22, just across from the Rock N Rogers Eola Inn about four miles west of Salem.
The route has long been a busy one for travelers headed to Dallas or the Oregon Coast, even back in the 1850s, when pioneers traveled the Salem-Dallas territorial road on horseback or with oxen teams.
Thomas and Cora Holman owned land along the road with a spring, and for decades the couple allowed travelers to stop, relax and refresh their animals before moving on.
In 1922, the Holmans sold their property for $1,000 to create one of Oregon's first state parks.
"The tradition of it being a place where travelers stopped to rest continued when it became a state park," Havel said. "You would have seen horses and early automobiles, people having picnics, and a great view of the river.
"Oregon's first version of a state park were these little pockets along the highways, and Holman was a great example."
The rise of a bad reputation It's unclear exactly when Holman went from a wholesome place for a picnic to a park with a reputation for illegal drugs and sexual liaisons.
Statesman Journal archives suggest Holman was a typical state park through the 1970s, with the biggest problems coming from trying to harness the spring and turn it into a drinking fountain.
But by the late 1980s and early '90s, more serious problems were apparent.
"This last year has just been terrible," Dan Lucas, an assistant park manager at Holman, told the Statesman Journal in 1989. He was referring to people continually destroying the park's restrooms. In 1991, Holman was closed for three weeks due to "extensive vandalism" that included the destruction of the sink, toilets, light fixtures and water fountain.
Police at the time blamed the problems on the park's close proximity to Salem's growing urban center. The city's population had grown nearly 60 percent since 1970, up to 107,000.
Vandalism was only part of the problem. At some point, the park became a hotbed for public sex, according to numerous reports. Polk County police conducted a sting as early as 1992 that led to arrests for public indecency.
A McDonalds at Holman? Oregon's state parks department was facing a crisis in the mid-1990s.
Underfunded for decades and overwhelmed by maintenance costs, the department was planning to shut down 65 state parks.
Enter a unique idea: corporate sponsorship.
For the most part, the idea was to allow corporate advertising at places like Silver Falls or Smith Rock. But there also was talk of adding a scaled-down McDonalds at Holman specifically, according to a 1996 Statesman Journal story.
"If we were to do it, we'd do a facility that would kind of blend in," Rob Wessberg, a state parks official, said in 1996. "I see it as a revenue generator, because it seems like society is always looking for a place to go to the restroom and grab a bite to eat."
The idea never went anywhere because in 1998 voters approved Measure 66 that dedicated 15 percent of profits from the Oregon Lottery to parks and salmon recovery programs.
The influx of cash meant not only did Oregon not have to close parks, but the park system would expand substantially over the next decade.
A McDonalds was no longer necessary at Holman. But the problems at the park didn't go away.
The breaking point came in 2007. After multiple visitors reported being propositioned for sex — and 100 reported incidents in 12 months — police conducted a sting that led to the arrest of eight men for public indecency.
In response, barricades were placed across Holman's parking lot as parks officials planned to close the park for "up to one year."
"I think this is necessary because the park isn't serving a good purpose for the community," Polk County Sheriff Bob Wolfe said at the time.
Could Holman be rebooted? A few attempts were made to reopen Holman as something new.
An early idea came from a group of mountain bikers that wanted to build a trails system with jumps and obstacles similar to the Black Rock Mountain Bike area outside Falls City.
But nothing gained traction.
Havel said there are multiple problems.
First, the park is tightly surrounded by roads — Highway 22, Doaks Ferry and Cherry Hill Lane on the far side.
Second, the steep hillside, which today is filled with dense forest and a meadow, is prone to landslides, Havel said. There also is a broken water line from the old spring.
"It's basically shoehorned into a steep triangle that defies a lot of beneficial uses," Havel said.
The park does host a bike path that is still used, helping connect a paved route from Salem to Monmouth, and parks officials are eager to protect that use.
Some believe the park should embrace recreation and turn Holman into a centerpiece for a trails system in West Salem.
"Park at Holman, have it lit with bathrooms open," said Salem trails advocate Mark Wigg. "Then peddle or scooter into town on the multi-use path."
Eventually, Wigg hopes to complete a pedestrian overpass of Highway 22 that connects to a proposed rail-to-trail along the Willamette to Edgewater.
"We will need bathrooms and parking for visitors wanting to do the loop," Wigg said, although the route could be a long way off.
There is plenty of potential for a park on its own merits as well — a mostly intact parking lot and forested trails with nice views. It has close proximity to a large population in West Salem that values parks. It's not difficult to see it becoming a place similar to the Salem Audubon Nature Reserve or Brush College Park, which are both in West Salem.
That said, reopening the park would cost time and resources, and is likely to face the same type of problems that closed it. A number of homeless camps are there currently.
Sale or transfer of Holman The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department owns numerous small properties statewide, and some of them are considered "non-essential" and candidates for "disposal."
Most are small parcels — waysides or holdings — that don't fit into the parks system, Havel said.
Holman currently fits that billing.
When disposing of a property, officials first identify other government agencies that it can transfer the property to. That could include a state agency, such as the Oregon Department of Transportation, or an owner such as Polk County.
In the past 10 years, Oregon's state parks department has transferred property to another agency 13 times. Currently, for example, Cascadia State Park is being signed over to Linn County to manage. In these types of cases, the properties usually serve the same role and the public doesn't notice the difference.
"The first thing we always do is reach out to a partner to take over the park in a way that keeps it public," Havel said.
But sometimes nobody wants the park, and if selling the land to a private business will help raise funds for other parks in the system, that option is considered.
In the past 10 years, parks property has been sold to private companies three times. The most noteworthy was in 2017, when the agency sold 37 acres of Washburne State Wayside near Monroe for $255,750 to Shiloh Forestry, Inc., which promptly clear-cut the property.
"It's only after an exhaustive search that we start entertaining the idea of putting it up for sale," Havel said. "It's at the end of a public process and a long chain."
At Holman, they haven't reached that point yet. ODOT has been using the site occasionally for staging equipment, which has slowed down the process.
But eventually, the hard question of what to do with Holman will need to be answered.
Should it be given a second life as a park or center for recreation?
Should it be sold to a land developer for low-income housing or another new use?
For more than a century it was a place for repose and relaxation below bigleaf maples and Douglas fir, on the banks of the Willamette. What will the next century bring?

"This is one of those properties that doesn't really serve a purpose in the state park system anymore and a prime candidate to move to a different owner. That said, if somebody had a brilliant idea for what to do with Holman, we'd take that call."

Texto completo: What's on TV
EXPEDITION UNKNOWN: MEGALODON 8 p.m. on Discovery. It's that time of year again. The weeklong television event that celebrates the most feared of ocean predators kicks off on Discovery with a look at the disappearance of the megalodon, a 60-ton prehistoric shark that ruled the oceans millions of years ago and continues to inspire summer blockbusters today. Using fossilized teeth and data about its descendants, paleontologists and marine biologists weigh in with their theories of why this shark went extinct.
SHARK TRIP: EAT PREY CHUM 9 p.m. on Discovery. This two-hour episode from Will Packer, the producer of "Girls Trip," is part educational shark program, part buddy comedy. The comedian and retired Marine Corps Reserve officer Rob Riggle takes Anthony Anderson, Adam DeVine, Joel McHale and Damon Wayans Jr. on a guys' trip that includes some close encounters with sharks. At one point, Riggle persuades Anderson and Wayans to hop into "the human aquarium," a transparent box that bobbles in shark-infested seas, while McHale and DeVine throw chum into the water around the cage.
NOS4A2 9 p.m. on AMC. The first season of this horror series starring Zachary Quinto has its two-part finale. Based on a novel by Joe Hill, Stephen King's son, the show is a creative take on the vampire genre. Quinto plays Charlie Manx, a demon with an appetite for children's souls, and Ashleigh Cummings portrays Vic McQueen, a young woman with superhuman powers who tries to rescue Manx's victims. Like much of Hill's horror, "NOS4A2" focuses more on the development of complex characters than on delivering shock. "I think some people think horror is about sadism; it's about flinging intestines at the camera," the author told The New York Times. "And some is. And I like some of that stuff. But I do think the really effective horror is about empathy."
AMERICAN SWAMP 9 p.m. on MSNBC. The journalists Katy Tur and Jacob Soboroff have teamed up for a limited documentary series to investigate President Trump's campaign promise to "drain the swamp." In four hourlong episodes, the two travel across the country to see how large donations affect local elections, and talk to members of Congress about the ways big corporations and lobbyists influence local politics, and what fundamental change would look like.
What's Streaming
PENNYWORTH 9 p.m. on Epix; streaming on Epix Now. If you've ever watched a Batman film and asked yourself how Bruce Wayne and his trusted valet, Alfred Pennyworth, got together, this prequel series on Epix tries to fill in the blanks. After his stint in the British Special Air Service, a 20-something Pennyworth (Jack Bannon) forms a private security company in London in the 1960s. His work catches the attention of Thomas Wayne (Ben Aldridge), a young billionaire who will go on to become Bruce Wayne's father. The 10-episode season explores their early partnership, with a Bond-like Pennyworth offering protection from bad guys (and gals). It will also showcase Pennyworth's softer and less-seen sensual side, giving him a love interest, played by Emma Corrin.

Soccer's Megan Rapinoe Scores a Book Deal

Texto completo: During a speech earlier this month celebrating her team's World Cup victory, Megan Rapinoe ended with a plea to fans. "We have to be better," she said, urging all of them to consider how they could effect change in their communities. "It's our responsibility to make this world a better place."
Now, Ms. Rapinoe, a captain of the United States women's soccer team, will transfer that message into a book. The untitled project, acquired by Penguin Press and expected to be out in fall 2020, will include anecdotes from Ms. Rapinoe's life, said the Penguin Press president and editor in chief Ann Godoff, who made the deal, but its message will go beyond sports.
"A lot of women, great women soccer players, have written memoirs," Ms. Godoff said. "Megan has a different platform." While watching the World Cup, she said, "I thought, 'Here's a woman who is comfortable in her own skin,"' and noted her own children's excitement about Ms. Rapinoe's authenticity.
"She's just operating from this very honest and straightforward and 'This is who I am' place," Ms. Godoff said. "I think that's what many people aspire to."
In an email, Ms. Rapinoe said she is excited to share her story with readers. "I hope this book will inspire people to find what they can do, and in turn inspire other people around them to do the same," she said.
Ms. Rapinoe has spoken out on social justice issues and politics, particularly L.G.B.T.Q. rights and pay equity for women. These issues will also be addressed in the book, Ms. Godoff said.
"Coming from that very honest and authentic place and being able to find a way to put that on the page," she said, "I think will make a very lasting book." Ms. Godoff declined to say how much the publisher is paying Ms. Rapinoe.
The soccer star has also signed on to do a middle-grade book with Razorbill, a division of Penguin Young Readers, which will address "the power young people have within their own communities and the world at large," according to a statement. Her overall message, she said, is that "we can change the world in one generation, and have one hell of a time doing it."

#WayToSoundElitist: New York Times columnist David Brooks mocked for theory on waiters and tipping

Texto completo: New York Times columnist David Brooks was taken to task on Twitter last night after he tweeted, "Waiters are 87% friendlier as they hand me the bill and I’m about to decide the tip amount than they are at any other point in the meal."
By morning on Friday, Brooks had received almost 7,000 comments from users displeased with his statement. TweetTwitter users bristled at Brooks' sentiment, which seemed to suggest that the hospitality industry workers were only kind and professional at the moment before a customer decides how much to leave as a tip, thereby dictating their salary.
Brooks, 57, who often writes about cultural elitism in his bi-weekly New York Times column, became the subject of public ire in 2014 when he left his wife of 28 years with whom he had three children.
He began a new relationship with his research assistant Anne Snyder, 23 years his junior, while he was writing a book called The Road to Character. They wed in 2017. Their online wedding registry, full of lavish gifts, became fodder for his critics.
The Thursday tweet echoes other instances of Brooks appearing to be out of touch with the public, such as a 2017 column in which he wrote, "Recently I took a friend with only a high school degree to lunch. Insensitively, I led her into a gourmet sandwich shop. Suddenly I saw her face freeze up as she was confronted with sandwiches named 'Padrino' and 'Pomodoro' and ingredients like soppressata, capicollo and a striata baguette. I quickly asked her if she wanted to go somewhere else and she anxiously nodded yes and we ate Mexican."
Brooks also wrote a column in 2015 about a lavish trip he took with his then-family titled "My $120,000 Vacation."
Many expressed their distaste for Brooks' Thursday night tweet by relating their own experiences in the hospitality industry, suggesting that tweet suggested that Brooks was elitist. One user wrote, "I’m guessing how much you make in a month is not based on the kindness of strangers -so who are you to judge? And btw let me give you a tip...leave a nice tip. She may be your next Congresswoman or he might be a future Dr. working his way through med school."
[Also read: Joe Biden lavishes praises on New York Times columnist David Brooks]TweetOthers evoked Brooks notorious history to point out the hypocrisy of his position. One user wrote, "Women are 87% friendlier to you when they're your research assistant and you're having problems with your first wife."TweetTweetTweetStory URLPhoto Caption:In this Jan. 19, 2012, file photo, New York times columnist David Brooks shares a stage with pundits during a panel discussion, "2012: The Path to the Presidency", at the University of Chicago in Chicago. Brooks has become a target of online criticism over an opinion piece published July 11, 2017, in which he describes taking a friend without a college degree to a Mexican restaurant because he assumed she was intimidated by the menu at a gourmet eatery.

Dr. Leana Wen's departure from Planned Parenthood exposes the organization's true identity

Texto completo: There are public relations problems and there are public relations crises. Then there is what Planned Parenthood is experiencing with the departure of its former president, Dr. Leana Wen.
Wen, the first doctor to run the abortion chain in nearly five decades, is not going quietly into the night. Rather, she is essentially blowing the whistle on the organization on her way out the door, making her the most senior staff member ever to publicly duke it out with the billion dollar behemoth.
Wen smartly got ahead of the narrative, laying down rhetorical stakes in a tweet immediately after news broke of her firing. She and Planned Parenthood had "philosophical differences. " She wanted Planned Parenthood to prioritize women’s health. The board did not.
In a piece for the Sunday pages of The New York Times, Wen expanded on what she meant by women’s health. Planned Parenthood has a duty, she argued, “to increase care for women before, during and after pregnancies,” care such as mental health care for women suffering from postpartum depression or treatment for pregnant women struggling with addiction. Though I am an ardent anti-abortion activist, I found myself admiring Wen for what is clearly a genuine commitment to providing care and treatment to women as a whole.
Women's health as a front, not an aim
Here’s why I also admire Wen. As she makes clear, the board that hired her tasked her with refashioning the organization — beleaguered by things like prior President Cecile Richards' highly publicized admission that Planned Parenthood doesn’t offer mammograms, or campaigns catching them offering ultrasounds only to confirm fetal gestational age for an abortion — as one that is about women’s health, not just abortion advocacy.
Abortion access: Texas made it hard to have my abortion. With Roe at stake, I’m going home to expand access.
With a wink and nod of course.
No doubt what the board really meant was Wen should pretend Planned Parenthood care about the full spectrum of women’s health, not actually start implementing programs that amounted to “mission creep,” as anonymous staff called it in The Times. Board members wanted to use Wen’s medical credentials and obvious passion for women’s health care to prop up the sagging myth that Planned Parenthood is more than just the most well-oiled abortion lobbying machine in the world. No doubt Wen figured it out, and refused to play along.
Planned Parenthood is vulnerable
Then came the biggest legal and financial blow dealt to Planned Parenthood perhaps ever. Undoubtedly, it was expecting the new regulation from the Department of Health and Human Services requiring family planning clinics that receive taxpayer dollars not to promote abortion as a method of family planning to be struck down in court. Shockingly, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rule, meaning that tens of millions of Planned Parenthood dollars, in addition to its entire business model, are now on the line.
The day after the Trump administration announced it would begin enforcing the rule immediately, Wen was out.
Coincidence? Hardly.
Commonality across politics: I'm pro-life, but I have a lot in common with Planned Parenthood's Cecile Richards
Wen’s departure has left Planned Parenthood perhaps more exposed than ever. She didn’t just ding the organization for failing to prioritize women’s health. She irreversibly exploded the myth that comprehensive women’s health is something it cares about. The proof is Planned Parenthood's willingness to take the extreme public heat for firing a passionate young doctor, and a minority immigrant at that, eight months into the job because the board so badly wants to protect access to abortion and little else. That board members were OK with being exposed as a pure political advocacy group despite the public relations toll it would bear belies just how extreme they have become.
Wen forced out for moderation
Wen also revealed her willingness and interest in working with those who disagreed about abortion. Though her goal was, as she put it, “to normalize abortion care as the health care it is,” she also wanted to help find “space for those of us in the middle to come together around shared values. ”
The problem is that, for pro-lifers, there is no middle ground on abortion. It is, every single time, the unjust and violent taking of a life from the most vulnerable class of human beings. We will never stop working until it is not just illegal but unthinkable. An important part of that work is exposing Planned Parenthood for what it really is, a taxpayer-funded abortion political advocacy group and abortion chain. By firing its best hope at masking that reality, Planned Parenthood is now doing our work for us.

Texto completo: The College of DuPage Fine Arts program, in collaboration with the Cleve Carney Museum of Art, welcomes six artists to campus for lectures and workshops as part of the 2019-2020 Visiting Artist Series.
All lectures are free and open to the public and take place in either the Playhouse Theatre or Belushi Performance Hall of the McAninch Arts Center, located on the Glen Ellyn campus, 425 Fawell Blvd.
In its fifth year, the Visiting Artist Series provides opportunities for the community to engage with leaders in the fields of contemporary art, design and culture.
This year’s series highlights artists who are committed to engaging with materiality through diverse mediums and practices.
The Visiting Artists Series begins at 1 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 18, with a lecture by messenger, artist and educator Nick Cave in Belushi Performance Hall.
Cave, described as a Renaissance artist, works between the visual and performing arts through a wide range of mediums, including sculpture, installation, video, sound and performance. His solo exhibitions have expanded globally from the United States through France, Africa, Denmark, Asia, South America and the Caribbean.
Cave is most famous for creating "Soundsuits," sculptural costumes enveloping the wearer’s body in everyday objects. "Soundsuits" camouflage the body, masking and creating a second skin that conceals race, gender and class, forcing the viewer to look without judgment.
Cave also works as a professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Multidisciplinary artist Mie Kongo discusses how her work is driven by a sense of curiosity, discovery, realization and learning through everyday life at 11 a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 22, in Belushi Performance Hall.
Kongo creates multidisciplinary work with diverse materials, including ceramic sculptures, installations and porcelain designed objects. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally, including recent exhibitions at the Arts and Literature Laboratory in Madison, Wis., 4th Ward Project Space in Chicago, Grunwald Gallery of Art at Indiana University Bloomington and the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago.
Her residencies include Shigaraki Ceramics Cultural Center in Japan, the European Ceramic Work Centre in the Netherlands and Intonation Deidesheim in Germany. She is an adjunct associate professor in the ceramics department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Artist Aden Kumler shares her extensive knowledge of medieval art history at 11 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 20, in Belushi Performance Hall. Kumler is an associate professor in the departments of Art History and Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of Chicago and an affiliated faculty member of the University of Chicago’s Medieval Studies program, Center for the Study of Gender & Sexuality and Divinity School. She is the co-editor of the International Center of Medieval Art’s "Viewpoints" book series, a new forum for experimental books on medieval art history, co-published by the International Center of Medieval Art and Penn State University Press.
Installation artist Paola Cabal discusses the intersection between physics and perception at 11 a.m. Thursday, Feb. 20, in the Playhouse Theatre. Cabal is best known for her rigorous observational studies of daylight over time—movements the artist photographs on-site, then paints directly into spaces trompe l’oeil-style using spray paint. As an artist and educator, Cabal co-teaches a course called "Articulating Time and Space" alongside astrophysicist Kathryn Schaffer at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Cabal has received a fellowship from the Illinois Arts Council, an Individual Artist award from the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation, a joint commission for the Chicago Transit Authority and the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, and a residency at the Chicago Cultural Center.
Visual artist Mary Mattingly discusses her work that explores issues of sustainability, climate change and displacement at 1 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, in Belushi Performance Hall. Based in New York, Mattingly creates photographs, sculptures and large-scale public art projects addressing climate change by drawing connections between the social and economic forces that make up the current political ecology impacting our environment. In 2016, she launched a floating food forest on a barge called "Swale," a social sculpture where people are invited to pick food from an edible landscape in order to circumvent public land laws in New York City that disallow public foraging. Mattingly recently transplanted a group of edible palm trees to upstate New York to show that the introduced vegetation accounts for predictions in climatological shifts. Mattingly’s artwork has been featured in The New York Times, Le Monde, New Yorker and The Wall Street Journal as well as on CBS, BBC, NBC and PBS’s Art21.
Chicago-based architect, Vladimir Radutny closes out the series with a discussion about his architecture studio’s belief that architecture is an art form at 11 a.m. Wednesday, April 8, in the Playhouse Theatre. In 2008, Radutny founded his Chicago-based architecture and design studio. Radutny’s multi-disciplinary architecture practice focuses on innovative design solutions that challenge the conventional interpretations of space, function and material use. His studio’s approach is ideas-driven, relying on imagination and experience to identify the creative nuances within each project. He believes in architecture as an art form with capacity to not just alter space, but to change perceptions, feelings and habits, transcending the workplace, home or in-between. His practice has been recognized with numerous AIA design awards and, in 2017, Radutny was awarded the Dubin Family Young Architect Award. In addition, he teaches at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Illinois Institute of Technology College of Architecture.

Texto completo: Aaron Hull, the chief Border Patrol agent in the El Paso Sector, which includes New Mexico, is heading to Detroit on Monday to serve as the interim chief on a temporary duty assignment, according to a CBP spokesman.
The reason for assignment was not clear.
"Multiple members of the Border Patrol's senior leadership team are currently rotating on TDY assignments in both Headquarters roles and senior field positions nationwide," the CBP spokesman said.
The El Paso Sector has seen its share of controversy, with accusations that migrant children in the Clint, Texas, facility were being neglected, kept in jail-like holding facilities and suffering from outbreaks of diseases such as scabies and chickenpox.
The El Paso Sector includes El Paso and Hudspeth counties in West Texas and all of New Mexico.
Earlier this month, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus toured facilities in Clint and El Paso. Elected officials claimed women in the facility made accusations of "psychological torture," with one migrant woman telling lawmakers she had been told to drink from the toilet.
After the El Paso Times and New York Times published an article stating leadership knew for months that some children in the Clint station had no beds to sleep on, sometimes went hungry and had no way to clean themselves, Hull disputed the claims on CNN.
"I would dispute that the conditions are so bad as have been reported," Hull said during the interview. "I can't understand why some people would be making some of the allegations that they're making."
U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, who was among the politicians who toured the Clint and El Paso centers, has been vocal in her disapproval of conditions at the facilities. The freshman congresswoman testified July 12 before the House Oversight Committee alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York; Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, on what she saw in the facilities.
"We've seen severe overcrowding in Border Patrol processing centers that is so inhumane, that the DHS Office of the Inspector General described it as 'dangerous' because it represents 'an immediate risk' to agents and migrants alike," she said in testimony.
The El Paso Times reached out to Escobar, but was told by a spokeswoman that she would not be commenting.

Texto completo: A flock of silkie chickens in Brookhaven Town is "endorsing" brands and laying golden eggs for  its owner, part of a wave of pets that translate social media celebrity to cash and free products.
Kristen Steinhardt oversees the brood of six silkie chickens: hens Willow, Aspen, Poppy, Cash and Fawke, and the rooster, Turbo. Their @lux_chicken page on Instagram has more than 7,000 followers.
Steinhardt, 24, charges $75 per photo for sponsored posts on her Instagram.
"I try to lock in one brand for a three-month period," she said. "This can generate $150 per month for my chickens. Minus expenses, they can profit around $130."
Those revenue numbers can climb for pets whose followers number in the millions.
Celebrity animals such as Grumpy Cat (now deceased) and Crusoe, the celebrity dachshund, can attract millions of followers to social media accounts on Facebook and Instagram. For instance, Grumpy Cat's Instagram account still has 2.7 million followers two months after her death in May from a urinary tract infection.
That media magnetism translates to marketing muscle for brands seeking to cut through the advertising clutter.
Loni Edwards founded The Dog Agency in Manhattan to represent social media pet stars, including Tuna the chiweenie - a cross between a Chihuahua and a dachshund - with an overbite; Duke Bush, the canine featured in Bush's Baked Beans commercials; and Crusoe, who has 3 million followers on Facebook. She said that A-list celebrity pets can fetch $10,000 to $15,000 per picture or video posted on Facebook or Instagram, the leading social media sites for pets.
Crusoe, who has had more than a billion video views, qualifies as a mega-celebrity pet, essentially a four-legged Kardashian. He has landed on The New York Times bestseller list; appears on calendars, blogs and short-form videos; and received the 2018 People's Choice Award for being an animal star. 
"We manage those campaigns," Edwards said. "We help brands with creative ideas. We make it easy for brands and influencers to work together."
Edwards' agency also is staging a series of PetCon conventions in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago that feature branded products and celebrity pets, such as the puggle (a pug-beagle mix) Bruno from the Netflix series "It's Bruno!" and human co-star Naim Solvan. Attendees are invited to bring their own critters.
Steinhardt, co-founder and chief executive of gyroplane dealer Gyro Revolution LLC in Ronkonkoma, bought her chickens in September 2016 from Swanky Silkies in Berkley, Massachusetts. Cost: $20 per chick.
"I always wanted them as pets, and they come with many benefits, including fresh eggs, great fertilizer and tons of amusement," she said. "As their Instagram account took off, brands started reaching out. I saw this as an opportunity where they could generate some extra income and pay their own rent."
The silkies have endorsed Chicken Chew, a corn-free, soy-free, non-GMO feed, as well as First Saturday Lime, a nontoxic pest repellent.
They also have made guest appearances at children's birthday parties and have an upcoming four-month exclusive endorsement deal with Manna Pro, a provider of  feed and other products for poultry, goats, rabbits, cattle, horses and swine.
In East Islip, Jennifer Aponte's 5-year-old border collie, Leo, models pet bandannas that she sells through her Fancy Little Fluffers page on the website Etsy. Aponte's grandmother does the sewing, and her mother packages and ships the items.
Aponte, 26, who works as a veterinary technician, said Leo also has won treats, leashes, cameras and a dog crate in Instagram contests. 
"Leo has yet to do any commercial work, but he is a phenomenal model," Aponte said. "I would absolutely love for Leo to become even more Insta-famous."
And for Steinhardt, the appeal of her silkie chickens extends beyond the barnyard.
"I think people are most drawn to them because their photos are fun and quirky," she said. "They have pool parties, drive with me in the car, fly on a jet, go on dates with each other, have Sunday brunch."
While social media can get "oversaturated" with copycat photos, Steinhardt said she tries to be "unique" and "stay true to their brand."
In addition to spinning off some cash,  her snowy white hens also each lay about four organic eggs a week in the summer.

President Shares the Stage With a Seal of Disapproval

Texto completo: A mystery was afoot in conservative Washington circles this week after an apparent mix-up made for an unexpected jab at President Trump. Let us set the scene.
The venue: a Washington hotel where Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization, was hosting a conference for high school students, where Mr. Trump spoke on Tuesday.
The décor: a presidential seal on the onstage screen, a fitting background for a speech by the president of the United States.
The problem: The presidential seal was not, in fact, the presidential seal at all, as The Washington Post reported. Instead of the customary bald eagle, the altered image showed a double-headed eagle, similar to that featured in Russia's national emblem. Instead of arrows, the eagle clutched a set of golf clubs in a talon. It appeared as the president emerged onstage.
The fake seal's appearance at the event seemed to catch everyone off guard. A White House spokesman told The New York Times that officials did not review the image before it appeared. Turning Point USA initially said it had no idea how it ended up there. Was it a prank or a political statement? Or was it a simple mistake by the audiovisual team, who perhaps pulled the wrong image off the internet? By Thursday, that seemed to be the explanation.
In the hours after the image was circulated online, an aide at the organization was fired, a person with knowledge of the matter confirmed on Thursday.
The seal appeared to be the same as one used to sell anti-Trump merchandise in an online store, The Post reported, based on a reader tip.
In an interview with The Times, the store's proprietor, Charles, said he had created the image, based on the Russian double-headed eagle, a little over a year ago out of frustration with Mr. Trump and his policies. He asked that his last name not be used because he is receiving hateful messages online.
"This is the most petty piece of art I think I've ever designed," said Charles, who is based in Virginia and works in video production and graphic design. "This was every petty, little thing I could think of to needle him because he was driving me bananas with his politics."
After he created the altered seal, Charles shared it with friends, who encouraged him to sell it online, so he created a website and store and quickly moved on with his life. Then, on Thursday morning, he said he was surprised to come across his creation in a news article while he was drinking coffee and scanning Reddit.
"It kind of made my day," he said.
The doctored image quickly became a talking point among liberals and conservatives alike. Online, some delighted in the dig and called it "brilliant trolling." Others denounced the switch as an offense worthy of dismissal.
The alterations were subtle enough.
The traditional presidential seal contains the image of an eagle, which holds arrows representing war in one talon and olive branches representing peace in the other. A banner above its head bears the motto "E Pluribus Unum," Latin for "Out of Many, One."
The eagle in the altered image had two heads, a symbol featured on the national emblem of Russia, the flags of several other countries and the logos for two Trump golf resorts in Scotland. The symbol is often associated with power and empire.
In that seal, the eagle clutches golf clubs and what appears to be a wad of money in its talons. The banner above its head reads "45 Es un Títere," Spanish for "45 Is a Puppet." And a shield across the eagle's chest features five instances of the hammer and sickle, a Communist symbol associated with the Russian Revolution.
The event was an unlikely setting for criticism, and it is unclear if the president was aware of the fake seal. He spoke for nearly 80 minutes in front of a supportive audience. The real presidential seal appeared on the lectern and on another part of the screen.
Katie Rogers contributed reporting.

Texto completo: Representative Tulsi Gabbard, the long-shot presidential candidate from Hawaii, said in a federal lawsuit that Google infringed on her free speech when it briefly suspended her campaign's advertising account after the first Democratic debate in June.
The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in a federal court in Los Angeles, is believed to be the first time a presidential candidate has sued a major technology firm.
In a twist that reflects Ms. Gabbard's unorthodox political views, the claim that her speech was stifled by Google is similar to complaints made over the last year in Republican circles. Few Democrats have raised similar concerns.
Big tech companies like Google are getting increasing scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators around the world for a wide variety of issues, including their influence on political debate, their handling of consumer data, and the aggressive way they compete with smaller companies.
A day before the Gabbard lawsuit was filed, Facebook said the Federal Trade Commission had opened a formal antitrust investigation into its business practices. Earlier in the day, the F.T.C. announced that Facebook was fined a record $ 5 billion for deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal data.
Tulsi Now Inc., the campaign committee for Ms. Gabbard, said Google suspended the campaign's advertising account for six hours on June 27 and June 28, obstructing its ability to raise money and spread her message to potential voters.
After the first Democratic debate, Ms. Gabbard was briefly the most searched-for candidate on Google. Her campaign wanted to capitalize on the attention she was receiving by buying ads that would have placed its website at the top of search results for her name.
The lawsuit also said the Gabbard campaign believed its emails were being placed in spam folders on Gmail at "a disproportionately high rate" when compared with emails from other Democratic candidates.
"Google's arbitrary and capricious treatment of Gabbard's campaign should raise concerns for policymakers everywhere about the company's ability to use its dominance to impact political discourse, in a way that interferes with the upcoming 2020 presidential election," the lawsuit said.
Ms. Gabbard and her campaign are seeking an injunction against Google from further meddling in the election and damages of at least $ 50 million.
Google has automated systems that flag unusual activity on advertiser accounts -- including large spending changes -- to prevent fraud, said Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for the company.
"In this case, our system triggered a suspension and the account was reinstated shortly thereafter," he said. "We are proud to offer ad products that help campaigns connect directly with voters, and we do so without bias toward any party or political ideology."
No other campaigns have publicly claimed that Google has suspended their advertising accounts.
Interest in Ms. Gabbard, who has served four terms in the House and is an Army National Guard veteran, spiked after the debate. She entered the presidential race as a relative unknown and is still polling at less than 1 percent, according to New York Times polling averages.
But her appeal has crossed traditional party lines. She has drawn support from both the right and the left because of a staunch antiwar message. She has also received favorable coverage from influential conservative news media like Drudge Report, Fox News and Breitbart.
Ms. Gabbard's campaign is historic even in a race with many potential firsts. She was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21, becoming the youngest woman to join a United States state legislature. When she was elected as representative for Hawaii in 2012, she was the first Samoan-American and first Hindu member of Congress.
Her political views are unusual among Democratic candidates. She has a history of making anti-gay statements and worked for an anti-gay advocacy group run by her father. (She has since apologized and said her past views were wrong.)
And she has tapped into increasingly bipartisan passion: wariness of big tech. The lawsuit filed Thursday said Ms. Gabbard had joined Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is also vying to be the Democratic Party nominee, in calling for large tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon to be broken up.
"Google's discriminatory actions against my campaign are reflective of how dangerous their complete dominance over internet search is, and how the increasing dominance of big tech companies over our public discourse threatens our core American values," Ms. Gabbard said in a statement. "This is a threat to free speech, fair elections, and to our democracy, and I intend to fight back on behalf of all Americans."
While assertions of tech firms tipping the scales against political opponents are largely unproven, the lawsuit taps into concern that tech companies aren't transparent about how decisions are made and they aren't held accountable when things go wrong.
Last week, senators homed in on Google in a subcommittee hearing about censorship in search. The hearing aired many largely unproven claims that Google tilts search results against conservative viewpoints.
"Google's control over what people hear, read, watch and see is unprecedented," said Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican from Texas who led the subcommittee. "With that market power, Google can and often does control our discourse."
Gabbard campaign workers sent an email to a Google representative on June 27 at 9:30 p.m. once they realized the account had been suspended. In emails reviewed by The New York Times, the campaign sent Google a screenshot of a notice of suspension for "problems with billing information or violations of our advertising policies."
The account was reactivated at 3:30 a.m. on June 28. In the email announcing that it had reinstated the account, Google wrote that the company temporarily suspended the campaign's account to verify billing information and policy compliance, but offered no other explanation for what had happened.
The campaign said it had opened the Google advertising account in February and had bought ads on Google search before the suspension. It said there was no problem with its billing information and that it had not violated Google's terms of service.
"To this day, Google has not provided a straight answer -- let alone a credible one -- as to why Tulsi's political speech was silenced when millions of people wanted to hear from her," the lawsuit said.
Without the ads, the Tulsi 2020 website, which has links for donations and information about the goals of her candidacy, appears in the first page of search results for "Tulsi Gabbard." But it is below stories and videos about her -- selected by a Google algorithm -- and after her Wikipedia page, her Twitter profile and her congressional website.
Roughly half of the candidates who participated in the first Democratic debates have bought ads to appear at the top of search results for their names.
With the exception of Senator Bernie Sanders, who is one of the leaders in fund-raising among the Democrats, the candidates buying Google search ads are polling in the low single digits, suggesting that the ads are more important to candidates with less name recognition.

Texto completo: No one on federal death row has been executed since 2003, but on Thursday, William P. Barr, the attorney general, announced that the government was resuming executions, starting with five men convicted of killing children.
The men, whose ages range from 37 to 67, have each been convicted of heinous crimes, and together have been involved in the slayings of 13 victims. The cases fell under federal jurisdiction because of how or where they were carried out.
[ Mr. Barr's decision runs counter to a broad national shift away from the death penalty as public support for it has dwindled. ]
All five are being held at a high-security federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., where their executions are set for December and January. More executions will be scheduled, the Justice Department said in a statement. There are 62 people who are facing death sentences, according to the Bureau of Prisons, including the five whose execution dates were announced Thursday.
Here is a look at the five men and the crimes they committed.
Lezmond Mitchell, 37, who killed a woman and her granddaughter
Mr. Mitchell was convicted in 2003 of killing a grandmother and her 9-year-old granddaughter within the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona.
Major crimes within the Navajo Nation fall under federal jurisdiction when either the perpetrators or victims -- or, as in this case, both -- are members of the nation. A jury decided that Mr. Mitchell should face the death penalty.
Mr. Mitchell and a friend were hitchhiking near the border with New Mexico when they were picked up by the 63-year-old grandmother, Alyce Slim, who was with her granddaughter, Tiffany Lee, according to The Santa Fe New Mexican.
The two men stabbed her to death and then killed her granddaughter after forcing the child to sit near her grandmother's body while they drove 30 to 40 miles, according to the Justice Department. They later used the grandmother's truck in a robbery, The New Mexican reported.
The Justice Department has scheduled Mr. Mitchell's execution for Dec. 11.
Wesley Purkey, 67, who killed a 16-year-old girl and an 80-year-old woman
Mr. Purkey, of Lansing, Kan., kidnapped a 16-year-old girl, Jennifer Long, in Kansas City, Mo., and brought her to his house, where he raped her repeatedly and, after killing her, dismembered and burned her body.
The Kansas City Star reported last year that the girl's murder in 1998 was nearly forgotten until one of her childhood friends contacted a true crime podcast, which featured her in an episode. Federal prosecutors pursued the case because Mr. Purkey had brought the teenager across state lines, from Missouri to Kansas.
Mr. Purkey was sentenced to death for the crime of kidnapping a child resulting in the child's death, according to the Justice Department.
Months before that murder, Mr. Purkey had used a hammer to kill Mary Bales, an 80-year-old woman who suffered from polio. It was after he was convicted of that slaying in state court that he began talking about killing the teenager, and eventually confessed, although he retracted his admission once prosecutors sought the death penalty, according to The Star.
Rebecca Woodman, a lawyer now representing Mr. Purkey, said her client experienced a horrific childhood and was inadequately represented during his trial. Ms. Woodman said Mr. Purkey has dementia and other mental and physical disabilities.
His execution is scheduled for Dec. 13.
Daniel Lee, 46, who wanted to create a white republic
Daniel Lee, a white supremacist who lived in Oklahoma, was convicted in 1999 of murdering an Arkansas gun dealer, William Mueller, as well as his wife, Nancy Mueller, and her 8-year-old daughter, Sarah Powell.
Mr. Lee broke into the family's home in Tilly, Ark., in January 1996 with an accomplice, Chevie Kehoe, and together they suffocated the family before throwing them into the Illinois Bayou, according to the Justice Department. The bodies were not found until June, when a woman who was fishing discovered a shoe and a bone.
Mr. Kehoe had stepped in when Mr. Lee said he could not kill a child, The New York Times reported in an article about the murders in 1999, although Mr. Lee was convicted of three counts of murder.
In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Lee's lawyer, Morris Moon, said Mr. Kehoe "was alone responsible for the death of the child in this case" and added that he believed that executing his client would be a "grave injustice."
The case was a federal one because Mr. Lee was accused, and later convicted, of three counts of murder to aid racketeering, a federal crime. Mr. Lee is known as "Cyclops" because he lost an eye in a bar fight, according to the 1999 article. His execution has been scheduled for Dec. 9.
Alfred Bourgeois, 55, who tortured and killed his daughter
Mr. Bourgeois, a trucker from La Place, La., was sentenced to death in 2004 after he was convicted of murdering his 2-year-old daughter at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, making it a federal crime.
At his trial, eight people who knew Mr. Bourgeois, including family members, said they had been threatened or assaulted by him, according to The Plainview Daily Herald in Texas. They said he had tortured and repeatedly beaten his daughter, referred to as "JG" in court documents, in the months before killing her in June 2002.
"Bourgeois preyed on an innocent child -- one of the most vulnerable among us," Ryan K. Patrick, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Texas, said in a statement on Thursday. "She should have been protected and loved, but was instead robbed of her young life after being brutalized by her very own."
Of the five men whom the Justice Department said it wanted to execute, Mr. Bourgeois is the only one who is black, even though the federal death row is composed of a disproportionate number of black men, adding to criticism that jurors disproportionately favor the death penalty for black defendants. The Justice Department is seeking to execute Mr. Bourgeois on Jan. 13.
Dustin Honken, 51, convicted of killing five people, including two children
Mr. Honken, of Mason City, Iowa, killed five people in 1993 with the help of his girlfriend, who was once one of only two women on federal death row.
Described as the kingpin of a methamphetamine operation, Mr. Honken killed two men who were fellow drug dealers, Terry DeGeus and Gregory Nicholson, as well as Mr. Nicholson's girlfriend, Lori Duncan, and her two daughters, ages 6 and 10.
The Justice Department said the two men had planned to testify against Mr. Honken.
Iowa does not have the death penalty, but Mr. Honken was found guilty of 17 federal crimes -- including tampering with witnesses, conspiracy to commit murder, and multiple counts of a federal crime known as the kingpin statute -- which meant he could be executed by the federal government. His execution is scheduled for Jan. 15.

Texto completo: The highest ranking immigration official in the troubled El Paso region of the southwest border, where hundreds of children were reportedly held for weeks without enough food or the ability to bathe, has been temporarily removed from his job amid growing criticism over health and safety conditions for migrants there.
Aaron Hull, a veteran border official who became the sector chief in El Paso in 2017, will be moved to Detroit on Monday, where he will oversee operations along the much slower and less contentious Canadian border, according to a statement from the agency.
Officials with the Border Patrol's parent agency, Customs and Border Protection, said Mr. Hull's transfer was part of a routine shuffle of multiple senior staff members and that Mr. Hull's new assignment was considered temporary.
But several officials at both the Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security said that Mr. Hull's departure had been long in the works and followed a period of intense scrutiny of his management of the El Paso sector. Mr. Hull did not respond to requests to be interviewed.
The job of overseeing the El Paso region could be considered one of the most difficult within the Border Patrol. Of the agency's nine enforcement areas along the southwest border, the El Paso region -- which stretches from New Mexico into West Texas -- has seen the largest increase in unauthorized crossings since last year. So-called family unit apprehensions of migrants who are caught with a relative rose by 1,759 percent in the last fiscal year.
Under Mr. Hull, the El Paso sector was the first to begin conducting widespread family separations with the goal of deterring migrant families from traveling to the United States. Customs and Border Protection piloted the initiative in El Paso during the summer of 2017, roughly a year before the Trump administration publicly announced a nationwide "zero tolerance" border prosecution policy that resulted in widespread family separations.
Agents in the El Paso region told The New York Times that they had been sounding the alarm for some time about conditions in the Border Patrol station in Clint, Tex., where hundreds of migrant children were being held, as well as about other facilities in the El Paso sector where conditions were deteriorating. The agents said their concerns were largely ignored. A spokeswoman from Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on whether the recent controversy in El Paso contributed to Mr. Hull's transfer.
Mr. Hull is known among colleagues as tough and law-enforcement oriented, according to two D.H.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media. One official said that Mr. Hull was seen as part of an "old guard" of border agents, referring to those who have chafed the most as the agency's job has transitioned away from traditional law enforcement work toward detaining and caring for thousands of migrant children and families.
He resisted attempts from Washington to "meddle" in his sector, one of the officials said. He has often been heard saying that migrants exaggerate the problems they faced in their home countries.
Some agents said the facility in Clint was so filthy that a stench would seep into their clothing and follow them home after they left work, causing friends and family to scrunch their noses when the agents approached. According to lawyers who visited the station and interviewed children who were being held there, some children as young as 7 were caring for infants they had only just met. The children were being overseen by armed guards, the lawyers said, but many of the children were sick, and adult caretakers who could provide treatment were nowhere to be found.
NBC News, which first reported the news about the sector chief's transfer, obtained a draft report prepared in May by the D.H.S. Office of Inspector General detailing "dangerous overcrowding" at two other facilities overseen by Mr. Hull in the El Paso sector -- the El Paso Border Patrol Station 1 and the Paso Del Norte Border Patrol Station.
Investigators found hundreds of adult migrants in the facilities crammed into small cells that were meant to hold only a few dozen. Some of the migrants had gone without sleep because they were left in places where there was standing room only.
Sanitation was also a problem. "With limited access to showers and clean clothing, detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks," the report said. There was a "high incidence of illness among staff," and guards were armed and wore masks because of "concerns with the overcrowding that potentially could result in volatile situations," such as riots.
The situation was "not sustainable," the report warned.
In a media tour of the Clint Border Patrol facility in June, Mr. Hull said his agents were doing the best they could with the overwhelming numbers of migrants arriving over the spring, despite being understaffed and underfunded. He said the new arrivals were being processed out of border facilities as quickly as possible.
"When we catch more aliens than we can turn over, they tend to build up here in the station," he said.
Though the agency did not refer to it as such, Mr. Hull's move to Detroit was widely viewed as a demotion. It takes him from the El Paso sector, one of the agency's highest-profile assignments -- in part because it is the birthplace of the Border Patrol -- to the northern border with Canada, where the pace of activity is much slower.
Mr. Hull will go from overseeing the work of more than 2,000 agents in El Paso to about 400 in Detroit. Though it is the busiest region of the northern border, only about 2,000 people were apprehended in Detroit during the last fiscal year, compared to 31,000 in El Paso.
Taking his place in El Paso will be Gloria Chavez, who presently heads the Border Patrol's El Centro Sector in southeast California.

Good news!
The California's Hispanic - 84% Mexican American and almost 40 percent of California's population - - is leaving poverty and being educated. How? By graduating instead of dropping out of school, by flooding into California colleges and by solid free enterprise entry into the California marketplace with new businesses.
So says a July 9 report from the California Latino Economic Institute titled "The State of Latino Economic Well-being in California" authored by Mindy S. Romero Ph.D. of the University of Southern California's (USC) Sol Price School of Public Policy.
Sol Price, by the way, hired this writer 57 years ago after my first foray into political campaign work. He touched almost every American by founding The Price Club, now known as COSTCO.
Pew Research published a demographic profile of the California Hispanic in 2014 mostly based on the 2010 Census. The report builds on Pew's work.
2014 Pew Report: 15 million California Hispanics, 84% of which were of Mexican origin, 12,600,000. U.S. born - 64%. Hispanic/Latinos other than Mexican, 16% U.S. born.
Median household annual income: 2010 Hispanic, $52,147-2017 $56,151, 2017 Non-Hispanic White, however, $83,682; non-Hispanic Black, $48,559.
In the past decade, the report shows California Latino poverty has dropped 5.5% from 23% to 17.2%. Regionally, the disparity between Latinos and non-Latino White poverty rates are 7.5% in the Bay Area, 10.8% in Los Angeles, San Diego 9.3%; the worst, exactly where we might expect, in the rural farm country where low income farm workers predominate, the San Joaquin Valley, 14.8%. Nevertheless, poverty is lessening.
On home ownership, however, there is a remarkable difference between the lowest income, highest poverty area, the San Joaquin Valley with 47.3% of Hispanics owning homes and Los Angeles with 44% and San Diego with its astronomical home prices, 39.8%.
Despite poverty (17%) almost double that of Whites (9%) and lower across the board income, 38.1% of all California Hispanics are in what the report defines as middle income between $65,794 and $158,504; Blacks 39.1%, Asians, 41% and 41.4% of nonLatino Whites are higher. Where Latinos fall short is in the upper income levels where only 7.4% earn more than $158,000.
Of course, the better educated a group is, the more income earned. California Latino graduation rates have improved substantially since 2010 when 68.1% graduated from high school - 80.5% graduated in 2016. Also improving is the share of those graduates that are eligible for University of California and California State University (CSU) entrance as freshmen.
In 2000, 21.5% of Latino graduates qualified for UC/CSU; that jumped 18% in 2017, 39.4%. The most gain was among Latina women with 43.1% qualified and men 30.8%.
CSU has 400,000 plus students, 40 percent of which are Hispanic/Latino.
Between 2000 and 2017, earned four-year college degrees doubled among Hispanics; two, four-year and graduate degrees totaled 18% and those with "some" college were 19% for a total of 37% of Hispanic adults with one or more years of college. Consider what famed economist Thomas Sowell wrote in "Ethnic America" - the average 1950 California Mexican American had only eight years of school in 1950, the current numbers are better than good, they are remarkable.
Taken in their totality, these numbers from the California Latino Economic Institute document significant progress for the largest population cohort in California, the predominantly Mexican-origin Hispanic/Latino community.
Of all California workers, 37% are Hispanic/Latino, of all business firms in California, 800,000 - 25% - are Hispanic/Latinoowned. Between 2007, through the worst recession in memory and until 2012, the number of Hispanic/Latino businesses grew 43.9% while all other California business numbers grew by only 5%.
The report concludes: "Latinos in the state have made large gains over the last decade...e.g. decreases in poverty rates; increases in college enrollment, high school graduation rates and the percentage of UC/CSU eligible; as well as great growth in entrepreneurship."
Yes, many problems exist for California's 15 million-plus Hispanics, but free enterprise entrepreneurs who prefer to work for themselves and an army of people graduating from high school and attending college are pulling the 15 million into a state of being unimagined when the average Mexican American in California had an 8th grade education - when I was nine years old.

Rich Lowry: ‘Cosmopolitan’ is a perfectly fine word for cosmopolitans

Texto completo: Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley used a perfectly good word in its appropriate context, and stands accused of dog-whistle bigotry.
At the National Conservatism conference in Washington, D.C., last week, Hawley gave a keynote address that attacked the coastal elite for being out of touch and out of sympathy with the heartland. He called it "the cosmopolitan elite," described its beliefs as the "cosmopolitan consensus," and accused it of building a "cosmopolitan economy."
Even though there's not a remotely plausible argument that Hawley was in any way targeting Jews, his use of the C-word alone was enough for critics to say he was making an anti-Semitic appeal.
“If you’re Jewish and the use of ‘cosmopolitan’ doesn’t scare you, read some history,” warned New York Times op-ed writer Paul Krugman. A columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined, darkly, that Hawley “chose the word purposefully” (he had, just not in a sinister way). James Fallows of The Atlantic agreed that Hawley knew “exactly the implications of ‘cosmopolitan.”’
There's no doubt that the word has been abused for hideous ends. In 1946, Joseph Stalin gave a speech heralding the repression of Jews in the arts and literature that lamented, "The positive Soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of Lenin, characteristic of the political leftovers, is many times applauded."
Yet, the connection between Hawley, the overachieving 39-year-old former Supreme Court law clerk and attorney general of the state of Missouri, and the cruel, power-hungry Marxist-Leninist dictator who is one of history's great monsters ... is not obvious.
The word has also been used to target Jews by other anti-Semitic lowlifes and haters, although it's a smear to mention Hawley, who gladly and forthrightly denounces anti-Semitism, in the same breath as these cretins.
Why resort to the word at all? The axis of the culture war in this country has shifted to national identity, immigration policy, and citizenship, and requires a new vocabulary. The welcome effort to rehabilitate the word "nationalism," one goal of the National Conservatism Conference, is part of this re-orientation. But there also has to be a term for what the nationalists oppose, since Big Government and social liberalism aren't apt.
Cosmopolitanism is the natural choice. Per the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the word "has been used to describe a wide variety of important views in moral and socio-political philosophy. The nebulous core shared by all cosmopolitan views is the idea that all human beings, regardless of their political affiliation, are (or can and should be) citizens in a single community."
If the word is inherently a hateful term of opprobrium, it's strange that it is embraced by people who hold the worldview it describes.
According to the NYU professor Kwame Anthony Appiah, our challenge "is to take minds and hearts formed over the long millennia of living in local troops and equip them with ideas and institutions that will allow us to live together as the global tribe we have become."
What should we call this project? He considers the possibility of "globalization" and "multiculturalism" as terms, but settles on "cosmopolitanism." Indeed, the title of his book is "Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers."
All sorts of academics routinely use the term, including in the titles and subtitles of books, since it is so useful in describing a mindset and philosophy.
Hawley’s speech isn’t immune from criticism. It’s overly reductive to suggest all — or even most — of our problems stem from the disconnect between the coasts and the middle of the country. And filling out a plausible policy agenda to give expression to Hawley’s worldview is very much a work in progress. But his speech should be considered a conversation starter. By focusing on one allegedly forbidden word, his critics hope, as always, to be conversation stoppers.

R.C. Gorman Days

Texto completo: Walking in Michael Gorman’s sun-filled, laid-back gallery, one can see into three generations of his Navajo family’s collection. The Gorman family line is an eclectic mix of military heroism, soaring visual art success — and controversy.
Michael is the nephew of international art star, Rudolph Carl “R.C.” Gorman (1931-2005).
The second annual R.C. Gorman Days celebration is planned this weekend (July 26-28) in the emerging Main Street District of Taos. The event spearheaded by the Taos Arts Council encompasses various talks, historic walking tours on Ledoux Street and “Past Meets Present” pop-up art exhibit outside at the Blumenschein Home and Museum’s courtyard from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday (July 27-28).
There is every right for Michael Gorman, the Taos Art Council, the Harwood Museum of Art and others in Taos to honor R.C.’s legacy. His larger-than-life persona was known the world over. His artwork is found in major museums, galleries and exclusive private collections. The New York Times referred to him as “the Picasso of American Indian artists.” But, the reality is that his life was touched by controversy that continues to hang over him like a fog refusing to burn off.
In his later years, R.C. was accused of pedophilia and investigated by the FBI. Although the case was dismissed, innocent until proven guilty still leaves room for a marred reputation.
According to reports in KRQE-TV, channel 13, and the Santa Fe New Mexican in 2006, the FBI “uncovered credible evidence that Gorman participated in child sexual abuse.” The report said, however, that the five-year statute of limitations on criminal prosecution had expired on the “only provable cases,” according to media reports at the time. The U.S. attorney for the New Mexico district at the time, Norman Bay, said continuing the investigation would make it appear that Gorman “was targeted … based upon his prominence.”
In an interview with the Santa Fe New Mexican in 2006, Virginia Dooley, who managed Gorman’s career for 35 years and was the personal representative of his estate, stated that she did not believe the allegations. “It’s just because Gorman was a famous person, and people like to hit on famous people.”
Gorman’s purported alcoholism may have in the end shortened his life. The New York Times’ Margalit Fox spoke to the cause of death as “pneumonia following a blood infection for which Mr. Gorman had been hospitalized since September.” Many Taoseños accept this with a shrug of the shoulders.
“There are plenty of things that are controversial about his life, but it is not critical to our R.C. Gorman exhibit,” remarked Juniper Manley, executive director of the Harwood Museum of Art. “We want to support R.C. Gorman Days and work in tandem with the Taos Arts Council in bringing people to our wonderful [Ledoux] street.”
R.C.’s estate dragged through probate like a thirsty three-legged camel looking for water. When the dust settled, his four siblings each received $77,500 – 22 percent of what was left of the estate, according to Taos News writer J.R. Logan.
Michael Gorman conjectures, “There are some amazing artists here that have been bringing artists to Taos, but I’m not sure if there was anyone who has been as successful as R.C. was in building an economy around the art for the length of time that he did from 1968 to 2005 – bringing in the New York art scene, the San Francisco art scene, the Philadelphia art scene.”
According to Michael, R.C. opened up the first Native American art gallery in the United States in 1968, calling it the Navajo Gallery.
Paul Figueroa, president of the Taos Arts Council, says that the second annual event flows from the R.C. Gorman proclamation read last year. The event was created “to acknowledge and celebrate the life of R.C.Gorman and his impact upon Taos and its community and the legacy of his family in the art and heritage of the Southwest.”
The Gorman family is such a part of both Americana and Native American history that it is hard to know where to begin. One thing is for certain: R.C. is at the epicenter of the dynamic familial swirl.
Both Michael Gorman and Paul Figueroa glossed over issues that continue to shadow R.C’s legacy, preferring to change the focus back to the artist’s prodigious economic contributions to Taos in general.
Michael’s earliest memory of R.C. is painting alongside with him in his studio, a converted garage. “I had a little studio section, little easel, some watercolors,” remembers Michael. Michael and his mother, Zonnie, lived in the same house with R.C. on the Navajo Nation in Arizona.
“I knew him as Uncle R.C.,” says Michael fondly. “He was a big father figure in my life.”
Reach back two generations to Michael’s grandfather, and R.C.’s father, and you find Carl Nelson Gorman Sr.
Also an artist, Carl was one of the original 29 Navajo Code Talkers in World War II, for which he posthumously received the Congressional Medal of Honor in 2001. His wife, Mary, received the medal in his honor. Gorman Sr. died at 90 in 1998.
According to The New York Times obituary, Robert Mcg. Thomas Jr. writes, “Mr. Gorman spent much of World War II in the Pacific on his belly at the front lines, with a radio rather than a rifle in his hands, just as other Navajo volunteers did, making sure that the vaunted Japanese code crackers, who broke the Army, Navy and Air Corps codes, would never learn anything from intercepted Marine radio messages.”
When Carl Gorman came back from the Pacific theater, he attended the Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles County in California on his G.I. bill. He entered the art world with his pioneering drive refusing to create flat, two-dimensional pieces of bows and arrows, pottery and sand painting.
Instead, he experimented with ceramics, tile, silk-screening and jewelry design. In Michael Corman’s gallery you can see his horse paintings. Carl painted horses with modernistic thick outlines and minimal depiction, creating the horse as a lovely and intimate creature. He opened the door for many Indian artists including his worldrenowned son R.C.
R.C. stood on his father’s tall shoulders and in the 1970s began his trajectory into the international art scene.
The rest you might say is history. He made an impressive fortune selling paintings and lithographs of dignified Navajo women wrapped in blankets, largely due to a lovely reverence imported from R.C’s hand. He managed to bring Native American art into the late 20th century in such a way as to elevate the Southwest and popularize its tribal feminine mystique.
In the 1970s, his fame soared. Pop art icon Andy Warhol even painted R.C.’s portrait. And, with success came legendary soirees.
“I was not privy to those parties,” muses nephew Michael Gorman. “I think one of the special things about Taos is from talking to people and what I understand is that R.C. was really good at making people drop their facades, people could be themselves.”
From the early ‘70s on R.C.’s star skyrocketed. He was known to be a prolific artist and a rich man who partied with Elizabeth Taylor, Warhol, Bianca Jagger and many of the other jet-setters who frequented Studio 54 in New York City – the place to see and be seen. But, in an even more important way, R.C. also helped make Taos the place to see and be seen as well.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES — At the end of a long day, cooking a meal might be the last thing you want to do. So you open one of the food delivery apps on your phone (Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub, to name a few) to find something you’re hankering for.
The problem is by the time you actually hit order, you might be paying twice the price of your meal in delivery fees and decide that instead of paying even more money, your delivery driver is going to have to deal without a tip.
A study from US Foods shows 66% of food delivery app customers base their tip on how much the delivery and service cost them. The good news is that 95% of customers still tip regularly, but 60% of drivers say no tip or a small one is their No. 1 complaint.
“It’s already expensive, but that’s not the fault of your delivery driver, who is getting in their car, working for wages of their own and delivering you the food,” said etiquette expert Diane Gottsman.
So, how much should I tip my delivery driver?
That depends on who you ask, but, generally, both customers and drivers agree that $4 is a fair tip, according to the study. However, that might be low depending on the amount of food you order.
National Drive-Thru Day: Here's how to get deals and freebies year-round
Gottsman suggests tipping at least 20% of the total cost of the meal, or at least $5.
“They are working for gratuity as well,” said Gottsman. “That is part of their livelihood, and I think we should tip politely and appropriately,”
There are other things you should consider when you tip:
Tip in cash: Some food delivery apps use tip money as a way to avoid paying the driver their full payments, as The New York Times recently found with DoorDash. So if a driver is owed a $5 and you tip $2, the app pays them $3 instead of adding the tip as extra. DoorDash changed their tipping model since the article’s publication, but the easiest way to ensure the driver gets the full tip you are paying is to give them in cash.
Do your research: Some delivery services don’t actually require you to tip or have a guide on how to tip their drivers. Look at their website and see what their expectations are.
Consider the circumstances: Think about things like how far does my driver have to drive? How far do they have to park? How many flights of stairs do they have to climb? What’s the weather outside? And factor that into your tip, especially if it’s extraneous.
Tip for future service: If you plan on using one specific app or service for a long time, let them know you’re a good customer and tip them fairly. You’ll probably get better service.
Wine and dine: Kellogg's is selling Cheez-Its crackers with a box of wine for $25
Hey, drivers, you can do things to make sure you get that tip money, as 50% of customers decide on their tip on a case-by-case experience. Customers complain about drivers staying in their car or dropping off the food at the door and leaving. And whatever you do, do not take food from the order – customers really don’t like that, as 85% say restaurants should tampering labels on their delivery orders to ensure no one messes with their order.
And customers, consider giving your driver a bonus if you like them by writing them a good review either on the app or through other rating services. It will go a long way for them.

Texto completo: "Go Down Moses," the deeply resonant new exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Photography, begins with contemplative photos. The museum's first gallery features shots of open roads, of body fragments.
From there it gets progressively more crowded as people enter into the frames, first as individuals, then in groups, first lying down, then captured in more active postures.
Finally in the third floor gallery of the free museum at Columbia College on South Michigan Avenue, the exhibition explodes into a kind of glorious, unsettling near-cacophony. There are dozens of images on a wide, uninterrupted wall, but moments jump out: A mud-spattered lens capturing a "typical" American home; a wrecked car, upside down, a body adjacent; a Civil War battlefield, afterward; a child crying in the seat of a shopping cart, out on a gritty street; an upended house.
Where previously in this show curated by Teju Cole the photos were arranged as individual members of small groups, the third-floor array is a collage, fire beside rust beside human distress. Where previously there were labels saying who shot the photos, all drawn from the museum's archive, on floor three there is only the images, only the sense of a world in motion and peril and disarray.
And then, importantly, to exit the museum, you pass through the sequence of photos in reverse. You move back into the quiet.
"Everyone is longing to be free, and everyone is curious about whether hope is still possible," Cole writes in his curatorial statement. "Through an intuitive sequence of photographs, in images soft and loud, this exhibition proposes a redefinition: that hope has nothing to do with mood or objective facts, but is rather a form of hospitality offered by those who are tired to those who are exhausted."
Cole, you may have guessed, is a writer. His 2011 novel "Open City" won wide acclaim, and he is currently Gore Vidal Professor of the Practice of Creative Writing at Harvard. He is also a photographer and writer on photography, most accessibly as photography critic for the New York Times Magazine. This failure of self-limitation is perhaps related to his upbringing. Cole, 44, was born in Michigan to Nigerian parents then raised in Lagos.
In an interview he said he jumped at the museum's invitation to take on this, his first major curatorial project. He studied the museum archive online and in person and came away with a set of some 150 photos that spoke to him and an arrangement that did likewise.
While apparently skipping some of the best-known of the museum's works, he did include pictures by many "name" photographers: Dawoud Bey, Robert Mapplethorpe, Diane Arbus, Andy Warhol, Sally Mann, Gordon Parks, much Dorothea Lange. But they are nothing like the entirety of the story. David Plowden's shots of lonely, mostly Midwestern roads set a tone here, as do Melissa Ann Pinney's looks at women on the precipice.
The title comes from what Cole calls "the old Negro spiritual" that "sought to link the black American freedom quest with the story of ancient Israel's struggle to be free of Pharaoh's bondage."
While many of the images are of African Americans, this is not a show about the black experience, like Arthur Jafa's wrenching short film "Love Is the Message, The Message Is Death," currently playing at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, or like Dawoud Bey's January selection of pictures from the Art Institute's collection meant to comment on "the black presence within ... the nation's social and physical landscape."
Instead, Cole said, he wanted to show that it was possible to "foreground blackness" without the exhibition being about blackness. In adopting the spiritual as his title, he explains in the exhibit's lovely accompanying book, "What appealed to me was this idea that struggles are interlinked ... If our freedoms are connected, then so are our confusions and hurts."
The museum calls the exhibition "a visual tone poem of contemporary America" that weaves past and present "suggesting an aesthetic approach to understanding the current psyche." Even as some of the images are from overseas -- like Gilles Peress' chilling 1972 shot of a presumed IRA operative in stocking mask in Derry, Ireland -- that seems a fair characterization.
In the book, also called "Go Down Moses," Cole, in an interview with MoCP Chief Curator Karen Irvine, says, "An exhibition is evanescent, like music is, and, like music, it is rhythmic. It unfolds in time, and through the viewer's individual progress it parcels out segments of time in an emotional way."
That's a fascinating way to think about what is, in prosaic terms, the act of hanging pictures on a wall. But the prosaic is not Cole's goal here, as he goads the viewer to think about the chaos of modernity, its connections to the chaos of the past, and the ways in which we find refuge from it.
"I don't want a show that can be too easily put into words; otherwise, I would just have written an essay," the curator tells Irvine. "I want it to be a show that's really felt in the body, and continues to resound long after it's been seen, long after the viewer has left the gallery."
"Go Down Moses" is through Sept. 29 at the Museum of Contemporary Photography at Columbia College Chicago, 600 S. Michigan Ave.; www.mocp.org

Food stamps vital to constant battle against hunger in US; Guest Columnist

Texto completo: President Trump's efforts to reduce the food stamp program for poor Americans harms the country. The Trump administration just announced plans that would end eligibility for food stamps to 3 million Americans living in hunger.
Food stamps (aka SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) is a valuable safety net that gives poor families extra purchasing power at grocery stores.
The nation's foodbank system, Feeding America, sent out a strong protest against Trump's move. A statement from the organization read "We know that SNAP is a lifeline for millions of Americans, so we must strongly oppose the administration's current effort to reduce eligibility for this assistance that helps put food on the table for so many people we serve."
Hearing from people who have used SNAP you realize it helps them get through difficult times of job loss, reduced income or medical traumas. SNAP prevents a family from going hungry during the darkest periods. Putting food on the table gives them hope and a chance to escape poverty.
We must also remember the history and purpose behind food stamps. During World War II food stamps were used to help hungry American families on the home front. This kept the nation strong.
Mary Hornaday of the Christian Science Monitor wrote in 1940 that food stamps "were being looked upon in official circles as an important adjunct of national defense." They turned out to be right as food stamps were continued at home even after America entered the war officially in 1941.
The New York Times cited a report stating "the development of the food stamp plan grew out of the search for more effective ways of expanding the domestic market for the American farmer and combating malnutrition among millions of American families."
During the food stamp expansion of World War II millions of American children also received free school lunches to combat hunger.
Today we see just the opposite. Feeding America says the Trump food stamp cuts "would also take free school meals away from hundreds of thousands of children whose enrollment is linked to their families' SNAP participation."
This is wrong. We should be fighting hunger together as a nation, not fighting the poor and hungry as Trump's policies are consistently doing.
We should be protecting the SNAP program from cuts. Reducing the program does not make hunger disappear in our country.
There are almost 40 million Americans living in hunger. We should be helping them escape hunger, not reducing programs that keep them afloat. Eliminating food stamps also puts huge pressure on food banks to make up the difference. Our food banks have a tough enough time keeping up with hunger without adding more burden to them.
Instead of food cuts, we should seek to expand assistance to impoverished Americans. Congress, for example, can pass summer feeding expansion to allow more impoverished children to get free meals during the summer.
It's about public health to keep children and their families well-nourished and eliminate hunger. If you want to improve America's health care system, try nutrition for all.
We should be protecting the SNAP program from cuts and working to prevent and eliminate hunger in our communities.

Targeting 2,100, ICE rounds up 35

Texto completo: An immigration enforcement operation that President Donald Trump called an effort to deport "millions" of immigrants from the USA resulted in 35 arrests, officials said Tuesday.
The action, dubbed "Operation Border Resolve" by the Trump administration, was touted as a significant show of force against an influx of Central American families crossing the border. The operation targeted 2,100 of the roughly 1 million people illegally in the USA with final deportation orders.
Of those arrested, 18 were members of families, and 17 were collateral apprehensions of people in the country illegally who were encountered by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. None of those arrests resulted in family separations, agency officials said.
The raids were condemned by Democrats and lauded by Republicans. Career ICE agents described them as a routine procedure, saying they expected to net an average of 10% to 20% of their targets.
"We are focused on criminals as much as we can before we do anything else," Trump said before the raids.
ICE conducted a separate nationwide enforcement operation targeting undocumented immigrants who had criminal convictions or charges. That netted 899 arrests from May 13 to July11, according to agency officials.
The agency issued 3,282 notices of inspection to businesses in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, telling business owners that their hiring records would be audited to see whether they employ undocumented immigrants.
This process, sometimes called "silent raids," is intended to "reduce economic opportunities" for undocumented immigrants, according to acting ICE Director Matthew Albence.
"We cannot have individuals who come into the country illegally and then go find work illegally," Albence told The New York Times.
Albence said the apprehension efforts would be "ongoing," claiming that increased enforcement could reduce illegal immigration. "Part of the way you stop people from coming is having a consequence to the illegal activity when you do come," he said.
The initial operation, scheduled for late June, targeted families and centered on those ordered to be deported by an immigration judge in 10 cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Miami and New York City.
That wave of raids was postponed after media outlets reported when and where they would take place.
The second effort started July 14, again receiving media attention noting when and where the raids would take place. Trump also called attention to the raids on Twitter, noting the date himself.
Immigration advocates braced their communities for the impending action, but elected officials and advocacy groups reported seeing little to no activity over the weekend.
Albence conceded that the number of arrests was lower compared with similar operations. An operation in 2017 resulted in 650 apprehensions over four days, according to ICE. Among those arrested were 73 family members and 120people who entered the country as children.
The success of previous efforts can partly be attributed to the lack of "fanfare and media attention," Albence said.

What's Behind All Those Hot Takes

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
What is a hot take? Per the New York Times Styles section, it is "a hastily assembled but perhaps heartfelt piece of incendiary opinionated content."
The desk recently assembled a list of 50 such scorchers in an interactive list: "The Summer's Hottest Takes."
"Fireworks are trash," reads one. "Ice cream is revolting," reads another.
The statements came from journalists throughout The Times's newsroom, and if you feel strongly about them, you can click one of two arrows next to each one: up for agree, down for disagree. When you do, things happen: Flames appear, sometimes a hot dog running on a treadmill in the corner offers commentary on your choice, and the opinions rise through the list based on the proportion of people who agree with them.
One motivation for the project was simply to test the voting feature. Bonnie Wertheim, a Styles editor, and Tracy Ma, the desk's visual editor, both worked on the project and sat down on Tuesday to talk about how and why it came together. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Tell me a little bit about how this came together. What was the genesis for it?
TRACY MA I had a dream of an article, like a beautifully written essay with paragraphs that you can rank to your liking.
By talking it through, it quickly became clear to us that the paragraphs can't be continuous thoughts because of the broken-up nature of it. And they had to be kind of succinct blocks that you can re-rank.
BONNIE WERTHEIM Ranking paragraphs would create an illogical series of paragraphs. But I like to think that what we published reads pretty logically because it's a list of thoughts that all fall under the umbrella of this season.
The way that we generated the takes was by creating a Slack room and just allowing conversations and threads to build, sort of as happens on Reddit. Except it lacked the feature that we needed to build, which was ranking the takes that got the most responses. So ones that people got excited about were the ones that had like 15 replies or so, and we culled from that channel the takes that seemed to excite the room most.
Can you tell me a little more about how you decided whom to solicit opinions from?
WERTHEIM The chat room had mostly people from our section of the newsroom.
MA Critics who are used to taking positions on things.
WERTHEIM And this isn't the first time that we've created an article or experience for our readers that draws opinions from across the company. So, we went with a few usual suspects from past round up-type coverage.
MA Can I ask you, I know you're the one asking questions, [to Bonnie Wertheim] how did you edit out the ones that you didn't like?
WERTHEIM The problem wasn't so much the bad, infuriating takes as the ones that were so boring and cold. So the ones that we picked, as I said before, were ones that generated the most discussion within our Slack group.
MA Or are just funny.
WERTHEIM Or were just funny.
What is this project exploring about our culture and the way that we live today?
WERTHEIM I don't know if everyone who worked on this would agree, but I see it as a piece of media criticism about the value of the take. Any of those takes on the list could have been fully written through opinion pieces if this were a different website, maybe. Or a few of them were takes that were written as articles essentially for The New York Times.
And I like that we as a group took a different tack. And instead of doing these piecemeal hot takes that certainly people would read and either agree with or disagree with or dismiss as, you know, beneath their intelligence level, instead, we made something that was fun and broke the usual article form and did not treat each of these opinions as if it needed 1,800 words to back it up.
Why does it look the way it does, with this hot dog doing what it's doing?
MA It's summer!
WERTHEIM The encasing is just a way of reinforcing the tone.
What is that tone?
WERTHEIM I think that the best way to describe the tone is irreverent, but the irreverence is just a product of what the heat does to people's brains. In the introduction, we mentioned a few studies on cognition, and the sort of takeaway was that people are more frustrated in the summer.
To me, those sort of summed up the reason for why people would think this way in the summer.
Why include buttons that let people vote?
MA Because either you agree or you disagree.
WERTHEIM This was conceived as many things, but one of them is as a piece of commentary. We are looking at the idea of a hot take and kind of twisting it and questioning its value and assessing other people's kind of appetite for it.
MA Which seems to be quite extreme. It's like if you give people buttons, they will smash it.
So by letting people vote, you're sort of drawing out that desire for people to impose their opinion on other people's opinions?
MA Yeah, make it so in front of them and easy that it also riles up whatever emotions they have.
Anything else that you want to say?
WERTHEIM There's a lot of bad news, and when we can be funny while maintaining, you know, some boundaries around what is allowed to be funny and what's not, I think it's O.K. to laugh a little bit.
The purpose of this is also just to have something fun and summery.
WERTHEIM Summery yet oppressive like summer.
How would you say that it is oppressive?
WERTHEIM I think looking at it makes you feel hot.
MA It frustrates you. Like there's a hot dog and the animation won't stop. And when I click on something it jitters. It frustrates you.

Madoff Asks Trump to Commute His Sentence

Texto completo: After Bernard L. Madoff admitted to masterminding the largest Ponzi scheme in history and bilking thousands of investors out of their cash, he was punished with a sentence that made it likely he would die in federal prison -- 150 years.
Now, a decade into his time, at the age of 81, Mr. Madoff is seeking to have his sentence commuted by President Trump. He has filed a petition for clemency with the Justice Department, according to their website.
It was not clear when Mr. Madoff filed his petition, or what arguments he is making for the request. The Justice Department declined to comment. The department's website said that information in its online clemency database was last updated on July 1, and that Mr. Madoff's request, which was first reported by CNBC, was still pending on that date.
Petitions for clemency, which include pardons and sentence commutations, are sent to the Office of the Pardon Attorney in the Justice Department. The office reviews petitions and makes recommendations on their merits to the president, who has constitutional authority to grant pardons and make final decisions on cases.
As president, Mr. Trump has increasingly wielded pardons as a way to push back against a justice system he frequently has called unfair. He has granted clemency to several prominent public figures whose politics resonate with him, like Joe Arpaio, a former sheriff in Arizona, and I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former aide to Dick Cheney.
It was not clear whether Mr. Trump would consider Mr. Madoff's application for clemency. The White House referred requests for comment to the Justice Department.
Years before he became president, Mr. Trump expressed contempt for Mr. Madoff in an interview with The New York Times Magazine in 2009.
Mr. Trump told The Times that he had met the notorious financier several times, both at Mar-a-Lago, the president's private, members-only resort in Palm Beach, Fla., and at Mr. Trump's nearby golf course.
At one point, Mr. Madoff, who once owned a waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, asked Mr. Trump to invest in his fund, Mr. Trump said.
"I said jokingly, 'No thanks, I can lose my own money,"' Mr. Trump said.
In 2008, in an interview with CNN, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Madoff as a "sleazebag" and "a total crook."
Mr. Madoff's former lawyer, Ira Lee Sorkin, who represented Mr. Madoff during his criminal case, said that he had no information about the clemency request. He did not know if another attorney had assisted Mr. Madoff with his petition.
Mr. Madoff has been incarcerated at a federal prison in Butner, N.C., since July 2009, after he pleaded guilty to 11 counts of financial crimes, including fraud, money laundering, perjury and theft. He received the maximum possible sentence.
He was accused of using his investment firm to steal billions from his clients, cheating many of them out of their life savings. Rather than investing their money, Mr. Madoff spent it on family and friends. He then took in money from additional investors to pay earlier ones and cover up his fraud.
In 2008, Mr. Madoff told his sons, both of whom have since died, that his investment advisory firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, had committed massive fraud. His family notified federal agents, who arrested him the next day.
Less than a year into his sentence, Mr. Madoff was moved to a low-security medical center at the prison complex, where he is currently located, according to online Bureau of Prisons records.
The Bureau of Prisons, cutting time off Mr. Madoff's sentence for good behavior, gave him a projected release date of Nov. 14, 2139, when he would be 201 years old.
Mr. Madoff was not the only one seeking clemency related to the fraud scheme at his investment firm.
His former secretary, Annette Bongiorno, who was sentenced to six years in prison on fraud charges, also filed a petition for clemency, according to the Justice Department's website.
Her lawyer, Roland G. Riopelle, said he did not have more information about Ms. Bongiorno's petition, but he noted that Ms. Bongiorno, 70, was moved to home confinement by the Bureau of Prisons in April.
She had previously asked a federal judge last year to move her into home confinement as permitted by the First Step Act, a criminal justice bill signed into law by President Trump in December.
The law allows certain offenders over 60, who are not considered a threat to others, to be released into home confinement if they have completed two-thirds of their sentence.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: It took just minutes for Robert Mueller's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee to turn into a painful exercise when it became clear the 74 year-old special counsel had difficulty handling the questions posed to him about his long, complex investigation into the Trump-Russia affair.
Mueller was slow to react to questions. He frequently asked for questions to be repeated. He sometimes appeared confused. He did not appear to be conversant with some issues in the investigation. He did not, or could not, put together detailed answers even to those questions he agreed to address.
Reporters who have covered Mueller for years saw differences from his appearances in the past. "I haven't seen a performance quite like this from Mueller," the New York Times' Noah Weiland said in an online discussion. "In 12 years as FBI director, he gave plenty of clipped responses. But more often than not he was more rhetorically agile than anyone on the committees that were questioning him. And there was rarely a time when he even paused for a second after a question was asked. There was little searching in his eyes for answers. He rarely looked at notes."
[Read: Mueller unfamiliar with key parts of own report]
That was the Mueller of years ago. On Wednesday, Mueller seemed incapable of engaging fully with the questions that were presented to him.
"This is delicate to say, but Mueller, whom I deeply respect, has not publicly testified before Congress in at least six years. And he does not appear as sharp as he was then."
Mueller's performance raised questions that reached far beyond one appearance before one committee. It called into doubt the degree to which Mueller was in charge of the entire special counsel investigation.
"You wonder how much of this was affecting the investigation," one Republican member of the House said as he watched Mueller's testimony. "It sheds a lot of light on what happened the last two years. He wasn't in charge."
If Mueller was not fully in charge, that would direct attention to the staff he assembled for the investigation — staff that President Trump has often derided as "17 angry Democrats." Some of Mueller's aides were Democratic donors, and a key aide, Andrew Weissmann, famously attended Hillary Clinton's 2016 election night event that was planned as a victory party. It seems likely that Republicans will direct new attention to them in light of Mueller's appearance.
No one noticed Mueller's performance that more than the centerpiece of the investigation, the president himself. "This has been a disaster for the Democrats and a disaster for the reputation of Robert Mueller," the president tweeted — not his own words, but those of Fox News anchor Chris Wallace during a break in the testimony.
During that commentary, Wallace said Mueller "has seemed very uncertain with his brief. He doesn't seem to know things that are in the report ... I think it does raise questions about the degree to which he actually was in charge and control of this [investigation]."

Biden and Sanders, behaving badly

Texto completo: Health care was a key factor in Democrats' victory in the 2018 midterm elections, and it should be a big plus in 2020 as well. The shared Democratic position - that every legal resident should have access to affordable care, regardless of income or health status - is immensely popular. The de facto Republican position - that we should go back to a situation in which those whose jobs don't come with health benefits, or who suffer from preexisting medical conditions, can't get insurance - is so unpopular that GOP candidates consistently lie about their own proposals.
But right now, two of the major contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, are having an ugly argument about health care that could hurt the party's chances. There are real, important differences between the two men's policy proposals, and it's fine to point that out. What's not fine is the name-calling and false assertions. Both men are behaving badly. And for their party's sake, and their country's, they need to stop it.
Let's back up. There are, broadly speaking, two ways a country can try to achieve universal health insurance. One is single-payer: The government simply pays the bills. The other retains a role for private insurance but relies on a combination of regulations and subsidies to ensure that everyone gets covered.
We don't have to speculate about how these systems would work in practice because every advanced country except the U.S. has some form of universal coverage. Some, like Canada and Britain, use single-payer (in Britain the government also operates the hospitals and pays the doctors). Others, like Switzerland and the Netherlands, have a large role for private insurers.
The clean little secret of health care is that both approaches work when countries try to make them work. In fact, we can see both systems at work right here in America.
More than 100 million Americans are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, which are both single-payer programs; despite Ronald Reagan's ominous warnings back in 1961, neither destroyed American freedom. Since 2014, millions more have been covered by the Affordable Care Act, which was underfunded and has been subject to extensive Republican sabotage; nonetheless, states like California that have tried to make the act work have experienced huge declines in the number of residents without insurance.
Which brings us back to the Democratic quarrel.
Sanders, of course, has made "Medicare for All" his signature proposal. Could such a plan work? Absolutely. But there are two valid criticisms of his proposal.
First, it would have to be paid for with higher taxes. While many people would find the increased tax burden offset by lower premiums, the required tax increases would be daunting. And while Sanders has in fact proposed a number of new taxes, independent estimates say that the revenue they'd generate would fall far short of what his plan would cost.
Second, the Sanders plan would require that roughly 180 million Americans give up their current private insurance and replace it with something different. Convincing them that this would be an improvement, even if true, would be a tall order. Indeed, there's good reason to believe that eliminating the option of retaining private insurance would be an electoral loser. (Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, take heed.)
On the other side, Biden is proposing to build on Obamacare. That can sound like tinkering at the edges. But his actual plan is much bigger and better than is widely realized, with large increases in funding, a public option and more. It would, arguably, bring the ACA close to the standards of successful European systems.
That said, the Biden plan would preserve the crazy-quilt, Rube Goldberg aspects of our current system, which impose a lot of unnecessary costs and make it too easy for people to fall through the cracks.
So there's plenty of room for a good-faith Sanders-Biden argument. Unfortunately, that's not the argument they're having.
Instead, Sanders is arguing that only single-payer can purge "corporate greed" from the system - an assertion belied by European experience - and broadly hinting that Biden is in the pocket of corporate interests. That's a criticism you can level about some of Biden's past policy positions, like his advocacy of the 2005 bankruptcy law. But it's not a fair criticism of a health plan that's actually pretty good and which most people would have considered radical just a few years ago.
For his part, Biden is declaring that the Sanders plan would undermine Medicare. In fact, it would enhance current recipients' benefits. And it's a bad sign that Biden, who poses as Obamacare's great defender, is using a GOP scare tactic familiar from the utterly dishonest campaign against the ACA. No Democrat should be stooping to that level.
Unfortunately, Biden and Sanders will be appearing on different nights during the next Democratic debates. So it will be up to other candidates, or the moderators, to put them on the spot. It's time for both men to stop poisoning their own party's well.

India launches moon mission on second try

Texto completo: SATISH DHAWAN SPACE CENTER, India - India is on its way to the moon.
One week after a first attempt was canceled at the last minute, the Chandrayaan-2 mission blasted off at 2:43 p.m. Monday from the Satish Dhawan Space Center on India's southeast coast, carrying an uncrewed lunar lander and the dreams of a nation.
The 142-foot, 700-ton rocket rose on a funnel of fire, ripping through the air perfectly straight and surprisingly fast before vanishing into a thick bank of clouds.
A roaring thunder echoed across the sky.
"The mission has been successfully accomplished!" blared a message from loudspeakers at mission control.
If the rest of the mission goes as well, India will become the fourth nation - after the United States, Russia and China - to land on the moon, more than 200,000 miles away. Its target is a region near the mysterious south pole, where no other missions have explored.
This would be a huge leap forward for India's ambitious space program, and scientists and defense experts everywhere are watching to see whether the country can pull it off.
So are countless Indians. There are few things as unifying for a nation as a successful space program, and over the past few weeks Chandrayaan-2 posters have popped up everywhere and schoolchildren have been hunched over mini-Chandrayaans made from empty plastic bottles, learning the physics of rocketry.
The mission includes four components: a giant Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-Mark HI rocket (though it is much shorter and lighter than the Saturn V rocket that lifted the Apollo missions); an orbiter; a lander; and a six-wheeled rover.
The purpose is to probe the south pole of the moon for the possibility of water ice and to study deposits of helium-3, believed to be a future energy source for Earth.
Indian officials say their new generation of sensors, cameras and other equipment could lead to scientific breakthroughs more than 50 years after the first manned mission to the moon.
"Every Indian is immensely proud today!" the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said on Twitter. "Indian at heart, Indian in spirit!"
The mission was relatively inexpensive in space terms, costing less than S150 mill on - less than it cost to make the 2014 film "Interstellar."
But Chandrayaan-2 will take until September to reach the moon, much longer than the relatively straight shot made by the Apollo missions, which cost billions (the presence of humans added to the price tag).
The Indian orbiter will conserve fuel by making ever-widening orbits around Earth before being captured by the moon's gravity and pulled into lunar orbit.
The big moment should come in early September. That is when the lander is expected to break off from the orbiter and gently land on the moon's surface. The lander will essentially be on autopilot, and a computer will be in charge of firing the various thrusters and steering the lander safely down.

Este reporte corresponde únicamente a una semana de operaciones y no se mezcla con datos de otros operativos, ya que el director de la agencia, Matthew Albence , dijo a The New York Times, que en los últimos meses ha habido cientos de capturas.
El presidente Trump anunció la operación antes de que realmente sucediera, lo que podría haber dado a las personas el tiempo suficiente para abandonar sus hogares para evadir el arresto, y les dio a los defensores tiempo para informar a las familias sobre sus derechos.

Texto completo: Here are what a few Mainers were doing or thinking during an historic summer 50 years ago.
Susanne MacArthur sat on her living room couch late on the night of July 20, 1969, and hoped that her 18-day-old son would wake up. When he did, she told him they were witnessing history.
“I was aware that this was about as big an event as had ever happened,” said MacArthur, 72, of South Portland. “Now I tell my grandchildren, ‘Your dad and I watched the moon landing.’ It made me feel like the impossible was attainable.”
The 50th anniversary of man’s first steps on the moon was Saturday, and Aug. 15 will mark a half-century since the cultural phenomenon that was Woodstock. Both events were among a summer of historic happenings in 1969, which continue to impact and inspire people today.
The moon walk by astronaut Neil Armstrong fulfilled a pledge by President John F. Kennedy just eight years earlier and became a symbol of American innovation and determination, setting the stage for an era of lightning-fast technological advances.
Woodstock was supposed to be a pop music festival with an audience of 50,000 but drew 400,000 young people who largely shared anti-war and anti-establishment sentiments. Concert-goers who slept on muddy hillsides, shared food and water with strangers and were not afraid to openly smoke marijuana became part of a generation-defining moment.
Other culture-shifting events during the summer of 1969 included a gathering storm of Vietnam War protests and the Stonewall Riots in New York City, which kicked off the LGBTQ civil rights movement that continues today.
All those happenings helped define and propel the Baby Boomers, who were roughly between age 6 and 23 in 1969 and who as an outsize generation would go on to have a massive influence on U.S. and world history for the 50 years that followed.
Here are the stories of some Mainers and their experiences during that extraordinary summer.
Steve Romanoff was at Woodstock, sort of. A founder of two Maine folk bands, Devonsquare and Schooner Fare, Romanoff was at a party in Portland when he and a friend decided they should go to the much-anticipated music festival, happening the next day.
So they got in a Chevrolet Corvair and drove all night to the concert site in Bethel, New York. They arrived around 9:30 a.m. and saw people and cars everywhere. They left their car on the roadside and walked “toward the sound of the festival.” Romanoff and his friend soon realized they had little money, no food, no change of clothes and no sleeping bags. They looked at the crowds of people already wallowing in mud and rain and decided to go home.
“We looked at each other and said, ‘this is stupid.’ Ten hours after we left, we were back in Maine,” said Romanoff, 72, of Falmouth.
CURIOUS COPS, COMMON BONDS Craig Brown was 16 when he left his home in Cape Elizabeth one day in mid-August of 1969, telling his mother he was going camping with friends in New Hampshire. But he was headed to Woodstock, on a farm in upstate New York, piling into a van with friends. Brown was a big music fan, and the chance to see a couple dozen mega-stars — including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young — all in one place excited him. Music festivals that attract hundreds of thousands of people are commonplace today, but in 1969 they were unheard of.
Because of a massive traffic standstill, Brown and his friends ended up ditching the van and walking 6 miles to the concert site. Heavy rain meant that they slept under soggy blankets on the ground, and the massive crowd meant that food vendors quickly had nothing to sell and bathrooms were nearly impossible to find. The event, in Brown’s mind, was a symbol of his generation’s struggles and common bonds. It was filled with young men who either were draft age or approaching it, and anti-Vietnam War sentiment was high.
Woodstock was also a moment when marijuana began to go mainstream, being used publicly by thousands of people. In its stories on Woodstock, The New York Times felt compelled to explain the terms “grass” and “stoned” for readers unfamiliar with them. But Brown and his friends needed no explanation. They were stopped by police on the way home, about 20 miles from Woodstock. The officers took the pot from their van and brought them into the police station. “They mostly wanted to hear whether we saw naked women,” he said. The police gave Brown and his buddies a case of beer to drink and eventually sent them on their way.
Brown, 66, lives in Cape Elizabeth and has spent his career in politics and public affairs, working as a community organizer and political consultant as well as running campaigns. He was chief of staff for Tom Andrews, congressman from Maine’s 1st District in the 1990s. He now runs Common Dreams, a progressive news website based in Maine. Feeling part of an empowered and politically active generation, something he felt strongly at Woodstock, helped fuel his life’s work.
“Conditions were bad, but people were taking care of each other and sharing whatever they had, and there was really no anger. There was this feeling of we’re all in this together,” Brown said of Woodstock. “I think for a lot of us who felt the same way, being against the war, it was a very empowering event.”
Split attention Author Stephen King was working at the University of Maine library in the summer of 1969 and remembers watching the moon landing on a small black-and-white TV atop a refrigerator in an Orono boarding house. Or at least he tried to. A fellow resident named Grover, a retired railroad worker, sat next to King and tried to divert his attention from the historic broadcast. Grover badgered King to look at his fishing scrapbook as Apollo 11 was about to touch down.
“I divided my attention between the first men landing on the moon and a series of old photographs, including one of Grover and a prize-winning salmon in the Bangor Daily News. It was (expletive) surreal,” King, 71, wrote in an email to the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram.
Lunar learning Jim Harmon was 9 years old and decided to watch the moon landing only after his older brother explained to him that it was a big deal. Harmon, who grew up in Windham, knew little about the mission or its significance. He had heard little about it in school.
But soon after watching it, he began launching model rockets in the backyard with his brother and wondering when more people might head to the moon. A few years later, he built a walking-talking robot for a school science fair. Today, he’s a science teacher at Deering High School in Portland and works part time at the University of Southern Maine’s Southworth Planetarium.
“I have to give my brother credit for getting me to watch,” said Harmon, 59, of Scarborough. “I do believe it helped lead me to a career in science.”

Texto completo: For more than two years, Netflix faced a backlash for including a graphic suicide scene in the first season of its hit show "13 Reasons Why," concerns that the teen drama's contents may be harmful to young audiences. On Tuesday, the show said the scene had been deleted.
"We believe this edit will help the show do the most good for the most people while mitigating any risk for especially vulnerable young viewers," creator Brian Yorkey said in a statement.
"13 Reasons Why" is based on the young-adult novel by Jay Asher.
The decision was made in part because of feedback from experts such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Concerns included that aspects of the show glamorized suicide and could contribute to the suicide contagion effect. A study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health suggested the show was linked to a 28.9% increase in suicide rates among people in the U.S. ages 10 to 17 in the month after the first episode. (Washington Post)
Collegians, take note: "Pearson will shift its U.S. textbook publishing program to a digital first model, effectively killing future print editions of its college textbooks," Publishers Weekly reports. "All future releases of Pearson's 1,500 current U.S. textbook titles will be updated in digital versions only rather than in print."
An acclaimed writing program for some women prisoners in Connecticut, led by bestselling author Wally Lamb, has been suspended by the state after efforts to publish their work broke down amid disputes over payment and charges of bullying. The anthology - "You Don't Know Me: The Incarcerated Women of York Prison Voice Their Truths," the third collaboration - had been set for release in October. (Hartford Courant via Publishers Weekly)
The New Republic magazine published, and then removed from its site, a very personal, homophobic hit piece on Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential hopeful. The piece was by Dale Peck, who won the prestigious Lambda Literary Award for LGBT Children's/Young Adult lit for his book "Sprout."
Obituaries: Lucette Matalon Lagnado, who won the $100,000 Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature for "The Man in the White Sharkskin Suit" - her 2007 memoir of her family's Egyptian-Jewish past - was 63. (Shelf Awareness)

New and recent
"Beyond Charlottesville: Taking a Stand Against White Nationalism" by former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, is due in paperback at the end of July. McAuliffe was in office in August 2017 when a white nationalist rally and counterprotest in Charlottesville culminated in violence and the death of a counter-protester. The book - whose foreword he wrote with civil rights icon John Lewis - looks at the roots and events of that weekend, as well as what followed, and proposes remedies. (Thomas Dunne, 192 pp.)
"Trouble So Hard: Labor and Life in the African-American Community, Edenton, North Carolina, 1870-1900," by Audrey Jean Sapp Childs. Childs, a descendant of two enslaved people who married in 1831 and eventually were free, acknowledges the contributions of the everyday black workers who helped build Edenton, beyond the famous names of Harriet Jacobs and Golden Frinks. (Heritage, 220 pp.)
"Conviction," by Denise Mina, Scottish crime novelist. Recommended by The New York Times: "Anna McDonald, at loose ends while her philandering husband takes their children on vacation, decides to clear an old friend's name after hearing him slandered on a true-crime podcast." The reviewer calls the mystery "endlessly surprising" and said it "seems to have been written in a white-hot rage." (Mulholland, 384 pp.)

Texto completo: When astronaut Neil Armstrong emerged from the spindly lunar module Eagle onto the craggy surface of the moon, he united a bitterly divided nation in a brief moment of national pride and wonder. After years of Vietnam protests, political assassinations and urban race riots, an astonishing 94% of all American households stayed up into the late night of July 20, 1969, to watch the miracle of Apollo 11 unfold on live TV.
"That's one small step for man, and one giant leap for mankind," Armstrong radioed once his boots touched the ground. Then he and Buzz Aldrin gathered rock samples, hopped in lunar gravity and erected a camera that captured the iconic image of Aldrin saluting an American flag they fumblingly planted into the gray moonscape. Yet soon enough, moon and space station missions became routine, and public indifference and second-guessing set in. So 50 years later, what are we to make of those hazy hours of glory?
In his meticulously researched and absorbingly written book, "One Giant Leap: The Impossible Mission That Flew Us to the Moon," journalist Charles Fishman provides both a celebration of the Apollo 11 mission and a corrective to some of the myths that have crystallized around it. The first involves the role of President John F. Kennedy. True, Fishman documents, it was Kennedy who in 1961 announced the goal of putting a man on the moon "before this decade is out," and who served as "our poet of space, and also our philosopher of space" in public. "We choose to go to the moon, in this decade, and do other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard," Kennedy famously declared in September 1962 at Rice University, after visiting the construction site of a new NASA center in Houston.
But Fishman argues that it was all about macho Cold War politics for Kennedy, after the Soviets took the lead in sending rockets, men and dogs into space. Privately, Kennedy cooled on the project after superpower tensions eased in the wake of the Cuban missile crisis that October, and he might have dialed it back, Fishman suggests, had he lived. ("I'm not that interested in space," an exasperated Kennedy blurted to NASA chief James Webb when Webb wouldn't guarantee that $400 million could ensure a victory in the race to the moon.) Only after Kennedy's assassination did Lyndon Johnson double down on the Apollo program, and Jackie Kennedy tie her husband's name to space travel for posterity by lobbying to have the space center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., named after him.
After all the movies and memoirs focused on astronauts, Fishman skips retelling the personal stories of Armstrong, Aldrin and Michael Collins, the third Apollo 11 crew member who manned the Columbia command module. Instead, he introduces us to the scientists and engineers who made it all possible.
Charles "Doc" Draper was the bow-tie-wearing ballroom-dance enthusiast who headed the MIT Instrumentation Lab, which designed the internal navigation system that allowed Apollo modules to all but pilot themselves once in flight. Bill Tindall was the talented writer and orbital mechanics "genius" from the old NASA headquarters in Langley, Va., who rode herd over the MIT scientists with more than 1,000 "Tindallgrams" in six years, mixing witty cheerleading with relentless flyspecking.
Most memorable of all, John Houbolt was the quiet, middle-aged, midlevel NASA engineer who dared to pester his superiors with long, single-spaced letters advocating a "lunar-orbit rendezvous" - a "lunar ferry," as The New York Times first described it, that would detach as it neared the moon, then link back up with the command module for the trip home.
In making his case, the lowly Houbolt was taking on the "Earth-orbit rendezvous" scenarios originally advanced by the cocky Saturn booster rocket team led by the legendary Wernher von Braun. The von Braun design, Fishman writes, "kept the astronauts close to home, so if something went wrong with the rendezvous, they could simply fire their retrorockets and return to Earth."
But in a meeting at the Saturn headquarters in Huntsville, Ala., in June 1962, von Braun suddenly threw his weight behind the LOR plan. Seven years later, Houbolt was invited to sit alongside von Braun in NASA's VIP viewing room. When Armstrong reported that "the Eagle has landed," von Braun turned to Houbolt. "John, it worked beautifully," he said.
To the criticism that the Apollo program was a "moondoggle" (in the words of sociologist Amitai Etzioni) and a waste of billions of dollars that could have been better spent addressing social ills at home, Fishman offers a persuasive defense. Not only did space contracts with Grumman, General Motors and other companies account for hundreds of thousands of jobs across all 50 states, but for almost a decade, NASA and its contractors, along with the Pentagon team building the Polaris missile, were virtually the only buyers for Fairchild Semiconductor's integrated circuits, perfecting and driving down the price of the chips that now power everything from our laptops and smartphones to kitchen appliances and electronic cars. "No, Apollo didn't usher in the Space Age, but it did usher in the Digital Age," Fishman concludes.
In his final chapter, Fishman riffs on the can-do "spirit of America" that the Apollo program came to symbolize, captured in the phrase: "If we can send a man to the moon, then why can't we (fill in the blank)."
But Fishman rescues what could have come across as an outdated paean to American exceptionalism with a crucial caveat. "We have to be asked" if we are to accomplish hard and great things again, he writes. "We have to be rallied to the cause." In this most fractious era since the 1960s, one finishes this book wondering: Will we ever again find missions that unite and inspire us as a nation, and leaders with the vision and magnetism to point the way?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- For more than two years, Democrats have hoped that Robert S. Mueller III would show the nation that President Trump is unfit for office -- or at the very least, severely damage his re-election prospects. On Wednesday, in back-to-back hearings with the former special counsel, that wish could face its final make-or-break moment.
Lawmakers choreographing the hearings before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees warn that bombshell disclosures are unlikely. But over about five hours of nationally televised testimony, they hope to use Mr. Mueller, the enigmatic and widely respected former F.B.I. director, to refashion his legalistic 448-page report into a vivid, compelling narrative of Russia's attempts to undermine American democracy, the Trump campaign's willingness to accept Kremlin assistance and the president's repeated and legally dubious efforts to thwart investigators.
For a party divided over how to confront Mr. Trump -- liberals versus moderates, supporters of impeachment versus staunch opponents -- the stakes could scarcely be higher.
"One way or the other, the Mueller hearing will be a turning point with respect to the effort to hold Donald Trump accountable for his reckless, degenerate, aberrant and possibly criminal behavior," said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House Democratic Caucus chairman and a member of the Judiciary Committee. "After the hearing, we will be able to have a better understanding of the pathway forward concerning our oversight responsibilities and the constitutional tools that are available to us."
Partisans in both parties may already have made up their minds, but Democrats are counting on Mr. Mueller's testimony to focus the broader public's attention on the findings of his 22-month investigation -- either to jumpstart a stalled impeachment push or electrify the campaign to make Mr. Trump a one-term president.
Even Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been a voice of caution on impeachment for much of the year, has tied the testimony to Democrats' broader political prospects.
"This coming election, it is really an election that the fate of this country is riding on," she told House Democrats at a private meeting recently, according to an aide who was there. "This presidency is an existential threat to our democracy and our country as we know it."
Democratic hopes are rising on an unlikely horse. Mr. Mueller has made his reluctance to testify widely known, and his appearance could easily backfire. If the hearings fail to sizzle, the viewing public could be left agreeing with the president that it is time to move on.
"A lot of public attitudes have hardened on the subject of Trump and Russia," said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. "So I'm realistic about the impact of any one hearing on public attitudes."
No matter what happens, House investigators say their inquiries into possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump and other accusations of administration malfeasance will go on, and those inquiries could yet inflict political damage on the president's re-election prospects or even re-energize impeachment talk.
But perhaps no other witness can command the authority of Mr. Mueller, who conducted his work in silence, above the political maw of Washington, and delivered it this spring with a modicum of words and drama.
Mr. Mueller is unlikely to level new charges on Wednesday against the president. Unlike Leon Jaworski, the Watergate prosecutor who persuaded a grand jury to name President Richard M. Nixon as an unindicted co-conspirator, or Ken Starr, the independent counsel who made a convincing case for President Bill Clinton's impeachment, Mr. Mueller has left a more ambiguous trail.
His report detailed dozens of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, painting a portrait of a campaign willing to accept foreign assistance. But it did not find enough evidence to charge anyone with conspiring with the Russians. And though Mr. Mueller pointedly declined to exonerate Mr. Trump from obstructing his investigation, he took the view that Justice Department policies prevented him from even considering whether to charge.
Mr. Mueller, 74, is unlikely to change course now -- particularly after he used his lone public appearance in May to clarify that any testimony he delivered would not stray from his report.
"We go in eyes wide open," said Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. "His style under the most effusive of circumstances is almost monosyllabic."
Knowing that Mr. Mueller is unlikely to take the bait on more explosive questions, Democrats see their role as coaxing him through some of the most damaging passages of his report.
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee will have the first opportunity, and they intend to dwell heavily on five of the most glaring episodes of possible obstruction of justice that Mr. Mueller documented in the second volume of his report. They include Mr. Trump's direction to the former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II to fire Mr. Mueller and then publicly lie about it; his request that Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign chief, ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reassert control of the investigation and limit its scope; and possible witness tampering to discourage two aides, Paul Manafort and Michael D. Cohen, from cooperating with investigators.
Many lawmakers, including Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, view the behavior in at least some of those episodes as reaching the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors, established in the Constitution as grounds for impeachment. They will try to solicit Mr. Mueller's views -- tacitly or explicitly.
"The overwhelming majority of the American people are unfamiliar with the principal conclusions of the Mueller report, so that will be a starting point," Mr. Jeffries said. "To the extent that Bob Mueller can explain his conclusions, particularly as it relates to possible criminal culpability of the president, that will be compelling information."
Democrats on the Intelligence Committee will use the second hearing to highlight evidence from the report's first volume about Russia's social media disinformation and hacking operations during the 2016 campaign and high-profile contacts between Trump associates and Russians offering assistance to Mr. Trump's presidential campaign.
Republicans are expressing little concern about the Democrats' strategy. Mr. Mueller's style and his prosecutorial conclusions will "blow up in their face," said Representative Steve Chabot, Republican of Ohio, who helped prosecute the impeachment case against Mr. Clinton.
"Back then, Starr came out pretty clearly and said that he felt there were impeachable offenses that had been committed," Mr. Chabot said. "Now we have a special counsel who, at this point, is saying no. We invested so much time and money and taxpayer dollars in this that we should give considerable weight in that."
Time is not on the side of impeachment advocates. Congress's six-week August recess is at hand. A fiscal deadline is likely to dominate Congress when it returns, and with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3, the nation's attention is likely to shift toward the 2020 presidential campaign. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that support for opening impeachment hearings based on current evidence had dropped among registered voters from June to July, to just 21 percent. Fifty percent said it was time for the country to move on.
Support in the House is somewhat higher and continues to grow with every fresh outrage Mr. Trump provides the Democrats, including an across-the-board refusal to comply with the House's investigations and comments that four liberal congresswomen of color should "go back" to their own countries. A handful of House Democrats this week announced their support for impeachment, pushing the total toward 90, according to a New York Times tally.
And Mr. Nadler formally acknowledged for the first time this month that impeachment articles were "under consideration as part of the committee's investigation, although no final determination has been made."
But the announced support is still far short of the 218 needed to impeach the president and send charges to the Senate for a trial, and moderate Democrats from Republican-leaning districts have quietly fumed at the position they are being put in.
As the most powerful Democrat against impeachment, Ms. Pelosi fears an attempt to oust Mr. Trump would backfire on Democrats and further divide the country unless her party can build broader support. She has counseled lawmakers "to have a level of calmness, no drama" about the questioning at the Mueller hearing, according to a senior aide, and she and her deputies will be watching how or if public sentiment shifts after Wednesday.
No need to "hype it," she has advised -- Mr. Mueller's words will carry power.

Texto completo: Two culinary celebrities with strong ties to the Bay Area are among the list of "20 Power Players of Food Media," as determined by The Hollywood Reporter.
Guy Fieri, dubbed by THR as "The Culinary Populist," and Samin Nosrat, called "The Next Big Thing," both made the list, which spotlights food media's "most significant creators, execs and icons."
Of Fieri, a Santa Rosa resident, THR wrote, "No matter what you think of his platinum-blond tips or trips to Flavortown,' Fieri, 51, has a golden touch. He has three Food Network shows, reaching more than 15 million adults 25-to-54 in the first quarter.
"Heading into its 30th season, the flagship Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives' or triple D,' as he refers to it has been the most impactful, in ratings and for the eateries featured (which see a post-airing visitor bump even in reruns). Though a scathing New York Times review of his shuttered Times Square restaurant generated plenty of social media attention, Fieri has 70 restaurants in the U.S."
Nosrat, who attended UC Berkeley and became a cook at Alice Waters' fabled Chez Panisse restaurant, published a bestselling cookbook, "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat," in 2017. The accompanying 2018 Netflix show made her "a culinary rock star."
The THR piece goes on to point out: "In a bidding war, Random House acquired her book follow-up (What to Eat'), and Netflix is awaiting her pitch for a second series. (Nosrat jokes that the working title is Carbs of the World.') And while Netflix won't reveal audience stats, anecdotal evidence of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat's' success is formidable. Unscripted producers and executives are near-unanimous in their praise of the project, part elemental cooking tutorial and part travelogue, as the newest high bar in the genre."
Of her TV fame, Nosrat tells THR, "I'm still wrapping my mind around the fact that if I say something is yummy, everyone wants it. It's about harnessing that power for good."
Also making the list were Tom Colicchio and Padma Lakshmi, who gained fame via Bravo's "Top Chef." They are frequent Bay Area visitors, and Colicchio is one of the celebrity chefs who will appear at the Gilroy Garlic Festival next weekend.
Among others on the THR list: Jose Andres, Alton Brown, David Chang, Bobby Flay, Ina Garten, Carla Hall, Nigella Lawson, Gordon Ramsay and Rachael Ray.

The news avoiders have opted out

Texto completo: NPR in May changed the long-familiar theme music to its “Morning Edition” newscast.
After 40 years of hearing B.J. Leiderman’s original score every weekday, you were either sick of it, or, for sticks in the mud such as yours truly, flummoxed at the very idea of messing with a good thing.
But I’ll get over it. Especially ‘cause the new, poppy, synthy thing is just a rewrite of the old tune anyway. Same chord progression; a few tweaks.
The reason for the move by the public radio commissars in D.C.?
It was, as Josh Benton wrote for Nieman Lab, “for the kids.”
Meaning, trying to get a few listeners under 60 to listen to the show.
The New York Times wrote: “The new theme is intended to attract a younger and more diverse audience, while also aligning with the evolution of ‘Morning Edition’ into a newsier program, said Kenya Young, the executive producer. ‘I wanted a sound and a mood and a tone and a feel and a vibe all mixed in one,’ she said.”
Actual young people seem to consume as much radio news as they do daily print newspapers. Meaning, none. The only reason I know at least one 20something has ever listened to a second of NPR is that Clementine Creevy’s great L.A. rock band Cherry Glazerr takes its name from KCRW’s morning host Chery Glaser, who Clem used to hear in her parents’ car as they drove her to school.
So where do young people get their news? I know, I know, Instagram, fool.
But it’s not just Millennials who don’t follow the old-fashioned definition of what’s going on in the world. Academics who study the subject say that, at a time when it is far easier than ever to get an enormous amount of information about everything by clicking on the screen of that telephone in your pocket, many are simply opting out.
Josh Benton, again, for Nieman: “News, you may have noticed, isn’t that great at generating happiness these days. So lots of people are happy to stick to Keanu and avoid Trump/Iran/Putin/climate change/mass shootings/Brexit/racism entirely.”
Yes, of course, there have been plenty of times as terrifying as these, and people still followed — hungered for — the news. When the Third Reich was bombing London and on the brink of ruling Europe, that didn’t stop people from listening to Edward Murrow broadcasting from the rooftops. So mere logic won’t do here. Something else is going on.
As someone who learned to read at age 4 out of fascination with the morning newspaper, and haven’t stopped since, it doesn’t matter that this makes no sense to me. It’s a thing. Benton cites data from Digital News Report: “In 2017, 29 percent of those surveyed worldwide said they ‘often or sometimes avoid the news,’ including 38 percent in the United States and 24 percent in the U.K. By 2019, those numbers had increased to 32 percent worldwide (+3), 41 percent in the U.S. (+3) and 35 percent in the U.K. (+11). (Even the Japanese — the world’s most devoted news consumers — saw news avoidance increase from 6 to 11 percent.)”
Harshing their vibe is the major reason for news avoidance, 57 percent of the avoiders said: “It can have a negative effect on my mood.”
Second, yes, is the more than a third of us who have concocted a conspiracy theory about the press: “I can’t rely on news to be true,” say 35 percent. You want real untruthiness? Try the internet.
“I haven’t read a newspaper in years,” said one respondent. “It was all too depressing.”
I hear you, dude. But you want real depressing? Try a future in which the creeps and crooks we report on win the day because you decided to just tune out.

Texto completo: Un juez federal se mostró dispuesto a aprobar un acuerdo preliminar presentado este viernes por el que la cadena de hospedaje Motel 6 pagará 10 millones de dólares, y que sería el punto final de una querella interpuesta tras descubrirse que se compartía información de huéspedes con ICE .
El juez David Campbell señaló a los abogados de ambas partes que una vez se entregue la documentación requerida para finales de este mes no tendría objeciones en aprobar el acuerdo preliminar, que eleva la cifra previa de 7.6 millones alcanzado entre la organización civil MALDEF y la cadena, y que la Fiscalía había considerado insuficiente.
“Este acuerdo es una gran victoria para nuestra comunidad, envía un fuerte mensaje: Motel 6 violó los derechos de cientos de personas compartiendo su información con ICE ” (Inmigración y Control de Aduanas), dijo a Efe Thomas Saenz, presidente del Fondo Mexicano Estadounidense para la Defensa Legal (MALDEF).
La compensación monetaria en esta demanda colectiva, en la que se denunció que empleados de la cadena entregaban información de los huéspedes a ICE, dependerá de si los afectados fueron cuestionados, arrestados o inclusive deportados. También si tenían hijos menores o familiares que fueron afectados por su detención.
Como parte de este nuevo acuerdo se eleva la compensación monetaria para aquellos que fueron víctimas de esta práctica, y en todos los hoteles de la cadena en Arizona y no solo unos cuantos que fueron mencionados en el primer acuerdo.
Aquellos cuyo nombre fue entregado a ICE en 2017 cuando se hospedaron en Motel 6, recibirán ahora 75 dólares, 25 dólares más que los mencionados en el acuerdo original.
La compensación no excederá los 200,000 dólares por persona .
También se modifico la cantidad que serán otorgadas de este acuerdo a organizaciones que luchan en favor de los migrantes.
Según escritos judiciales, los empleados de Motel 6 entregaban información privada a ICE de aquellos que se registraban utilizando matriculas consulares, pasaportes o identificaciones extranjeras.
Los abogados estiman que el número de víctimas se podría incrementar hasta 50,000 .
Saenz indicó que a partir de agosto comenzará un periodo de gracia donde aquellos que no estén conformes con este nuevo acuerdo podrán apelar, y quienes consideren que fueron víctimas de Motel 6 también se podrían agregar a la demanda.
Por su parte, la oficina del Fiscal del Estado de Arizona, Mark Brnovich dijo a Efe que revisaran el nuevo acuerdo.
El pasado mes de mayo, Brnovich pidió a la corte rechazar el primer acuerdo debido a que lo consideraba injusto para las víctimas, porque iban a recibir muy poco dinero.

What's on TV
FIRST MAN (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. While this Oscar-winning drama about Neil Armstrong touches on the space race and the political issues the moon landing raised at home, it focuses on the personal and professional setbacks Armstrong overcame before taking that small step in 1969. "Feelings are the film's fuel," A.O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review. "Like some of the ancient epics 'First Man' is primarily a character study, a space odyssey with a diffident and enigmatic Ulysses at its center." Ryan Gosling, collaborating with "La La Land" director Damien Chazelle for the second time, portrays the astronaut in the years leading up to the Apollo 11 launch. The screenplay draws from James R. Hansen's biography and contrasts Armstrong's reserved, hard-to-read temperament with the larger-than-life job he has shouldered. We watch as he and his wife (Claire Foy) grieve over the loss of their daughter, prepare for the launch and wrestle with the fact that Armstrong could go down in history as the first man to walk on the moon -- or perish in outer space.
APOLLO: THE FORGOTTEN FILMS (2019) 8 p.m. on Discovery. While "First Man" has been praised as a stunning reimagining of the liftoff, this new documentary compiles archival footage of the real deal. Apollo engineers and astronauts provide a minute-by-minute narration of that long-awaited moment, while awe-inspiring, slow-motion clips capture the spaceship as it shot up toward the sky. A similar documentary, MOON LANDING LIVE, airs at 9 p.m. on BBC America. And a one-hour Discovery special, CONFESSIONS FROM SPACE: APOLLO, featuring interviews with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, follows at 10 p.m.
What's Streaming
FOR ALL MANKIND (1990) Stream on Criterion Channel or Kanopy; rent on Amazon, iTunes or Vudu. "For All Mankind" is a must-see documentary for anyone remotely interested in space exploration. NASA gave the first-time director Al Reinert access to footage shot by astronauts during the nine Apollo missions carried out from 1968 through 1972. With that wondrous material, Reinert crafted a composite trip, putting dazzling visuals front and center. The Oscar-nominated film is accompanied by a fitting, ambient score by Brian Eno, as well as narration from the NASA tapes and Reinert's own interviews. Writing in The Times, Caryn James said the movie "re-creates the sense of immensity involved in space travel: the grandeur of its ambition, the complexity of its physical details, the sheer infinity of space."
THE MARS GENERATION (2017) Stream on Netflix. While the titles above retrace history, this documentary looks to the future: It follows a group of teenagers at NASA's space camp who dream of one day traveling to Mars. While the youngsters share their ambitions, scientists and astronauts -- including Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye -- argue that for aspiring explorers to achieve their version of the moon landing, they need all the support they can get.

LEADING OFF
Happy Friday and welcome to Rhode Map, your daily guide to everything happening in the Ocean State. I'm Dan McGowan and all this reporting is really getting in the way of my attempt to rewatch “The Wire" for the 30th time. Follow me on Twitter @DanMcGowan or send tips to Dan.McGowan@globe.com.
If you haven't heard yet, Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green is set to begin the process of taking over Providence schools next week. Make sure you read my scoop from last night.
The scale of the state's intervention – known as reconstitution – is unprecedented, so it's still unclear how far Infante-Green's reforms will go. Here's a guide to the key unanswered questions.
Will teachers lose their jobs?
It's no secret that Mayor Jorge Elorza supports the state's plan in part because he has been unsuccessful in making significant changes to the teachers' union contract. But that doesn't mean a total overhaul is imminent. First, any mass firing would need to withstand a legal challenge. Second, it's already July 19. Finding hundreds of new teachers in the next six weeks is nearly impossible. Look for Infante-Green to try to negotiate a more favorable contract rather than going to war.
Will schools be closed?
One power that appears clear in reconstitution is the ability to shutter failing schools. But again, it's July and there are logistical challenges to forcing kids to change schools. Observers expect her to clear the barriers for charter schools like Achievement First to expand, but it's unlikely you'll see wholesale changes by the time students return to school Sept. 3.
Will the school board be replaced?
The mayor and the nine people he has appointed to serve on the board have the same question. We know board leadership has met with Infante-Green to explain why some level of continuity is important — especially when it comes to handling union grievances. But it's entirely possible a restructuring is coming.
Who will the new superintendent report to?
The school board announced this week it plans to bring on former Central Falls Superintendent Fran Gallo to help with the opening of schools, but it appears Infante-Green wants to find a schools chief that will report directly to her. That search is underway.
Will this cost taxpayers more money?
Don't forget, the state already covers two-thirds of Providence's nearly $400 million school budget, but the city still will be required to provide the other third to the school system. It would also be surprising if Infante-Green doesn't lobby state lawmakers next year to increase funding for targeted intervention in the city.

Texto completo: Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
CAMP KIDS 'N COMEDY GRADUATION SHOWS at Gotham Comedy Club (July 19, noon and 2:30 p.m.; Aug. 2 and 16, 2:30 p.m.). Some young people spend their summers telling ghost stories around a campfire; those in Kids 'n Comedy's indoor programs (where campfires are discouraged) tell jokes. You can see the results at these end-of-session performances, in which aspiring comics ages 10 to 18 demonstrate what they've learned after studying improv, sketch comedy and stand-up with adult professionals. (Telephone reservations are required.) The graduates won't be vulgar -- there are rules -- but they can be scarily funny.
212-877-6115, kidsncomedy.com
CIRCUS AFLOAT: THE FLIP FLOP CIRCUS at the Waterfront Museum and Showboat Barge (July 21, 2 p.m.). Why are so many clowns men? Here, at last, is a chance to see two who aren't: Liz Bolick (a.k.a. MizLiz) and Therese Schorn, who together make up the Flip Flop Circus. The women perform vaudeville-style comedy, but they're also adept at skills like juggling, plate spinning and manipulating their performance partners, puppets that can be as big as they are. The clowns are bringing their talents to Brooklyn as part of Circus Afloat, a series that earns its name from its location, a former Hudson Valley railroad barge that is now a museum docked at a pier in Red Hook.
718-624-4719, waterfrontmuseum.org
'DOROTHY'S ADVENTURES IN OZ' at the 92nd Street Y (July 20-21, 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.; through July 28). The Emerald City is apparently a popular destination. This adaptation by Megan Doyle and Jeffrey Sanzel, which sold out when it debuted in the spring, is now back at the Y for a longer run. Once again, young audiences -- the recommended ages are 2 to 11 -- can help build the Yellow Brick Road, which is just over the rainbow from a nearby spot: Here, Dorothy is a New York girl whose Auntie Em owns a Lexington Avenue newsstand close to the Y. With a book by Sanzel and a score and lyrics by Kevin F. Story, this musical invites children to follow Dorothy's ruby red hightops in a whirlwind journey of just 35 minutes.
212-415-5500, 92y.org
'FLYING LESSONS' at the Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theater at the Pershing Square Signature Center (July 22, 8 p.m.; July 25, 1 p.m.; through July 28). The fledgling in this new work is Isabella, an eighth-grade Latina whose most important learning experience isn't about aviation. Presented as part of the New York Musical Festival, this production finds its heroine confronting an end-of-year project: Write a research paper about a historical figure and the qualities making that subject great. As Isabella is trying to decide whom to select, she has a dream in which she is visited by two trailblazers from the past: Amelia Earhart and Frederick Douglass. Created by Donald Rupe, Jason Bailey and Cesar De La Rosa, the show follows Isabella on an educational and emotional journey.

MOTH NIGHT at the Staten Island Museum (July 20, 8:30-10 p.m.). The titular stars of this event attract a lot of little night owls, and not just those that fly. Presented in partnership with the Staten Island Children's Museum, this annual celebration welcomes young people -- those under 12 are admitted free -- for creature encounters, craft activities, an investigation of moth life cycles and a chance to stay up late. The fun will include observing museum specimens like a hummingbird moth and a tulip-tree silk moth; creating luna moth shadow puppets; making hand-printed species for the Moth Migration Project, an upcoming crowdsourced installation in Albuquerque by the artist Hilary Lorenz; and visiting Cooper's Corner, hosted by Cooper Keane, a 13-year-old amateur entomologist. The evening culminates in a hike around Snug Harbor, where participants will look for luna, sphinx and owlet moths, as well as other species. (Raccoons and opossums may join the party, too.) Families should note that this expedition is B.Y.O.F. (bring your own flashlight). LAUREL GRAEBER

OUTDOOR CINEMA: 'THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL' at Socrates Sculpture Park (July 24, 7 p.m.). This free series, which focuses on foreign pictures, offers much more than screenings. Presented with Film Forum and Rooftop Films, the programs begin with food and entertainment that reflect the national origins of each evening's movie -- and the diversity of Queens itself. This German-Mongolian project chronicles the efforts of a nomadic family to induce a female camel to nurture the colt it has rejected. Shown in Mongolian with English subtitles, the quest takes two young brothers from the desolate Gobi Desert to a nearby town, where they seek a musician to solve the problem with a healing ceremony. Combining drama and comedy, this is "a picture that will probably keep young eyes entranced," Elvis Mitchell wrote in his review for The New York Times in 2004. Also entrancing: a preshow performance of Mongolian folk songs, accompanied by live music played on the morin khuur (horse-head fiddle).

POWER PLAY: RUBIN MUSEUM ANNUAL BLOCK PARTY (July 21, 1-4 p.m.). These free festivities are all about power, but not the kind that subjugates. The Rubin Museum of Art specializes in the culture of the Himalayas, so you can look forward to Buddhist touches, relaxed attitudes and emphases on the power within. Held rain or shine on the block outside the museum -- and offering free admission to its galleries all day -- the event will offer crafts, group activities, food and live entertainment. The highlights for young visitors will include Power Poles, a chance to explore science with magnets and metallic sand; Flower Power, a collaborative project built with blossoms; Power On, a workshop on making portable lamps with LEDs; and Playgami, an augmented-reality experience that the origami artist Uttam Grandhi will create with museum images.
212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org
SUMMER SATURDAY 2019 at the American Folk Art Museum (July 20, 11:30 a.m.-6 p.m.). Adventurous, not formally trained, willing to embrace unconventional materials -- many children fit the definition of folk artists. At this annual free celebration, they can practice their skills at a museum devoted to the genre. Outside the building, from noon to 4 p.m., the artist Jake Bialos will lead a fantasy-fan-making workshop, in which young people can create decorated paper designs. Indoors, they can draw inspiration from the carousel animals in the show "Made in New York City: The Business of Folk Art," and then, from 12:30 to 2 p.m., build their own mixed-media creatures. The day will also include a scavenger hunt, guided gallery tours, face painting and lots of multicultural music: The performers Elena Moon Park, Brendan O'Shea and Queen Esther will each play a set.

POP MUSIC; Less of a loss in '08 fire? Artists' lawyers dispute new tally of destruction offered by Universal Music.

Texto completo: Universal Music Group officials have initially identified only 22 original master recordings made by five artists that may have been destroyed in the 2008 vault fire, according to an internal memo issued Wednesday, a copy of which was obtained by The Times.
Those were identified through UMG's efforts in recent weeks to inform musicians, their managers and lawyers precisely what was destroyed more than a decade ago in a disaster brought to light in June in a New York Times Magazine expose.
Wednesday's memo was written by Pat Kraus, UMG's senior vice president of recording studios and archive management, at the behest of Chairman and Chief Executive Lucian Grainge.

"Over the past several weeks," the memo states, "our team has been working around the clock, fielding requests from approximately 275 artists and representatives. To date we've reviewed 26,663 individual assets covering 30 artists. Of those assets, we believe we've identified 424 that could be missing or lost due to the fire, with audio assets accounting for 349 of them.
"Our data suggests that 22 of those could be 'original masters' which are associated with five artists," it continued. "For each of those lost masters, we have located high-quality alternate sources in the form of safety copies or duplicate masters. As we complete new work and we fill in gaps of work we've already done, these tallies will continue to evolve by the hour."
One of the lawyers representing musicians in a class-action lawsuit, filed last month on behalf of musicians whose recordings may have been lost, told The Times Wednesday, "I don't really know what that even means. Significantly, they have not been able to give us status on any of the dozens of artists that have asked us to inquire -- except one, for which the information has not been verified," said Edwin F. McPherson, principal at McPherson LLP. "I don't know what this apparently random sampling of 30 artists is, but it does not appear to be any of our artists, and I am very curious as to their methodology -- and why they didn't do this 11 years ago."
Howard King, another of the lawyers who filed the class-action suit, asked, "Why not show us the sworn declarations of losses they filed in their lawsuits against NBCUniversal and their insurance company? I wonder if those are consistent with what they are now claiming?"
The class-action suit was filed on behalf of Soundgarden, Hole, Steve Earle, Tom Petty's ex-wife Jane Petty, Afeni Shakur Trust representative Tom Whalley "and on behalf of all others similarly situated."
The UMG statement added, "Of course, our work is just beginning. In the coming weeks and months we will continue to update our artists and internal teams with our progress."
The memo was distributed just a few hours before UMG filed a motion in U.S. Central District Court to dismiss the class-action suit that seeks at least $100 million in damages, including a portion of a multimillion-dollar settlement UMG reached in 2012 with NBCUniversal and its insurers over the lost recordings.
UMG lawyers argued that the master recordings at hand belonged to UMG, not the musicians or their representatives, so any losses suffered were the company's. Further, musicians could not claim they were entitled to half the proceeds from the UMG-NBCUniversal settlement because such money falls outside UMG's obligation to share proceeds with artists for "furnishing, licensing or authorizing the use by others of master recordings embodying their musical works." UMG's motion also argued that the statute of limitations to seek legal relief has expired.
UMG's internal memo also included a question-and-answer session that Kraus said summarized some of the questions most commonly asked by musicians and their representatives since the June 11 publication of the New York Times Magazine investigation, the accuracy of which is disputed in the memo.
"This is not to say there weren't losses in the fire," Kraus wrote, "it's simply to say that the Times report is not a reliable source for what was lost and as a result it has created significant confusion."
The first question in the memo addressed why UMG has not published a list of everything that was lost when fire ravaged a storage facility in which UMG was renting space from NBCUniversal Studios on the lot of the latter's Universal Studios.
"While it would be ideal if we could publish such a list, unfortunately, it's not that simple," Kraus wrote. "[T]here is no definitive list of what was destroyed in the fire because it affected both inventoried assets and those that were not inventoried."
That corresponds to statements that audio engineers and archivists with knowledge of the storage facility have made to the Los Angeles Times and other media outlets since the New York Times report was published.
Several sources have confirmed that the vault did indeed house a vast repository of original master recordings by innumerable artists. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, they have told The Times that it may indeed be impossible to know exactly how many and which recordings were destroyed because a comprehensive inventory of what was in the vault does not exist.
An entire wall was filled with tape boxes identified only by numbers, one source told The Times, but there was no catalog of what those numbers corresponded to, and no other labeling information on the boxes.
The New York Times Magazine story said perhaps as many as 500,000 master recordings dating back decades were destroyed, including many by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, Billie Holiday, Judy Garland, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Elton John, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Nirvana, Soundgarden and multiple other artists.
In the immediate aftermath of the fire more than a decade ago, Universal representatives assured the Los Angeles Times and other media outlets that the facility housed only copies of recordings, and stated on the record, "In essence, nothing was lost." Spokespeople also emphasized that digital copies exist for the original analog tapes in the vault, but subsequently that assertion has been subject to intense debate.
"Immediately after the fire," according to the class-action suit, "UMG embarked on a systematic and fraudulent scheme of misrepresentation and misdirection designed to conceal the loss of the master recordings destroyed in the fire."
Even though record companies such as UMG typically retain ownership of such master recordings, from which commercial singles, albums, reissues and other iterations of the music are usually drawn, any loss of such recordings can affect artists because they can regain ownership through copyright reversion or other contractual means.

Texto completo: Fifty years ago this month, with what looked like an over-starched flag, Americans turned the moon into their own backyard sandlot. Yet back here on Earth, any number of places can rival the moon's all-in-the-family strangeness – a truth for which writers give unceasing thanks. 
Consider Oklahoma City. It may not top most lists of must-see destinations, but Sam Anderson can assure you it is “one of the great weirdo cities of the world." As “a laboratory for unavoidable American problems," he proposes, it is also a worthy case study.
A staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, Anderson developed an outsider's affection for the city when, thanks to considerable maneuvering, it acquired the professional basketball team now known as the Thunder. His “Boomtown – The Fantastical Saga of Oklahoma City, its Chaotic Founding, its Apocalyptic Weather, its Purloined Basketball Team, and the Dream of Becoming a World-class Metropolis" attempts to explain everything in its subtitle and then some.
The 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building still unfortunately dominates most people's conception of Oklahoma City. Anderson argues that the Thunder's arrival 13 years later, and the team's unexpected brilliance, have been essential to the community's healing. 
The city abruptly sprouted with the land run of 1889, an event Anderson recounts in lively detail. (At times he can seem like the desperate-to-amuse guy on the next barstool, but bear with him.) Although the sections on the Thunder may be a little too much inside basketball for some readers, Anderson balances his account with wonderful historical and cultural nuggets (my favorite: the museum devoted to free enterprise). He also delivers a powerful reconstruction of the bombing, as well as an indelible portrait of Gary England, a meteorologist venerated for his life-saving tornado forecasts. 
If Oklahoma City almost never came to be, Los Angeles was at least as improbable. Gary Krist's “The Mirage Factory – Illusion, Imagination and the Invention of Los Angeles" illuminates the city's rise through three notable figures: William Mulholland, the architect of its water system; D.W. Griffith, the master filmmaker who helped bring a fledgling movie industry west; and the wildly popular evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson.
Krist's scrupulously researched history shows how three intersecting dreams created the unlikely fact of LA, as well as its illusion-loving soul. (“Whether you like it or not," Charlie Chaplin once tellingly told McPherson, “you're an actress.") 
At the turn of the last century, Los Angeles was smaller than Fall River. Mulholland's scheme to poach water from the north, and the 1913 completion of his aqueduct, proved vital to attracting investment. 
Griffith was drawn by the promise of sunny days and virtually year-round shooting. McPherson, she would attest, arrived on instructions from the Lord. At 28, she quit the East Coast and, with her mother and two children, headed to LA, driving most of the way herself. In California, she drew thousands with her upbeat gospel of salvation and, not incidentally, reports of faith healing. Followers soon donated enough to erect a lavish million-dollar temple, with seating for 5,300. 
In the years when Los Angeles was coming of age, Pittsburgh had already reached maturity.
The Pennsylvania coal capital is probably best known as the stamping ground of Andrew Carnegie, and other Gilded Age titans. But in “Smoketown – The Untold Story of the Other Great Black Renaissance," Mark Whitaker unearths a second, lesser-known city. Much like Harlem, Pittsburgh was home to a vibrant black community that flourished from the 1920s through the 1950s. Its newspaper, the Pittsburgh Courier, played an outsized role in shaping black opinion across the country.
Like Sam Anderson, the Courier's editors understood the power of sports to lift the profile of a community. The paper was an early champion of Joe Louis, presenting the Alabama fighter's rise as a vindication of black flight from the South. Pittsburgh's integrated school system and rich musical culture helped produce several jazz greats, including Billy Strayhorn, Billy Eckstine and Erroll Garner. The city also molded August Wilson, one of the postwar era's greatest playwrights.
Family ties encouraged Whitaker to bring this lesser-known history to light. But as Anderson demonstrates, it sometimes takes an outsider to bring a place fully into focus. As a visitor to the deep South, the British travel writer Richard Grant was so entranced that he impulsively purchased a grand plantation house. “Dispatches from Pluto — Lost and Found in the Mississippi Delta" is his mind-blown account.
Arriving from New York with his girlfriend, Grant discovers nature in all its summertime fecundity (snakes, clouds of mosquitoes and armadillos that need killing). He quickly takes on his own prejudices, among them a dim view of gun culture and weed killers, and is entertainingly humbled. Questions of race assume an equally humbling complexity. Full of outlandish stories, eccentrics and lessons in neighborliness, Grant's report from the Mississippi swampland washes down like sweet tea.

How to manage your cilantro hatred

Texto completo: We're used to questions about substitutions and recipe changes. One of the most common ingredients that trips people up is cilantro.

"This is one herb you either like or dislike -- there seems to be no middle road," writes British author, grower and gardening expert Jekka McVicar in her book, "Jekka's Herb Cookbook."

To say people dislike cilantro seems like one of those charming English understatements, because often the sentiment that arises is more like loathing. "Has A Nation Taken Leaf of Its Senses?" screamed an over-the-top Washington Post article from 1994, in which author Elizabeth Kastor calls cilantro "an affront" that "tastes like the grief you feel over the public humiliation of a favorite teacher who was found drinking in the language lab."

OK then!

Often, however, people describe the taste of cilantro as soapy. As Harold McGee explained in the New York Times some years back, that comparison makes sense given that cilantro's aroma shares some of its flavor substances with soap. McVicar also mentions the scent "is said to resemble a crushed bedbug," which was a new one for me (shudder). Then again, McGee cites the Oxford Companion to Food when he explains that the word coriander, another name for cilantro, "is said to derive from the Greek word for bedbug." Anyway, whether that soapy/bug taste is the result of some kind of genetic factor or merely a result of your environment (cilantro is a lot more integral to some cuisines than others) is almost beside the point when someone who can't stand it is confronted by it.

"It's one of those flavors you can distinctly pick out of any dish," says Bill Williamson, executive chef at Washington's BLT Prime, who admits to being able to tolerate cilantro only some of the time. Given his job, he's used to working around people who claim a sensitivity or allergy to the herb. Here's some advice from him and others if you're in the same boat.

• Leave it off. Honestly, it's sometimes as simple as that. If the recipe is merely using cilantro as a garnish, you're not going to make or break the dish by skipping it. Or set aside a separate bowl to let your guests add as much or as little of it as they want to.

• Make a substitution. At the restaurant, Williamson says, the kitchen often swaps in a mix of parsley, tarragon and dill for cilantro. And because cilantro lends a bright, citrusy pop of flavor, lime or lemon zest is another option. He also likes carrot tops. "It's kind of a warm, earthy, sweeter spicy flavor," he says of the greens, which can otherwise go to waste. Depending on the dish, you may also be able to get away with mint or basil. Real Simple recommends Thai basil, which is a great idea I wish I had thought of, because it has a sharp pungency similar to cilantro's. Of course, any major herb substitution is going to change the flavor of the dish.

• Try a different form. Coriander seeds are from the cilantro plant, so Williamson says you can try them instead. Some people might find them more palatable. McVicar says the seeds even "develop a delightful orange-like scent." If you can get your hands on it, micro cilantro is also worth a shot because it's less potent than the full-size plant, Williamson says.

• Get used to it! If you're interested in seeing whether you can get over your cilantro aversion, it's certainly possible. Just ask the neuroscientist in McGee's piece, who also happens to be an expert in smell. McGee notes that crushing cilantro may help eliminate its more soapy aroma substances. He's also a fan of cilantro pesto, which he calls "lotion-free and surprisingly mild." Similarly, I think a good Indian chutney is another great way to go. "If you can surround yourself with likable dishes," Williamson says, "maybe you can kind of change your attitude toward the actual herb itself."

Ayanna Pressley wants to get back to the issues, although ignoring the president isn't easy

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — In the foyer of Representative Ayanna Pressley's Capitol Hill office, interns answered constantly ringing phones Wednesday as calls flowed in from around the country.
Behind a closed door in her personal office, Pressley was taking a break from the chaos, drinking a Gatorade and spending a few moments with her husband.
All week, Pressley said, she's been battling a headache — a real one.
It's no wonder.
For the fourth day in a row, President Trump was launching vicious personal attacks on the Massachusetts Democrat and three fellow first-term lawmakers.
Pressley acknowledged that trying to ignore his insults is a bit like trying not to look at a car wreck.
“The entire country is emotionally rubbernecking every day," she said. “You have to pay attention to a certain extent because it's through these Twitter storms that he unleashes vitriol and venom and hateful policies."
After all the controversy — the tweets and the news conferences and bitter House debate — it's easy to forget how this all started. But Pressley remembers, and as far as she is concerned, it all could have been easily avoided.
“I quite honestly feel that it's much ado about nothing," she said.
She was referring to the House vote three weeks ago in which the four lawmakers known as “the Squad" — Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota —were the only House Democrats to oppose a bill to provide funding to address the humanitarian crisis at the border.
Since even before they were elected, the four have drawn attention and controversy for their progressive stances on issues and use of social media to cultivate massive followings. Their votes on the border bill angered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called them out in remarks to a New York Times columnist.
Then Trump waded into the controversy by telling the four representatives, three of whom were born in the United States and all of whom are US citizens, that if they do not like this country they could leave.
“Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done," he tweeted. “These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough."
But as far as Pressley is concerned, the fact that she and her three colleagues decided to vote against the bill shouldn't be cause for outcry from her own party, which led to the criticism from Trump.
“I think what people have to appreciate is that this is a deliberative body," she said. “We are a large Democratic caucus. This is the first time in a long time that we've been in the majority and this is the most representative class in the history of Congress — in ideology, in race and ethnicity, in gender, in lived experience."
She continued: “When you have that diversity of perspective, opinion, and thought around the table, it means you are going to do exactly what people would expect you to do in a deliberative legislative body and that is to debate."
Pressley said that also sometimes means different tactics on how to act on those values.
“This is the most representative Democratic caucus in the history of Congress, we are building new muscle and I think we are still figuring out how to flex that muscle," she said.
Pressley said she and the three others voted against the border bill because they did not believe it included enough language to specify how the money would be used.
“I won't pretend it isn't hurtful, I won't pretend it doesn't even endanger people's lives, but what I'm most focused on are hateful, racist policies that are threatening the preservation of families, people's peace of mind," she said.
As she spoke, the phone in the foyer continued to ring. Her office got more than 100 calls during the news conference the Squad held on Monday to rebuke the president's remarks.
Pressley said she has received death threats (on this issue, but also just in general). But she has also received support from her district. She said she consulted with Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins, and also immigrant advocates before taking her border vote.
“Ultimately I don't work for Washington. I work with Washington but I answer to my district, and this is a representative democracy so there is nothing radical about my keeping the promises that I made to the people who sent me here," she said.
Her district includes parts of Boston, Cambridge, and Milton as well as all of Chelsea, Everett, Randolph, and Somerville.
About half the district is white, a quarter is black, and a quarter latino. A third of all residents were born outside the United States, according to the latest census data.
Pelosi, meanwhile, is focused on keeping the party unified in the face of Republicans in Congress who want to take back the House majority in 2020. And she believes that a fractured party could help Trump win reelection.
“You have to give him credit, he's a great distractor and that's what this is about," Pelosi told reporters Wednesday about the controversy over Trump's remarks.
Indeed, at a rally in Greenville, N.C. Wednesday night, Trump again targeted the four Democratic lawmakers.
“So these congresswomen, their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left," Trump said. “And tonight I have a suggestion for the hate-filled extremists, who are constantly trying to tear our country down. They never have anything good to say. That's why I say, hey if they don't like it let 'em leave, let 'em leave, let 'em leave."
Earlier in the day, Pressley said she is eager for this all to be over. She wants to work on things she came here to do such as reduce gun violence, build more affordable housing, and make sure everyone has health care and good public transportation. But she said there is at least one silver lining — her party is united by Trump's comments.
“We are centering ourselves on who the real enemy is," she said on Wednesday. “That's the best thing that can come out of this."

Texto completo: The origins of "Stinkers" are as tricky to pin down as a wriggly toddler.
It has to do with the worlds of three artists colliding: beloved actor Sally Wingert, who did a developmental reading of "Crashing the Party" nine years ago while she was on Broadway in "La Bªte." Playwright Josh Tobiessen, who wrote "Crashing." And Star Tribune artist of the year Sarah Rasmussen, who is married to Tobiessen and has directed his and Wingert's work several times.
All of the above led to the comedy that world-premieres Saturday at Jungle Theater, where Rasmussen is artistic director and where Wingert has not performed since "Entertaining Mr. Sloane" 15 years ago. She plays a woman, fresh out of jail for white-collar crimes, who crashes into the lives of her nonmaterialistic son (John Catron) and his small children (Reed Sigmund and Megan Burns, operating puppets). Awkward parenting attempts -- and criticism of those attempts -- follow.
As this lightly edited conversation reveals, getting the story goes something like this:
On the (probable) origins of 'Stinkers':
JT: Sally said something to me about writing her a play, and Sarah said, "If Sally Wingert tells you to write a play, you're kind of stupid if you don't." Going into writing, the main things on my mind were my toddler children and that Sally Wingert wanted to be in it so, from the get-go, I wanted to represent parenting.
SW: Did you not say to me, "I have a character in mind that you should play?"
JT: That probably did happen. It's fun to be able to write with a specific actor in mind because it very much becomes, "What would I like to see her do?"
SW: I probably did say you should write me a play. Because: If you do not ask, you shall not get it. I say this a lot but I think Josh is about the funniest contemporary playwright I have ever come across, ever read, ever got
to perform. This play really is a whole windup of amusement before the big payoff.
On whether having a play written for you is nervous-making:
SW: No. I knew it'd like it. I just remember thinking it was so funny. I did say a note to Josh: She is not a storyteller. Josh had her giving capitalism lectures but I said I think she's not necessarily a person who speaks in paragraphs, not because she couldn't but she has a clock that's always ticking, like, "Got me? Got me? OK. We're moving on." [Claps her hands to indicate: Next!]
JT: I'd like to point out that it's nice Sally wasn't scared about acting in the play but I was really nervous about it. There are plays of mine that are sitting in a drawer and probably deserve to be there. They've never been performed. So, when I start one, I never have that confidence that it's going to be great.
SW: But you think this is a good play, Sarah, not just because he's your husband.
SR: Of course. I think I'm harder on Josh because he's my husband. "Lone Star Spirits," when he wrote it, I was like, "Great. Go get a good New York Times review of it and then we'll talk about doing it at the Jungle."
JT: We do have a professional career that predates our romantic career. We worked together in grad school.
SW: So, no. I wasn't nervous. How often does someone get this lucky? It doesn't happen, in my world, anyway. And I have Sarah.
On working with puppets, used to play the children:
SW: You cannot imagine how fantastic it is. At first, I just liked watching those two humans be toddlers. And Sarah was very patient with me: "We're going to use puppets. It will work." And I'd be, "Hmmm, sure, Sarah. We'll use puppets. Sure." And then these puppets show up in rehearsal!
SR: Josh had this idea that children are a huge part of so many of our lives but we rarely get to see children on stage. And there's a good reason for that. I remember I showed John [Catron] the script and he was like, "Are we going to cast a 3-year-old and a 20-month-old in this play?" And I said, "No. No one wants to do that." The idea is that a child is small and vulnerable and needs to be taken care of, but they also take up an enormous amount of space.
On when you know it's working:
SW: It's how the language fits with the emotions of it. It ends up feeling like, "Oh, something really just went through me while I did that." It happens like that early in the play. I'm just out of prison and meeting the grandchildren -- well, meeting one and re-meeting the other. It's funny and true and I ask them to give me a hug and then, when I'm doing it, it pops into something that is, "Wow! She has just gotten out of jail and has not really acknowledged how off her game she feels. She's landing on the moon, almost." In the play, it doesn't get lingered on for more than a heartbeat and a half, but it is comedy that is bringing you to an emotional truth, and it's such a surprise.
On others' contributions to a playwright's work:
JT: Everybody wants it to be a great production but I also want it to be a great script, moving forward. So, if Sarah and the actors are trying to finesse a moment, to "get through" it, I want to ask them, "Are there things I can do, script-wise, that will help?"
SW: I often tell playwrights, "I don't understand this." And they give me a long explanation and I'll say, "Now, I understand. But when you are not in the room, no actor is going to know any of that, so you have to put it in the script."
SR: It's small but meaningful that, when scripts get published, the names of the actors who did it first go on that first page, too, along with the writer. The people who do it first are indelibly part of it, going forward. The questions they ask go into the play.
On putting it out in the universe:
SW: There's a character in the play who wants wealth without working for it. Something along the lines of "The Secret," he has a vision board where he puts things he wants. I always think that I kind of made my own little vision board here, with this play.
SR: You manifested it.
SW: I really did.

What Pelosi versus the squad really means

Texto completo: What's at stake in the struggle between Nancy Pelosi and the four progressive House members known as the squad? Partly it's just the perpetual conflict between younger members who want change fast and older members who say you have to deal with political reality.
But deep down it's a conflict of worldviews. No matter how moderate or left, Democrats of a certain age were raised in an atmosphere of liberalism. I don't mean the political liberalism of George McGovern. I mean the philosophic liberalism of people like Montaigne, John Stuart Mill, Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas - people who witnessed religious and civil wars and built structures to restrain fanaticism.
Philosophic liberalism, Adam Gopnik explains in his essential book, "A Thousand Small Sanities," begins with intellectual humility. There's more we don't know than we do know, so public life is a constant conversation that has no end. In the liberal view, each person contains opposites and contradictions. You flatten and dehumanize complex individuals when you see people according to crude dichotomies and assign them to tribal teams.
Liberals prefer constant incremental reform to sudden revolution. "Liberal reform, like evolutionary change, being incremental, is open to the evidence of experience," Gopnik writes. Liberals place great emphasis on context. The question is not: What do I want? It's: What good can I do in this specific circumstance?
Liberalism loves sympathy, suspects rage and detests cruelty. Politics is inevitably a dialogue between partial truths. Compromise is a virtue, not a sign of cowardice. Moreover, means determine ends. If you win power through rhetorical violence, and by hating those who disagree, your regime will be angry and destructive. Liberalism arose out of the fact that political revolutions, while exciting at the outset, usually end up in brutality, dictatorship and blood. Working within the system is best.
People who came of age in the past few decades did not grow up in an atmosphere of assumed liberalism. They often grew up in an atmosphere that critiques it.
Critics on the right argue that liberal pluralism creates a society that is too thin. It lacks the tight bonds of clan. It lacks a single coherent moral culture. When you take away the idea of a single divine order, you create a fluid world in which a few shrewd elites may thrive, but everybody else falls into chaos.
Critics on the left argue that liberalism is a set of seemingly neutral procedures that the privileged adopt to mask their underlying grip on power. Left-wing critics detest liberalism's incrementalism and argue that only a complete revolution will uproot injustice.
They do not share liberalism's belief in the primacy of free speech. They argue that free speech sometimes has to be restricted because incorrect words can trap our thinking. Bad words, like insensitive gender pronouns, preserve oppression.
They embrace essentialism, which is the antithesis of liberalism. Essentialism is the belief that people are defined by a single identity that never changes. A cisgender white male is always and only a cisgender white male.
In short, many of today's young leaders, and their older allies, don't want to work within the liberal system. They want to blow it up.
So which side will prevail?
Over the short term, I'd put my money on the anti-liberals. Liberalism suffers from a series of weaknesses. First, many Americans have already betrayed it. The adventure of liberalism is constantly encountering people and ideas that are new and different. But Americans of both left and right moved into lifestyle enclaves with people like themselves. Americans have stopped seeing each other accurately. Conversation, the very lifeblood of liberalism, is blocked.
Second, liberal institutions have deteriorated. A liberal society needs universities where ideas are openly debated, it needs media outlets that strive to be objective, it needs political institutions, like the Senate, that are governed by procedures designed to keep the process fair to both sides. It needs people who put the rules of fair play above short-term partisan passion. Those people scarcely exist.
Third, Donald Trump. Trump marshaled illiberal groups in the GOP and easily defeated the old guard. He turned the GOP into an illiberal force. It's very hard for Democrats to play by the rules of liberalism when the other party won't.
Furthermore, Trump has a vested interest in keeping the progressives atop the Democratic Party, and he powerfully influences that party. When Pelosi tried to marginalize the squad, Trump issued a racist tweet against the squad's members. Democrats responded predictably, and the squad was back as the party's defining element. Expect this pattern to recur.
Liberalism's ultimate problem is that its achievements have been taken for granted. It's moderate in an age made for reality TV. It's an attempt to restrain passions, not inflame them. Liberalism is about treasuring your opponents, not calling them racists or traitors.
In the current moment, "Let's not get carried away" and "Let's play by the rules" are not great campaign slogans. Trump's primary opponents learned that the hard way in 2016. Pelosi, Biden and the other Democratic liberals, I'm afraid, may learn that in the months ahead.

My goal is to hit you readers in the heart

Texto completo: When I was in eighth grade, I remember thinking to myself as I read the New Orleans Times-Picayune sports page until the last possible second before I had to catch the bus to school — how cool would it be to do what I do most of the time anyway and get paid for it?
By this time in 1975, I was already an expert on the Saints and the Houston Astros, who were on the radio and TV regularly in New Orleans. And I was already routinely arguing about what each team needed to do and what they needed to stop doing. In fact, I knew nearly as much about both teams as I do now.
When I covered each franchise's lone world championships — the Saints on Feb. 7, 2010, in the Super Bowl and the Astros in the 2017 World Series — I felt like a kid on the Big Zephyr at Ponchartrain Beach. I felt the same way covering LSU's first national championship in 48 years on Jan. 4, 2004, in the Louisiana Superdome. I could relate with the starved feeling of all three organizations that had fasted for a combined total of 142 seasons.
Sports made me read when I was 7. I was the first person I knew my age who read books without it being assigned at school. "Great Quarterbacks of the NFL," "Great Running Backs of the NFL" and "Great Receivers of the NFL" by the late, great Dave Anderson of the New York Times were the first ones in 1968 — each left lying around by my older brothers. I still have them. They were very anecdotal and not overly statistical and held my attention more than "Lord of the Flies." I remember a professor at the University of Missouri Journalism School telling us to use anecdotes and stay away from stats, as if this was a new strategy.
I loved Saints games at Tulane Stadium outdoors with my dad. So many smells — cigars, sweat, hot beer, and really bad Saints teams. Then I went to my first LSU game at Tiger Stadium on the night of Nov. 8, 1969. Dad and I walked around the campus in the afternoon before going into the stadium. I was in awe. And LSU beat the great Bear Bryant's Alabama team, 20-15. They didn't beat Alabama at home again until Nov. 4, 2000, and I covered it.
Less than two months later, I covered the Saints' first playoff win on Dec. 30, 2000, in the Superdome. LSU's first football national championship since 1958 came three years later in the dome, followed by another one four years later also in the dome. And I covered the LSU basketball team's Final Four in 2006 and my fourth of six LSU baseball national titles in 2009.
Mark Twain was right. "Write what you know about," he said. That way, using of your firsthand knowledge becomes second nature. It also makes it easier to argue when you have the information — both current and historical. So, it has been a lot of fun. I didn't realize I was writing columns in my head at 13, and I still do.
Columns are the heart and soul of sports journalism, and they have always been what I like doing best. In this day of increasing homer-ism in sports writing, they are needed more now than ever. Sometimes, they are the only way to cut through the B.S., which is also a lot of fun.
LSU and the Saints are in the hearts and souls of Louisianians, so my goal is to hit you readers in the heart. You may not always like it as sometimes passion is at odds with the truth. But you can trust in this - I will not B.S. you. You may say I'm negative. But, if you think about it, anyone who is very passionate tends to be overly positive and will therefore naturally see something that is objective as negative. Unlike many other writers, I will not say LSU is going to be great in football every year to remain popular with the fans and gain readers. So when I say LSU will be great, you can bank on it.
And after years of saying LSU will be average to above average in football, it WILL be great in 2019 and break out of its seven-year itch of three losses are more. This will be the first season LSU returns the same offensive coordinator and starting quarterback from the previous season since 2010, and that will pay dividends.
So, if you want to keep up with what is really going on with LSU and the Saints and what they need to do and what they need to stop doing — as opposed to just believing in Santa Claus — stay subscribed or consider our subscription offers at https://offers.theadvertiser.com/specialoffer.
Why did you go into journalism?
Even when I was a kid, I thought I was sort of disseminating information about sports the way a journalist might. So why not try as a career what I was already doing? And I found myself unable to stop watching the Watergate hearings over that summer of 1973 when I was 11. It always seemed like a natural fit.
What is the most satisfying part of your job?
When I feel like a really nailed a column with a strong opinion, but one that looks at all sides when possible. And when I hear from someone I do not know that really liked it.
What do you love most about Acadiana?
Lafayette and surrounding areas have a lot of culture to offer — culinarily and musically. New Orleans gets a lot of the attention understandably, but Lafayette is sort of like a cool secret.
What would you be doing if you weren't in journalism?
I'd be dead. But if you put a gun to my head, which could result in the same thing, I'd say lawyer.

How to travel with a group and stay Mends

Texto completo: From bachelor parties to family reunions, group trips are opportunities to explore the world with the people you love. They also have the potential to be planning messes, with scheduling, decision-making and sorting-out finances coming together in a seemingly endless and possibly disappointing snarl.
But they don't have to be. We've rounded up tips, tricks and tools to help plan your next group getaway, hopefully allowing everyone to focus on the fun, not the logistics.
Understand your group dynamic
The first step in planning a successful trip: Ensure the travelers will get along well together. "Is it a group of friends, or is it a couple of families traveling together? Is it a multigenerational trip with a big age range?" said Kate Doty, managing director of premier access at the adventure travel company, Geographic Expeditions (GeoEx). "These factors all come into play with activity level, comfort zones and rooming."
Understanding individual roles within the group is big, too. "There will be someone in the group who will be the natural leader," Doty said. "Be candid about this! Find opportunities to talk through these topics with humor and lightness."
Group dynamics can play a big role in determining where to stay. Families might prefer the ease and facilities of a hotel or resort. Big groups of friends might opt to search through home rental sites like VRBO and Airbnb. Ali Killam, Airbnb's consumer trends expert, recommends creating a shared wish list and inviting group members to add listings and vote on favorites.
"Determine what's most important to the group when it comes to accommodations - a pool, a big kitchen, proximity to town, the beach - and filter the search accordingly," she said.
Shared apps are vital
Once you've decided on the group, figure out when everyone is available. Doodle allows users to create a poll online of possible travel dates and then vote on preferred options. Tried and true Google Sheets is a decent way to organize options for destinations, housing and more in a spreadsheet and track when and how people will be traveling.
Katrina Kagan, the partnerships and marketing associate at the weekly newsletter Girls' Night In is the designated planner in her group of friends, who try to take group trips at least once a year. She created a trip planning spreadsheet that gathers travel details, expenses, meals and more for the purpose; her colleagues were so impressed that they shared it with the newsletter's 150,000 subscribers.
"If you're a planner, like I am, this spreadsheet is a way to get organized enough that you can feel personally at ease during your trip. Why not take half an hour beforehand to get organized?" she said. "If you're not a natural planner and are looking to step into that role, this can be a starting point."
Beyond the spreadsheet, Triplt is an itinerary-building app that allows you to collect details for flights, hotels, car rentals and more into a master itinerary - the app's Inner Circle feature allows you to share your itinerary with other members of your group.
Other ways to communicate, beyond unwieldy email chains: set up a private Facebook or WhatsApp group to send messages both while planning and when traveling. Google Docs make for a shared repository of events and suggestions and other vital information. And, if you plan on Instagramming your travels, a fun group hashtag is a nice way to keep track of the memories.
Figure out finances
Tracking expenses is doable via spreadsheet, but still requires a fair amount of work to properly divvy up shares and figure out who owes what. Splittr and Split-wise are popular mobile free apps for tracking, prorating and ultimately balancing expenses, available offline and in multiple currencies.
"I was traveling a lot with friends, and I was the one who did the spreadsheet after the trip. I thought, 'This should be easier!'" said the Splittr founder and developer, Raphael Wichmann.
Splitwise was originally created with roommates in mind, but translates to the travel space - it also integrates directly with the payment app Venmo, allowing you to make payments and receive money directly.
"We're looking to helps reduce stress and awkwardness when it comes to finances," said Jon Bittner, the Splitwise chief executive. Bittner suggests creating a group as soon as the first big expense, like a house or hotel rooms, has been booked, and continue adding expenses as you go.
Looking to treat your friends or family to free rides during your trip? Uber Events allows you to set up a code to cover transportation for your crew, with options to customize the time window, location and pickup radius (we particularly like this option for weddings and family reunions).
Getting group deals
Investigating group deals may be a bit time-consuming but the research can save you money.
Amtrak recently launched Share Fares, which earns you greater discounts on tickets the more people you travel with. If booked at least three days in advance, this program can reduce ticket prices up to 35% for groups of four.
Brian Kelly, The Points Guy, has made a career out of understanding the intricacies of airline and credit card loyalty programs. On his site, he published a free article, the "Ultimate Guide to Points, Pooling and Sharing," for applying airlines miles and credit card points to group travel.
To begin with, he warns about transferring points and suggests instead on combining them.
"Airlines will generally charge you one cent per point or mile to transfer, which negates the value," he said. He also suggested savings could be had by taking a "look at your trip in terms of one-ways instead of round-trips, and look at it based on availability." If flying together is a priority, consider letting members of your group with the most available points purchase individual legs of the trip. This allows for booking through multiple airlines, too.
Some domestic airlines offer perks for groups booking together, including discounted fares and flexible ticketing options (while other apps and services for booking group flights exist, we found they were neither streamlined nor consistently well reviewed).

Texto completo: El presidente, Donald Trump , aseguró el lunes que “muchos, muchos” inmigrantes fueron capturados el domingo por el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) en el primer día de la operación con la que planeaba arrestar a al menos 2,000 personas.
Hasta el momento no se han tenido noticia de detenciones masivas, pese a que tanto los migrantes (aterrorizados, y escondidos en sus casas) como los activistas (en guardia, defendiendo los derechos de los afectados) están en alerta máxima.
“Simplemente, ustedes no conocen lo que ha sucedido”, explicó Trump sobre esta falta de noticias sobre arrestos. “Fue un día muy exitoso, pero no vieron mucho de lo que pasó”, añadió el presidente, sin citar cifras concretas.
La operación, que debería llevarse a cabo durante toda la semana en nueve ciudades (Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Ángeles, Miami, Nueva York y San Francisco), puede ganar fuerza en cualquier momento.
Y ICE, en cualquier caso, no ha dejado de arrestar a inmigrantes.
Entre el 7 de julio y el pasado jueves, por ejemplo, detuvo a docenas de personas en Los Ángeles. La semana pasada, arrestó a 20 migrantes, la mayoría con antecedentes criminales, en San Diego. El lunes capturó a seis más en una redada en un edificio de apartamentos de Houston (Texas).
En Estados Unidos hay 10,5 millones de indocumentados. ICE cifra en 565.892 los fugitivo s (migrantes que han desobedecido una orden final de expulsión).
La agencia federal arrestó a 160,000 personas (440 al día) en el año fiscal de 2018, y deportó a 256,000 (700 al día). Es decir, en una semana normal detiene a más de 2.000 migrantes y deporta a casi 4,000, cifras muy similares a las anunciadas para la operación de esta semana.
Si se cree en peligro, recuerde sus derechos y siga los consejos de activistas sobre qué hacer si se ve involucrado en una redada.
Agentes de ICE tocaron a la puerta de una vivienda en Passaic (Nueva Jersey) el domingo a la una de la madrugada, según cuenta el diario The New York Times. Despertaron a una joven adolescente, pero gracias a que había leído una información en Internet sobre qué hacer en estos casos, decidió no abrir.
“Dijeron, ‘tenemos que hablar contigo, ¿puedes salir, puedes abrir la puerta?’. Yo dije, ‘¿tienen permiso para entrar en mi casa, tienen un papel?’”, explicó la joven. “Ellos dijeron, ‘no estamos intentando entrar en tu casa, sólo queremos hablar contigo’, y yo dije, ‘no, no voy a salir”, añadió.
Los agentes regresaron a las cinco de la madrugada, pero la joven se escondió con sus padres hasta que se fueron, según cuenta el diario.
No fue la única redada.
“Hablan del domingo, pero no necesitamos esperar al domingo, ya están deteniendo a inmigrantes”, explicó la activista Nora Sandigo a la cadena NBC.
Según contó, el viernes fueron detenidos cinco hombres en el área de Homestead (Florida), al menos uno de ellos en su casa y otro mientras esperaba a las puertas de un centro comercial Home Depot esperando trabajo en la construcción.
Se trata de un guatemalteco que lleva 16 años en el país y tiene cinco hijos de entre dos y 16 años. “Es totalmente injusto”, explicó Sandigo, “es el que trae el dinero a la familia, una buena persona sin problemas con la ley, su único problema es que no tiene papeles”.

Texto completo: It would seem that the band of young progressives in Congress driving the Democratic Party to the left have struck a chord in American politics.
Our Question of the Week for readers: Is it a symphonic G major, or a flat discord?
Even the Executive Branch Tweeter in Chief seems to be fascinated by the group.
Are especially the members of “The Squad” — the four young women members of Congress President Trump told to “go back” to ancestral home countries over the weekend — creating important new policy discussions that will add oomph to the Democrats’ brand?
Or are they a danger to their party, increasing the chances that Trump will easily be re-elected by an American people worried about radicalism under the banner of “democratic socialism”?
In a recent New York Times interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was fairly critical of The Squad, which is made up of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts.
The irony of course is that Pelosi has long been viewed by many Americans as a stalwart liberal from elitist San Francisco. If she is instead the leader of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, does that mean the center cannot hold?
The four were the only Democrats to vote against the House version of a border funding bill backed by Pelosi. The speaker angrily said they had supporters in “their Twitter world” but not on Capitol Hill.
But after the racially tinged tweets from the president, Pelosi spoke out in support of her junior colleagues.
Some note that The Squad and other newly elected House Democrats are really more representative through their youth of the Millennial generation than of their ethnic backgrounds.
Will they energize young people who haven’t been involved in the political process before? Will they bring to the polls some minority voters who stayed out of the Hillary Clinton-Trump election in 2016?

ICE raids: Southern California not seeing stepped up enforcement

Texto completo: Jose Rodriguez stocked his food cart with fewer fresh fruit cups Sunday, figuring many in Santa Ana’s Latino community might stay home for fear of much-touted immigration raids.
But his sales were brisk.
Immigration arrests were not.
“I wasn’t expecting any crowds,” said Rodriguez, who has worked his cart at the same corner for 26 years, selling fresh fruits, cold drinks and Mexican treats. “There’s been so much fear in the community.”
That fear, for a day at least, seemed to be unfounded.
Immigration rights advocates from around the region said Sunday they hadn’t heard of any large operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. And while some arrests occurred in Los Angeles, Riverside and Lake Elsinore over the past few days, it’s unclear if those were related to the announced sweeps or part of typical ICE work.
President Trump this month announced, initially on Twitter, that on Sunday, July 14, ICE agents would pick up some 2,000 immigrants around the country who are living in the United States illegally and have deportation orders.
He’d made a similar claim in June, saying “millions” of people would be removed from the country. The June raids never happened.
The plan slated for Sunday would focus on criminals and recent arrivals from Central America. They could also include “collateral” arrests of people who happen to be in the area of the intended targets, according to news reports.
The publicized sweeps were supposed to take place in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Miami, New York and San Francisco. Two other cities originally on the list, Houston and New Orleans, were reportedly postponed because of tropical storm Barry.
It’s possible the raids were only delayed, not abandoned.
Instead of a large, simultaneous sweep, immigration officials created a secondary plan for a smaller and more diffuse scale of apprehensions to roll out over roughly a week, the New York Times reported Sunday. Individual ICE field offices were given the discretion to decide when to begin those sweeps.
Immigration officials have declined to say what their plans are, saying it could threaten the safety of agents and jeopardize their operation.
In Southern California, immigration arrests, they pointed out, are made every day.
“This is what we are. We are a law enforcement agency,” Lori Haley, an ICE spokeswoman based in Orange County, said Friday.
Many immigrant-rights advocates said they were not surprised by the low-key rollout of the so-called sweeps.
“I think they’ll do their usual ops today. They want that element of surprise,” said Jennaya Dunlap, deportation defense coordinator for the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.
Even through 2,000 arrests or so – spread across Los Angeles and the other cities – are not necessarily unusual for ICE raids, the president’s words and the media’s coverage of his plan have created considerable anxiety, advocates said.
“It’s not about the numbers. It’s about the fear,” said Guillermo Torres, who spearheads the immigration campaigns of the Los Angeles-based Clergy & Laity United for Economic Justice.
“Words are powerful and they impact families. And that’s what this president has done, for political purposes, because he’s running for re-election,” Torres said.
In downtown Santa Ana, the number of visitors appeared typical. Some said business was a little slow, but most said it was about the same.
In other heavy Latino locations, some residents were reportedly keeping a low profile.
“We were in Lake Elsinore yesterday (Saturday, July 12,) and the stores were empty. People were telling us they don’t come out until evening,” said immigration rights advocate Dunlap.
“That’s the kind of fear people are living” with, she added.
On Sunday, Dunlap was at a swap meet in Winchester, a small town close to Hemet in Riverside County. Normally, the swap meet would be very crowded – but not this Sunday.
“We’ve come here before and given out a couple of thousand hotline cards,” Dunlap said. “But I’m standing here and literally no one is walking past.”
Another swap market that had much lower attendance Sunday was one outside Cypress College, said Anaheim resident Dariana Diaz, whose father has a stand. “People are scared of the raids.”
In Indio, Coachella and Moreno Valley, advocates noted that local supermarkets frequented by Latino customers had considerably fewer shoppers on Sunday, according to Luz Gallegos, community programs director for the Training Occupational Development Educating Communities (TODEC) Legal Center.
Yet, at least 160 people turned out Sunday for information forums in Perris, Coachella and Victorville, she said. A few attendees had deportation orders.
“People were very interested in identifying the official documents and understanding the difference between an ICE warrant and a search and seizure warrant signed by U.S. magistrate judge,” Gallegos said.
In recent weeks, starting after Trump initially tweeted about deportations, local groups have held numerous seminars, sometimes called “know your rights” forums, telling immigrants how to handle potential contact with ICE officials and how to prepare their families, legally, in case adults are removed from the country without their children.

A Photographer at Home in the Zoo

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
How does a photographer document an elephant that weighs 40 times what she does? For Robin Schwartz, who worked on this weekend's cover story for The New York Times Magazine, the process came naturally. Her connection with animals is innate.
"It's something I was born with," she said.
Ms. Schwartz, who is also a professor of photography at William Paterson University in New Jersey, has been working with animals all her life. Indie, her Chinese crested dog, often sits by her side while she lectures. Ms. Schwartz was 10 when she first got a Kodak Instamatic camera. She often dressed her cat in doll clothes and took pictures of him.
"I considered him my brother," she said.
To photograph the cover story for The Times Magazine, Ms. Schwartz accompanied Charles Siebert, an author who has written extensively about the relationship between humans and animals, to three zoos that had recently received elephants from eSwatini (formerly Swaziland). The elephants were "rescued" from big-game park reserves, a story that Mr. Siebert discovered was darker and more complex than the plaques at the elephant's new enclosures made it seem.
Ms. Schwartz has made a name for herself over the last 30 years as a photographer of people and animals around the world. In 2016, she received a Guggenheim fellowship to work with rescued animals and their caretakers. She has photographed foxes in Minnesota, let flying fox bats play with her hair in Australia, and captured people swimming with pigs in the Bahamas. As a graduate student at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, she photographed roaming packs of feral dogs in Brooklyn, Jersey City and Hoboken.
"I'm really interested in that magical relationship between animals and people," Ms. Schwartz said.
Ms. Schwartz's best-known images feature her daughter, Amelia, in uncanny situations with animals.
They aren't cutesy family snapshots. "I was sort of afraid of Amelia when she was born," Ms. Schwartz said. "I'd never held other people's babies. My husband knew how to diaper and had babysat; I had never taken care of kids. I'm not very domesticated. I don't even like to cook."
When Amelia was 3, Ms. Schwartz's mother and then a beloved cat died within a year of each other. Ms. Schwartz felt depressed and stopped taking pictures, until she discovered that capturing images of Amelia with their pets was a way of processing that grief. "It gave me a way out," she said.
Over time, Ms. Schwartz amassed pictures of her daughter, now 20, with the animals in both of their lives. She captured her daughter showering with the family cats, resting with monkeys and lemurs, and playing with baby tigers and elephants.
"I don't talk to Amelia when I photograph, because the noise factor will throw the animals off," Ms. Schwartz said. "I watch."
She often approaches human subjects the same way.
"I do physical things, I tilt my head where I want them to look or I take my finger and point to my chin," Ms. Schwartz said.
"I think I photograph people as if they were animals. I'm more comfortable with animals than I am with people," she said.
For this weekend's magazine article, Ms. Schwartz photographed in different environments in three zoos. Sometimes, she shot from far away on a platform with the tourists, using a long lens. Other times, such as at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kan., she was able to get closer to the elephants.
"She understands animals in a very deep way," said Amy Kellner, associate photo editor for the magazine. "I wanted someone who would photograph them with an empathetic eye, the same way that you would photograph people who had been uprooted from their homes."
In September, Ms. Schwartz's work from the last two decades will be on display in New York during the Photoville exhibition in Brooklyn Bridge Park. She plans to bring her dog.

Texto completo: What's on TV
SWEETBITTER 9 p.m. on Starz. Last year Starz added this drama series -- adapted from the novel by Stephanie Danler -- to the list of shows about young women navigating life in the Big Apple (think "Girls" and "Sex and the City"). The focus here is on Tess (Ella Purnell), a 20-something naïf who leaves the Midwest and is offered a trial position at a high-end Manhattan restaurant. In the first season, she discovered the inner-workings of the dining world, got a taste of New York City night life and found a love interest (or two). Season 2 debuts with two back-to-back episodes and picks up after Tess has been handed the job. No longer the new girl in town, she's a little more at ease but realizes there is plenty to learn if she wants to keep her head above water.
TOP GEAR 8 p.m. on BBC America. Despite some mishaps, this motor show is still going strong. In Season 27, the host Chris Harris returns alongside new faces Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness. Their first challenge? Buying examples of their first cars and driving them out to Ethiopia's sweltering Danakil Depression.
GRANTCHESTER 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). If one crime-solving vicar doesn't do the trick, two just might. The fourth season of this cozy mystery series sees the end of our protagonist, Sidney Chambers (James Norton), a clergyman who moonlights as a detective in 1950s England. In his place, the quaint village of Grantchester gets a new, younger priest: the rebellious reverend Will Davenport (Tom Brittney). The show, based on the series of novels by James Runcie, returns with a two-hour episode in which Sidney gets involved in the Civil Rights movement and Geordie Keating (Robson Green) looks into a slum's shady happenings.
What's Streaming
GONE BABY GONE (2007) Stream on Amazon, Hulu or Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Ben Affleck first showed off his directing chops with this gripping thriller adapted from the Dennis Lehane novel. When 4-year-old Amanda is kidnapped from her mother's home in working-class Boston, the child's aunt and uncle enlist the help of the young private detectives Patrick (Casey Affleck) and Angie (Michelle Monaghan). The pair know the neighborhood well, and the family believes they can get more out of locals than the police. Still, the detectives work with the cops on the investigation and inevitably clash with them as they turn one stone after another. The loose ends will grab your attention, but it's the personal dramas that will hold it. "'Gone Baby Gone' pays closer heed to the enigmas of soul and heart than to clues and guesswork," Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review. "There are false leads, dead ends, brandished guns and nightmarish discoveries, as well as shadows and controlled camerawork, but mostly there are human frailties and thrown-away, forgotten lives."

Texto completo: [ Read all Times reporting on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing . | Sign up for the weekly Science Times email .]
It took eight days for the crew of Apollo 11 to travel to the moon and back in July 1969. In commemoration, here are eight movies, television shows and podcasts that illuminate just how revolutionary that journey was.
'Apollo 11' (2019)
Even if you have seen a number of moon-landing documentaries and have a familiarity with their footage, Todd Douglas Miller's film is something special. The director obtained access to 65-millimeter Panavision footage that was shot on the ground leading up to the launch. Much of it had been sitting in the National Archives and was never shown publicly. Miller weaves a narrative of the launch, landing, return and recovery of the astronauts, all from archival footage (including the discovered footage) and audio.
It is a marvel to see on the big screen if you can. Science museums have been screening a shorter version in their theaters this spring and summer, and CNN is airing the movie in the lead-up to the July anniversary.
It is also available on YouTube, Google Play and Vudu.
'2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968)
One year before Apollo 11 touched down on the surface of the moon, Stanley Kubrick's astonishing film helped prepare audiences for what it might look like to get there. The meticulously researched film was prescient in the way it presented the moon's visuals, the approach of the lunar module to the surface and more. While the movie has much more than the moon on its mind, it primed a generation of people for sights their eyes might not have otherwise believed.
Available on YouTube, iTunes, Vudu, Amazon Prime and Google Play.
'13 Minutes to the Moon' Podcast (2019)
The 13-minute period between the time the Apollo 11 crew members started the Eagle's engine and when they touched down on the moon may have been brief. But it was packed with an entire podcast series's worth of drama. The BBC dives in with this program, hosted by Kevin Fong. It uses these brief moments as a springboard to talk about how NASA navigated the many challenges faced by the space program. And the music, by the film composer Hans Zimmer, adds to the excitement.
Listen to it on the BBC website, or download it with your preferred podcast app.
'Moon' (2009)
While "2001" gives us spectacle, Duncan Jones's sci-fi drama provides something much more spare. As it imagines a future where resources for Earth are harvested off-planet, it captures both the intrigue and the loneliness of space voyages. Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a man who mines lunar soil for fuel that helps power the Earth. He is the only one on the mission, and his isolation might call to mind that of Michael Collins, who had to spend time alone aboard Apollo 11's command module while his colleagues were exploring the lunar surface. The film heads to complicated places and asks ethical questions about how far humans could, or should, go to maintain species survival.
Watch it on Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube and iTunes.
'For All Mankind' (1990)
Al Reinert's captivating documentary takes footage from multiple Apollo missions and creates a kind of moon-mission supercut. It is achieved with breathtaking footage, some shot by the astronauts themselves. In her New York Times review, Caryn James wrote that Reinert "changes points of view so smoothly and quickly that he evokes an omniscient sense of being everywhere at once."
Available on Kanopy, Amazon, iTunes and Vudu.
'From the Earth to the Moon' (1998)
Before bingeable programming, and before the limited series concept became ubiquitous, HBO released this 12-part, visually ambitious and epic narrative of America's quest to win the space race. Executive produced by Tom Hanks, the series was, at the time, the most expensive television project in history ( $ 68 million, without adjusting for inflation). With 10 different directors (including Hanks and Sally Field) at the helm for individual episodes, the series takes on multiple moods and personalities. In his Variety review, Ray Richmond wrote that it "manages to achieve its improbable goal of getting us excited about exploring the heavens again."
For the moon mission anniversary, the series has been remastered, with a computer-generated update to its visual effects, based on reference models from NASA. Beginning July 15, this version will be available on digital download and for streaming on HBO's platforms. The HD Blu-ray will be out July 16.
'Moonstruck' Podcast (2018)
This informative podcast devotes each episode to a different element of the history of human spaceflight. Episode 3 explores a more granular aspect of the Apollo 11 mission. Rather than focusing on the landing, it looks at the days after, when the crew was quarantined. It interviews NASA officials about the details of what was done over those days, arguing that sometimes it is the smallest stories "that teach us the most about ourselves and remind us why we went to space in the first place."
Listen to the series at its website, or download it with your preferred podcast app.
'First Man' (2018)
Damien Chazelle's biopic is as equally interested in following Neil Armstrong on his walk through family life as it is with his walk on the moon. Ryan Gosling plays him as a stoic with a cool surface you are aching to peer beneath. But when the movie gets to the moon, it pulls no punches in the visual dazzle department. The scenes, shot with Imax cameras in a quarry landscaped to look like the moon's surface, are so wondrous and realistic that you will feel as if you were taking that one small step yourself.
Available on YouTube, Amazon Prime and Google Play.

Texto completo: For half a century, Michael Collins has been answering variations of the same question asked by reporters, he says.
"Mr. Collins, weren't you the loneliest man in the whole lonely history of this lonely planet by your lonely self behind the lonely moon in this lonely orbit? Weren't you terribly lonely?" he mused.
Mr. Collins is often the forgotten astronaut on Apollo 11, the one who remained in orbit, 60 miles above the moon in the Apollo command module, waiting for his crewmates, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, to return from the lunar surface.
He did not mind his solitary time aboard the spacecraft, which was named Columbia.
"I had this beautiful little domain," Mr. Collins said. "It was all mine. I was the emperor, the captain of it, and it was quite commodious. I had warm coffee, even."
Unlike half a billion people on Earth, Mr. Collins did not see the broadcast of Mr. Armstrong's first steps on the moon.
There was no television in the command module. Even if there were, he would still not have seen it. Mr. Collins was above the far side of the moon at that moment, cut off from all communications, and he missed Mr. Armstrong's legendary words: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
Mr. Collins spoke of his life as a NASA astronaut in the 1960s in a series of interviews, two with New York Times journalists and one with the playwright J. T. Rogers as part of research for a play commissioned by The Times. He discussed other questions he has often been asked, too.
What was the mood as you sat on the launchpad awaiting liftoff on July 16, 1969?
"I was thinking of per diem, you know, how many dollars per mile we'd be paid for this voyage," he joked.
More seriously, he said he was carefully completing tasks on his checklist. "I was nervous about getting every syllable of it exactly right," he said. "Because this was going to be the day. This was no fooling around. This was it."
Was he worried as Mr. A rmstrong and Mr. Aldrin undocked and headed for the moon's surface in the lunar module?
"I thought it would go well," Mr. Collins said. "I thought, Neil is a very competent pilot, and the surface as we knew it presented some obstacles but it also presented a lot of nice flat landing zones."
The landing turned out to be more nerve-racking than anticipated when the landing area, thought to be a smooth plain, was strewn with boulders. Mr. Armstrong searched for a clear spot and finally landed with less than 30 seconds of fuel left.
Mr. Collins was more worried about their return.
If something went wrong with the lunar module's ascent engine, Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin might be stuck on the lunar surface or in a crazy orbit; Mr. Collins would try to maneuver to retrieve them.
Mr. Collins said that around his neck he had a packet outlining 18 contingency plans.
"What happens if they veer this way, that way, the other way?" he said. "Some of them were so outlandish, we never really practiced them."
What would he have done if he were unable to bring Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin home?
"I was not going to commit suicide. I was coming home by myself. And they knew that," he said. "I didn't have to discuss it with them, and they didn't have to discuss it with me. But it would not have been a good trip home."
What did he say to Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin when they successfully returned to the command module?
Mr. Collins recalled that he was not entirely happy to see them.
"They were dirty," he said. "You know, from their knees down, their nice white suits had all this grimy goo on them from the rocks and dust on the moon. And I thought, Oh, I'm going to bring that into the command module; I have to clean everything up."
But Mr. Collins says he does not remember what he said as they entered: "I don't know. I've been asked that question so many times that if I ever knew the answer, I've lost it."
Three days later, the Apollo 11 capsule splashed down in the Pacific.
"I was just amazed that all those mechanical little bits and pieces worked exactly as advertised," he said, "and we were able to carry off what John F. Kennedy had told us to do without a hitch."
______
Mr. Collins is 88 years old now. He was 38 when he kept his vigil during the moon landing. All three Apollo 11 astronauts were born in 1930.
"We came along at exactly the right time," Mr. Collins wrote in the 2009 preface to "Carrying the Fire," his meticulous accounting of Apollo 11 first published in 1979. "Just lucky, the right place at the right time."
Like most of NASA's early astronauts, he had been a test pilot for the United States Air Force. When he applied to NASA in 1962, he was rejected. He applied again a year later and was accepted.
Astronaut training included trips to the Grand Canyon to learn the basics of geology and survival training in the jungle in case the landing ended far off course.
"When I signed up to be an astronaut, I really did not know and had not asked what some of the training venues might be," Mr. Collins said. "You know if someone told me I'd be eating iguana lizards in the Panamanian jungle, I would have said, 'Was that really necessary?"'
His first spaceflight was Gemini 10, one of the Apollo precursor missions during which NASA figured out the details of orbital maneuvers like docking.
That he ended up on Apollo 11 was the serendipity of back surgery.
Mr. Collins was originally assigned to be command module pilot of Apollo 8, which became the first mission to orbit (but not land on) the moon. But he started having trouble walking, caused by disk herniation in his spine. James Lovell replaced Mr. Collins on Apollo 8.
The surgery was successful, and Mr. Collins was reassigned to Apollo 11.
He could have had a third spaceflight as commander of Apollo 17. But even before Apollo 11 launched, he decided he wanted to leave the program because life as an astronaut took him away from his family. He told Deke Slayton of the astronaut office, who had been one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts, "If everything goes exactly as planned, I'm out of here."
After Mr. Collins left NASA in 1970, he served as assistant secretary of state for public affairs and then director of the National Air and Space Museum, overseeing the construction of the current building on the National Mall in Washington.
Today, Mr. Collins still remembers the view of the moon as they closed in.
"It filled up a whole window, and it was absolutely three-dimensional," he said. "The lights a lot lighter, the darks a lot darker, the delineation of them so clear. The sunlight was behind, and the sunlight was cascading 360 degrees around the rim of the moon. It made the most glorious spectacle you've ever seen in your life."
But it is the view of Earth from 230,000 miles away, blue and white with a smudge of tan, that made more of a mark on him. "The thing that really surprised me was that it projected an air of fragility," he said. "And why, I don't know. I don't know to this day. I had a feeling it's tiny, it's shiny, it's beautiful, it's home, and it's fragile."

Texto completo: Ahora resulta que otra persona reclama ser quien presentó al presidente Donald Trump y a la primera dama Melania Trump .
En el libro “El método de la locura: el ascenso de Donald Trump según lo dicho por aquellos que fueron contratados, despedidos, inspirados e investidos” , escrito por Allen Salkin y Aaron Short se afirma que el empresario italiano Paolo Zampolli fue quien a la pareja presidencia.
La información fue revelada en Page Six y desmiente los reportes The New York Times de que supuestamente Jeffrey Epstein –acusado de tráfico sexual de menores– afirmó haber presentado al presidente Trump y a su ahora esposa en 1998.
Según el relato de Salkin y Short preguntaron al empresario Zampolli, si Epstein había asistido a la fiesta donde supuestamente se conoció la pareja presidencial.
“¡De ninguna manera!” , fue su respuesta. Agregó que la noticia de que Epstein había presentado al mandatario y la exmodelo fueron calificadas de falsas.
De esa afirmación, lo único que no cambió fue que la pareja se conoció durante una fiesta en la Semana de la Moda.
La Primera Dama ha contado que conoció a Trump en el Kit Kat Club en Nueva York en 1998 .
Reportes indican que en aquel entonces, la exmodelo no tenía suficiente dinero, por lo que conocer al empresario neoyorquino fue “su salvación”.

Staying put in first home in the suburbs

Texto completo: It was 1964. I was six months' pregnant with my third child, and my husband and I realized we needed to move from our one-bedroom apartment in Jackson Heights - and soon.
We had no clue where to move, but since many of the people we knew lived on Long Island, we thought we would look there.
School districts? What did that even mean? Neighborhoods? We had no clue. We saw some listings in The New York Times and one of them gave an address on Old Country Road. Well, that sounded kind of suburban, didn't it?
We called one of my husband's work colleagues and asked him about a place on "Old Country Road."
He replied, "That's a main drag."
Main drag? What does that mean?
He went on to explain that the address was probably that of a real estate broker, not a private home. OK, so now we knew we should find a real estate broker to help this clueless couple.
We drove around, as chance would have it, in the Roslyn area. There on a corner of Willis Avenue was a real estate broker. We went into the office, where we found an affable salesman who began to show us three-bedroom homes that were for sale in the neighborhood.
At this point I was, to say the least, confused, tired and very pregnant - and wishing this process was over. There was a light at the end of the tunnel, however, when we found a nice house on a street named for a fruit tree. It sounds so countrylike! How could we resist this house on such a street after living in apartments on streets designated with just plain numbers?
We bought the house and settled into the three bedrooms, one for 3-year-old Joy and one for 13-month-old Gary - the yet to be born, Lesley, whose gender was unknown in utero, would share with Gary or Joy. 
What was my first gleeful discovery? The dishwasher! Never having had one, I felt I'd reached the ultimate in homeownership.
When child No. 4 (Kenneth) arrived five years later, we realized it was time to expand the house.
Years went by, the kids grew up and out. I had a new husband, and life was completely different.
I am still in the same place, rattling around in a four-bedroom house by myself. The sounds of children and the voice of my husband are memories now, and I wouldn't think of moving from this house - ever.
Nancy Fadem,
Roslyn

Texto completo: Business owners are offering rides to work for employees living in the country illegally. Neighbors are buying groceries for people too nervous to go out and shop. Mothers are gently trying to tell their children they might have to be apart for a little while.
Reports that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is planning to launch nationwide raids over this weekend and arrest thousands of undocumented immigrants have sparked alarm and uncertainty in immigrant communities in Massachusetts, causing many to retreat to the shadows in fear.
“Nobody knows what to do," said Yocelen, 22, who gave only her first name to avoid detection. She crossed the border a year ago after leaving Guatemala with her 5-year-old son and now lives in the Boston area.
“They don't know if they can go out and even go shopping because they don't know if [ICE] will grab you," Yocelen said.
The operation is expected to take place over multiple days in at least 10 major cities, according to The New York Times, which first reported the planned raids.
Mayor Martin J. Walsh said Boston was not among the targeted cities, but immigrant advocates said no one knows what, exactly, to expect in Massachusetts. The administration has taken a hard line on illegal immigration and has vowed to step up deportations to discourage illegal immigration at the southwestern border. But last month, the administration threatened to carry out raids against undocumented families before agreeing to delay its plans at the last minute.
“The panic that's out there is alarming," said Gladys Ortiz, who works at REACH, a nonprofit that helps victims of domestic violence and works closely with immigrants and their families. Ortiz said her phone has been ringing constantly with calls from frightened immigrants, including a mother of five who called in tears, asking if she could find space for her family at a shelter for a few days.
“My head is like. 'Oh my God,' " Ortiz said. Women “keep calling me and ask, 'What am I going to do? What am I going to do?' "
On Friday, President Trump told reporters the raids will focus on criminals but acknowledged that his administration would arrest anyone who came to the United States illegally.
The sweeps are meant to target immigrants facing deportation orders but will include “collateral" deportations of undocumented immigrants who are present during targeted arrests, according to The New York Times.
In East Boston, an “emergency community education session" is scheduled for Saturday at the public library on South Bremen Street. On Thursday, people packed the office of the consulate of El Salvador in East Boston, where representatives from countries such as Honduras, Peru, Columbia, and Mexico gathered to provide immigrants information about their rights.
About 250,000 unauthorized immigrants live in Massachusetts, according to a 2016 estimate by the Pew Research Center.
Walsh said city police would have no role in helping ICE detain immigrants. In Chelsea, which has a high concentration of immigrants, Police Chief Brian Kyes offered similar assurances.
“The enforcement of our nation's civil immigration laws are the primary responsibility of the federal government," Kyes said in a statement. “Accordingly, all Chelsea residents can be assured that the officers of the Chelsea Police Department shall not and will not undertake or become involved in any civil immigration-related investigations that do not have a direct nexus to criminal activity."
Around East Boston, residents in the largely immigrant neighborhood said they have been on high alert for days.
José Goméz, who owns a convenience store in East Boston, has offered to deliver goods from his store to fearful customers who have not left their homes in days. He has at least six employees who are unauthorized immigrants, and he has offered to drive them all into work so they can minimize the risk of arrest.
“It's stressful," Goméz said. “We have to try to help them."
Wilder Cerrate, 19, thought of his cousins as he stood outside the East Boston Social Centers where he had just picked up his sister from an after-school program.
Cerrate, who is in the country legally, said he is worried about what will happen to family members who are not.
“It's just bracing yourself for impact," Cerrate said.
People are “practicing their lines," he said, by reminding themselves they do not have to answer their doors unless an ICE officer has a court order or warrant signed by a judge.
“We try to keep calm," Cerrate said. “We try not to let it take over our whole lives. It's a type of calm where you actively have anxiety in the back of your head."
Rosa, a 42-year-old Guatemalan woman who is living with her 20-year-old daughter, said she is trying to be pragmatic and maintain her regular life.
“We have to keep working," said Rosa. “We have to make money to buy food, clothes, and shoes."
Rosa, who asked to be identified by just her first name, said her daughter is terrified of going to work this weekend at her job tending to the grounds of golf courses. Rosa, who cleans offices and houses for a living, advised her daughter to go to work.
“Ask God for help," she said she told her. “Only God can protect us."
Yocelen, the young Guatemalan woman, said she won't dare leave her apartment.
“I don't even want to go out on the street for fear that [ICE] will take me away," she said. She dreads returning to Guatemala, which she fled after drug dealers threatened her and came to her home because police told them she had reported their activities to the authorities.
“They'll kill me," Yocelen said. “They never forget anything."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Speaking for over 30 minutes in the hot sun on Friday morning, President Trump lashed out at his critics in no particular order, heaping vitriol on everyone from Democrats running for president to the former Republican House speaker, not to mention a foreign ambassador and the press.
The president conducted his impromptu news conference after announcing the resignation of R. Alexander Acosta, the secretary of labor. Mr. Trump spoke over the loud roar of Marine One idling on the South Lawn of the White House, with Mr. Acosta smiling awkwardly at his side.
[Read about Mr. Acosta's resignation over the Jeffrey Epstein plea deal.]
The thing that bound Mr. Trump's disparate group of targets together was their recent public airing -- intended or not -- of something negative about Mr. Trump, or what he viewed as a critical portrayal of his policies.
Paul D. Ryan, the former Republican speaker of the House who left Congress in January, recently unloaded on Mr. Trump in a new book by Tim Alberta, describing him as a leader who "didn't know anything about government" and saying he "wanted to scold him all the time." Mr. Ryan described leaving government as an "escape hatch" he used to avoid two more years of working with Mr. Trump.
Mr. Ryan's comments appeared almost to be designed to illicit a rejoinder from a reactive president, and Mr. Trump dutifully engaged, calling Mr. Ryan a politician who was "not a talent," "unable to raise money" or get subpoenas, "when Nancy Pelosi hands them out like they're cookies."
Mr. Trump, always sensitive to the idea of former political allies making money off their onetime association with him, also implied that Mr. Ryan was getting paid for talking to Mr. Alberta and said that "the only success Paul Ryan had was the time he was with me."
Moving on to other targets, Mr. Trump said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has been trying to sell himself to Democrats as the levelheaded antidote to Mr. Trump, is "weak and ineffective," adding, "President Xi laughs at guys like that." He said that Mr. Xi, the president of China, and other foreign leaders "go to bed at night and they pray that Joe Biden, or somebody like him, becomes president."
Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who is also running for president and has coined the term "Con Don" for his onetime constituent, "doesn't work very hard," Mr. Trump said. "Nobody knows what the hell he does."
When it came to Kim Darroch, the British ambassador who resigned on Monday after the leak of a confidential email in which he described the Trump administration as "clumsy and inept," Mr. Trump said he wished him well. That was only after berating him on Twitter as a "very stupid guy" and a "pompous fool." Mr. Trump's change of tone came, he said, because he was told that Mr. Darroch "actually said very good things about me" and "was sort of referring to other people" in the leaked cable.
"But they've got to stop their leaking problems," Mr. Trump warned the British embassy.
Mr. Trump condemned two freshman congresswomen who are frequent critics of the administration, Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, capitalizing on an intraparty feud that has gripped the House majority. The freshman Democrats have accused Ms. Pelosi of singling them out for criticism because they are women of color.
[Read about the tensions between Ms. Pelosi and progressive Democrats.]
Ms. Omar "shouldn't even be in office" Mr. Trump said, noting that the Muslim congresswoman is part of a group of freshman Democrats who "I don't even know where they come from." He also dinged Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for her chilly relationship with Ms. Pelosi, the speaker of the House. "I think Cortez is being very disrespectful to somebody that's been there a long time," he said.
Mr. Trump also offered an unusual defense of Ms. Pelosi, whom in the past he has called "Crazy Nancy," noting that "she is not a racist. For them to call her a racist is a disgrace."
But he saved perhaps the greatest ad hominem attack of the morning for his perpetual foil, The New York Times, a newspaper that Mr. Trump singled out for a report on the conditions in Border Patrol detention centers.
"They have phony sources," he said. "I almost cried about that phony story," he said, calling The Times a "very dishonest newspaper. What they do is a tremendous disservice to this country. They are truly the enemy of the people." The Times, in a statement last week, said it was "confident in the accuracy of our reporting on the U.S. Border Patrol's detention centers."
[Read about conditions inside the detention center in Clint, Tex.]
Mr. Trump said that Vice President Mike Pence would be visiting detention centers to view the conditions there firsthand. "And that was my idea," he said. "I'd love to be there."
Then, finally he sent Mr. Acosta off with a handshake and a backslap, sending him back into the White House, before trudging across the lawn and finally boarding his helicopter.

Texto completo: Valley News Staff Writer
The characters in Lindsey Stoddard’s first novel, Just Like Jackie, live in a small Vermont town. They shop at a country store called Dean and Walt’s. The community’s children, including the novel’s protagonist, 11-year-old Robinson Hart, attend elementary school in the center of town. The Appalachian Trail also makes an appearance.
“There’s all sorts of Norwich goodies in there,” Stoddard said. “I loved Vermont and it defined so much of who I was. I was a Vermonter and I kept it in my heart.”
For Stoddard, the places she has lived and loved drive her middle-grade novels. Her latest, Right as Rain — released in February — is set in the New York City neighborhood of Washington Heights, where Stoddard worked as a teacher. Her third novel Brave Like That, is currently in production and takes place in a small town similar to Northfield, Minn., where Stoddard attended Carleton College.
“Those are my three home places in the world,” Stoddard said. “I have a book for each of the spots I love in the world.”
Stoddard, 35, lived in Norwich during middle and high school, graduating from Hanover High in 2002. After graduating from Carleton, Stoddard headed to New York City to work as an English teacher. She now lives in Shelburne, Vt., with her husband and their two young children.
“It was just a wild culture shock,” Stoddard recalled about moving to 152nd Street to teach in Washington Heights. “A lot of the reason I really loved New York was because of that classroom.”
Stoddard became enamored of her middle school students. She was intrigued by their backgrounds and the stories they shared with her.
“They’re at an age where they feel things so big,” Stoddard said. When they are happy, they are overwhelmingly so; when they are frustrated, they express it in a big way. “They don’t shy away from the big stuff. They want to talk about all of it.”
Stoddard began to write stories for the students in her class based on their ideas.
“I would go home and write a page and bring it back,” said Stoddard, who spent 10 years teaching in New York City. “The story would just kind of live in the classroom for a while.”
Those experiences also got Stoddard thinking about her own childhood dreams and pursuing them.
“My first dream job was to be a teacher. My second dream job was to be a writer,” Stoddard said. “It wasn’t until I met my middle school students in Washington Heights that I knew I wanted to write for middle grade.”
While still teaching, Stoddard wrote a book based on the life of one of her students. She sent it to agents, who all responded with the same critique: “ ‘We love your writing, but the story’s not working,’ ” Stoddard recalled, but they encouraged her to try again.
She did, with advice from her adviser at the Vermont College of Fine Arts: “ ‘Try writing for 10-, 11-year-old Lindsey … you might come across more honestly in your writing.’ ”
Stoddard tapped into 11-year-old Robinson’s story in what would become Just Like Jackie. She started with the relationship between Robinson and her African-American grandfather who is raising her on his own and struggling with a memory disorder. Stoddard thought back to adolescent Lindsey, who would sit with her grandfather and not know “exactly how to react when he would lose the end of his sentences,” she said. “I remember as a 10-year-old that was really scary.”
Stoddard adored her grandfather and, like Robinson, developed a great appreciation for nature from him.
“All the stuff that Robbie knows in the book, I know from my grandpa,” Stoddard said. “He was the one who sort of made me fall in love with the woods.”
Just Like Jackie evolved to explore Robinson’s lineage and her anger issues. It focused on the relationships Robinson built with her peers and the adults in her life, learning to trust more people than just her grandfather. In true Vermont — and Norwich — fashion, Robinson’s community rallies around her and her grandfather when they are in trouble.
When Stoddard sent her book out to agents the response was more positive.
“I got yeses from everybody,” Stoddard said. Just Like Jackie went to auction and was bought by Harper, which published it in 2018.
Her second novel, Right as Rain, focuses on 11-year-old Rain Andrews, who relocates from a small Vermont town to New York City with her parents after the death of her older brother, Guthrie. Rain blames herself for his death. Stoddard recalled helping her brother sneak out of their house when he was 15 and she was 11.
“I was always the more straight-edge, follow-the-rules type of kid and he was a little bit more daring,” Stoddard said. “I stayed up that night worrying and worrying and worrying.”
Stoddard used that moment as the basis for Right as Rain, which was reviewed favorably by The New York Times.
Rain’s new school is in Washington Heights and is based on the one that Stoddard taught at.
“Right as Rain is a bit of a love letter to that school and to Washington Heights,” Stoddard said.
Brave Like That, scheduled to be published next year, takes place in Minnesota. The protagonist is 11-year-old Cyrus, who was left at a fire station as a baby and adopted by one of the firefighters.
Stoddard is currently brainstorming her fourth book by “listening for the voice” of her protagonist, which has guided her first three novels.
“I’m just getting bits and pieces of her,” Stoddard said. “It’s always really exciting once I start to hear her.”

Buttigieg, struggling with black voters, releases plan to address racial inequities

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Pete Buttigieg, whose presidential campaign is struggling to appeal to African-American voters even as it gains more support from Democratic donors, on Thursday released a plan to “dismantle racist structures and systems" in the federal government.
Buttigieg's announcement comes after weeks of scrutiny of his record on racial justice as mayor of South Bend, Ind., where a white police officer shot and killed a black man last month.
The episode turned into a severe test of his leadership, spawning protests among South Bend's black residents and raising questions about his handling of policing issues in the city. Buttigieg suspended his campaign for several days to return and meet with members of the black community.
Buttigieg has offered a frank acknowledgment of his shortcomings in this area, saying during last month's debate that he has not done a sufficient job recruiting police officers of color during his seven years as mayor.
“I couldn't get it done," he said.
Without increasing his standing among black voters, Buttigieg faces a difficult path to the White House. He entered the campaign largely unknown among black voters, many of whom received their first introduction to him through news about the South Bend shooting.
The policy proposal Buttigieg unveiled Thursday appeared to be a way to position himself at the forefront of efforts to reduce longstanding inequities in federal and state criminal justice systems.
The plan includes health, education, and voting-rights reforms. But it is particularly focused on addressing discrimination in policing and criminal justice.
His goals include many of the major changes sought by liberal criminal justice reform groups, and in some cases conservative groups as well.
They include eliminating federal incarceration for drug possession and reducing sentences for other drug offenses; legalizing marijuana at the federal level; limiting solitary confinement; and abolishing the death penalty and mandatory minimum sentencing.
Buttigieg also called for the establishment of several measures specifically addressing policing: tightening the legal standard for police officers to use deadly force; creating a federal database of officers fired from police departments; and persuading states to disclose more data on use of force, line-of-duty deaths, traffic stops, and officer misconduct.
Derek Cohen, the director of Right on Crime, a leader in conservative efforts to reform the criminal justice system, estimated that 20 percent of Buttigieg's proposals were within the purview of the federal government. The rest are squarely within the authority of state and local officials, he said.

Price tag for Trump's July 4 event hits $5.4m
WASHINGTON — President Trump's July Fourth extravaganza — featuring tanks, a military flyover, and a Trump speech at the Lincoln Memorial — cost an estimated $5.4 million, according to rough figures Thursday.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt provided the latest share of costs, $2.45 million for his agency, in a letter to lawmakers, saying his agency pulled money from operating funds for national parks, recreation fees, and another source to help fund Trump's Salute to America.
The event included donated fireworks, a military flyover, and Trump's speech to a rained-on crowd at the Lincoln Memorial.
Trump announced Monday he would do it all again next year, calling the event "remarkable."
Democratic lawmakers have condemned the extra expenditures for the Independence Day celebration, which came in addition to the traditional concert, fireworks, and events held near the US Capitol.
Arizona Democratic Representative Raul Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and one of several Democrats who had demanded a full cost accounting, said in response to Interior's funding estimates that the public funds were spent to "celebrate President Trump."
Bernhardt called the use of public funds justified, and cited past administrations' spending for concerts, parades, and other celebrations in and around the National Mall. Interior's costs included crowd accommodations such as temporary fencing and portable toilets.
In addition, the Department of Defense says its costs came to $1.2 million. Despite repeated requests, the Pentagon as of Thursday refused to provide a precise breakdown.
The military's efforts included positioning tanks on flat-bed trailers around the capital, meeting Trump's desire for tanks while minimizing damage to district roads from the heavy armor.
Separately, Washington Mayor Muriel E. Bowser wrote Trump to say the district's costs for Trump's July Fourth event have drained a special fund used to provide security and protect the nation's capital from terrorist threats.
The District of Columbia estimates it spent about $1.7 million, not including police expenses for related demonstrations.
Bowser wrote Trump that the fund will have a $6 million deficit by September, reminding the president that the account was never reimbursed for $7.3 million in expenses from Trump's 2017 inauguration.
White House spokesman Judd Deere says officials will respond "in a timely manner."

Joint Chiefs nominee says keep troops in Afghanistan
WASHINGTON — Pulling American troops prematurely from Afghanistan would be a "strategic mistake," the Army general nominated to be Joint Chiefs chairman told senators Thursday. Mark Milley also said the United States should keep a "modest number" of forces in Iraq and Syria for now to maintain stability.
Milley assured the Senate Armed Services Committee that he will give his candid advice to President Trump regardless of any potential consequences to himself.
"We've buried soldiers. Arlington is full of our comrades. We understand absolutely full well the hazards of our chosen profession," Milley said, in response to questions from Senator Angus King, Independent of Maine, about whether he would be willing to tell Trump that he thought the president was wrong on any issue. "We know what this is about and we are not going to be intimidated into making stupid decisions."
The 61-year-old Milley, who is Trump's pick to replace General Joseph Dunford, said "no one, ever" would intimidate him.

Texto completo: It looked like change was eminent in Queens politics, but a voter recount might say otherwise. Two weeks ago, public defender Tiffany Cabán declared victory in the Democratic primary for Queens district attorney. She emerged from a trove of candidates with 39.6 percent of the vote. Queens Borough President Melinda Katz ended the night right behind her at 38.3 percent.
Katz said that she'd wait for the recount before conceding although she might not have to concede at all.
Despite having a 1,100-vote deficit after primary night, Katz held out for the Queens Board of Elections to count the 3,400 paper absentee and affidavit ballots. With a combo of those ballots plus votes being thrown out based on technicalities, Katz had a 30-vote lead (that's now down to 16). Starting this Tuesday, the BOE started counting 91,000 votes by hand while Cabán and Katz's people went to court to fight over 114 thrown out affidavit ballots. BOE officials said that the recount would take 10 days.
In a statement, Caban's campaign spokesperson Monica Klein said that the BOE made a mistake by throwing out ballots and vowed to continue to fight to have the ballots counted.
"As we have said from the beginning, and as the New York Times agreed today, every valid vote in this election must be counted. Over the coming days and weeks, we will continue to fight in court and at the Board of Elections to make sure Queens voters are not disenfranchised. Melinda Katz said on election night that every vote should be counted. We hope her campaign will join us in court to make sure that happens-and join our call on Governor Cuomo to quickly sign already-passed legislation that could prevent otherwise valid votes from being thrown out by technicalities.
"We remain confident that when all the votes are counted, we will win," Klein concluded.
Klein's sentiments were also uttered by New York Working Families Party State Director Bill Lipton. In an emailed statement, Lipton said that the BOE is on the verge of disenfranchising eligible voters.
"There is pending legislation that could help ensure that these voters are protected. We ask Melinda Katz to demonstrate her commitment to democratic values by joining us to ask that the Assembly forward the bill to the executive chamber for the governor's signature," said Lipton. "Common sense dictates that where the will and intent of an eligible voter is clear, that vote should be counted. This bill wifi bring us closer to common-sense and inclusive voting rights for New Yorkers."
But not all agree. NewYork State Sen. Leroy Comrie said that Caban's people haven't been forthright with their motives during the recount.
"I think Team Caban's been very disingenuous about every level of the count," said Comrie. "It's been transparent. The press and media have been there every day. Her lawyers admitted twice that the process was fair and transparent."
Comrie also accused Caban's campaign of trying to reinstall ballots from parts of Queens more favorable to the public defender.
"They tried to cherry pick districts where they had a chance of getting a better outcome," continued Comrie. "It's been a horrible social media campaign full of lies and deliberate disingenuousness. There were people who voted who were registered Republicans or Independents. They're just trying to tell lies and spin the story. I'm disappointed in the campaign."
Caban's campaign floated the idea that more than 2,000 votes were unjustly purged leading to Katz's current lead.
Last Friday, Katz put out a statement declaring victory once the lead swung to her side.
"We said from the beginning that every vote needs to be counted and that every voter needs to be heard, and now we see clearly why this must always be the case," stated Katz. "I am proud to have been chosen as the Democratic nominee for Queens District Attorney. We know that these numbers can and will be subject to recount, and there may be legal challenges, but what matters most is the will of Queens voters."
NewYork City Mayor Bill de Blasio stepped into the mix suggesting that state officials look into the Caban's campaign's claims about the affidavit ballots despite the accusations being unsubstantiated.
The Queens district attorney race has garnered national attention due to key endorsements. Cabán was endorsed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, presidential candidates Bemie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the New York Times.
Katz kept her endorsements local with 32BJ SEIU, CWA Local 1180, the United Federation of Teachers, 1199 SEIU andTWU Local 100.
Keith Wright, current leader of the New York County Democrats, said that he found it peculiar that a local race would make national news.
"It's just not done," said Wright. "I applaud the Cabán camp for I guess getting that exposure. But it's just not done at all. This race is a community race. It's Forest Hills. It's East Elmhurst. It's Bayside. It's Southeast Queens. I don't think Elizabeth Warren could tell you where East Elmhurst is."
However, no matter the endorsements, the recounts will determine the next Queens district attorney. NewYork City Council Member Adrienne Adams said that she's confident that the recount will be handled fairly.
"With such a razor-thin margin between the candidates, it is imperative that every valid vote be counted and the conspiracy rhetoric by individuals that don't necessarily live in Queens or NewYork City proper be tamped down," said Adams.
NewYork Gty Council Member Donovan Richaids said he wanted the in-party fighting to stop.
"There is a set process by law that must be abided by and must run its course," said Richards. "What has been disappointing is the rhetoric that has come out of ensuring that all votes are counted. Melinda Katz has spent decades dedicating her life to public service, and the attacks that have been levied against her, especially in recent days; are wholly inappropriate. The language that we use matters, especially with a president who distorts the truth to further his agenda. Democrats should not match the bombastic language that's coming out of the White House with our own hyperbole."

Texto completo: WI Staff Report
Mad, the venerable humor magazine that lampooned all facets of pop culture and politics, will cease publication of new material after 67 years.
After its next two issues, the magazine reportedly will instead only fill its pages with old material, except for year-end specials. It will only be available via subscription or at comic book stores.
Mad hit a circulation peak of 2.8 million in 1973, but as it became more focused on pop culture, it steadily lost readers and relevance.
Mad's owner, DC Entertainment, declined to comment publicly on the publication's future, but writers and artists of the magazine have posted on social media platforms that it is effectively dead.
Mad influenced a generation of comedians, comic artists and writers like Art Spiegelman. Publications such as The Onion and shows such as "Saturday Night Live" and "South Park" were also heavily indebted to its satirical, smart-alecky nature.
"Mad was, 'The entire adult world is lying to you, and we are part of the adult world. Good luck to you,'" Spiegelman told The New York Times. "I think that shaped my generation."

Russian cyberthreats are a 'blinking red light'

Texto completo: National security adviser John Bolton recently declared that "we're now opening the aperture, broadening the areas we're prepared to act" in cyberspace to meet a Russian threat that extends far beyond the ballot box, costing American companies billions of dollars and posing unacceptable risks to our citizens' safety and the American way of life.
It's about time.
For years, the Russians have been preparing the digital battlefield, treating our critical infrastructure as if it were their own cyber weapons range.
Overseas they've gone even further. In 2015 and 2016, the Kremlin planted malware in Ukraine's electric grid, disrupting power for hundreds of thousands of residents in the middle of winter. Keenly aware of its capabilities and motivations, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has said that "the warning lights are blinking red again" – an allusion to CIA Director George Tenet's warning to Congress just months before 9/11.
The federal government has a fundamental responsibility to deter Russia and other state actors from holding civilian infrastructure at risk. This is precisely why reports from The New York Times that the United States is embedding "potentially crippling malware" in Russia's power grid should concern all Americans. Cyber weapons are horrible deterrents – and mimicking targeting civilian infrastructure sets a dangerous precedent for America.
Fear of punishment or retribution is a fundamental tenet of deterrence theory. And it's true, as the head of U.S. Cyber Command, Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, told a Senate panel last year, the Russians "don't fear us." But to think that Vladimir Putin fears cyber-induced power outages in Moscow is a naive and dangerous miscalculation. To the contrary, an American cyberattack against Russia's power grid would play right into the Kremlin's strategic playbook.
First, the costs to the Kremlin would pale in comparison with the benefits. The vast scale of Russia's power grids, which include a total power generation capacity of 236 gigawatts, would render the military effects of any cyberattack relatively limited while granting the Kremlin its long-awaited case study of American cyber aggression, which it would use to consolidate domestic support for more censorship policies under the guise of cybersecurity.
Furthermore, an American cyberattack against civilian infrastructure – especially a preventative one aimed at deterring Russian hackers – would erode the United States' international credibility as a champion of a free and open internet governed by universal norms of acceptable behavior. Far more than sporadic blackouts – something that isn't uncommon anyway in Russia – Putin fears a digital age in which the West writes the rules.
And finally, what better way to justify an even more persistent cyber presence in American infrastructure than in the name of self-defense? Fighting cyber with cyber is inherently escalatory, and reports of American cyber operations targeting Russia's power grid – true or not – will inevitably trigger an equal and opposite response.
Detractors argue that we must reserve the right to hold dual-use infrastructure at risk. And because Russia would depend heavily on its power grid for any attack on the United States, then we should be prepared to disrupt it at any time. But America is the most digitally dense nation in the world, and we risk establishing this norm at our own peril.
We cannot fall into the trap of applying nuclear rules of deterrence to today's Cold War of digital proportions. Cyber weapons can be a tremendous military asset, especially if used as a proportionate means of neutralizing conventional weapons – as took place last month when the Trump administration approved cyber strikes against the Iranian missile systems that took down a U.S. drone. But they are not conducive to threatening punishment. You can't parade them through public squares or test them in the desert – indeed the very knowledge of their existence by your adversaries renders them obsolete.
President Donald Trump says it's "NOT TRUE" that the United States is increasing cyberattacks on Russia's power grid. I hope he's right. No nation should target civilian infrastructure via cyberspace. It's wrong and not in our long-term national interest.

Whitewash supremacy

Texto completo: A high school in San Francisco has decided to destroy an 83-year-old Depression-era mural of George Washington because of its depictions of racial minorities.
This is odd, for the black laborers and Native Americans depicted in the artwork aren’t shown as blithe companions of their white oppressors. The mural's 13 panels include images of slaves in cotton fields and a dead Native American man lying face down on the ground at the pioneers' feet. These make it quite clear that Washington and his peers were far from perfect. Nevertheless, despite this unvarnished realism, the city's board of education voted unanimously to paint over the mural anyway.
“It’s always an issue when anyone wants to remove or cover or displace art,” Board Vice President Mark Sanchez said, the Washington Post reported, "But there are countervailing issues we had to look at as well. We believe students shouldn’t be exposed to violent imagery — that it’s degrading.”
The Works Progress Administration mural was painted in 1936 by Victor Arnautoff, an artist with communist sympathies. KQED Arts reporter Sam Lefebvre writes that “according to Arnautoff’s biographer Robert Cherny, the artist intended the mural as a ‘counter narrative,’ or a corrective rebuke to the nation’s founding mythology.” But such subtleties are lost on the late-stage social justice movement.
The itch to destroy art appears confined entirely to adults at the school. George Washington High School students, apparently untraumatized by depictions of degrading violence, nearly all support the mural. When an English teacher asked freshmen to write about it, only four out of 49 thought it should be removed. According to the New York Times, at least one student understood Arnautoff’s intention, writing, “The fresco shows us exactly how brutal colonization and genocide really were and are. The fresco is a warning and reminder of the fallibility of our hallowed leaders.”
The blinkered iconoclasts say American art habitually fails to to depict black and Native American heritage in a clear-eyed manner, but they can't see that the 1,600 foot mural does exactly that.
It will cost $600,000 to wreck the mural, which Sanchez said was small change in pursuit of "reparations." Lope Yap Jr., vice president of the schools alumni association told the Post that anti-mural activists accuse opponents of white supremacy.
He told KQED Arts that the alumni association will sue if necessary. A meeting of minds seems unlikely. "Anything less than whitewashing, for the opposition, would be a compromise," he said.Story URL

Armstrong’s post-Apollo life

Texto completo: WAPAKONETA - Approximately 400 people had the opportunity Thursday to learn about the life of Neil Armstrong after the moon landing from an expert in aerospace and the history of science and technology.
The 2019 Celebration Committee hosted the presentation “Reluctantly Famous: The Post-Apollo Life of Neil Armstrong” by Dr. James R. Hansen at Wapakoneta Middle School. This year marks the 50-year anniversary of Armstrong’s Apollo 11 moon landing, and activities are planned through July 21 to help commemorate that historic event.
Hansen is emeritus professor of history at Auburn University in Alabama. He has published a dozen books and numerous articles covering topics such as the early days of aviation, the history of aerospace engineering, NASA, the mood landings, the Space Shuttle program and China’s role in space. He is a Fort Wayne native.
Hansen’s “First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong” is the only authorized biography of Armstrong. The book spent three weeks as a New York Times best seller and garnered major book awards, including the AIAA’s Eugene E. Emme Astronautical Prize, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’ Gardner-Lasser Literature Award. A film adaption of “First Man” starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong premiered in October 2016 and earned major awards.
He said it took two years to get the green light for Armstrong to approve the book about his life that was published in 2005. He had 55 hours of recorded tapes of interviews from Armstrong talking about his life after the moon landing and had access to Armstrong’s papers and also archives from NASA and military archives. Photos were shown from the 1969 parade during Thursday’s event.
“A lot of people thought Neil became a recluse and stayed away from the public after he landed on the moon, but he did a lot of things,” Hansen said. He said Armstrong did his best he could to lead a normal life, but it was hard with all his popularity.
Hansen informed the audience that Armstrong taught aeorspace engineering at the University of Cincinnati from 1971 to 1979. He wanted to find a way to get out of the spotlight and Washington, get back into engineering and be around young people, Hansen said.
“One of the more prominent things he did was he was chair of the Rogers Commission that looked into the Space Shuttle Challenger accident,” Hansen said.
Hansen said once the moon landing ended, Armstrong became a global icon. People would project things on him and tell stories about him that weren’t true.
Will Snyder, Wapakoneta Middle School principal, and his 6-year-old son, William attended the event.
“The opportunities we are getting to learn about this can light a spark for someone. You never know who the next engineer or hero will be,” Snyder said.
At the end of the presentation, Hansen sold and signed copies of his book.

AOC clarifies: Pelosi is ‘absolutely not’ racist

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez clarified remarks she made suggesting Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was racist for disrespecting women of color.
“No, no, absolutely not, absolutely not," the New York Democrat said Thursday in regards to whether she believed Pelosi was racist according to CNN. Tweet
The freshman congresswoman had said the day before that Pelosi was "outright disrespectful" to women of color.
“But the persistent singling out ... it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful ... the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color," Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday.
The feud between Ocasio-Cortez and Pelosi rekindled after the senior lawmaker told the New York Times in an interview Friday that Ocasio-Cortez and her allies have no real power.
“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” the California Democrat said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”
The freshman congresswoman responded initially by accusing Pelosi of ignoring the American people.
Tweet Tweet
"That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country," Ocasio-Cortez said. "I find it strange when members act as though social media isn’t important. They set millions of dollars on fire to run TV ads so people can see their message. I haven’t dialed for dollars *once* this year, & have more time to do my actual job. Yet we’d rather campaign like it’s 2008."
Pelosi held a closed-door meeting this week in which she chided Democratic members for tweeting about other members in the caucus.
She said she was particularly upset at Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti suggesting on Twitter suggesting that moderate Democrats were akin to southern segregationists in the 1940s.Story URLPhoto Caption:Rep.

Texto completo: Las comunidades inmigrantes del sur de California están nuevamente en vilo por las amenazas que se revivieron hoy sobre los posibles operativos que tienenn en la mira a más de 2,000 personas que ya han recibido órdenes de deportación , según el artículo publicado por el New York Times.
El diario además indicó, citando a dos funcionarios y a un extrabajador del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS, en inglés), que pidieron el anonimato, que las redadas estarán a cargo de personal del Servicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE).
Ante el temor generado por dichas declaraciones, el gobernador de California, Gavin Newsom , envió un mensaje en el cual rechazó nuevamente las redadas que infunden temor y ansiedad en la población del Estado Dorado.
Newsom se sumó a las críticas de otros alcalde y gobernadores y reconoció que los rumores están aumentando la “ansiedad” en la comunidad migrante y urgió a prepararse para cualquier contingencia con ICE, pues es “vital” saber que los indocumentados también tienen derechos.
“Sólo quiero decir a las personas que están ansiosas por los que pueden tocar a su puerta: cuando hablamos de que conozcas tus derechos, no abras la puerta. Sin una orden de registro, no tienes que abrir la puerta”, dijo el mandatario.
Rumors of mass ICE raids in major cities this weekend is stirring up anxiety within our immigrant communities.
My message to each of you: Regardless of your immigration status, be prepared. It’s critical that you know your rights.https://t.co/c2PNxfks2B pic.twitter.com/vvObO56I5B
— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) July 11, 2019
California, el estado con mayor número de indocumentados, cuenta con dos ciudades que grandes ciudades que podrían estar en el blanco de las próximas redadas de ICE: Los Ángeles y San Francisco. Otras urbes donde podrían ocurrir esas redadas son Chicago (Illinois), Baltimore (Maryland), Nueva York (Nueva York), Houston (Texas), y Miami (Florida).
Un día después de que las autoridades estadounidenses confirmarán un leve descenso en la detención de inmigrantes en la frontera, del que se puede inferir un retroceso en el paso de indocumentados, medios de comunicación locales informaron del comienzo a partir del domingo de las temidas operaciones en al menos diez de la principales ciudades del país.
A mediados de junio, el presidente, Donald Trump , había anunciado por Twitter que ICE iniciaría un proceso para deportar a “millones” de indocumentados, decisión que dejó en suspenso escasas horas de la fecha anticipada por medios locales para el comienzo de esas operaciones.

How Jeffrey Epstein made himself into a 'Harvard man'

Texto completo: Before Jeffrey Epstein was disgraced — before he was arrested this month and charged with sex trafficking dozens of minors, before he received a slap on the wrist in 2008 for molesting girls at his mansion in Palm Beach, Fla. — he aimed to be a Harvard man.
He contributed millions to the university, reportedly funding the construction of Harvard Hillel's building, and helping to establish the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. He frequented an office blocks from campus, and flew up in his private plane to host seminars there with some of Harvard's most prominent professors, according to Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus professor of law at Harvard who served as one of Epstein's lawyers. Among Epstein's close associates, according to a 2003 Harvard Crimson article, were former president Lawrence Summers, former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry Rosovsky, and professor emeritus of psychology Stephen Kosslyn.
“He had a close connection to Harvard," said Dershowitz, who helped negotiate the generous plea deal with prosecutors in Florida. Two women have alleged that Epstein directed them to have sex with Dershowitz; he denies ever meeting them.
Epstein savored his university ties. He was photographed wearing a crimson sweatshirt, “Harvard" emblazoned in white letters across his chest. As recently as 2014, Epstein's foundation issued press releases referring to him as a “Harvard mogul," and “renowned science and Harvard investor."
But Epstein was not, exactly, a Harvard mogul. He was not a Harvard alum, a Harvard professor, or a Harvard parent.
Instead, he seems to have simply chosen Harvard to be his, adding it to a collection of prized objects that would reflect glory back upon him, like the photographs of famous people displayed in his New York home, the lavish properties he amassed from Manhattan to the Caribbean, and the young girls he allegedly hunted down. Some have likened him to a sinister Jay Gatsby, whose stories about himself don't always line up with the truth.
Now that Epstein is once again facing criminal charges alleging that he sexually abused a vast network of underage girls, his lengthy relationship with Harvard, and his touting of that relationship, shine a light on the role the university played, however unintentionally, in burnishing Epstein's reputation and status even as he committed serious crimes.
“The Epstein case makes very clear what Harvard and other institutions like it are selling: reflected prestige and reputational glow to people who need it, which is often people who have sinned greatly and violated law or conscience," said Anand Giridharadas, author of the book “Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World."
“If you do something awful, and you need not to make things right, but to make your reputation change, Harvard is like a drive-through providing that service," Giridharadas said.
Epstein was charged by federal prosecutors in New York this week with sexually abusing dozens of girls between 2002 and 2005. He had been accused of similar crimes in Palm Beach, but in that case, prosecutors ended up negotiating a secret deal with Epstein's lawyers that required him to plead guilty to just two prostitution charges in state court. The Miami Herald, in a blockbuster investigation last year, reported that more than 80 women said they were victimized by Epstein.
But at least one thing is clear: For decades, Harvard was a central part of Epstein's story.
Even after he was arrested and served time in the county stockade — a brief 13-month stint, during which he left six days a week to work from an office in West Palm Beach — Epstein continued to shower money on Harvard.
In 2012, he established a private foundation called “Gratitude America Ltd.," which contributed at least $100,000 to the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, a Harvard performing arts organization, according to The Daily Beast, and contributed more than $100,000 to a nonprofit run by Harvard professor Elisa New, the wife of former president Summers. Both donations suggested a kind of insider status, the type of gift that would most likely come from an alum with a hearty dose of nostalgia for his college days.
New told WBUR that she was “profoundly troubled" by the latest allegations against Epstein, and that the funds had already been spent. The Hasty Pudding Institute did not respond to requests for comment.
Epstein, who took some classes at Cooper Union and New York University, does not have a college degree, according to a 2002 profile of him in New York magazine. In any case, his major institutional contributions to Harvard may have been largely talk.
The New York Times reported in 1991 that four donors, including Epstein and his close friend Leslie Wexner, pledged to raise $2 million to fund a center for Hillel, the Jewish student organization at Harvard. A plaque inside the center listed Epstein, Wexner, and Wexner's wife as donors of the Rosovsky Naming Gift, the Crimson reported in 2003. Today, the plaque is no longer there, according to a person familiar with Harvard's Hillel; Hillel did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Another gift of Epstein's to the university remains foggy: He publicly pledged $30 million to establish the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, run by professor Martin Nowak, in 2003, according to the Crimson. But a Harvard source said that Epstein actually gave just $6.5 million.
But even if the promised money never arrived, Epstein successfully cultivated close relationships with preeminent professors, partly through funding individual research projects. Multiple professors told the Crimson in 2003 that Epstein was funding some of their work.
Epstein also regularly hosted private lunches and seminars in an office at One Brattle Square, where he invited world-renowned faculty members to share their work, said Dershowitz, who sometimes attended, and described the sessions as “very intellectual, very academic."
It is not clear when, or whether, Epstein and his foundation stopped funding individual faculty. A number of scholarly papers published between 2006 and 2008 contain a brief sentence in the acknowledgments section: “The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED) at Harvard University is sponsored by Jeffrey Epstein." And as late as 2012, a Harvard website detailing the schedule for professor George Church's lab lists a 5 p.m. meeting with Epstein in Nowak's office — a year after Epstein was required to register as a high-risk and potentially dangerous sex offender in New York. Neither Church nor Nowak responded to requests for comment.
Rick Friedman, a longtime photojournalist in Boston, attended one session where Harvard's luminaries gathered at the behest of Epstein. In September 2004, Friedman was hired by a German magazine to photograph an end-of-summer event hosted by Epstein, a meeting of minds Friedman called “absolutely surreal."
“I photograph a lot of academics," Friedman said. “Here was an incredible group of noted academics who were all going to be together." The frames from that day show Dershowitz, Epstein, Summers, and others talking and laughing.
“It's just like a bunch of friends having a good time, just all hanging out," Friedman said.
But after Epstein was accused of crimes, most of his academic friends scattered.
“Once the charges were made, certainly my relationship with him became entirely lawyer-client," Dershowitz said. “We never had another seminar again, or never had any connection with the Harvard people."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The House Oversight Committee, which Democratic lawmakers head, tweeted a Obama-era photo Tuesday to promote a hearing on the current treatment of migrants at facilities along the U. S. -Mexico border.
The tweet has since been deleted.
The image that was tweeted out promoted a hearing entitled: "Kids in Cages: Inhumane Treatment at the Border. " The background photo, which was from June 2014, showed migrants fenced in a facility with silver emergency blankets.
Democratic lawmakers last week visited migrant facilities near El Paso, and decried the treatment of the children, women and men migrants. According to a report from the El Paso Times and the New York Times, that children in a migrant facility in Clint, Texas have been victims of outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
More: The stuff of nightmares: Inside the migrant detention center in Clint, Texas
President Donald Trump's 2020 reelection campaign posted a screenshot of the now-deleted tweet.
"House Democrats are promoting their 'civil rights' hearing on 'kids in cages' and 'inhumane treatment' with a photo from 2014, when Joe Biden was Vice President," the tweet from Trump's campaign said. "So dishonest!"
Trump referred to the use of the "horrible picture" in a tweet of his own on Thursday, calling it "very embarrassing. "
Republicans on the House Oversight Committee also pointed out that the photo was one take during the Obama Administration.
"You all know that’s a picture from 2014, right? Remind us who was President then," the Oversight Committee Republicans tweeted.

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein, the hedge fund manager and self-proclaimed billionaire, was charged with sex trafficking on Monday in federal court, a crime similar if not identical to one for which he was allowed to enter a plea deal in Florida in 2008 and avoid serious jail time.
In violation of the requirement to inform victims of such a settlement, prosecutors in the 2008 case - including Alexander Acosta, the current secretary of labor - hatched the deal in secrecy, tossing aside a 53-page indictment alleging that Epstein recruited underage girls and induced them to recruit others to engage in sex at his home in Florida.
The New York Times suggests, "The indictment in Manhattan could prompt a moment of reckoning for the Justice Department, which for years has wrestled with accusations that it mishandled the earlier case and has faced a barrage of litigation from Mr. Epstein's accusers. In February, the Justice Department opened its own internal review into the matter.
Don't get your hopes up for any reckoning from a president recently accused of rape and previously alleged by more than a dozen women to have engaged in unwanted sexual behavior. Don't expect Trump, who endorsed accused child molester Roy Moore for a Senate seat, to toss Acosta out.
Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. - lionized by the right as some kind of grand intellect - inquired about the sweetheart settlement during Acosta's confirmation hearing, but voted to accept his nomination anyway. Now, Sasse is horrified, simply horrified, that Epstein got such lenient treatment.
"Jeffrey Epstein has evaded justice for too long - this child rapist belongs in prison and should not be allowed to post bail and hurt more girls, he said in a written statement. He added, "This monster received a pathetically soft sentence last time, and his victims deserve nothing less than justice. Justice doesn't depend on the size of your bank account, this billionaire can't be let out just because he can cut a bail check. The Justice Department needs to see this through.
So why did he vote for Acosta, and why isn't he demanding he be fired immediately?
Still, Republicans are making excuses for Acosta. They run the gamut:
"This was up about three months ago, and then all of the sudden it died down, so I don't know how big of a deal it is (Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa); to "I'm satisfied [with Acosta] (Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia); to "I don't know. Why do you people ask this stuff? Don't you realize that we're working on tough legislation? (I did not make that up; Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska said it.)
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., provided the voice of moral sanity. He put it exactly right: Labor Secretary Alex Acosta "needs to go.
Monday evening, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted: "Secretary Acosta must step down. As US Attorney, he engaged in an unconscionable agreement w/ Jeffrey Epstein kept secret from courageous, young victims preventing them from seeking justice. This was known by @POTUS when he appointed him to the cabinet.
I'm tempted to say that the Republican Party should join Pelosi because it wouldn't want to be associated with an alleged child molester, but Trump already has (Alabama's Moore). I'm tempted to say that the GOP should care about victimized minors; but its indifference to the plight of mistreated children detained at the border should disabuse you of that notion. I'm tempted to say that the GOP doesn't want to be on the side of men who abuse women, but ... well, you get the point.
If Acosta doesn't quit as Pelosi suggests, Democrats should pass a resolution in the House demanding Acosta's resignation. If that doesn't do it, commence impeachment hearings. It'll be good practice. And let the Republicans defend the guy who cut a deal with a "monster.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The House Oversight Committee, which Democratic lawmakers head, tweeted a Obama-era photo Tuesday to promote a hearing on the current treatment of migrants at facilities along the U. S. -Mexico border.
The tweet has since been deleted.
The image that was tweeted out promoted a hearing entitled: "Kids in Cages: Inhumane Treatment at the Border. " The background photo, which was from June 2014, showed migrants fenced in a facility with silver emergency blankets.
Democratic lawmakers last week visited migrant facilities near El Paso, and decried the treatment of the children, women and men migrants. According to a report from the El Paso Times and the New York Times, that children in a migrant facility in Clint, Texas have been victims of outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
More: The stuff of nightmares: Inside the migrant detention center in Clint, Texas
President Donald Trump's 2020 reelection campaign posted a screenshot of the now-deleted tweet.
"House Democrats are promoting their 'civil rights' hearing on 'kids in cages' and 'inhumane treatment' with a photo from 2014, when Joe Biden was Vice President," the tweet from Trump's campaign said. "So dishonest!"
Republicans on the House Oversight Committee also pointed out that the photo was one take during the Obama Administration.

A cycle of cruelty and folly on immigration

Texto completo: Nature's temporary solution to the crisis on the United States' southwest border is upon us, in the form of high summer temperatures that should reduce the migration rate and relieve some of the pressure on our overcrowded camps and courts. So it's a good time to step back and assess the disastrous cycle in which our immigration policy has been caught.
The cycle started with a gap between the elite consensus on immigration - unabashedly in favor - and the public's more conflicted attitudes, which differ depending on the day's headlines and the wording of the polling questions. Across the first 15 years of the 21st century, too many Beltway attempts to simply impose the elite consensus set the stage for backlash, populism, Trump.
Unfortunately that backlash did not just give us a more restrictionist president. It gave us a restrictionist president who mixes ineffectiveness in legislating, incompetence in administration, and an impulse toward "toughness" as the response to every challenge - one that easily becomes a license for cruelty when a crisis hits. As it has, in the form of the wave of family migration - to which the Trumpian response has been, first, the formal inhumanity of the child separation policy, and since then, the informal inhumanity of an overwhelmed detainment system.
This inhumanity, in turn, has driven many liberals - led by the Democratic Party's would-be nominees for president - to repudiate not only the specific evils of Trump's approach, but the entire architecture of immigration enforcement as implemented by, well, the last Democratic president. The camps for asylum-seekers must not just be made more humane; they must be closed. Deportations of noncriminal aliens must not only be limited; they must be ended. As migration rates increase exponentially, the government must respond by . . . decriminalizing illegal entry and extending public benefits to undocumented immigrants.
These policies are far more reckless than the old path-to-citizenship, more-guest-workers elite consensus, because they learn exactly the wrong lessons from the last five years of turbulence. We now have multiple case studies, European and American, of how in a globalized and internet-connected world migration can suddenly cascade, how easily a perceived open door can lead to a dramatic rush to enter - and then how quickly the most generous societies can find themselves retreating to enforcement and lurching toward populism.
For this cycle to break, for immigration policy to stabilize instead of whipsawing between folly and cruelty, you would need fraternal correction to happen within both the right-wing and left-wing coalitions.
On the American right, that correction ought to come from religious conservatives and their representatives, who have generally been far too blasé about the conditions in the migrant camps and the Trump administration's moral responsibility to migrants.
Yes, these conditions reflect funding shortfalls in which Democrats as well as Trump are complicit; yes, some of the problems were also problems under Obama, and liberal partisans are only just now noticing; yes, reckless adult migrants are often responsible for putting children in peril in the first place.
But none of this absolves the United States of a basic responsibility to keep vulnerable people, children above all, in the most humane conditions possible when their detention is required. The harsh reality of border enforcement tends to breed callousness and prejudice, of the sort that pervades a recently-exposed Border Patrol Facebook group, unless someone in authority is pushing back hard against that tendency. And it's plain that Trump's team doesn't regard that kind of pushback as a moral obligation, that they are either invested in the idea that cruelty might be a useful deterrent or indifferent to the conditions that visitors to the camps keep uncovering.
This is where the president's religious supporters should be intervening, should be applying moral pressure, should be working to prove that the immigration restrictions they support can be implemented in accord with basic Christian principles. At the moment their efforts are meager, and that proof does not exist.
Then on the Democratic side, the obligation to halt the march of folly falls upon the party's moderates, its House and Senate leaders - who behaved responsibly last week in passing the border funding bill over Ocasio-Cortezan objections - and finally on the would-be moderate trying to win the party's nomination, Joe Biden.
Of all the questions that his leftward critics want to relitigate on the debate stage, this might be the most immediately important: Were Barack Obama's deportation policies (which at their peak removed more people than Trump's) immoral and un-American, a compromise with fascism that liberalism must now repudiate and permanently leave behind?
Biden has an obvious incentive to answer no, to defend as pro-immigration realism the last administration's efforts to legalize longtime residents while also resisting migration waves.
But it's how the party's voters answer, and what the next Democratic president does, that will determine how fast the cycle of polarization continues turning, how wide our immigration gyre becomes.

Baseball size throws pitchers for curve

Texto completo: When esteemed New York Times baseball writer Tyler Kepner set out to examine the history of baseball in 10 pitches, he devoted the third chapter of his new book, "K," to the curveball.
Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown is featured prominently, as are curveball maestros Sandy Koufax, Bert Blyleven, Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer.
The first pitcher examined, though, is none other than the Cubs' Mike Montgomery. His 0-1 yakker to the Indians' Michael Martinez was the final pitch of the 2016 World Series.
"He interviewed me after the World Series and then I kind of forgot about it," Montgomery said. "I read that part and saw the first (pitcher) was me. Awesome. Pretty incredible."
What's even more incredible is that in the space between Montgomery earning his first career save and this week's All-Star break, his curveball has changed.
"Mine is not the same as it was in 2016," he said. "A lot of it is due to the change in the baseball."
Nearly half of the teams in the majors are projected to surpass their franchise records for home runs in a season, and it's not because of syringes or better lumber. The baseball is juiced.
"There's no getting around it; it's absolutely true," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said Sunday. "I was on the mound the other day with two (baseballs) and one felt smaller than the other. I asked the guys to check it out. You can see it in the way the balls have been flying. They could easily have stamped 'Titleist' on the side."
Several of Maddon's pitchers, including Montgomery, have mentioned tinkering with their grips on breaking balls because of the lower seams.
"I'm moving toward sliders because with lower seams, you can't get that same vertical break," Montgomery said.
Montgomery said the change in the shape of the ball makes it harder to throw a 12-to-6 curveball, the kind that drops from a batter's chest to his knees.
"Pitchers have been making adjustments with their grips," Maddon said. "It's not just him."
Like the Cubs, Montgomery has not had an easy time of it this season. He gave up at least a run in three of his first four outings and then missed a month with a left lat strain. He got his ERA down to 4.26 but has been dinged in his last three outings and reached the All-Star break at 5.67.
The Pirates' Adam Frazier took him deep last week on a 1-2 curveball on the inner half that Montgomery thought would produce an out. Instead it reached the first row of the seats in right.
"I thought it was a popup," Montgomery said. "It was the pitch I was trying to make, and I threw it where I wanted to.
"If those are the kind of balls that are home runs now, I have to adjust with it. The hitters know that home runs are going to be easy to come by. I've got to pitch more to the top of the zone."
Montgomery, 30, said the challenge of adapting is the "fun part" of the game.
Perhaps not as much fun as what transpired after the Cubs won Game 7 of the 2016 World Series. Montgomery and wife Stephanie wisely stuck around Chicago in the aftermath, eating their way through the city.
Cubs fans would spot them at locales such as Chicago Cut, Bandera and Sunda and buy them drinks or pay for their meals. A few took it further, naming their kids "Montgomery."
Mike and Stephanie learned of it from handwritten letters and on Twitter.
"Wow, I was just throwing a ball and the next thing someone names their kid after you," he said. "What the heck is going on? It was a surreal experience. Cubs fans have been awesome and this city is such a special place for me.
"But it seems a long time ago. We're in it, we're grinding and things haven't been as easy for us and me personally."
Asked if he feels his legacy is secure, Montgomery replied: "I can't rest on that moment. The accomplishments are there, you can't take them away, but guys who have been in this game a long time are never satisfied. And then when you're done, you can go back and look.
"Go as hard as you can as long as you can and then look back when you're done and enjoy some of those accomplishments. When you're in it, it's such a short window. Put the blinders on."

DMV denies FBI, ICE use of driver's license photos

Texto completo: Recent news stories have highlighted the ability of the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to access tens of millions of driver photographs held by nearly two dozen states.
Agents apply facial recognition technology to scan those vast databases for people they're looking to identify.
But those agencies do not have access to New York's trove of DMV photos, state officials are insisting, despite what you might have read.
What's been reported? New York is one of several states negotiating with the FBI to give to provide the agency with access to their DMV photographs, according to a recent GAO reportcited by the Washington Post on Sunday.
This would seem to contradict what the Democrat and Chronicle was told last month — that New York doesn't allow the use of facial recognition on their database of photos.
DMV spokeswoman Lisa Koumjian threw cold water on the GAO report Monday afternoon, however, saying "there are no ongoing negotiations. The DMV is contacting the Government Accountability Office to clarify its report."
Koumjian also said the agency had denied any FBI requests for access to its photo database.
"Furthermore, the DMV does not permit any local, state or federal police department or government agency, including ICE, to access its photo database for facial recognition purposes," she said.
The agency also does not run facial-recognition searches on behalf of police agencies, Koumjian said.
A GAO official, Gretta L. Goodwin, referred a reporter to FBI for an explanation of why New York was listed as being in negotiation with the agency. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, or GAO, is a nonpartisan arm of Congress that investigates executive-branch spending and activity.
How does FR work? Facial recognition systems use advanced software to compare the face of a target with a library of other facial images in hopes of finding a match. It's similar in concept and practice to running a fingerprint to identify a criminal suspect.
Privacy advocates warn there are few laws or regulations governing the use of the technology. Despite that, or because of it, the use of facial recognition is exploding.
It is being put in place in a growing number of locations, including transportation hubs such as the Greater Rochester International Airport, to scan for the likenesses of known terror suspects or criminals.
Facial recognition also is being used more and more by law enforcement to look for the names of criminal suspects whose faces are captured on security cameras and the like. There have been questions about the accuracy of the technology, which is less reliable in identifying women and people of color, according to tests run by the M.I.T. Media Lab.
The Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology reported three years ago that many state and local police agencies were using facial recognition in this way. Photos of previously convicted criminals are used for comparison purposes, and in some cases police can tap their state's driver's license photos as well.
The privacy center's report also said that 16 states were then permitting the FBI to comb through their DMV databases with a combined 64 million photos.
The number of cooperating states has now grown to 21, the GAO reported in June. Pennsylvania, Maryland and Michigan are among them.
What about New York? New York state would be a valuable addition to the FBI collection. The state had 12.1 million active licensed drivers at the end of 2017. The number of photos in the DMV database would be considerably larger when photos of people with non-driver ID cards and formerly licensed drivers were included.
The DMV began taking driver's license photos in July 1984.
In a story Monday, the New York Times raised a separate concern about the use of facial recognition technology by immigration agents.
Several states that provide driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants also allow ICE to access their driver photos, which advocates say could be a back-door means for the government to track down and detain the immigrants.
The law enacted recently in New York that authorizes the issuance of driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants included a provision barring DMV from disclosing any photographs or other information about a driver without a court order, judicial warrant or subpoena and attempts to block use of DMV data for immigration enforcement.

Texto completo: Robert Mueller is expected to testify in front of a congressional hearing next Wednesday. At first, it seemed House Democrats issued his subpoena to get to the bottom of the most expansive presidential investigation in recent memory. Now it appears they simply want Mueller to give them the SparkNotes version of the 448-page report.
According to more than a dozen members of Congress interviewed by Politico, few lawmakers have read the Department of Justice’s report in full, and a smaller fraction of the American public has yet to study it beyond segments floating around social media.
“You can’t expect people to read lengthy documents in large numbers. They have their own lives to lead,” admitted House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York. “What’s the point?” said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.
That’s a curious revelation given the frenzy to see the full report that followed Attorney General William Barr’s executive summary in March. Sure, the report is dense, but it’s not like lawmakers are being forced to read Immanuel Kant’s “Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals.” They asked for the full version of the report, after all.
Mueller has stated the report is his testimony and that inquisitors won’t receive anything beyond what’s already between the covers of the document. Thus, taking the time to read it would save time and money next week, perhaps warranting dismissal of the much-anticipated hearing altogether.
What’s depressing, though, is the apparent “literacy gap” within the nation’s governing bodies. Naturally, a single member of Congress can’t read everything. Staffers routinely summarize bills and take notes in meetings on behalf of their bosses. But the Mueller report wasn’t a routine happening. In terms of anticipation, it was the congressional equivalent of a New York Times bestseller. If lawmakers can’t read that, how much faith should the country have in their capacity to read the legislation affecting everyday Americans?
At its best, Congress passes laws with adequate input from engaged parties. At its worst, Congress uses time constraints, arcane parliamentary rules and lengthy texts to push through questionable legislation. The Affordable Care Act measured more than 900 pages long, excluding volumes of regulatory language that would come sometime after its passage. Seven years later, Senate Republicans crafted the American Health Care Act in less-than-transparent circumstances, meriting a rebuke from Sen. John McCain. Neither circumstance allowed for debate or input from the opposing party. A fifth grader can tell you that’s not how a bill becomes a law.
Reading, or not reading, has become the latest excuse for members of Congress. When they are interested in delaying a tough vote on a divisive bill, they cry, "We haven't even had time to read this legislation. The opposing party is trying to jam this through without debate or compromise.” And when members are hurrying to get out of town for a recess or want to pass something in the dead of night, they will pass hundred-, even thousand-page bills without having had the time to print them, let alone read them.
Now, lawmakers are fast approaching a summer recess. Amid their fundraising and vacationing, it would be the perfect time to assess priorities and put reading at the top of the list. Until then, they have one week left to read Mueller’s tome before interrogating its principal author. Utilizing what they asked for would be the polite thing to do.

Licencias de conducir en NY incluyen blindaje de privacidad contra ‘La Migra’

Texto completo: Para muchos neoyorquinos, la tranquilidad que habían ganado al saber que desde el próximo diciembre podrán tramitar en Nueva York sus licencias de conducir, independientemente de su estatus migratorio , se convirtió en minutos en duda y temor, tras conocerse esta semana un informe que revela que ‘La Migra’ y el FBI han tenido acceso a millones de fotos de licencias en oficinas del Departamento de Vehículos y Motores (DMV), imágenes que ahora pueden ser usadas en procesos de reconocimiento facial, en otros estados.
La incertidumbre creció cuando el diario The New York Times informó que funcionarios del Servicios de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE), han solicitado acceso a las fotos de las licencias de conducir en al menos tres estados, en los cuales se permiten a las personas indocumentadas solicitar los permisos para manejar.
Uno de los neoyorquinos mostró preocupación fue Henry Parra. El ecuatoriano confesó que le impactó la información, y contó que “todos los días estamos recibiendo noticias que nos llenan de miedo. Yo pude sacar mi licencia hace años en Connecticut, con un trámite muy simple, y al aprobarse aquí, uno lo veía como un alivio para familiares. Ahora, uno hasta lo piensa”.
El inmigrante quien reside desde hace 12 años en Corona, en Queens , recuerda que vivir aquí en muchos casos significa no poder salir del país y, “ no tener licencia te impide inclusive la movilidad dentro de la propia ciudad , no tanto para uno que se puede mover en tren, sino cuando tienes niños, como es mi caso. Quieren convertir al país en una jaula”.
Ante la nueva ola de temores, que a juicio de Parra afecta la tranquilidad de los inmigrantes trabajadores y honestos , los legisladores estatales, los activistas pro inmigrantes y más de 200 organizaciones que presionaron la aprobación del proyecto de Ley Luz Verde, que garantizará a más de 250,000 residentes de Nueva York optar por un permiso de conducir estándar, coinciden en que no hay razones para tener miedo.

Dulce Rojas , miembro de la organización Sepa Mujer, indicó que justamente en las últimas horas han recibido más llamadas de consulta de lo habitual , por parte de inmigrantes dudosos en Long Island , que sienten que su privacidad puede estar comprometida, si obtienen el permiso para conducir.
“Las 200 organizaciones en todo el estado , que trabajamos en la promoción del proyecto Luz Verde, sabemos que ahora nos toca empoderar a los inmigrantes con más información. La gente que no ha cometido ningún delito, no tiene nada que temer”, reiteró Rojas .
Entre tanto, Javier H. Valdés , co-director Ejecutivo de Make the Road New York (MRNY), dijo confiar en que todos los neoyorquinos calificados, sin importar su estatus migratorio, ahora podrán acceder de manera segura a las licencias de conducir. “Esperamos que el gobernador Cuomo haga todo lo que esté a su alcance para garantizar que se cumplan las fuertes protecciones de la ley y que toda la información de los neoyorquinos esté resguardada”, indicó.
Algunas posturas han dado más alivio a las dudas. Lisa Koumjian, portavoz del DMV en Nueva York , aseguró a medios locales que esta oficina “no permite que ningún departamento de policía local, estatal o federal, ni ninguna agencia gubernamental, incluido el ICE, accedan a su base de datos de fotos, para fines de reconocimiento facial. No hay negociaciones en curso entre el estado y el FBI sobre el tema”.
En la Fiscalía General de Nueva York también hubo reacciones. El portavoz Enny Pichardo dijo: “Hemos conocido lo que ha pasado en otros estados donde aprueban licencias de conducir a indocumentados. Es un buen ejemplo, del por qué en Nueva York, nuestras leyes incluyen ciertas protecciones. Aquí valoramos a los inmigrantes, y haremos todo lo que esté a nuestro alcance para protegerlos”.
¿Mi información personal estará protegida por el DMV?
* La nueva legislación limita la recopilación de información confidencial al prohibir al DMV escanear y almacenar documentos originales utilizados para solicitar las licencias estándares y de preguntar sobre el estado de ciudadanía o inmigración de los solicitantes.
* Cierta información confidencial del solicitante -incluida el número de Seguro Social, lugar de nacimiento, país de origen y número de identificación-, no puede ser divulgado por el DMV, a menos que sea en respuesta a una orden judicial o citación emitida válidamente, (una “orden administrativa” emitida por ICE no sería suficiente).
* El DMV no se le permitiría revelar registros que muestren qué tipo de licencia una persona posee, para limitar las suposiciones que se podrían hacer sobre su estatus migratorio.
* La nueva ley también hace ilegal el uso del tipo de licencia que una persona posee, como prueba de su estatus migratorio o como base para arrestar.
* La ley restringe el acceso a los datos del DMV por ICE , además requiere que cualquier persona que reciba registros o información del DMV, certifica que no usarán esos datos para fines vinculados con migración.
* La ley proporciona una base sólida de protecciones de privacidad que permite a los inmigrantes, sin documentación, en el estado de Nueva York tomar una decisión sobre los beneficios de obtener una licencia.

Texto completo: The El Paso Times and USA TODAY stand firm in the accuracy of their reporting and continue to be a leading and impartial voice in the coverage of border security and immigration.
The strength of the partnership between the El Paso Times and the New York Times lies in the fact that you have a team of reporters and editors who understand the immigration crisis and are subject matter experts.
The journalists spoke to current and former Customs and Border Protection agents and supervisors who work or have worked at the detention facility in Clint, TX. These agents and supervisors are witnesses to the severe problems at the secretive site and spoke on condition that they not be named because of fear they will face repercussions for exposing such squalid conditions.
The journalists reviewed CBP documents, sworn statements from those housed at the border facilities, inspection reports, spoke with immigration attorneys and lawmakers who toured the facility and also provided first-hand accounts.
The on-the-ground reporting also led to the creation of a graphic that outlines the detention center, from cinder block cells, holding rooms, nurses' station, and a padded cell, with no toilet, where sick children were quarantined and sometimes held.
The El Paso Times and USA TODAY stand firm in the accuracy of their reporting and continue to be a leading and impartial voice in the coverage of border security and immigration. The New York Times issued a statement: "We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting on the U.S. Border Patrol's detention centers."
Tim Archuleta is the executive editor of the El Paso Times. He is also the Plains Regional editor who oversees news operations in the Texas and New Mexico. He can be reached at 915-546-6141 and opinion@el pasotimes.com

Soft path to a hard peace in Afghanistan

Resumen: The first talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban may have achieved some progress because of a mood of empathy that was created by the sharing of personal sorrows during 18 years of war.

Texto completo: If forgiveness is key to ending a conflict, then the long war in Afghanistan just saw a merciful ray of hope. On Sunday and Monday, Taliban and Afghan officials held talks for the first time, even issuing a joint “road map” toward national reconciliation. Yet with the hard details still to be negotiated, it was the moments of softhearted sharing that may have set the tone for reaching a final deal.
During the talks in Qatar, more than 50 Afghan politicians and civil society activists and 17 Taliban members recognized the mutual suffering of others in the room as a result of the ongoing 18-year war. They told tales of relatives and friends lost to either Taliban attacks, U.S.-led airstrikes, or imprisonment. The sharing of personal sorrow set a mood of contrition and an opening for compromise. The joint statement stressed that all of Afghanistan is “suffering daily.”
Nader Nadery, chairman of the Afghan civil service commission, said he acknowledged the suffering of Taliban officials who had been held for years in detention. “I have the courage to forgive, as I know your members have suffered, too,” he told the group.
Many wept at the stories. “The pain from all sides, whether it is the night raids or the bombings, that is why we are here,” Suhail Shaheen, a member of the Taliban delegation, told The New York Times.
Such tender moments may help dispel the mistrust, fear, and hatred that drive the war. As often happens in negotiations to end armed conflicts, the two sides found some empathy. According to participants, there was great patience in listening to each story. Their newfound vulnerability and humility may yet create a capacity to forgive the violence of the past and move toward peace.
The two sides are a long way from finding common ground on basic issues of governance, women’s rights, and the role of other countries in Afghanistan. A parallel set of talks between the Taliban and the United States has made more progress. Yet this intra-Afghan negotiation has broken ground on essential virtues necessary for an agreement. “It is not easy for me to sit across from people who have killed my father,” said Abdul Matin Bek, an Afghan Cabinet member, according to the Times. Yet in a sign of forgiveness at work, he added, “But we have to end this.”

NIKE'S FREE SPEECH SPEECH ISSUES ARE RARELY CUT-AND-DRY

Texto completo: Now that the Fourth of July has slipped past, let's take a quick look at a trio of controversies over history and tradition that erupted just as the holiday was creeping up on us.
The most prominent was the uproar over Nike's decision to withdraw a version of its Air Max 1 Quick Strike honoring Betsy Ross, which was to go on sale around Independence Day. The shoe displayed on its heel the original U.S. flag with its 13 stars - which Ross either did or didn't create - and was pulled after former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick pointed out to the company "that the Betsy Ross flag had been co-opted by groups espousing racist ideologies."
I have two observations.
First: White supremacists shouldn't get to decide for the rest of us the meaning of our historical symbols. I'm old enough to remember the Ku Klux Klan - not today's pale shadow, but the Klan to which many Southern politicians of the 1960s still pledged open allegiance. The group's rallies always featured American flags in abundance - you know, the 50-star kind - and nobody thought the rest of us had to give up on the symbol by letting the bad guys control its significance. In that sense, Nike's action might be seen not as a strike against the white supremacists but as a surrender to them.
True, it's not just the supremacists. The New York Times notes that some find the 13-star flag an offensive reminder of our nation's "painful history of oppression and racism." Fair point. But I'm a great believer in confronting rather than avoiding the burdens of history. And besides, if the 13-star flag must be hidden away as a symbol of racism, what about the 13 stripes on the 50-star flag?
Second observation: Furious about Nike's decision, the governor of Arizona has canceled the $1 million in subsidies that the company was promised in return for opening a $184 million factory in the state. OK, this sort of political tit-for-tat happens all the time - but the Supreme Court has recently made things interesting. At the end of its most recent term, the justices ruled in Iancu v. Brunetti that the federal government cannot refuse to register a trademark for being "scandalous" - which the court defined as giving offense - because such a power would amount to viewpoint discrimination, which the First Amendment forbids.
Hmm. You get the Arizona subsidy if you sell the shoe with the 13-star flag but not otherwise? Sure sounds like viewpoint discrimination to me. I don't expect Nike to sue Arizona for violating the company's First Amendment rights, but goodness that would be a fun case.
...
Now let's travel to St. Louis Park, Minn., where the city council voted in June to end the practice of reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to open its meetings. At least part of the motivation seems to have been to emphasize that the town is "very welcoming and increasingly diverse." This decision has led to predictable fury - and not just from the right. The editorial board of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, no bastion of conservatism, weighed in against the city, which in turn has promised to revisit its position later this month.
Although a government institution can certainly do the people's business without regularly pledging allegiance, the U.S. Congress opens its sessions with the Pledge of Allegiance. So does the town council in the Connecticut hamlet where my wife and I live. Since St. Louis Park is in Minnesota, let's add this: The Minnesota legislature begins its meetings with the pledge. Minnesota public school students are required by law to recite it at least once a week unless they opt out.
Moreover, the claim that the pledge is anti-diversity seems rather obscure. Wherever people might have come from originally, whatever the state of their documentation, whatever their religion or creed, most of those who live in the U.S. are here because they want to be. In its aspirational language, the Pledge of Allegiance arguably promotes rather than hampers diversity. Certainly there are threats to diversity; but the pledge isn't high on the list.
Besides, as the Star-Tribune editorial pointed out, people who object to the pledge needn't recite it; and they can even register their protests. I've long argued that a respect for vigorous dissent is at the heart of the American idea. The recital of the pledge to open a meeting signals only that those in positions of authority believe in what the flag stands for. The rest of us are free to do as we like.

Texto completo: A few years ago, the novelist Helen Phillips woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of her young daughter's screams. She rushed to her bedside but was unable to calm her child, who was stuck in a nightmare, crying: "I want Mommy! I want Mommy!"
"It was one of the most terrifying moments of my life," Phillips said. "It's a metaphor for motherhood. There's always going to be things that they're confronting that you're powerless against."
That moment gave rise to one of the more unsettling scenes in her new book, "The Need," a thriller that explores the psychological, emotional and physical torments of motherhood. The narrative centers on Molly, a sleep-deprived paleobotanist and mother of two young children, whose harried domestic routine is upended one night by an otherworldly intruder. The interloper represents Molly's worst fear: that something bad will happen to her children.
For Phillips, 37, writing about a supernatural threat felt like the most accurate way to explore the treacherous emotional terrain of motherhood and the lurking feeling that even the most mundane situations are freighted with peril.
[ Read our review of Helen Phillips's "The Need." ]
"I was trying to evoke the experience of having young children, and apparently that has a lot of elements of horror," she said. "It's the best way I can describe to you what it is like for me to be a mother and the kind of anxiety I have."
"The Need" belongs to a growing body of surreal speculative fiction that uses horror tropes to capture the panic, self-doubt and pressures that new mothers face. The exhaustion that verges on hallucination. The feeling that your body has become a food source and no longer belongs to you. The endless chores and monotony of caring for small children, punctuated by adrenaline spikes that emanate from a constant, creeping dread. What if the fever in the middle of the night is a sign of a life-threatening illness? What if the boiling pasta water falls on the child who's clinging to your knees while you frantically cook? What if you can't keep them safe?
Those fears propel the plots of several new works that feature mothers who fear they are losing their grip on reality -- or worse, that their nightmares have manifested.
In Vanessa Lillie's thriller, "Little Voices," which Thomas & Mercer will publish this fall, a woman who nearly dies during childbirth from a detached placenta is unable to breastfeed her premature baby and has to pump milk constantly through the night. She begins hearing a menacing voice that makes her feel possessed: "She'll never sit up or pull up or crawl or walk," it says. "You were never meant to be a mother."
"Orange World," the title story of Karen Russell's latest collection from Knopf, follows Rae, who makes a deal with a demon to keep her newborn alive. The demon demands to be breastfed every night at 4:44 a.m. Ravaged by sleep deprivation, her nipples raw and achy from feeding her baby and a devil, Rae feels isolated, helpless and slightly crazy. When she attends a new moms support group, after listening to others complain about C-sections and sciatica, Rae struggles to describe her problem, then says, "I'm having a hard time with night feedings."
Russell began working on "Orange World" two years ago, after her son was born, and started taking notes for the story during those disorienting first weeks with her newborn.
"I had a difficult and at times frightening pregnancy, and there wasn't public space to be honest about this other side of pregnancy, this unstoppable thing growing inside of your body," Russell said. "There's a real primal anxiety over all the ways you feel like you're failing your kid, like not being able to nurse them adequately."
A similar mixture of fear, doubt and self-loathing haunts Lauren, the protagonist of Melanie Golding's debut novel, "Little Darlings," which was published this spring by Crooked Lane Books. Lauren is recovering from postpartum injuries and worries that she's unfit to care for her constantly crying twin boys. In the maternity ward one night, she's confronted by a strange woman wearing rags, who says her own twins are cursed and demands they swap. Later, Lauren becomes convinced her babies were stolen by the woman, an ancient witch, and replaced with look-alikes, and finds her body no longer readily produces milk for the wailing doppelgängers. "Maybe she deserved all of this, for being a bad mother," Lauren thinks.
Golding, who lives in a small town in Gloucestershire, England, and has two children, now 7 and 9, said her novel was inspired in part by her own difficult experience giving birth, and by European folk tales about changelings, fairy children who are swapped in for human ones. "It seemed to be a really good way of exploring the post-birth experience, which for me was pretty horrific and unexpectedly frightening," she said.
These stories hinge on age-old anxieties but feel contemporary in their depictions of modern motherhood. Many tackle issues like the physically brutal process of childbirth and nursing, the difficulty of balancing career and child care, the pressure women face to subvert their needs to their offspring, the fear of judgment of their parenting style or lack of one, and the erasure of identity that can come with a new baby.

Children in peril have long been a plot staple in crime fiction and thrillers, and exploring motherhood through the lens of horror isn't entirely new -- classics include Ira Levin's 1967 best seller, "Rosemary's Baby." Horror movies, too, have increasingly focused on domestic dread.
More recently, there's been a spate of memoirs, essay collections and literary fiction about the complexities of modern motherhood, including groundbreaking books by Sheila Heti, Maggie Nelson, Jenny Offill, Rivka Galchen and Samantha Hunt.
And yet, there still seems to be a paucity of realistic, nuanced depictions of the internal lives of mothers in popular culture. "Why, when there are scores of new books about mothers and mothering and motherhood, does it continue to feel like there aren't any?" the critic Willa Paskin wrote last year in Slate.
Phillips, who lives in Brooklyn with her husband, the artist Adam Douglas Thompson, and her two children, now 4 and 7, said that in "The Need" she aimed to capture not only the fear she feels as a parent, but the almost equally terrifying ferocity of maternal love. "The love you feel for them is so fraught and intense and visceral and animal," she said.
She began working on the novel four years ago, but she had the idea for a book about the complexities of motherhood in 2012, when her daughter was born shortly before her older sister died from a rare neurological condition called Rett Syndrome.
"The Need," which Simon & Schuster will release on Tuesday, grew out of the confluence of those life-altering events and Phillips's sense that the things she loved and sometimes took for granted could disappear in an instant.
"She wondered if other mothers experienced it, this permanent state of mild panic," Phillips writes in "The Need." "What a phenomenon it was to be with her children, to spend every moment so acutely aware of the abyss, the potential injury flickering within each second."

Texto completo: Sin el conocimiento los automovilistas, los funcionarios de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) utilizan las bases de datos de licencias de conducir estatales para aplicar tecnología de reconocimiento facial.
Al menos en Utah , Vermont y Washington –que ofrecen licencias de conducir a inmigrantes indocumentados– los oficiales de ICE han solicitado revisar la información de los automovilistas.
En Utah y Vermont se hicieron las búsquedas requeridas para encontrar a un número no indeterminado de personas, indicó The New York Times.
En el tercer estado, Washington, los agentes autorizaron citaciones administrativas del Departamento de Licencias para realizar un escaneo de reconocimiento facial de todas las fotos, pero se desconoce si logró contretarse la búsqueda.
Los documentos que exponen estos tipos de búsqueda fueron obtenidos a través de solicitudes de registros públicos por el Centro de Privacidad y Tecnología de Georgetown Law y reportados por primera vez por The Washington Post.
Es la primera vez que se confirma que ICE utiliza tecnología de reconocimiento facial para escanear las bases de datos de licencias de conducir estatale s, incluidas fotos de residentes legales y ciudadanos.
“Esto es un escándalo”, dijo Harrison Rudolph , un experto en privacidad. “Los estados nunca han aprobado leyes que autoricen a ICE a sumergirse en las bases de datos de licencias de conducir que utilizan el reconocimiento facial para buscar personas” .
Agregó que las entidades no alertan a los indocumentados sobre esa posibilidad.
“Estos estados nunca le han dicho a las personas indocumentadas que cuando solicitan una licencia de conducir también están entregando su rostro a ICE. Eso es un enorme cebo” , consideró.
El Post destaca que la Policía siempre ha tenido acceso a huellas dactilares, ADN y otros “datos biométricos” tomados de sospechosos criminales, pero los registros del DMV contienen las fotos de una gran mayoría de los residentes de cada entidad, la mayoría de los cuales nunca han sido acusados ​​de un delito.
Esto se desarrolla sin autorización de las legislaturas estatales, por lo que un creciente número de legisladores demócratas y republicanos están criticando la tecnología como una herramienta de vigilancia peligrosa, generalizada y propensa a terribles errores.
“El acceso de las agencias de la ley a las bases de datos estatales, especialmente las bases de datos del DMV, a menudo se realiza sin consentimiento” , dijo el presidente del Comité de Supervisión de la Cámara de Representantes, Elh Cummings al Post.
Cuando firmó la reforma que permite otorgar licencias a indocumentados, el gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, dijo que estos datos no se compartirían con agencias como ICE.

Texto completo: National security adviser John Bolton recently declared that “we’re now opening the aperture, broadening the areas we’re prepared to act” in cyberspace to meet a Russian threat that extends far beyond the ballot box, costing American companies billions of dollars and posing unacceptable risks to our citizens’ safety and the American way of life.
It’s about time.
For years, the Russians have been preparing the digital battlefield, treating our critical infrastructure as if it were their own cyber weapons range.
Overseas they’ve gone even further. In 2015 and 2016, the Kremlin planted malware in Ukraine’s electric grid, disrupting power for hundreds of thousands of residents in the middle of winter. Keenly aware of its capabilities and motivations, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has said that “the warning lights are blinking red again” — an allusion to CIA Director George Tenet’s warning to Congress just months before 9/11.
The federal government has a fundamental responsibility to deter Russia and other state actors from holding civilian infrastructure at risk. This is precisely why reports from The New York Times that the United States is embedding “potentially crippling malware” in Russia’s power grid should concern all Americans. Cyber weapons are horrible deterrents — and mimicking targeting civilian infrastructure sets a dangerous precedent for America.
Fear of punishment or retribution is a fundamental tenet of deterrence theory. And it’s true, as the head of U. S. Cyber Command, Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, told a Senate panel last year, the Russians “don’t fear us. ” But to think that Vladimir Putin fears cyber-induced power outages in Moscow is a naive and dangerous miscalculation. To the contrary, an American cyberattack against Russia’s power grid would play right into the Kremlin's strategic playbook.
Commander in cyber: Dear 2020 candidates, cybersecurity chief is your most important hire. Don't screw it up.
First, the costs to the Kremlin would pale in comparison with the benefits. The vast scale of Russia’s power grids, which include a total power generation capacity of 236 gigawatts, would render the military effects of any cyberattack relatively limited while granting the Kremlin its long-awaited case study of American cyber aggression, which it would use to consolidate domestic support for more censorship policies under the guise of cybersecurity.
Furthermore, an American cyberattack against civilian infrastructure — especially a preventative one aimed at deterring Russian hackers — would erode the United States’ international credibility as a champion of a free and open internet governed by universal norms of acceptable behavior. Far more than sporadic blackouts — something that isn’t uncommon anyway in Russia — Putin fears a digital age in which the West writes the rules.
The politics of cybersecurity: Huawei — Politicizing cybersecurity is a losing proposition
And finally, what better way to justify an even more persistent cyber presence in American infrastructure than in the name of self-defense? Fighting cyber with cyber is inherently escalatory, and reports of American cyber operations targeting Russia’s power grid — true or not — will inevitably trigger an equal and opposite response.
Detractors argue that we must reserve the right to hold dual-use infrastructure at risk. And because Russia would depend heavily on its power grid for any attack on the United States, then we should be prepared to disrupt it at any time. But America is the most digitally dense nation in the world, and we risk establishing this norm at our own peril.
We cannot fall into the trap of applying nuclear rules of deterrence to today’s Cold War of digital proportions. Cyber weapons can be a tremendous military asset, especially if used as a proportionate means of neutralizing conventional weapons — as took place last month when the Trump administration approved cyber strikes against the Iranian missile systems that took down a U. S. drone. But they are not conducive to threatening punishment. You can’t parade them through public squares or test them in the desert — indeed the very knowledge of their existence by your adversaries renders them obsolete.
President Donald Trump says it’s “NOT TRUE" that the United States is increasing cyberattacks on Russia’s power grid. I hope he’s right. No nation should target civilian infrastructure via cyberspace. It’s wrong and not in our long-term national interest.

Texto completo: A group of freshman Democratic congresswomen responded on social media this weekend to criticism from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who dismissed them and "their Twitter world" in an interview with The New York Times.
Columnist Maureen Dowd asked Pelosi about the opposition to a border funding bill from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. ; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. ; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. ; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.
Pelosi said "our bill" was the best Democrats could do. She criticized the four liberal freshman – whom Dowd referred to as "the Squad" – for being the only members of their party to vote against the original version of the legislation passed by the Democratic-led House, which included some protections for migrant children.
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," Pelosi said, according to Dowd. "But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got. "
The response was swift.
"That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment," Ocasio-Cortez fired back on Twitter. "And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country. "

"I don’t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody," Ocasio-Cortez said, explaining her opposition to the legislation. "It’s a huge mistake. This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People’s lives are getting bargained, & for what?"
The House version of the border funding bill was rejected by the Republican-led Senate. Pelosi then capitulated and agreed to join the moderates in her party in passing the Senate version of the $4. 6 billion bill. Ninety-five Democrats bucked their leader and voted against that version, with another 10 not voting.
Pelosi said she "reluctantly" decided to back the Senate version of the bill because "the children come first" and the emergency funding was needed to get resources to help the mass of migrant children arriving at the U. S. -Mexico border.
Pelosi told Dowd that the blame should go to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , whom she called "authentically terrible. "
"With all due respect, the press likes to make a story that is more about Democrats divided than the fact that Mitch McConnell doesn’t care about the children," she said.

Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti said on Twitter that the four Democrats had opposed Pelosi's version of the bill because they did not trust a promise he says McConnell made to Pelosi that he would pass the House version of the bill.
"Nah. It is deeper than that," Tlaib wrote in response to Chakrabarti's tweet. "Why would we fund a broken system that rips children away from their parents, deny asylum seekers due process & fuels a racist ideology that dehumanizes people?"
Tlaib also retweeted two posts that fired back at Pelosi's comment to Dowd, including one from immigrants right advocate Greisa Martínez Rosas who said, "The strategy is simple: Don’t fall for lies. Play to Win," and another from Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein that pointed out the "pivotal policy proposals" authored by each member of "The Squad. "

Stein's tweet was also shared by Omar, who responded to Ocasio-Cortez's post about Pelosi's comments with a cry of "Patetico!" – apparently referring to the Spanish word for "pathetic. "
"You know they’re just salty about WHO is wielding the power to shift 'public sentiment' these days, sis. Sorry not sorry," Omar tweeted.
Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, also took issue with Pelosi's dismissal of Twitter, saying the speaker would "rather campaign like it’s 2008. "
"I find it strange when members act as though social media isn’t important," she said before using emojis to slam conventional campaigning, which spends millions of dollars on television advertising.
"I haven’t dialed for dollars *once* this year, & have more time to do my actual job," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

Texto completo: Fear is your friend when the market seems low, but also when it is up, like now, and seems too high for so many people.
Fund managers of all types, for example, are at their most pessimistic since the financial crisis, a recent survey showed.
But as Warren Buffett famously preached: Be fearful when others are greedy – and greedy when others are fearful.
Such fear is ironic as stocks hit all-time highs last week. That means the Bank of America's fund-manager survey is merely one sign of today's rampant fear. And the American Association of Individual Investors' weekly survey showed less than 30% of retail investors think stocks will rise over the next six months.
At the same time, investor sentiment and economic confidence gauges across Europe are tanking. Headlines echo these fears, driving folks to yank money from stock mutual funds and ETFs in four of the previous six weeks through mid-June.
Sour sentiment is bullish. Why? Markets pre-price widely known information – fears, opinions, forecasts and more. When you see headlines warning of tariffs, Brexit, Iran, or Europe's allegedly imploding economy, understand that stocks already considered them.
Anything less bad is a positive surprise, hence bullish. Consider this bull market's March 2009 birth. Folks feared a new Great Depression. The recession we got was big and bad, but not that big. Stocks rose while the economy fell. U.S. stocks jumped 72.3% in the bull's first 12 months.
Consider today's big fears, such as Iran's threats to close the Strait of Hormuz and choke oil supply. Investors' dread is priced in now. Anything tamer brings relief. Tamer is likely, because of ample global supply and the fact that Iran can't really block the strait. Tankers have been attacked in years past, which wasn't good – but it was no economic crisis either.
What about European economic fears? A slow-growing economy with weak manufacturing beats recession. Bullish!
How about Brexit? By now, any darned development on that front beats expectations. As for tariffs, have you noticed, as I predicted here last August in great detail, that tariffs only take a nibble from global output, rather than cause the much-feared recession? It's another pre-priced fear. Again, bullish.
I've often said bull markets end one of two ways: One, atop the legendary "wall of worry" as euphoria makes positive surprise essentially unattainable. Or the wallop – a multitrillion dollar negative shock. The 2007-09 financial crisis was a wallop. But every other post-WWII bull market ended in euphoria. That matches Sir John Templeton's legendary framework: "Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria." Absent a wallop, bull markets end when investors tire of worrying.
We're nowhere near that today. Stocks still have a big wall of worry to climb. At a true euphoric peak, sentiment surveys boast optimism. Money pours into stock mutual funds and ETFs. Headlines cite as many opportunities as risks. The investment world will ridicule the bears, not the bulls. You'll fear missing gains more than fear suffering losses. If I write that bad times loom, you'll call me crazy.
Sentiment isn't a timing tool, of course. Euphoria is more like a dimmer switch than an on-off switch. To see euphoria correctly when it comes, you must think differently than others do. Instead of letting widespread fears send you scampering, envision what they say about sentiment broadly. When you see people excited to own stocks and dismissing risks, then start thinking about your exit.
Today, they do the opposite. Their fear is your future fortune.

Texto completo: ATHENS -- Four years ago almost to this day, Greece came a breath away from leaving the euro. People formed quiet, somber lines outside banks to take out small amounts of cash, as a lockdown on the financial system barred them from accessing their savings. They stockpiled tinned food and toilet paper.
On Sunday, the leader who rallied Greeks to confront international creditors, but then reversed himself and gave in to their demands for austerity, was voted out of office. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, a former firebrand leftist, was defeated in a landslide.
Greeks turned instead to the resurgent center-right New Democracy party led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a Harvard-educated former banker and son of a 1990s prime minister. His party secured almost 40 percent of the vote and a comfortable majority of 158 seats in the 300-seat Parliament.
Mr. Tsipras's party, Syriza, got about 31 percent of the vote -- a stinging defeat for the prime minister personally and a bookend to what began as a social experiment, just as populist parties from the left and the right are on the ascent elsewhere in Europe.
[Greece frequently underestimated Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Now he's prime minister.]
It is a reminder that even as Britain moves to leave the European Union, voters in other parts of the bloc appear committed to sticking with it. New Democracy's resurgence also bucks the trend of European conservative and center-right parties that are struggling to win elections or to form majority governments across the continent.
Whatever hopes Mr. Tsipras once inspired in his fellow Greeks, and however much stronger Greece is now financially than it was when he took office, over time he came to arouse their enduring enmity as he shifted positions.
In July 2015, he persuaded his countrymen to reject another international bailout and the onerous austerity that came with it -- but then face to face with the enormous economic challenge, he fell into line. Mr. Tsipras acceded to the demands of international policymakers in the European Commission in Brussels and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, whipping his party members in line to vote for more austerity.
Mr. Tsipras did manage to restore a semblance of stability to Greece's economy, which is growing today, though only at a tepid 2 percent. But unemployment continued to hover above 18 percent, a remarkably high level for a European country.
Mr. Tsipras also pushed through some privatization. He cut pensions, raised taxes and trimmed spending to meet stringent fiscal targets that demand Greece's budget runs sizable surpluses for years to come.
To stay in power, he formed a coalition with a smaller, far-right party, the Independent Greeks. They used that political marriage to advance their nationalist agenda, but parted ways with Mr. Tsipras when he pushed through a historic but unpopular agreement that allowed Greece's neighbor to rename itself North Macedonia.
In the end, however, Mr. Tsipras's undoing came at the hands of his own core voters, who abandoned him. Trying to walk a tightrope, he aroused popular support through an anti-austerity message, but he imposed austerity measures to keep the bailout funds flowing and the country afloat.
Mr. Tsipras's supporters felt cheated -- and he felt their ire.
Among them was Yianna Elafrou, 55, a schoolteacher and a onetime socialist supporter who switched to Mr. Tsipras during the crisis years after seeing her salary cut several times. This time, she said, she gave her vote this time to Mr. Mitsotakis.
"We tried them, it didn't work," she said of Syriza after casting her ballot at a polling center in Athens.
"All we saw was another memorandum and more taxes," she said, referring to the country's third bailout, which Mr. Tsipras signed in July 2015 after the referendum.
New Democracy might not align fully with her political beliefs, she said.
"But it's the lesser of two evils."
Conceding defeat on Sunday, Mr. Tsipras struck a defiant note, promising to fight for the working class. And he said that it was through his party's work that Greece could consider itself liberated from its international creditors.
"We hold our heads up high as the Greece we are handing over in no way resembles the Greece we took over four years ago," Mr. Tsipras said. "Today we hand over a country that is free again."
Still, the Greek public sector, often criticized as bloated and as slowing down innovation and entrepreneurship, was left largely intact by Mr. Tsipras's party. Now, it will fall to Mr. Mitsotakis to cut it back and modernize it, if he can.
There are other challenges, as well.
Mr. Tsipras oversaw the creation of what amount to ghettos on Greek islands in the Eastern Aegean. There, 16,500 refugees languish in grueling conditions according to Human Rights Watch and other humanitarian organizations. They wait months and even years for their asylum claims to be assessed, with no access to basic services.
Some voting on Sunday were enthusiastic about New Democracy's ascent, seeing in Mr. Mitsotakis someone with better credentials to build the economy.
Andreas Apostolopoulos, 53, who owns a small business manufacturing light fixtures, said he was "ecstatic" over New Democracy's anticipated victory.
"We put up with them for four years," he said of Syriza. "It's time they left us alone to do our work. Good riddance."
But Mr. Mitsotakis faces obstacles both internal and external.
He is a liberal leading a conservative party, and so pushing through reforms that may irk his party members and their vested interests could prove tricky.
Mr. Mitsotakis has promised, for example, to make the asylum processing system faster and get refugees out of the camps swiftly, but his party's right wing appears less inclined than he is to treat refugees humanely.
And it is not clear that Greece's creditors in the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund will be keen to give Mr. Mitsotakis space to cut taxes as he hopes. Despite formally exiting its bailout program, Greece is still under strict monitoring until it repays its dues, and has committed to observing stringent fiscal goals that allow the new government little leeway.
Mr. Mitsotakis sounds undeterred.
"I think 90 percent of our program is outside the scope of the restrictions that have been imposed on us," he argued in an interview with The New York Times just before the elections. "Even within the constraints of the program, everyone agrees that Greece needs to lower taxes."
With virtually all the votes counted, it was clear that the new Greek Parliament will look a little different in several ways from the current one. Four parties, including the Communists, gained seats on Sunday.
One contentious party, however, Golden Dawn, the neo-Nazi organization that rose to prominence in the last election amid the migration crisis, suffered a major setback, and will no longer be in Parliament. Several of its prominent members are standing trial, including on murder charges.
Another far-right upstart, however, the pro-Russian Greek Solution, won 10 seats. Their leader, who once telemarketed letters supposedly written by Jesus, once suggested using land mines against migrants trying to make it to Greece.
In his acceptance speech, Mr. Mitsotakis said he was ready to unite the country.
"I asked for a strong mandate to change Greece," he said. "You gave it to me generously. Today begins a difficult but beautiful battle."
He called on the hundreds of thousands of Greeks who abandoned the country during the crisis to think of coming home.
"Keep your eyes and hearts turned toward Greece," he said. "We will work hard to change the country you were forced to leave behind."

Abortion access for all

Texto completo: Lawmakers have eroded
reproductive rights and threatened to
jail doctors.
Planned Parenthood focuses on preventing unwanted pregnancies. It provides education, access to birth control and health care. Yet because the organization also offers abortions, it is targeted by anti-choice politicians.
The GOP-controlled Iowa Legislature helped usher in the closing of four Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa. Now Missouri officials are declining to renew the license of the only clinic in their state.
This is wrong. But it is reality now.
And it underscores the need for other health providers to step up and provide women access to safe, legal abortions. Practitioners specializing in obstetrics and gynecology have the expertise, equipment and access to medications to terminate pregnancies.
Iowa had 159 OB/GYNs in 2015, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Nationally almost all of these specialists have encountered patients seeking abortions, but only 14% provided them, according to a 2011 study.
Even fewer may do so now, as lawmakers across the country have eroded reproductive rights and threatened to jail doctors. Physicians may fear being targeted by anti-choice activists. Yet the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which has more than 58,000 members and represents OB/GYNs, considers safe, legal abortion "a necessary component of women's health care." It supports access and opposes restrictions.
So why don't more OB/GYNs offer this simple outpatient procedure and agree to dispense drugs that safely terminate an early pregnancy?
If more practitioners did this, abortion care would not be relegated to a relatively few clinics targeted by anti-choice politicians and activists. Services would be integrated into our health care system, where they belong.
"Your personal beliefs should not trickle into your job as a gynecologist," said Amy Bingaman, a Des Moines OB/GYN. "Nor should it make patients feel badly."
This doctor knows a thing or two about making difficult decisions.
She dropped out of high school after getting pregnant as a teenager. She was alienated from her family and moved to inner-city St. Louis, where there were frequent shootings.
But she raised her son and went back to school. She moved to Iowa, got a degree in biology from Drake University and graduated from medical school at the University of Iowa. She has four kids of her own and has delivered an estimated 5,000 babies.
Bingaman is passionate about access to birth control and women's reproductive rights.
She also knows doctors are in a tough spot when it comes to abortion. They must navigate provisions in state laws intended to reduce access. Iowa requires special consents and an ultrasound.
Doctors must also navigate pressures from their employers, which are frequently large health systems also nervous about or confused by restrictive abortion laws.
Dr. Jen Gunter, a Kansas physician, wrote an essay in the New York Times recently about the real-world impact of these misguided laws. She was asked to perform an abortion on a very sick woman in her first trimester who was deteriorating rapidly because of her pregnancy. Specialists were concerned she would develop kidney failure.
But Kansas had banned abortion on state property, including at the medical center where Gunter worked. She called the hospital's attorneys, who were unsure how to interpret the law. Ultimately, the doctor said she got on the phone with the state legislator who wrote the law. As she started to explain the patient's health problems, he told her to do what she thought was best.
"My patient got the abortion, and her health improved as a result. But I was furious. How dare some legislator applaud this monstrous law in public all the while deferring to a doctor's expertise in private," she wrote.
This is the kind of insanity doctors deal with across the country.
In Iowa, lawmakers blocked a source of federal funding to pay for any service performed by providers who also perform abortions. Could an entire health system lose this stream of funding if one of its employees performs a legal medical procedure? Are Iowa lawmakers willing to punish the same scarce health providers Iowans depend on to deliver babies?
Bingaman said she's fortunate to live in Des Moines, where doctors can refer patients seeking abortions to Planned Parenthood.
"We have an excellent place we can refer them," she said.
But what if the nearest Planned Parenthood is hours away or in another state? What if it closes? What if they all close? What if doctors are afraid to provide abortions?
Then women lose access to necessary health care.

Hacking on small Florida cities spike concerns

Texto completo: Hackers are targeting small Florida cities and demanding big payouts. In two recent cases, the hackers got exactly what they asked for.

In June, hackers attacked computer systems and held hostage city files and data in Lake City, a city of 12,000 about 60 miles west of Jacksonville, and Riviera Beach, a small city of about 35,000 people, and demanded a combined $1 million in ransom.

After weighing the positives and negatives, both cities began negotiating with the attackers, and in the case of Lake City, decided to pay them 42 bitcoins -- roughly $480,000 -- after an attack that disabled the city's computer system and shut down phone lines, email and online utility payments. In both cases, insurance took on most of the loss with the cities paying just $10,000 each.

The attacks have put other government agencies, including St. Johns County Government, the City of St. Augustine and the St. Johns County School District, on high alert.

"It's definitely a concern," said City of St. Augustine General Services Department Director Jim Piggott. "We are aware of what is going on in other cities in Florida."

Before the June attacks, there had been 22 known public-sector attacks across the country in 2019, according to CNN, which would outpace 2018. Piggott said the city is taking the proper steps to guard against attacks seen in other cities but declined to elaborate on exactly what steps are being taken as a security precaution.

Piggott did say that one of the steps is educating employees on exactly what to look for to help prevent attacks. In the case of the Lake City attack, Mayor Stephen Witt told The New York Times it started on June 10 when an employee clicked on a malicious email that ended up infecting the city's computer with ransomware.

Piggott and Michael Ryan, spokesman for the county, both said educating employees on how to guard against attacks is a top priority.

"We are doing amplified monitoring and educating the staff on what to look for in emails," Ryan said.

The county defends against external threats on a daily basis, Ryan said, and there have been cases of minor viruses, but there have been no catastrophic attacks like the ones seen in other Florida cities.

In a school board workshop on Tuesday, the district talked about how it is trying to make sure it doesn't fall prey to a malware attack.

The district recently started to implement a multi-factor authentication system for employees. It's a security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the users identify for a login or other transactions.

In other words, it adds a second layer of security on top of a traditional 8-64 character password. Password breaches have accounted for more than 80% of the data breaches in the past few years, according to Bruce Patrou, chief information officer of the district's IT Department.

The district plans to test and pilot the system over the summer and fully implement it before December. It's unclear if the county or the city have multi-factor authentication system for employees or plan to add them in the future.

Patrou said the system will help protect student records -- valuable assets on the black market because they can be used to set up fraudulent credit cards. The attacks also target teachers. Last year, a "spear phishing" attack cost a local teacher $500.

"These hackers know what they are doing. They do this for a living," Piggott said.

And the attacks keep coming. The Village of Key Biscayne, a town of about 12,000, confirmed it had been hit by a cyber attack on June 23, marking the third Florida city in the month to fall victim to outside hackers. Key Biscayne would not say whether a ransom was involved in the attack, according to The Miami Herald. As of Friday, the FBI, which was investigating the attacks, had yet to publicly identify the hackers involved.

Mayor Witt, who said Lake City fired the IT director it deemed had not done enough to protect the computer systems, urged other small cities in Florida to make changes and take stock as soon as possible.

"We're developing a system with a backup that hopefully won't be vulnerable," Witt told the New York Times. "Every other town needs to look at their system -- today."

Texto completo: Six months after he was sworn in as governor, Ned Lamont wanted to spend thousands of dollars to refurbish his office in the historic state Capitol.
His interior designer envisioned grasscloth wallpaper and new hardware, among other high-end upgrades, along with refreshing the carpet and drapes and completing basic repairs to aging woodwork.
But Lamont is not looking for Connecticut taxpayers to pick up the tab. Instead, he is offering to dig into his pocket, something he has done repeatedly since he was elected to the state's top post in November.
After spending about $15 million of his own money on the campaign, the Democrat from Greenwich personally funded all transition costs, estimated at $250,000. He was the first governor in recent memory to take such a step.
Lamont's largess has continued since taking office. Just last week, he pledged $30,000 to cover the costs of a music festival in Woodstock. And he has made thousands of dollars in charitable contributions - most of it done quietly - all while rejecting a salary, set by state law at $150,000 annually.
"His philosophy is centered around public service and giving back," said Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for the governor. "That's seen through not taking a salary and his humble, low-key approach to charitable giving."
Foodshare has been one of the beneficiaries of Lamont's donations. Bringing a turkey and a bag of groceries to the anti-hunger charity has been a holiday tradition for most Connecticut governors, but Lamont quietly supplemented those contributions with a check, said Jason Jakubowski, the organization's president and CEO.
"We have some donors who want to do big check presentations," he said. "The governor did not ask for any of that. He wasn't looking for a photo op."
Some view Lamont's willingness to open his checkbook to donate to charity and fund improvements to his office as a plus for his constituents.
Carol Platt Liebau is president of the Yankee Institute for Public Policy, a small-government think tank that has been sharply critical of Lamont's economic policies. But she said she sees no downside to his decision to personally fund renovations to his office, as long as the work conforms to the High Victorian Gothic style of the Capitol.
"Given the state's fiscal crisis, we agree that it would be wrong to ask state taxpayers to pay for significant refurbishment of the governor's office, and we appreciate his recognition of that fact," Liebau said.
Rep. Josh Elliott, a liberal Democrat from Hamden, is Liebau's political opposite. But he, too, has no problem with Lamont's decision to underwrite the renovation.
"If he wants to spend his own money and it's under the oversight of the managers of the Capitol in terms of maintaining the historic nature, then I'm all for it," Elliott said.
But critics say Lamont's approach is reminiscent of the Gilded Era, when the wealthy used their money to insulate themselves from the masses.
"We are modeling a plutocratic structure in state government," said state Rep. Vin Candelora, a Republican from North Branford. "The governor is acting as a monarch, and there's a danger in the way he's throwing money around."
Candelora expressed skepticism about Lamont's free-spending ways, both the philanthropic donations made in an official capacity and financial outlays to improve his office or fund the extras that government cannot afford, such as the Woodstock music festival. He said such gifts are not bound by the same rules of public disclosure that government is.
"He's acting outside the scope of public policy," Candelora said. "He's blurring the lines between public and private."
Blanchard rejects Candelora's characterization. "[Lamont] understands that the state is getting its fiscal house in order, and he's more than happy to cover the cost of renovating the office," Blanchard said.
The improvements will remain in place after Lamont leaves office, Blanchard said. And they will be reviewed by the State Capitol Preservation and Restoration Commission.
Already, Eric Connery, who manages the Capitol grounds, has raised concerns about the grasscloth wallpaper. "Grasscloth is not something that's anywhere else in the building," he said, adding that it could also damage the plaster and canvas walls.
Blanchard said Lamont will only make upgrades that "stick to the character of the building." He also pointed out that there is precedence for politicians in Connecticut using their own money to renovate public spaces: Former Lt. Gov. Michael Fedele paid for a refurbishment of his office.
Lamont is also proposing replacing all the carpet in the suite of offices housing the governor and his staff. (Traditionally the state pays for the replacement of only the carpet in the governor's office.) He is also seeking permission to remove pink marble surrounding a fireplace. The marble is not original to the building; it was installed during former Gov. Ella Grasso's term.
The cost of the renovations proposed by Lamont has yet to be tallied, Connery said.
"I don't think he's going to be spending an exorbitant amount," Blanchard said. "It will all be reasonable. He's got good tastes, and I'm sure it will look nice and fit with the character of the office."
By any measure, Lamont, the great-grandson of former J.P. Morgan & Co. chair Thomas W. Lamont, is extraordinarily wealthy. During the 2018 gubernatorial campaign, he released partial information about his federal and state taxes over the past five years. The summaries do not show his net worth, but they offer a snapshot of his finances on an annual basis.
According to the filing, Lamont's adjusted gross income for the past five years combined was around $18 million. He reported donating $2.46 million to charity during that same span. Those totals do not reflect the income of his wife, Annie Lamont, a successful venture capitalist.
During the campaign, Lamont pledged he would drive his own car to work, but state police rejected that idea due to security concerns. Lamont's office totaled up the annual cost of the state car - about $10,000 - and is donating an equivalent sum to charity, Blanchard said.
Lamont isn't the first wealthy politician to use some of his personal fortune for the expenses of the office. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent millions on everything from tropical fish tanks for City Hall to private jets to travel to official functions, according to a review by The New York Times. Like Lamont, Bloomberg also doled out money to arts programs, social service charities and other nonprofit groups.
Most recent Connecticut governors have not had such vast personal fortunes. The exception was Lowell P. Weicker Jr. But while he entered politics with inherited family wealth, he told the Los Angeles Times in 1994 that a career in public service had depleted his finances.

Texto completo: Shirley Chisholm stares out from the side of a dozen coffee mugs these days, her epochal glasses, brocade dresses and distinct crown of curls recognizable trademarks of the most regenerative political figure in modern American culture.
As a number of new congresswomen begin to emerge in her image, Ms. Chisholm, who 50 years ago began her service as the first African-American woman in Congress, representing Brooklyn's 12th District, is enjoying a resurgence of interest 14 years after her death.
The actor Viola Davis is producing and starring in a feature film about her, "The Fighting Shirley Chisholm," and the congresswoman will be portrayed by the actress Uzo Aduba in the upcoming series "Mrs. America," which chronicles the movement to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.
The Shirley Chisholm State Park -- the largest state park in New York City -- opened July 2 in Brooklyn. The congresswoman will soon be the first female historical figure to have a public monument in Brooklyn. Representative Yvette Clarke, who holds the seat held by Ms. Chisholm, is working to get a statue of her placed in the United States Capitol.
This month, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, another Brooklyn Democrat, had a portrait of her made to hang in the office of the House Democratic Caucus -- which he heads -- on Capitol Hill. "The social, economic and social-justice fights that Shirley Chisholm once led have sharpened in the Trump era," Mr. Jeffries said. Those forces have converged, he added, with "the logical attention to her 50th anniversary of becoming the first African-American woman in Congress."
John Stanton, a writer in New Orleans, recently had a replica of the 2008 portrait of Ms. Chisholm that hangs in the Capitol tattooed on his knee. "People want heroes right now," Mr. Stanton said, "and they're looking for heroes that aren't just straight white men."
Before the feminist movement fueled a slow wave of new women into Congress, Ms. Chisholm was a one-woman precursor to modern progressive politics. A community activist and educator who served briefly in the State Legislature, Ms. Chisholm decided to run for a House seat in 1968, her campaign centered squarely on gender; her primary opponent repeatedly suggested that a man was better suited to represent the area in Washington.
An advocate for the poor and working class, Ms. Chisholm employed a pre-Instagram method of direct engagement, a sound truck that she rolled up to Brooklyn housing projects bellowing, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is fighting Shirley Chisholm coming through."
As the first African-American woman in Congress, Ms. Chisholm was often frozen out by men of all races and felt alienated by the feminist movement. In a 1974 speech at the University of Missouri, she said: "It is quite understandable why black women in the majority are not interested in walking and picketing a cocktail lounge which historically has refused to open its doors a certain two hours a day when men who have just returned from Wall Street gather in said lounge to exchange bits of business transactions that occurred on the market. This is a middle-class white woman's issue." Her efforts took years to be replicated. "You now have 20 black women in Congress," Ms. Clarke said. "She was the only one."
In 1972, Ms. Chisholm became the first African-American woman to seek the nomination of a major party for president of the United States. Thinking she could consolidate black, female and working-class voters under her campaign slogan and theme, "Unbought and Unbossed," she ran up hard against the political realities and institutional sexism and racism of the era.
Ms. Chisholm was initially blocked from a televised debate, was derided by many of her black male colleagues in Congress who thought she had overstepped and was abandoned by white feminists like Gloria Steinem. But her unsuccessful run sealed her legacy as an unapologetic antiwar, feminist and working-class advocate, work she pursued until retiring from Congress in 1983. (In a twist, she also formed a genuine friendship with a presidential opponent, George Wallace, the former pro-segregationist governor of Alabama, and visited him in the hospital after he was shot.)
"A number of scholars have been doing a lot of work to expand the discourse on Shirley Chisholm for about six years knowing that there would be the 50th anniversary of her election to Congress," said Zinga A. Fraser, director of the Shirley Chisholm Project on Brooklyn Women's Activism at Brooklyn College. Still, "Hillary Clinton did not evoke her during her campaign," Ms. Fraser said. "Neither did Barack Obama."
In popular culture and politics, the fascination with Ms. Chisholm went into a period of hibernation after she left Congress. "Shirley Chisholm had just been erased and forgotten," said Barbara Winslow, a professor emeritus at Brooklyn College and founder of the Shirley Chisholm Project. The rise of progressive politics on the left and the wave of women officeholders, including the first black and Muslim and Native American representatives from their districts, have combined to give Ms. Chisholm new cultural consideration.
Her speeches were of particular interest to Alphonso David, who is counsel to Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and who sponsored the exhibit honoring Ms. Chisholm in a state office building. "They defined empowerment," he said, noting remarks at Howard University in 1969 that resonate today. She said, "Just as the picket line and the lunch counter demonstrations and the boycotts were dramatic and effective weapons of protest for the civil rights movement, the polling place is the new phase in the new thrust of the black man's bid for equality of opportunity."
Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, was given Ms. Chisholm's office in the Longworth House Office Building by her colleague, Representative Katie Hill, who had drawn it in the office lottery. "I feel a soul tie to Shirley Chisholm," Ms. Pressley said. "The vibe of her office fills me with the courage to boldly lead, boldly legislate, and to never forget those who sent me here." Ms. Pressley was one of many women who evoked Ms. Chisholm during their 2018 congressional campaigns.
The former Representative Charles Rangel, who served from 1971 to 2017, said Ms. Chisholm's "newly found recognition" was "fully due to this new women's movement." He added, "Shirley did not get this type of support from men or women at the time. We always wait until somebody dies to do what we wish we had done while they were alive."

Texto completo: Rep. Ilhan Omar stepped to the edge of the stage in front of about 400 Richfield High School students and squinted into the lights.
More than two decades had passed since she and her family fled civil war in Somalia, first for a Kenyan refugee camp and then America. Now she was 36, one of the youngest members of Congress and the first lawmaker to wear a hijab in the legislative body's long history. She was also at the center of a contentious fight over American identity that pitted her against the president and, even, some in her own party.
At issue wasn't a piece of legislation or an election. It was something bigger - a battle over the American story - who was entitled to tell it and how it would be told.
In Omar's version, America wasn't the bighearted country that saved her from a brutal war and a bleak refugee camp. It wasn't a meritocracy that helped her attend college or vaulted her into Congress. Instead, it was the country that had failed to live up to its founding ideals, a place that had disappointed her and so many immigrants, refugees and minorities like her.
"I grew up in an extremely unjust society, and the only thing that made my family excited about coming to the United States was that the United States was supposed to be the country that guaranteed justice to all," she told the high school students. "So, I feel it necessary for me to speak about that promise that's not kept."
And so, on this morning she decided to share a story of American racism, cruelty and injustice.
Five years earlier, Omar told the students, she was working for a Minneapolis city councilman who asked her to report back on problems with the courts. There, she recalled encountering a "sweet, old . . . African American lady" who had been arrested for stealing a $2 loaf of bread to feed her "starving 5-year-old granddaughter."
After spending the weekend in jail, the woman was led into the courtroom and fined $80 - a penalty she couldn't pay. "I couldn't control my emotions," Omar continued, "because I couldn't understand how a roomful of educated adults could do something so unjust."
"Bulls---!" she recalled yelling in the courtroom.
Laughter rippled through the auditorium, then silence.
Omar's story echoed the plot of "Les Miserables." If true, it is also probably embellished. City officials said that police aren't allowed to arrest people for shoplifting unless there's a likelihood of violence or further crime. Typically, shoplifters are sentenced to attend a three-hour class.
In an interview, Omar said she may have flubbed some facts. "She might have had a prior [arrest]," Omar said. "I'm not sure. . . . The details might not have all matched, but that's what I remember."
After the speech, the students, who were mostly minorities, swarmed the congresswoman. "It's great to have a representative who looks like the people she represents," a white student said.
An African American student asked about mentors: "I have none," Omar said. "You don't need people to guide you. You can guide yourself."
A Somali girl in a hijab asked how she weathered the attacks on her appearance, her patriotism and her religion from the president and Fox News. "I refuse to give oxygen to people who suck out oxygen," Omar replied.
"I like that," the girl said.
The lights flipped off in the auditorium. The students had missed their lunch period. Omar, who was already running 30 minutes behind schedule, made her way toward the exit, stopping every few steps for another selfie.
Some politicians are inseparable from their story. Such is the case with Omar. Her family landed at a Kenyan refugee camp when she was 8 and spent the next four years in poverty. "It was the first time I understood what hunger would feel like, what death looked like," she said in "Time for Ilhan," a documentary that chronicles her 2016 run for the Minnesota State House.
Shortly after her family was cleared in 1995 to come to America, they traveled to Nairobi to watch an orientation film for new immigrants. Years later, on the campaign trail, Omar would recall that version of America, with its pristine suburbs, perfect lawns and paeans to representative democracy.
Then she would recount arriving in a New York City that was cramped, dirty and populated by panhandlers.
"This doesn't look like the America you promised," Omar recalled telling her father, Nur Omar Mohamed.
"We're not in our America yet," he replied to his 12-year-old daughter. In Omar's immigrant story, America wasn't a "city on a hill," a haven for grateful masses fleeing war and oppression. Rather, it was a broken promise. "I arrived at the age of 12 and learned that I was the extreme other," she often said. "I was black. I was Muslim. I also learned I was extremely poor and that the classless America that my father talked about didn't exist."
The family spent one year in the Washington suburbs, where Omar told a reporter for the New York Times that she was bullied by middle school students who stuck gum in her scarf, jumped her in the locker room and knocked her down the stairs. "They are doing this to you because they feel threatened in some way by your existence," she said her father told her.
Eventually, her family settled in Minneapolis's Cedar-Riverside neighborhood - the heart of the Somali diaspora. The neighborhood, anchored by six dilapidated high-rises that overlook the interstate, had long been a haven for those escaping war. Some of the first occupants were Hmong refugees fleeing Vietnam and Laos in the 1970s. Somalis began arriving about 20 years later.
Omar's father drove a cab and then found a job with better hours and benefits at the post office. As a teenager, Omar accompanied her grandfather to Democratic Party caucuses, acting as his interpreter. "And through that process, I fell in love" with politics, she said.
She had her first child at age 20, earned her degree from North Dakota State University at 28 and by 34 had launched her campaign for the Minnesota House against an incumbent who had held the seat for more than four decades.
Her long-shot campaign took shape at a Perkins Restaurant in the shadow of the Brutalist-style cement high-rises. After she had put her children to sleep, Omar would meet up with David Gilbert-Pederson, an activist who was in his early 20s, and talk until well past midnight.
Gilbert-Pederson, who is Filipino, was adopted by two white Minneapolis librarians. He dropped out of high school and still didn't have a driver's license when he signed on as Omar's campaign chairman in late 2015. But he had been active in politics, protest movements and organizing since before he could vote. As a child, Gilbert-Pederson played Filipino People's Party, a role-playing game he made up with friends, his mother said.
Gilbert-Pederson pushed Omar to run. "It kind of became a joke between the two of us," he said. She'd vent about politics and he'd tell her to stop complaining and run for office.
The two began to map out a strategy. Gilbert-Pederson helped her forge relationships with many of the environmental, LGBTQ, civil rights and labor groups whose support Omar would need to win in a statehouse district that's about 60 percent white. Her current congressional district, which encompasses most of Minneapolis, is about 70 percent white.
Each week, Omar and Gilbert-Pederson arranged meetings with two to three activist leaders. She courted older peace-and-justice hippies and was a regular presence at the University of Minnesota, where she worked to mobilize students who didn't normally vote but might be drawn to a young candidate who could speak Somali and quote rapper Tupac Shakur. She showed up at Black Lives Matter protests that swept through the city after the shootings of Jamar Clark in November 2015 and Philando Castile the following year.
Omar won the primary in August 2016, all but guaranteeing her election. Three days before the general election, Donald Trump flew into Minneapolis and vowed to halt the influx of "terror prone" Somali refugees into the country.
"How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are they to allow this to happen?" Trump shouted to the crowd. "You've suffered enough, Minnesota!"
On the day Trump won the presidency, Omar was elected to the Minnesota State House. She was only one of more than 5,000 state legislators across the country, but as the first-ever Somali lawmaker and a refugee, she drew national attention and scrutiny.
Conservative blogs dug into her complicated marital history. She and the father of her three children split temporarily in the 2000s but still filed joint tax returns in 2014 and 2015, when Omar was legally married to someone else.
Omar danced in a Maroon 5 video alongside lead singer Adam Levine and was interviewed by Trevor Noah of "The Daily Show."
"What's the plan?" Noah asked her.
"I am America's hope," she replied, "and the president's nightmare."
Today, a cross-stitch of that line is framed in her congressional office.
For Omar, figuring out what it means to be the "president's nightmare" on a national stage has been a work in progress. In theory, she said, it means amplifying marginalized voices at home and overseas.
In practice, it has been more complicated. First came the backlash this winter over her suggestion that the Israel lobby was using its resources to buy off supporters - "it's all about the Benjamins," she tweeted. Omar apologized for the remark, but she also blamed her colleagues for overreacting.
"There is an almost demonized view that people have of us that makes it really hard for others to see us as their neighbors, their friends and as their colleague as a member of Congress," she said in an interview. Such attitudes, she said, also afflicted her Democratic colleagues.
In March, at a banquet for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, Omar appeared to minimize the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "CAIR was founded after 9/11," she said, "because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties." (The council was founded in 1994). Omar's speech was a call for Muslims to take part in civic life as full citizens, not guests in the country. "Raise hell," she told the crowd. "Make people uncomfortable."
Trump tweeted a video that interspersed Omar's 9/11 remarks with footage of the burning World Trade Center towers. Democrats denounced the president for inciting violence against her. One week later a man who threatened Omar's life was arrested in New York with a cache of ammunition and guns.
In May, Omar's allies held a rally on her behalf in front of the U.S. Capitol. "Everyone knows that I refuse to cry," she told the crowd. "I always say that nobody really deserves my tears." But as she gazed out at her supporters and turned to address the civil rights activist Angela Davis, sitting behind her on the stage, her voice cracked, and she covered her face with her hands.
"This is not going to be the country of white people," she vowed. "This is not going to be the country of the few."
Like many immigrant diasporas, the 50,000 Somalis in Minnesota have complicated views of their adopted country that mix gratitude, frustration, alienation and pride. One thing they share is a worry for Omar.
"She gets a lot of death threats, but every soul has a time," Mariam Ibrahim, 60, said over dinner at home with her three daughters.
Her eldest, Filsan, 30, was the master of ceremonies at an Omar fundraiser in 2016, and like many young Somali activists felt a kinship with her. She put less stock in destiny than her mother.
"Cheeto is so careless," she said, using a derogatory nickname for the president. "Every day he's riling people up. I want her to be protected, to be with her children."
It was the holy month of Ramadan and the Ibrahims had gathered to break the day's fast. Mariam ran a small day care out of her home in the same room where her family had spread a tablecloth on the floor for dinner. She struggled to speak English but had put all three of her daughters through college and regularly nagged her eldest, Filsan, to get a master's degree.
Two decades after arriving in America, Mariam still felt like a guest in the country that had saved her life. "No husband. No father. No brother," she said. "We love America."
She disappeared upstairs and returned with the white, plastic International Office for Migration bag that she received upon landing in Minnesota and had saved as a reminder of the uncertainty, hope and joy that accompanied her family's first days in America. Inside were passport-size photos of her children - all under the age of 10 - looking exhausted and overwhelmed. One of her daughters began to read a boilerplate welcome letter, signed by President George W. Bush.
Filsan and her sisters laughed at the letter's formal language. "Americans are united across generations by grand and enduring ideals," it began.
"You know Godd--- well that Bush did not write that," Filsan said.
Her sister kept reading: "Our country has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by principles that move us beyond our backgrounds . . ."
"All of America is focused on people's backgrounds," Filsan said. "It's all anyone cares about. You can't come here and just be an American unless you are white. Otherwise you are a Somali American, an African American, an Asian American."
"It's bulls---," her sister agreed.
"Hilarious," her other sister added.
A few days later Filsan, her mother and her sisters attended a fundraiser and rally for nine Somalis who had been convicted in 2016 of trying to travel to Syria to fight on behalf of the Islamic State.
Omar had written a letter on behalf of the men on the day she was elected in 2016, urging rehabilitation instead of prison time. "The desire to commit violence is not inherent in people - it is the consequence of systemic alienation," she wrote the judge. She had known other young men from school who died fighting for al-Shabab, the al-Qaeda affiliate in Somalia.
Since her letter she has kept her distance from the case, which she knew was politically toxic, an easy opportunity for her enemies to paint her as un-American.
For Filsan, the trial remained a source of anger and frustration. Her generation of Somali refugees saw America as home, but they lived under a shadow of suspicion. Armed American drones regularly fired missiles into their homeland. In Minneapolis, the FBI was surveilling their mosques and paying off informants.
Filsan had protested the FBI's "countering violent extremism" program in Minneapolis, which sought to dissuade Somalis from joining terrorism groups, but which she believed stigmatized the Somali community.
About 400 people - most of them young Somalis - filled a gymnasium in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. The main purpose of the event was to raise money to help Guled Ali Omar appeal his 35-year sentence.
Filsan didn't know Guled or his family. But the trial and its aftermath had left her feeling "defeated," she said. At the sentencing, the judge compared the nine Somalis to the Islamic State operatives who had trained in Syria and then killed hundreds of innocents in Paris and Brussels. "Everyone talks about Brussels and Paris having cells," the judge said. "We have a cell here in Minneapolis."
To Filsan, it didn't make sense. The men on trial had never touched a weapon or left the United States. "I don't think they knew what they were getting into and I don't think they need to give up their lives for something that never happened," she said. "That's madness." The heavy sentences, she said, were the product of racism, Islamophobia and the never-ending war on terror.
After prayers and an Iftar meal, Filsan hugged one of Guled's sisters and headed home with her mother and sisters.
About a dozen of Guled's friends lingered in the parking lot, posing for pictures they planned to post on Instagram. "Fingers up," someone called out.
Most of the men raised their index fingers, a gesture that symbolizes the oneness of God and has become widely associated with the Islamic State. They flashed the same sign during the trial in 2016, drawing the ire of the prosecutor.
The young Somalis in the parking lot - a mix of men and women - said they didn't subscribe to the Islamic State's fanatical interpretation of the Koran. And they certainly didn't support any terrorist groups. But, on this night, they were trying to send a message - one of Muslim solidarity, alienation and defiance.
Spend some time with the congresswoman in Washington and her district and it can feel as if there are two Ilhan Omars. There's Omar, the anti-Trump, the symbol, whose introduction is almost always followed by a series of "firsts." She's the first Somali American lawmaker, the first woman of color to serve Minnesota in Congress, the first lawmaker to wear a hijab on the House floor.
Then there's the other version of the congresswoman - less confident, more compassionate and not nearly as angry.
The first, better-known version has become a fundraising juggernaut, raising more than $875,000 since November, the second-most among new House Democrats.
This version of the Minnesota lawmaker often seeks out fights that go viral. At the height of her Israel controversy, Omar used her position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee to castigate Elliot Abrams, a longtime hawk and Trump's new Venezuela envoy.
She quoted Abrams's claim that U.S. policy in El Salvador in the 1980s had been a "fabulous achievement" and asked if he thought a 1981 massacre in which U.S.-trained troops killed 800 Salvadoran civilians, met that standard.
"That is a ridiculous question!" Abrams replied.
"Yes or no," Omar calmly repeated.
"I am not going to respond to that kind of personal attack," Abrams complained.
Omar understood that her personal history gave the exchange power. For decades people like her had been on the receiving end of U.S. foreign policy. Such people typically get "beaten into submission," she said. Now, Omar was the one delivering the beating.
Sometimes this version of the congresswoman botched basic facts. Recently, she told a group of veterans that about 45 percent of military families rely on food stamps. She was trying to make the point that Republicans didn't care for the troops. The actual number is less than 5 percent, according to Pentagon statistics.
At times, she struggled to see the humanity in her opponents, dismissing a paralyzed Gulf War veteran's suggestion that the presence in Congress of more combat veterans, who have experienced the costs of war, might produce a more cautious foreign policy and improve veteran care.
"I've been in rooms with people who have served who say the most horrendous things, who have complete disregard for life," she said. "I would love for that statement to be true, but it isn't in most cases."
A few days later, it was the other version of the congresswoman - quieter, less confrontational - who visited a food pantry in St. Louis Park, a community that since the 1950s has been the center of Jewish life in Minneapolis. The suburb touts former senator Al Franken, New York Times columnist Tom Friedman and the Oscar-award-winning Coen brothers as native sons.
The mayor and several members of the city council waited for Omar in a small conference room typically used by the city's social workers. Steve Hallfin, a councilman and insurance wholesaler, had been bothered by some of her remarks. He knew some of his constituents felt the same way.
"I thought I should hit her with both guns on the Israel stuff," he said. But he decided that pressing her on that issue wouldn't help his constituents or fix his city's problems. "She's new to Congress," he said. "I'm not willing to overlook [her statements], but she deserves a chance."
His first impression upon seeing her: "She looks much taller on TV," he said of Omar, who is just a shade over 5 feet. As the group toured the food pantry, Omar talked about the nearly identical rules governing halal and kosher food.
"It's interesting how our people have the same kinds of food but nothing else," Hallfin replied.
Mayor Jake Spano filled her in on a recent "Women for Trump" rally that drew about 200 marchers, most of whom came from out of town. Trump won less than 18 percent of the vote in St. Louis Park.
"What was the purpose of this?" Omar asked of the march.
"I think they knew it was your district," the mayor answered.
The group discussed the rising cost of housing, the steady demand for the food pantry's services and the increasing number of immigrant families drawn to the city's school system. All were familiar topics for Omar, who had worked in Minneapolis City Hall and as a nutrition outreach coordinator for the state's education department. She asked questions and scribbled notes.
Soon it was time to leave. Omar and the mayor lingered by the door, chatting about the rewards and challenges of public life. "People remember how you made them feel," the mayor said. "It's special."
"It makes the horrible days bearable," Omar agreed.
Her thoughts shifted to the strains of her new profession. The closest analogy, she decided, was parenting.
"You're not supposed to be tired or sad," she said. She thought for a moment and found one more similarity. "You don't get any training. You have to be an expert on the first day," she said. "They just give you the baby and that's it."

Texto completo: Did you see the article regarding "Apple shifting the assembly of the Mac Pro to China"? Bismarck Tribune, Sunday, June 30, Money section, page B11. 
"Apple has assembled Mac Pros in Austin, Texas, since 2013 ... CEO Tim Cook trumpeted in a national television interview." Per the article, "But the Austin factory, run by Flex Ltd, encountered problems finding enough skilled workers willing to accept work for minimum wage." What?!
The U.S. minimum wage for 2019 is $7.25 per hour  that is $14,500 annually for a 40 hour week, full time job  and this is their offer/expectation for skilled workers! Apple has a contract with Flex Ltd. Apple's net income for the 2018 fiscal year was $59.5 billion. Net income equals total revenue minus total business expenses. 
"Almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by The New York Times, Apple insiders "believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that "Made in the U.S.A." is no longer a viable option for most Apple products." What?! 
Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. 
Looks to me like Apple is either Un-American or Anti-American. 
If our people aren't good enough to build Apple products, at a competitive wage, maybe Apple products should "no longer be a viable option" when we purchase! 
Irene Rankin, Bismarck

Iconic Otis Cafe burns over holiday

Texto completo: The Otis Cafe, an iconic stop for residents on their way to or from the central Oregon Coast, caught fire Thursday.
Crews from North Lincoln Fire & Rescue were dispatched at about 7:45 p.m. to the cafe about five miles east of Lincoln City on Highway 18, according to dispatch records.
Cafe owner Jeff England told the Lincoln City Homepage that the fire destroyed much of the interior.
"It's fairly gutted. It's not pretty. Hopefully, we can get it up and running as soon as possible," England said.
Officials with the fire district report there were no injuries and the fire was extinguished in about 20 minutes. Crews stayed on scene throughout the night to monitor for flare-ups.
According to Statesman Journal archives, the Otis Cafe was established in the 1920s.
The pint-sized diner offered a handful of booths and a few stools, which often led to lines out the door on summer weekends. It seated about 30 customers.
A note tacked to the front door in the 1980s read: "Each meal is cooked to order and if you're in a hurry, you might prefer another restaurant."
It wasn't just a local phenomenon, the New York Times published a review of the roadside diner in 1989.
Visitors were known to rave about the restaurant's black molasses bread.
The cafe was one of just a handful of businesses in the unincorporated town of Otis, which made national headlines in 1999 and again in 2004 when it was for sale for about $3 million. Included in the sale were the cafe, a gas station and the post office.
Gary Fromm reportedly bought the town in 2015. The cafe isn't the only eatery in town anymore. He opened Otis Pizzeria in 2018.
An investigation in the diner fire is ongoing by the Lincoln County Fire Investigation team, Oregon State Fire Marshal Office and the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office.
Crews from North Lincoln Fire & Rescue responded to a fire at Otis Cafe on Thursday.

15 Jersey Shore restaurants for fine dining

Autor: Griesemer, Sarah.

Texto completo: Some days, the perfect dinner is a hamburger with a side of crispy fries and a cold beer. Other days, it's a pie from your favorite pizzeria.
But from time to time, dinner should be more of a special occasion.
Maybe you're on vacation and are looking forward to a really nice dinner out. Or maybe there's something to celebrate — a new job? A big birthday? A wedding anniversary?
Or perhaps you're just in the mood to treat yourself to a really, really good meal.
When that time comes, here are 15 restaurants that fit the bill:
The Poached Pear Bistro, Point Pleasant Beach Chef Scott Giordano knows what he's not, and that's "over the top, frou-frou style."
But that doesn't mean the chef, who opened The Poached Pear Bistro with his brother, Marc, in 2014, isn't cooking top-notch food.
"I try to keep it simple: a couple elements to the dish, nice flavors, a nice portion," said Giordano, whose menu of elevated comfort food includes duck confit ravioli with blood orange butter; rack of lamb with baby vegetables; and coffee-rubbed New York strip steak with mushroom risotto.
The chef also pays more attention to children's dishes than most restaurants; he feels young diners deserve good food, too. "Little pears," as they are called, will find their favorites, done better: panko-crusted chicken tenders with housemade french fries, petite filet mignon with mashed potatoes, and flatbread pizza.
Go: 816 Arnold Ave.; 732-701-1700, poachedpearbistro.com.
Blu Grotto Ristorante, Oceanport After a day at the races at Monmouth Park Racetrack, head to this restaurant on the grounds — look for the conservatory-style dining room, with floor-to-ceiling windows.
Inside, Chef James Corona prepares modern and classic Italian dishes like short rib meatballs; veal porterhouse with artichokes; lamb chops Milanese with cauliflower caponata; and branzino with chickpeas, Swiss chard and pesto.
Outside the glass-walled dining room, the restaurant has three outdoor patios and a beer garden. Brunch is served on Sundays; dishes include French toast souffle, eggs in purgatory, and skirt steak and eggs.
Go: 200 Port Au Peck Ave.; 732-571-7900, blugrottonj.com.
Pascal & Sabine, Asbury Park In the fall of 2014, nearly a year after Pascal & Sabine brought French food to Bangs Avenue, a reviewer from The New York Times came calling. She tried escargot in garlic butter, coq au vin, steak frites, and milk chocolate pot de crème. Her review declared that the restaurant had "beauty, spirit and, in general, exceedingly good food. For these reasons, it stands out among the state's few, fine French restaurants."
From the highly regarded Smith restaurant group (also the owner of Brickwall Tavern, Porta, The Annex and Little Buddy Hideaway in the city), Pascal & Sabine is a place to savor champagne and Petrossian caviar, served with whipped crème fraîche.
The restaurant offers a seven-course chef's table experience complete with wine pairings, plus dishes like chicken liver mousse, country pork pâté, and the hard-to-find Dover sole, which is pan-seared in brown butter, parsley, lemon and capers.
Go: 601 Bangs Ave.; 732-774-3395, pascalandsabine.com.
Osteria Radici, Allentown A little less than two years ago, the husband and wife team of Randy and Ally Forrester opened Osteria Radici, serving modern Italian food in the tiny borough of Allentown.
Since then, their restaurant has garnered two James Beard nominations. The first, which came four months after the opening, was for best new restaurant. Osteria Radici was the only New Jersey restaurant on the list that year.
Not too shabby for the new guy in town.
This year, Randy Forrester was nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic.
In his kitchen, he makes his own bread and pasta each day. Ally runs the front of house.
Their menu, a marriage of traditional Italian cuisine and modern technique, changes daily and includes such dishes as sea trout crudo with caper honey; pressed pork cheek with broccoli rabe; and gnocchi with lamb sausage ragu.
Go: 4 S Main St.; 609-223-2395, osteriaradici.com.
Restaurant Nicholas, Middletown It has been nearly 20 years since Chef Nicholas Harary and his wife, Melissa, opened their fine-dining restaurant a stone's throw from bustling Red Bank, and the accolades for inspired cuisine, exceptional service and truly great wine keep coming.
One of the best – and most indulgent – ways to enjoy a meal here is by taking a seat in the kitchen: The chef's table, nestled into an cozy alcove, overlooks the bustling kitchen. In the dining room, diners choose between three-, four- and five-course tasting menus.
Dishes include pickled heirloom beets with mascarpone, butter-poached lobster with pasta, and bourbon-braised suckling pig with apples and maple jus. Dinner also is served in the bar area, called Bar N.

U.S. national team
The Women's World Cup final on Sunday will be one for the books.
The faceoff between the United States and Netherlands is expected to be an explosive finale after four weeks of some of the most competitive matchups in the tournament's 28-year history. And, it's likely that the impact from this year's tournament will be felt long after that final whistle blows inside France's Parc Olympique Lyonnais.
This summer's tournament is being hailed as a watershed moment for women's soccer and women's sports, with the U.S. national team steering the course.
The popularity of the women's game has grown in record-breaking ways in a matter of weeks, especially in the United States. The U.S. women's home jersey just became the best-selling soccer jersey, men's or women's, ever sold on Nike.com in one season, Nike executives said in an earnings call ahead of the United States quarterfinal game against France last week. Then on Thursday, ESPN announced it would bring the National Women's Soccer League, which features 55 players who competed in the World Cup, back on television, with plans to air 14 games beginning July 14 through the remainder of its season — capitalizing on soccer's momentum.
The league, which is the top professional women's soccer league in the United States, had been without a national TV partner since the beginning of its current season after A&E Networks and Lifetime prematurely ended a three-year deal that included weekly national broadcasts.
Sarah Killion, a midfielder and captain of New Jersey's Sky Blue FC, which plays in the NWSL, said teams should try and build off the momentum from the World Cup, and take advantage of the national attention.
"This is a time where we really have to cease the moment coming up because this could have so much impact on future generations of women's soccer and just the next couple of years," Killion said in a phone interview Friday, while traveling with her team to Chicago for a Saturday game. "If we can keep building the numbers and comradery around the sport, then it's only going to help women's sports and especially women's soccer just get into the next level."
In July 2015, after the previous Women's World Cup ended, Killion recalled the influx of fans who descended to Yurcak Field in Piscataway, where Sky Blue plays. She said fans flooded the stadiums to see some of their favorite World Cups stars competing for their local club.
"It felt like we were playing in a World Cup in a sense," Killion said. "It was so much fun to play in that type of atmosphere."
One game could feel like another World Cup game in Piscataway. The Sunday, Aug. 18, match between Sky Blue FC, has Carli Lloyd on its roster, and Reign FChas Megan Rapinoe. That game will be broadcast on ESPNews at 1 p.m.
Bigger than soccer But this year's World Cup has the potential to propel women's sports beyond the field.
The U.S. team has made national headlines for weeks, all the while dominating on the pitch, securing the defending champions their third-straight World Cup final.
From the team's 13-0 victory against Thailand during group stages, to Alex Morgan's tea-sipping celebration after scoring on her 30th birthday in a semifinal match against England — several of the narratives around this team have shone a light on what it's like to be a female athlete competing at the highest level of your sport.
"I feel that there is some sort of double standard for females in sports," Morgan told ESPN, "to feel like we have to be humble in our successes and have to celebrate, but not too much or in a limited fashion."
Rapinoe has arguably been one of the loudest voices on the team. The openly gay star forward has not shied away from speaking her mind. Her comments about not accepting an invite to the White House went viral early in the tournament, prompting President Donald Trump to tweet at her. Rapinoe has stood by her comments, and addressed critics in a thought-provoking, minute-long response to reporters this week.
Rapinoe has also been protesting the national anthem during the World Cup by refraining from putting her hand over her heart or singing along. She has been doing so since 2016, a nod to Colin Kaepernick, and in a recent Yahoo Sports interview called herself a "walking protest."
Once the tournament ends, the U.S. national team will be coming home to fight another battle: one for equal pay.
In March, all 28 members of the national team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit in United States District Court in Los Angeles against their employer, the United States Soccer Federation. The team alleges in the suit that, among other things, U.S. Soccer paid them less than their male counterparts, and denied them equal playing, training, and travel conditions. Last month, both sides agreed to begin a mediation process as soon as the women complete play in the World Cup, The New York times reported.
U.S. Soccer has long argued that any pay discrepancy is based on revenues generated by the teams — but a recent Wall Street Journal report, which examined the organization's financial reports, found that women's games reportedly generate more total revenue than U.S. men's games.
The outcome of the dispute, which has been a years-long spat between the team and its employer, could have ramifications well beyond the soccer world.
World Cup 2015, then and now
This weekend, only one team will be left standing — the United States, who is vying for its fourth World Cup victory, or the Netherlands, who is playing in its first final ever.
Fans will have to wait another four years before they are able to experience it all again. The space between Women's World Cups, however, can be a time for growth for the sport. A lot has changed since the last Women's World Cup, some coaches have said.
Rutgers' head women's coach Mike O'Neill said during an interview at the start of the tournament that women's soccer has made strides since 2015, when the U.S. national team lifted the cup at the end.
"Women's football is in a better place today than it was back then," O'Neill said in June. "But it's also extremely important that they continue to put more resources in [women's soccer] ... After the World Cup is over, then expectations continue to rise. That will never change. I think that it's only going to get better, and better, and better."
Although fans will have to wait four years, the next tournament may be the largest rendition of the tournament in its history.
On Friday, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said he supported expanding the women's tournament from 24 teams to 32 teams, possibly as soon as 2023, the New York Times reported. The expansion would mean more opportunity for growth of women's soccer in new markets, and more prize money for the tournament's winners.
Another sign that women's soccer may be reaching new heights.
"I feel that there is some sort of double standard for females in sports to feel like we have to be humble in our successes and have to celebrate, but not too much or in a limited fashion."

Texto completo: Usually I go car-free on vacation. This time, I went car-free to vacation.
My wish was to go to San Diego for a long weekend to see my team, the St. Louis Cardinals, play the Padres. And rather than drive to San Diego, I decided to take the train.
The last time I went to San Diego, in 2015, I drove to Encinitas, parked long-term and took the Coaster train to San Diego for the experience, but also to save on hotel parking. Coaster is Metrolink under a different name.
That was a pleasant 50-minute ride. But it made me want to do something more ambitious.
This time I decided to take Amtrak from L.A. Union Station. And to get to Union Station, I took Metrolink.
In other words, I took the train to the train.
This involved a small amount of planning, as I had to find good Amtrak times with a Metrolink train in proximity. Then I booked a modestly priced Gaslamp Quarter hotel — one that wasn’t quite so modest after nearly 20% in taxes — near a trolley stop.
That Friday morning, I drove a few blocks to the Metrolink station in Claremont. But that was the extent of my driving.
As longtime readers know, I’m a fan of public transit and of Metrolink. I enjoy the mild challenge of working out the connections while doing my bit for the environment. Taking transit makes me feel more urban. Plus, riding provides time to read, always a plus.
I got to Union Station more than an hour before my Amtrak train would leave, but that seemed right as I didn’t know about check-in procedures.
With the Pacific Surfliner, it turns out, all you do is board, the same as Metrolink. So I relaxed in a leather chair in the Union Station waiting room until about 20 minutes before departure.
The train was filling up when I did board, and I had lost the chance for a window seat on the second deck. Rookie mistake. Still, the rows are only two seats, so I had a good view regardless.
And the comfort! Compared to airlines, the coach seats are about five inches wider and have about eight inches more legroom.
Which brings up another point: You board without going through a luggage scanner, emptying your pockets, removing your belt and shoes, or submitting to a patdown or nude photo via the body scanner.
You can leave your tray table down the whole trip and use the restroom whenever you like. Now this is a civilized way to travel.
At the first stop, in Fullerton, the passenger at the window seat next to me disembarked. What a break. I scooted over and had a westside window seat the rest of the trip.
After the industrial and business zones came a few patches of agriculture, with pickers working the fields, and the rustic charm of San Juan Capistrano’s Los Rios Street.
South of there, at Capistrano Beach, the surf was perhaps 100 feet away. People could be seen on that shallow stretch of sand walking or sunbathing with books.
After the San Clemente Pier, the train was farther inland, paralleling the 5 Freeway, until the ocean became visible and near again at Solano Beach down a small bluff.
Three hours after leaving Union Station, the Surfliner arrived at the last stop, San Diego’s Santa Fe Depot.
Built in 1915 in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, the depot has twin domes, lots of arches and a waiting room with wooden benches and a soaring ceiling. It’s not too different from Santa Fe’s 1918 depot in San Bernardino.
From the depot, a $5 daily transit pass got me around, as did hoofing it. I saw the Cardinals-Padres game that first night with a San Diego pal. The Cards lost 3-1.
I’m thankful I skipped the next night, when they lost 12-2. A simple loss can be borne stoically, but a humiliation is too much.
Saturday, my friend picked me up to go bowling. He dropped me off, at my request, at Liberty Public Market, a food hall at Point Loma. I cobbled together lunch from multiple vendors and then wondered how I might find my way back to San Diego proper.
But Google Maps did the trick: A short walk took me to a bus stop, and I made that and two further connections seamlessly, arriving in the Hillcrest neighborhood in 40 minutes.
From there it was one block to my destination, Bluestocking Books, a very good used bookstore. I picked up a collection of Red Smith sports columns, unable to resist the blurb on the back from the New York Times: “Red Smith was to sports what Homer was to war.”
Two blocks away was Record City, an equally good record store, from which I bought a Firesign Theatre boxed set.
Three blocks back and I was soon on a bus that dropped me near my hotel.
Incidentally, I had considered my $71 Amtrak round-trip something of a splurge, especially when Metrolink tickets brought the total to $89. But in San Diego, hotels like mine were charging $45 a night for parking. I was there two nights.
Did I come out a buck ahead?
The next morning, I returned to the Santa Fe Depot and took a seat on one of the worn benches. As I did when I boarded in Los Angeles, I kind of wished I’d dressed in a suit, tie and fedora, and maybe had my shoes polished at a shoeshine stand, all for the vintage effect.
An Amish family was among the waiting passengers. The two men wore beards, hats and slacks, the older man in a vest, and the women were in dresses and bonnets. Now that’s a vintage effect.
Learning from my rookie mistake, I stood in line on the shaded platform to get a window seat. That worked out pretty well.
Except a college-age kid soon took the seat in front of me, and reclined it as far as it would go. By this point, all the other window seats were taken.
Even with his lean, I had plenty of room. I read from “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” while enjoying free wi-fi, free electricity for my phone and the same scenes as before, only in reverse.
At Union Station, with an hour and 15 minutes before my Metrolink train home, I rolled my baggage down Alameda Street for lunch at Philippe, founded in 1908. It was an old-time way to end an old-time trip.

E.U.'s Pick for Top Job: Too Pious for Feminists, Too Feminist for Conservatives

Texto completo: BERLIN -- She is a gynecologist with seven children who knows just about everything about fighter jets. She says grace before dinner and believes in gay adoption. She loves the United States and dreams of a United States of Europe someday.
Some feminists are annoyed by her piety. Most conservatives are annoyed by her feminism.
"That woman," they sigh.
That woman is Ursula von der Leyen, Germany's defense minister and a longtime ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who this week was unexpectedly nominated as the next president of the European Commission, the European Union's powerful executive body.
If confirmed by the European Parliament later this month, she will be the first woman to hold the top job in the 28-nation bloc. For now, the outcome of that vote has been clouded by more than the usual grumblings about the lack of transparency in the bargaining that produced her nomination.
In the juggernaut of horse trading over the European Union's top jobs, Ms. von der Leyen emerged as the surprise winner from days of back-room haggling, a qualified but compromise candidate to break what threatened to become an insurmountable deadlock.
Her selection has met intense criticism at home, where, having served 14 years alongside Ms. Merkel, and more than five in Germany's unloved ministry of defense, Ms. von der Leyen was not particularly popular.
Nevertheless, almost everyone agrees on one thing.
"Her European credentials are rock-solid," said Nathalie Tocci, special adviser to Federica Mogherini, the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs, and the director of the Rome-based International Affairs Institute.
Five-foot-three, the daughter of a German politician who worked in the European institutions at the founding stage, Ms. von der Leyen, 60, was born in Brussels and grew up speaking French and English.
It was in school that she said she developed "a lifelong internal love for the phenomenon that is Europe."
At the height of Europe's debt crisis, Ms. von der Leyen argued in favor of closer political union, even as many in her country shrunk back from the idea of a greater federalization of debt.
Later, as defense minister, she urged for an ambitious integration of national defense structures and ultimately a "European Army," which remains a distant dream.
"My aim is a United States of Europe -- along the lines of the federal states of Switzerland, Germany or the U.S.A.," she told the German magazine Der Spiegel in 2011.
In 2016, she repeated this vision in another interview: "I imagine the Europe of my children or grandchildren not as a loose union of states trapped by national interests."
By putting her name forward, Europe's heads of state have sent a clear signal, said Guntram Wolff of Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank. "The message is: We don't want to appease the populists," he said. "We don't want a half-hearted Europe; we want a courageous Europe."
But others warn that the rise of nationalism threatens European cohesion and has made the prospect of surrendering sovereignty on sensitive issues like taxation and national security even harder. People are fearful of losing their national identities and European integration needs to be mindful of that.
Ms. von der Leyen, who once hosted a Syrian refugee in her home, acknowledges this.
"You can't win against nationalism with internationalism," she told The New York Times in January. "You need the nation, too."
At a time when concerns about social injustice and fears of migration have fueled populist and nationalist movements across Europe, Ms. von der Leyen brings an intriguing mix of conservative and liberal values to the table.
Her supporters say she was a transformative family minister who gave paid parental leave to German men and lobbied hard for boardroom quotas.
Later, as defense minister, they note, she fought hard for military budget increases and ultimately oversaw an expanding role for German troops, from Mali to Lithuania.
Her critics fault her for failing to sufficiently modernize Germany's military. They also point to a parliamentary commission that is currently investigating procurement practices in her ministry. She herself may have to testify later this year.
But as Ulrike Franke, a defense expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, explained, Ms. von der Leyen "came into a difficult job in a difficult ministry at a difficult time." She added, "That the budget didn't increase quite as much as she was hoping for, and as many external voices demanded, was largely outside her control."
Despite her detractors, Ms. von der Leyen commands a striking level of support from very different quarters, even in a fragmenting Europe.
Her outspoken European idealism seems to align less with her own more careful chancellor than with President Emmanuel Macron of France, who has grown increasingly frustrated with Berlin's reluctance to help him fulfill his vision of deeper European integration.
In fact, Ms. Merkel has made it no secret that the nomination was not her idea, while Mr. Macron, who put forward Ms. Von der Leyen's name, was visibly delighted.
So, apparently, were Polish nationalists, often fiercely anti-German and euroskeptic, who have come to see her as a staunch ally in the standoff with Russia and respect her traditional family values.
"She is a conservative and she is knowledgeable about national security, which plays well in Eastern Europe," said Ms. Tocci, who has experienced Ms. von der Leyen close-up in countless meetings.
"But she also has a background as social affairs minister, which matters at a time when the European Union needs to find a way to get closer to its citizens," Ms. Tocci added.
Ms. von der Leyen was a minister in Lower Saxony when Ms. Merkel brought her to Berlin in 2005. She quickly became a national star, overtaking many in her party who had served years in hopes of a similar career vault.
Her name was once floated as a possible federal president or even a successor of Ms. Merkel herself. But her appeal has waned over time, at least in Germany, where an opinion poll by public broadcaster ARD found that 56 percent of respondents did not think she was a good choice for the job of Europe's top bureaucrat.
"If you're a woman and you trying to get things done, you're going to make enemies," Ms. Tocci said.
Indeed, Ms. von der Leyen is no stranger to sharp and sometimes very personal criticism. Some of Ms. von der Leyen's most vocal critics have been men who have been less successful than her.
"Von der Leyen is our weakest minister. That's apparently enough to become Commission president," huffed Martin Schulz, a former president of the European Parliament who led Germany's Social Democrats to a humiliating defeat in 2017.
She has had to justify herself endlessly about combining a high-powered career with being the mother of seven children.
"Why did she have seven children when she is never home?" Doris Schröder-Köpf, ex-wife of the former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, mused in 2006.
Ms. von der Leyen has spoken about the challenges faced by liberal democracy, a key pillar of the European project.
"Perhaps we as democrats have believed for too long that democracy is so powerful, so convincing, so brilliant that its victory march cannot be stopped," she told Der Spiegel in 2016. "Democracy can go to the dogs if we don't care for it."
She may now be the one defending Europe's interests before President Trump, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and China's President Xi Jinping.
She has made some tough noises on all three fronts already.
"America is not its presidents," she said about trans-Atlantic relations, scarcely hiding her dislike of Mr. Trump, while speaking about the growing "alienation" with Mr. Putin and warning against being naïve about China's rise and intentions.
Europe, she told The New York Times aboard her ministry's plane in January, has had a series of wake up calls. Now it needs to act.
"Our crisis was in 2016 right after the Brexit referendum and when President Trump was elected and said NATO is obsolete," she said.
"This was the point when Europe understood that it has to be able to tackle its own problems, problems that are all around us, and to work on a Europe that protects, a Europe that defends, a Europe that is able to act. That's what is essential."
If Ursula von der Leyen is confirmed by the European Parliament, she would be first woman to hold the top job in the 28-nation bloc.

Texto completo: An Italian airline has apologized and removed an ad that used an actor wearing blackface to represent former President Barack Obama.
Alitalia's promotional video, which was meant to advertise its new Rome-to-Washington D.C. flight, depicted Presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Obama, and Donald Trump.TweetThe ad sparked backlash on social media for using an actor in blackface for Obama, but an airline representative initially defended the ad. They argued that the actor who played Obama was not white and that the makeup "was applied to highlight features," the New York Times reported.
“Alitalia deeply apologizes for the offense caused by the promotional video on our new Washington route. It has since been removed from all of our social media channels," Alitalia said in a statement to Fox News. "For our Company, respect for everyone is mandatory, it was never our intention to hurt anyone and we will learn from what has happened."Story URLPhoto Caption:Former President Barack Obama speaks at the My Brother's Keeper Alliance Summit in Oakland, Calif.

Texto completo: An Italian airline has scuttled its promotional video featuring an actor in blackface as former President Barack Obama and apologized for the offensive clip.
The video, part of Alitalia’s social media campaign for a new Rome-to-Washington route, was met with stunned disbelief when the airline shared it across social channels.
“Alitalia deeply apologizes for the offense,” the airline said in a statement sent to USA TODAY, saying it has since removed the video. The airline also tweeted an apology Wednesday “For our Company, respect for everyone is mandatory, it was never our intention to hurt anyone and we will learn from what has happened. ”
The New York Times reports that an airline representative at first defended the controversial video when negative comments erupted on Facebook, noting that the actor wasn’t white and that “makeup was applied to highlight (his) features. ”
The airline claims the video was removed from social media promptly.
Twitter users were quick to react.
“Words fail me,” wrote Alberto Riva, managing editor of the travel news site The Points Guy.
“Alitalia dropped an ad featuring a white actor in blackface portraying President Obama. In 2019. Read that again,” tweeted activist April Reign, creator of the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag.
Numerous brands have courted controversy in recent months with design choices that customers complained resembled blackface, the racist practice of darkening one’s complexion with makeup.
In February, Gucci discontinued a black turtleneck sweater with a red-rimmed cutout for the mouth, and Katy Perry’s eponymous shoe collection dropped two pairs of black shoes embellished with eyes and exaggerated red lips. Burberry apologized that same month for sending a model down the runway at London Fashion Week in a hoodie featuring a drawstring knotted into a noose.
Last December, Prada stopped selling its Otto charm, a monkey-like figure with red lips.

Texto completo: Looks like former Boston Globe Spotlight reporter Michael Rezendes has really hit the big time: His name appeared as a clue in Tuesday's New York Times crossword puzzle.
The clue for 17 across read “Actor with the same initials as Michael Rezendes, his role in 'Spotlight.' " The answer: Mark Ruffalo .
“As a one-time English major, I have to admit it doesn't get any better," Rezendes said on Twitter.
Ruffalo was nominated for best supporting actor for his portrayal of Rezendes in the 2015 film “Spotlight." The movie won Academy Awards for best original screenplay and best picture.
A graduate of Boston University, Rezendes reported on the Globe's Spotlight Team for more than a decade. His investigative reporting on the Catholic church's cover-up of clergy sex abuse helped earn the Boston Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.
Rezendes's reporting revealed that top Catholic officials had buried the abuses of John Geoghan , a Boston priest who molested more than 100 children. After news of the Boston scandal broke, Rezendes continued to report on similar cover-ups by the church across the country. Although he has since retired from Spotlight, Rezendes continues to report as an Associated Press global investigation correspondent.
On his feature in Tuesday's crossword, Rezendes said: “It was very gratifying to see this high confirmation that the movie 'Spotlight,' Mark Ruffalo and the work of the Spotlight Team have succeeded in getting the issue of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church into the popular culture. Of course, I was also pretty happy to find a clue I could answer so easily."

How to Combat Online 'Fingerprinting'

Texto completo: If there's one lesson to learn about digital privacy, it's that we can never grow complacent. Even if we secure our data so we are not tracked online, the ad tech industry will find ways to monitor our digital activities.
And so it is with the rise of so-called fingerprinting, which security researchers are calling a next-generation tracking technology.
What is it exactly? Fingerprinting involves looking at the many characteristics of your mobile device or computer, like the screen resolution, operating system and model, and triangulating this information to pinpoint and follow you as you browse the web and use apps. Once enough device characteristics are known, the theory goes, the data can be assembled into a profile that helps identify you the way a fingerprint would.
"Get enough of those attributes together and it creates essentially a bar code," said Peter Dolanjski, a product lead for Mozilla's Firefox web browser, who is studying fingerprinting. "That bar code is absolutely uniquely identifiable."
And here's the bad news: The technique happens invisibly in the background in apps and websites. That makes it tougher to detect and combat than its predecessor, the web cookie, which was a tracker stored on our devices. The solutions to blocking fingerprinting are also limited.
Security researchers discovered fingerprinting as a tracking method about seven years ago, but it was rarely discussed until recently. Only about 3.5 percent of the most popular websites use it today for tracking, but that's up from about 1.6 percent in 2016, according to Mozilla. And an unknown number of mobile apps also use fingerprinting.
All of this is not a reason to panic, but it is a reason to be concerned. As fingerprinting becomes more popular, here's what you need to know about it and what we can do.
How did we get here?
Over the last few years, tech companies like Apple and Mozilla introduced aggressive privacy protections inside their web browsers. Tracker blocking is built into the Safari and Firefox browsers to make it harder for advertisers to follow us around the web and serve targeted ads. That thwarted traditional tracking methods like cookies and pixels that were embedded inside social media buttons.
Because many of those technologies became blocked by default, advertisers had to find a different way to track people.
How does fingerprinting work?
Let's get technical for a moment. Fingerprinting takes advantage of a fundamental way that apps and websites talk to our devices.
When you browse the web, your browser automatically gives websites some information about your hardware. That's partly because a website needs to know things like the resolution of your screen so it can load a page in the correct window size.
Similarly, when you install a mobile app, the operating system shares some information about your hardware with the app. That's partly because an app needs to know what type of phone you use so it can adapt to the processor speed and screen size.
There are restrictions to the data that apps and websites can get about your device. On iPhones and Android phones, for example, you must give an app permission to gain access to your location data, your camera and microphone. Similarly, many browsers also require your permission before a website can have access to those sensors.
But fingerprinting collects seemingly innocuous characteristics that are generally shared by default to make apps and websites work properly.
With enough information gathered, fingerprinting can be very reliable. In a study last year in France, researchers found that about one-third of digital fingerprints they collected were unique and therefore identifiable. In a 2017 study, researchers at Lehigh University and Washington University tested a fingerprinting method that identified 99 percent of users.
Privacy advocates say fingerprinting is abusive because in contrast to cookies, which people can see and delete, you generally cannot tell it is happening and cannot opt out of it.
"It's really a black box," said Casey Oppenheim, the chief executive of Disconnect, a company that develops tracker blocking tools.
What can I do?
The solutions for preventing fingerprinting are relatively new, and some are still in development. It is hard to tell how effective they are since fingerprinting happens invisibly. But taking advantage of the solutions will give you peace of mind if you care about privacy.
Here are some solutions for blocking browser fingerprinting.
■ Apple users have protections in Safari for computers and mobile devices.
For those who use iPhones and Macs, Apple introduced a fingerprinting defense mechanism in its Safari browser last year. It basically makes many Macs and iPhones look the same to a website by sharing the bare minimum of information that the site need to load properly. (For example, if you are using MacOS 10.14.5, the browser will tell the website only that you are using MacOS 10.14.)
To take advantage of this defense, just make sure you are running a recent version of the iPhone and Mac operating systems.
■ Android users and Windows users can try the Firefox web browser.
Mozilla introduced fingerprint blocking in its Firefox browser this year, but the feature can prevent content for some websites from loading or a shopping site from processing a payment properly, so it's not turned on by default, the company said.
Mozilla said it was making progress and expected to block fingerprinting by default in a future release. For now, you can enable the feature by opening the browser preferences, clicking on the privacy and security page, selecting "Custom" and checkmarking "fingerprinters."
Google announced this year that it planned to introduce fingerprint defense for its Chrome browser, but it did not specify when the feature would be released.
■ Other desktop browsers can install an add-on.
Disconnect offers a tracker blocker for web browsers that includes fingerprint defense. It's a downloadable add-on that works with Google's Chrome browser, among others. I've used it on my desktop browsers for years, and it works well. But it also has its flaws: Occasionally, the tool breaks shopping sites, and I have to disable Disconnect to do things like add items to my shopping cart.
Mobile fingerprinting is a different beast.
Fingerprinting can be done directly inside apps, without people easily seeing what data an app is gathering in the background or when it runs. One example of this surfaced in 2017 when The New York Times revealed that Uber used a form of fingerprinting inside its iPhone app to identify users even after they erased content from their devices.
Fingerprint defenses in mobile apps are only beginning to emerge. Here's one example:
■ Disconnect offers mobile apps for blocking trackers inside other apps.
For iPhones and Android devices, Privacy Pro and Disconnect Premium can analyze app activities on your device to detect and block trackers, including fingerprinters. Once the Disconnect apps are installed and activated, the tracker blocking happens automatically.
The problem with the Disconnect apps is that it is difficult to decipher which specific apps are doing the fingerprinting so that you can delete them. When I recently opened my Privacy Pro app, it was unable to say which app was doing what because of restrictions in the iPhone's software architecture. Disconnect said it was working on making the app easier to use.
So what's the most practical thing you can do for mobile? Start by deleting apps you rarely use, especially the ones from obscure brands. Free apps are most likely to be loaded with trackers, though some paid ones track you, too.
Fingerprinting is a complex topic since the tracking method applies to both the web and mobile apps. But don't stress if you don't protect yourself right away: Just learning about it now means you are ahead of the curve.

Kardashian West and Japan Reach Détente on Kimono Line

Texto completo: Relations between Kim Kardashian West and the country of Japan eased on Tuesday after Ms. Kardashian West announced that she would change the name of her shapewear line, which she had said last week would be named Kimono.
That announcement of the trademark caused an uproar (kimono being a traditional Japanese garment) and invited pushback from Japanese officials. The mayor of Kyoto sent Ms. Kardashian West a letter to ask her to reconsider the name. Days later, she did.
On Tuesday, Hiroshige Seko, Japan's trade minister, acknowledged Ms. Kardashian West's pledge to revisit the name. Still, he said that he planned to send someone to speak to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and that he would keep an eye on the shapewear situation.
A publicist who reached out on behalf of Kyoto did not yet have any update on whether the mayor's invitation to Ms. Kardashian West to visit his city still stood.
In a Twitter thread announcing that she would change the name, Ms. Kardashian West said that her "brands and products are built with inclusivity and diversity at their core."
The Kardashian family frequently arouses ire over issues of cultural appropriation, most often appropriation of black culture. David Dennis, a writer for the website Bossip, voiced a common criticism of Ms. Kardashian West on Monday in a post about another recent controversy: "A large part of her empire has been finding ways to incorporate blackness into her brand in ways that white women can aspire to attain."
It's a criticism that extends to other members of the family. In 2017, Ms. Kardashian West's sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, released T-shirts that featured their images layered on those of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. (The T-shirts were later pulled from their website.) That year, Pepsi also ceased to run a commercial featuring Kendall Jenner that echoed Black Lives Matter protest symbolism after widespread criticism and mockery greeted its premiere.
The sisters have been accused of appropriating braided hairstyles and darkening their skin in order to appear black. In an interview with The New York Times in 2017, Ms. Kardashian West responded to one of those instances, explaining that "I was really tan." Sometimes, they just ignore criticism, as Khloé Kardashian did after she asked for recommendations for a "sweet biracial baby doll" for her daughter. (Her audience suggested that the word she was looking for was "black.")
Some of the outrage might be beneficial to the family. The engine of the Kardashian empire is attention, and even negative attention increases their brand recognition.
Meredith Clark, a professor at the University of Virginia's department of media studies, said that the family had mastered exploiting the attention economy "and specifically exploiting the online outpour of outrage when they do something that draws attention."
So are the Kardashians too big to cancel? Ms. Clark said that, given that canceling is a personal act on the part of the consumer, no one was really too big to cancel.
But when cancellation means a product getting knocked out of the market, "I do think they're too big to fail," she said. "Because even in failing, even in garnering this outrage, they still manage to profit."
The Kimono uproar was perhaps the first time the Kardashians have managed to exasperate a nation. It occurs at a time when Japan's officials have become more responsive to conversation on social media, as the Japanese government is championing both its cultural heritage and the international recognition of that heritage.
Mr. Seko, the trade minister, is not quite as gregarious on social media as the country's foreign minister, Taro Kono, who has a separate English-language Twitter, but he tends to tweet frequently. While addressing the Kardashian controversy, Mr. Seko was also tweeting about the Group of 20 summit meeting in Japan, conducting a slightly different type of diplomacy.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — If California Sen. Kamala Harris is elected president in 2020 and reelected in 2024, by the time she leaves office 114 months from now she might have a coherent answer to the question of whether Americans should be forbidden to have what 217 million of them currently have: private health insurance. Her 22 weeks of contradictory statements, and her Trumpian meretriciousness about her contradictions, reveal a frivolity about upending health care's complex 18% of America's economy. And her bumblings illustrate how many of the Democratic presidential aspirants, snug in their intellectual silos, have lost — if they ever had — an aptitude for talking like, and to, normal Americans.
Seven days after announcing her candidacy in January, Harris, appearing on CNN, endorsed "Medicare for All" and was asked: So, people "who like their (private) insurance, they don't get to keep it?" She answered: "The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. ... Let's eliminate all of that." More government, less paperwork. Really.
She subsequently, as The New York Times — not an unsympathetic auditor of her campaign — says, "waffled" regarding private insurance. But at the second Miami debate she raised her hand ("just as quickly as Mr. Sanders," the Times reported) when a moderator asked: "Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private insurance in favor of a government-run plan?" Harris also raised her hand just as quickly as Sen. Elizabeth Warren had done the night before, who exclaimed "I'm with Bernie." Sen. Bernie Sanders is the purest advocate of a government-only health care system.
The next morning on MSNBC, Harris said "No, I do not" support ending private health insurance, claiming that she heard the pronoun "their" in the debate moderator's question (see the paragraph above) as an ungrammatical reference to each individual candidate. This alibi might be less implausible if she had not recently said, in a detailed response to a Times inquiry about her health insurance policy, that she favored abolishing private insurance.
One cannot unring a bell and Harris cannot erase the fact that she has repeatedly said she wants to take from 217 million Americans — 80 million more than voted in 2016 — something most of them like. And she is striking at a core function of organized labor, which is to negotiate employer-provided health care as untaxed compensation.
Equally maladroit was her debate decision to wrap herself in an unpopular policy that ended 20 years ago. Nothing did more to fuel the conservative ascendancy in the 1980s than the 1970s enthusiasm of some judges and politicians for the compulsory busing of (other people's) children away from their neighborhood schools, assigning children to schools on the basis of skin color in order to engineer a desired racial balance. In a 1973 Gallup poll, just 4% of whites and 9% of blacks chose busing from among a variety of means of achieving integration.
Yet Harris chose this issue as a cudgel with which to bludgeon Joe Biden. He, evidently lacking the courage of what once supposedly were his convictions, had neither the gumption nor the mental nimbleness to ask her whether, as president, she would favor reviving the compulsory busing of children away from homes that many parents, black and white, purchased because of their proximity to desirable neighborhood schools. Biden is becoming a conviction contortionist, as with his retreat from 40 years of support for the Hyde Amendment. Suddenly he favors federal funding of abortions — forcing many taxpayers to be complicit in a practice they abhor.
Many Democrats striving to replace Donald Trump are, while execrating him, paying him the sincerest form of flattery: imitation. He prepared to campaign for president by calling America a "hellhole" and he began his presidency with an inaugural address that his would-be replacements are mimicking with their versions of his trope about "American carnage."
The day the Supreme Court held that "partisan gerrymandering" is not a justiciable issue, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, yet another presidential candidate, tweeted: "Make no mistake: the partisan gerrymandering SCOTUS just allowed is also racial gerrymandering — modern-day Jim Crow. Just look at what happened with Stacey Abrams last cycle in Georgia." Abrams lost a gubernatorial race. How can a statewide race be gerrymandered? How can presidential candidates be so silly?

Texto completo: Along with parades, fireworks and family gatherings, the celebration of our nation’s founding is also a time to reflect on the blessings of freedom and our nation’s founding principles. Might such patriotic sentiments bring together Republicans and Democrats in a show of unity? Nah. Not a chance.
The first Democratic presidential debates revealed a Democratic Party lurching far to the left, while President Trump engages in bombast, taunts and insults. What impact does this dysfunctional national political climate have on Utah politics?
Pignanelli: "Right now we’ve got two parties trying to make political moderates homeless.”— David Brooks, The New York Times
American politics today is a massive version of reality TV with performances every day on television and social media. Issues are overdramatized, while the players are hypersensitive. As with any entertainment, extremists grab most of the attention while driving programming content. Saying outrageous things while being outraged is the norm. There is no better example than the last two weeks’ statements made from the debate podium, the president, Congress, Twitter, Facebook and cable news. (Things are so weird, the Betsy Ross flag is now controversial.)
Thankfully, Utahns prefer a more genteel version of politics. But the effects of the national circus are everywhere and cannot be ignored or misunderstood. Local Republicans and Democrats will soon need to distinguish themselves from crazy partisans in Washington, D.C., or otherwise be caught in the net of disgust by their voters. Angering the extremes may cause short-term pain, but history demonstrates such is beneficial strategy in the long run.
Reality TV is not reality. Similarly, the political antics do not mirror how most Americans, especially Utahns, interact or express themselves. So, enjoy or change the channel.
Webb: Unlike what happens at the national level, in Utah we actually deal with disagreements on controversial issues pretty well. It is possible to disagree, and do so in a reasonably civil manner.
National politicians could learn from Utah, but they won’t. And, certainly, the toxic partisanship on national issues and national leaders rubs off on Utahns, as evidenced by the nasty stuff we see on social media and in letters to the editor.
Emotions run high because both sides believe the future of the country is at stake. Many Republicans, myself included, are scornful of the liberal, socialist positions of the Democratic presidential candidates. And we aren’t shy about expressing those feelings.
Likewise, many Democrats literally hate President Donald Trump, believing he is a liar, racist, rapist, bigot and is rapidly destroying the country. Civility and compromise are hard to find amid such strong sentiments.
But on specific issues, such as immigration, liberals ought to put aside their hatred of Trump, and conservatives ought to put aside their disdain of socialism, to compromise on commonsense solutions. It wouldn’t be very difficult if both sides would focus on solutions instead of emotions.
In other words, go ahead and hate Trump. But solve immigration. Go ahead and reject socialistic schemes. But solve immigration.
Seldom has the partisan divide been worse. National Republicans and Democrats appear to be on totally different political planets. Is the country being damaged by such discord and acrimony?
Pignanelli: Actually, more discord and acrimony are needed. Rational moderates must stop the extreme left and right wings from hogging the agenda. Americans who achieved influence have an obligation to publicly defend our system against anti-capitalist nonsense and discriminatory statements destructive to our social fabric.
Our economy is sound. Most disease results from an abundance of food. Important efforts to take advantage of technology, improve job creation, enhance entrepreneurial opportunities, advance health care and confront climate change are evolving. Americans are doing what we do best — screaming and shouting while getting the job done.
Webb: The anger and hatred mean some of the country’s biggest problems are used for talking points instead of being solved. Until politicians are willing to settle for partial wins, each side getting some of what it wants, gridlock and dysfunction will continue.
Do any solutions exist to restore compromise and political progress, or are we doomed to ever-escalating partisan rancor?
Pignanelli: Our nation was founded by argument and we never stopped. Much of the rancor is a sign of a healthy, invigorated democracy, engaged by people informed through technology. History documents issues that deeply divided our country — including many no longer remembered (i.e. free silver) and those which haunt us (slavery) — did not and will not prevent us from facing significant challenges together.
Webb: A major reason for failure at the national level is that the federal government is too big, too expensive, and inserts itself into every facet of life. The country is too large and diverse for one-size-fits-all solutions dictated by Washington.
State and local levels of government, for the most part, are productive and solve problems. If the federal government would stick to its constitutional responsibilities, and leave the rest to the states, the country would be in better shape.
Battles would continue over federal responsibilities like immigration and foreign affairs. But myriad other issues would be resolved, with a lot of diversity and innovation, at state and local levels.

A MORAL BLIND SPOT U.S. POLITICIANS WON'T TALK ABOUT CHINESE AUTHORITARIANISM

Texto completo: Given the recent fight over whether U.S. refugee detention centers are in fact "concentration camps," the Trump administration might want to borrow a page from the Chinese and simply call them "vocational skills education training centers." That way, no one would really care at all.
That's what the Chinese call their gulag archipelago of internment and re-education camps in Xinjiang province, where an estimated 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Turkic people are being held. The Uighurs are a traditionally Muslim minority, and Beijing says they pose a major threat because of Islamic terrorism. The reality is that the Chinese fear separatist movements, Islamic or otherwise, in a resource-rich region three times the size of France.
As a result, the Chinese are pursuing the largest attempt at cultural annihilation of the 21st century. Religion is heavily regulated throughout China, but it is brutally policed in Xinjiang. Ancient cemeteries are being erased, turned into parking lots. In the southern city of Kashgar, once a jewel of the Silk Road - and closer to Baghdad than to Beijing - morning calls to prayer have been silenced.
The evil deeds in Xinjiang are merely the most egregious examples of what The Economist has called "apartheid with Chinese characteristics."
What is both intriguing and infuriating to me is that American politicians refuse to talk about any of this. After all, we are in the midst of a trade war with China. Whatever the merits of this economic confrontation may or may not be, you would think the nature of the Chinese regime itself would play a larger part in debate.
The nature of the South African regime was the entire reason for the sanctions and boycotts pushed by progressives and Democrats in the 1980s. The nature of the Soviet Union was the rhetorical centerpiece of the economic warfare pushed by Republicans during the Cold War.
But among both Democrats and Republicans, Chinese authoritarianism often goes unmentioned. Countless conservatives, particularly of the new nationalist bent, want to take a hard line with China because they make widgets at a lower price than us. The fact that the Chinese government has put a million Muslims in re-education camps and persecuted Christians, too, is rarely part of the conversation.
Rhetorically, President Donald Trump has been far harsher on Canada and Mexico than he has been on China.
One needn't be blindly moralistic about all of this. China is big, powerful and dangerous. But so was the Soviet Union, and we still managed to tell the truth about it.
The ongoing confrontation with China highlights the moral blind spot of economic nationalism - on the right and the left. The new fad of nationalism on the right has brought many conservatives into agreement with the left on non-interventionism and realism. The Trump administration, as well as Democratic supporters of a tough trade policy with China, have made it clear that all we expect of Beijing is more cooperation on trade, intellectual property and currency policies. Fix that stuff, our messaging signals, and everything you do to your own people is your business.
Mr. Trump's speech in Normandy last month was rightly hailed as one of his best. It was particularly popular among the nationalists because World War II understandably looms large in the romance about American moral and military might. Mr. Trump hailed the veterans of D-Day who "threw open the gates of Nazi concentration camps to liberate Jews." Meanwhile, today's nationalists are silent about a China that rounds up internal enemies and puts them in concentration camps.

Brenda Maddox, 87; told the stories of unsung influential women

Texto completo: Brenda Maddox may have been best known for her biography of Nora Barnacle, who inspired some of Irish literature's most memorable characters, but she crafted what may have been her most resonant line while writing about a DNA researcher history nearly forgot.
“Rosalind Franklin has become a feminist icon, the Sylvia Plath of molecular biology, the woman whose gifts were sacrificed to the greater glory of the male," Ms. Maddox wrote in “Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA," her 2002 book about the British scientist whose key early research was mostly overlooked amid the accolades heaped on James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick.
Bringing her background as a reporter to the longer form of biographies, Ms. Maddox illuminated the lives of literary greats such as George Eliot, D.H. Lawrence, and W.B. Yeats. And with 1988's “Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom," she brought full recognition to Barnacle, who would marry James Joyce and inspire some of his fictional characters, including Gretta in “The Dead" and Molly Bloom in “Ulysses."
Ms. Maddox, who spent her childhood and youth in Bridgewater and Brockton, and who began her writing career in Greater Boston, was 87 when she died June 16 in her London home. Her family told news organizations the cause was complications of dementia.
“I honestly consider myself a journalist," she told the Globe in 1988 during interviews for the publication of “Nora." “I am not a feminist crusader. This book brings out the qualities of a woman who has been hidden."
Reviewing “Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom" that year, Globe critic Robert Taylor wrote that Ms. Maddox's “illuminating book scotches, once and for all, the notion of Nora Barnacle as a primitive lass from the west of Ireland whom the author of 'Ulysses' and 'Finnegans Wake' married because she let him get on with his writing."
In the Globe interview, Ms. Maddox recalled that she had begun the biography a few years earlier “liking Nora. I finished in awe of her." Nora, she added, lived through tumultuous decades whose events included “the emancipation of women" and two world wars.
“With her strength, wit and calm, she survived them all, just as she survived 37 years with James Joyce and taught him what life was all about," Ms. Maddox said.
Meanwhile, Ms. Maddox's book about Rosalind Franklin taught scholars, scientists, and science fans alike about someone who had made essential contributions to science.
A year ago, New York Times science columnist Carl Zimmer cited “Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA" as the book he wished more people would read.
“The story of the discovery of the structure of DNA has been told over and over again from James Watson's perspective," Zimmer said in an interview with the Globe. “Rosalind Franklin's story is also important, and Maddox tells it wonderfully well."
Born in 1932, Brenda Murphy was the only child of Dr. Brendan Murphy and Edith Giamperoli. A few weeks after Brenda turned 3, her physician father died. She was raised by her mother, who gave square-dancing lessons, even though she used a wheelchair due to complications from polio.
After graduating from Radcliffe College, Ms. Maddox began her writing career as a reporter for The Patriot Ledger in Quincy. Moving to England, she attended the London School of Economics. “I hated it," she later told the Globe. “I didn't last the year."
Instead, Ms. Maddox recalled, she wrote briefly for the Reuters news service.
While covering a UN conference in Geneva, she met John Maddox, a science writer and editor for the Guardian newspaper and later the editor of Nature magazine. They married in 1960.
Early in their marriage, she wrote for the Economist magazine, where she subsequently was an editor, and occasionally wrote for the Globe about a variety of subjects, including traveling with children. Perhaps inspired by her own experiences, she praised the un-France-like informality at mealtime for tourists in Brittany, where the Bretons allowed children to “wander in and out between courses and wear their pajamas to supper."
She would later write that as a journalist for the Economist, she watched “with fascination the long-running Irish debate on contraception, abortion, divorce, and illegitimacy. Whatever problems women have, Irish women have them worse. I began to see Nora Barnacle as typical of a certain kind of Irish girl — desperate to escape from her circumstances, unequipped with anything but strength of character and charm."
Along with the Nora Barnacle biography, Ms. Maddox wrote books about literary figures that included “D.H. Lawrence: The Story of a Marriage" (1994), “George's Ghosts: A New Life of W.B. Yeats" (1999); and “George Eliot: Novelist, Lover, Wife" (2009).
In her book “The Half Parent: Living with Other People's Children" (1975), she drew from her experience as a stepmother to John Maddox's children and spoke of their good fortune in marrying.
“My husband and I could not have been better suited, although we had grown up thousands of miles apart," she wrote about Maddox, who died in 2009. “We were good at school, loners, readers, escapers from poor, ambitious families and from claustrophobic small towns that had given us an incurable preference for city life. After time spent in academia, his much longer than mine, we had discovered the guilty delights of journalism. We might have been matched by computer."
According to The Washington Post, Ms. Maddox's survivors include a daughter, Bronwen of London; a son, Bruno of Beacon, N.Y.; two stepchildren, Imma and Piers, both of England; and three granddaughters.
When Ms. Maddox was a college student, a seminar at Harvard University in Anglo-Irish literature, led by the scholar and professor John V. Kelleher, had sparked her interest in Nora Barnacle. Kelleher noted that the Joyces had spoken Italian at home.
“My own grandparents were immigrants to America from Ireland and Italy, and I had heard Italian spoken in my home," Ms. Maddox would later tell the Globe. “I was intrigued by this Irish family who had gone east, not west."
Years later, her interest was rekindled when, as a present, her husband gave her Richard Ellmann's acclaimed biography of James Joyce.
“In reading the biography," she recalled, “I wondered: What about Nora? Joyce was a genius. How did Nora take herself from being a chambermaid in Dublin to becoming a hostess in Paris?"
Ms. Maddox added that several years after James Joyce died, Nora was bringing a journalist to visit his grave and commented during a cab ride: “I often think he must like the cemetery he is in. It is near the zoo and you can hear the lions roar."
That anecdote would prompt Ms. Maddox to write about how essential an inspiration Nora must have provided for her husband, including for a memorable passage in his story “The Dead":
“The woman whose memory of a dead lover in a lonely graveyard led to one of the most beautiful passages in English literature casually conjured up for a total stranger a vision of her husband lying in his grave, enjoying the sound of lions, perhaps chuckling to himself. It suggests that Nora herself may have evoked for Joyce the final scene in 'The Dead,' the snow falling on the grave of Michael Furey."

Texto completo: The jury assigned to the case of accused Special Warfare Chief Edward Gallagher has found the decorated Navy SEAL not guilty of murder and attempted murder after a whirlwind trial that included bombshell revelations and twists.
Navy SEALThe verdict was reached by the five Marines and two sailors Tuesday after the prosecution and defense made their closing arguments the day before. The jury did find Gallagher guilty of unlawfully taking a picture with the corpse of the teenage ISIS fighter he was accused of killing.
"Our stance from the very beginning of this has been that Eddie needs to have a fair trial and we're going to stand behind him no matter what because he's our brother. And the courts have prevailed," Brad Bailey, president of the Navy SEALs Fund, told the Washington Examiner. "We understand that it's a very contentious accusation and one that deeply divided our community. And I hope that everyone can learn a lot from this on both sides and we can get back to taking care of business."
Gallagher, 40, was accused of stabbing an injured teenage ISIS fighter to death and shooting at civilians during a deployment to Iraq in 2017. Seven members of Gallagher's own platoon leveled the accusations against him, describing their chief as a reckless murderer who failed to distinguish between civilians and the enemy.
The accusers communicated through a WhatsApp group called "The Sewing Circle," a seemingly innocuous name for a group dedicated to discussing the alleged war crimes of a decorated sniper and medic. Those discussions would be the basis on which Navy prosecutors would bring charges against Gallagher.
The case received national attention after a searing New York Times report detailed the gory accusations, including stabbing an injured teenage ISIS fighter and shooting an elderly man and a young girl. The report claimed the accusers were told to keep quiet about Gallagher's actions or risk losing their tridents, the coveted badge identifying a sailor as a Navy SEAL.
Gallagher's case drew further attention in May when it was reported that he was one of several accused troops being considered for pardons from President Trump. The news sharply divided the military community and even the Navy SEALs themselves. The SEAL community is known for being especially close-knit, but the Gallagher case created a clear division between old-school defenders and younger skeptics.
"When I heard about it first, I said, 'That's impossible, it's outright stupid. It's going to go away.' Well, it didn't," Thomas "Drago" Dzieran, a former Navy SEAL, told the Washington Examiner in May.
"I said I cannot sit on the sidelines, I need to take [a stand] and bring it up. What they do is not right."
Retired Adm. William McRaven, a legend within the SEAL community who helped plan the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, weighed in, saying he was concerned Trump's potential pardon may have exercised undue command influence over the trial's proceedings.
Gallagher's case took a dramatic turn before the trial even started when it was revealed in May that prosecutors had embedded email tracking software in their correspondence with Gallagher's defense team. The revelation outraged lead defense attorney Timothy Parlatore, who told the Washington Examiner he would be filing an ethics complaint against lead Navy prosecutor Cmdr. Chris Czaplak. Navy Capt. Aaron Rugh, the judge overseeing the case, dismissed Czaplak over the revelations and released Gallagher from pre-trial custody. He also lowered Gallagher's maximum possible sentence to life with the possibility of parole. He denied motions to dismiss the trial.
The trial started on June 17, with the prosecution presenting two witnesses who said they had seen Gallagher stab the injured teenager. Prosecutors showed the court pictures Gallagher had taken with the teen's corpse. They said the chief bragged about the kill to fellow SEALs back home in text messages.
"Good story behind this. Got him with my hunting knife," read one text Gallagher sent.
The testimony against Gallagher appeared damning, but the case took an unexpected turn when Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Corey Scott declared it was he, not Gallagher, who was responsible for the death of the injured teenage fighter. Scott admitted to seeing Gallagher stab the teen but said he himself asphyxiated the fighter in an effort to save him from Iraqi captors, who he had seen torture, rape, and kill other prisoners.
"I knew he was going to die anyway," said Scott, a trained combat medic. "I wanted to save him from waking up to what had happened next."
The shocking revelation caused a flustered Navy prosecutor to call Scott a liar. Navy officials later informed Scott through his lawyer that he may face perjury charges if he lied to investigators or during his testimony.
Gallagher's defense team presented two witnesses, Marine Staff Sgt. Giorgio Kirylo and Iraqi Maj. Gen. Abbas al-Jubouri, who denied seeing Gallagher stab the teenager at all. Gallagher's spotter, Special Operator 1st Class Joshua Graffam, testified that he and Gallagher both believed the elderly man Gallagher shot was actually an ISIS operative between the ages of 40 and 50.
Parlatore and lead prosecutor Cmdr. Jeff Pietrzyk summed up the testimony in their closing arguments Monday.
Pietrzyk admitted that before being injured, the fighter "would have done anything in his power to kill an American." But he noted that after his capture, the teen was no longer a lawful target.
"We're not ISIS. When we capture someone and they're out of the fight, that's it. That's where the line is drawn," Pietrzyk said.
Parlatore reiterated his claim that the SEALs who made accusations against Gallagher were nothing more than disgruntled subordinates upset with Gallagher's tough leadership style.
"This case is not about murder, it's about mutiny," Parlatore said.
With a verdict of not guilty, Gallagher will not need a pardon from Trump for the charges of murder and attempted murder. The conviction for posing with the corpse reportedly carries a maximum sentence of four months, and Gallagher served nine months in detention before the trial.
With Gallagher's trial concluded, attention will likely turn to the case of Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, who pleaded not guilty last week to a charge of premeditated murder for the killing of a suspected Taliban bomb-maker.Story URLPhoto Caption:Navy Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher is shown.

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris of California attacked Joe Biden for his position on busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s.
In the second democratic debate in Miami, Harris said that Biden worked with segregationist senators to oppose busing.
Harris asked Biden: “do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?”
Biden responded: “No. … I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That’s what I opposed.”
We found that Biden tried to oversimplify his complicated record on busing. He glossed over the fact that he regularly opposed busing, even though he supported other civil rights measures such as the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act.
Biden’s record on busing
Biden won his Senate seat in 1972 on a platform of integration, but once in office, he faced white constituents who hated the idea of busing. A federal court order in 1974 to integrate Wilmington schools brought the issue home for Biden. In the Senate, Biden began supporting much of the anti-busing legislation.
University of New Hampshire historian Jason Sokol, who tracked Biden’s response to local opposition, has told us the amendments that Biden supported “paint a somewhat muddled picture.” Biden proposed some amendments that would have hamstrung desegregation while at other times he backed off.
Sokol told us after the debate that Biden’s position on busing evolved but by the late 1970s he was decidedly against busing.
Biden’s claim that he was for integration but against busing doesn’t make a lot of sense, he told PolitiFact. “By that point in history, there were very few school districts voluntarily integrating by other means, which is why judges were ordering busing. He is using disingenuous logic,” he said.
The Biden campaign pointed to exceptions, including in 1974 when he voted to table an anti-busing amendment sponsored by Sen. Edward Gurney, R-Fla.
The amendment to an education bill was tabled by a single vote on May 15, 1974. The New York Times called the vote a victory for liberals.
In 1975, Biden supported an amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, a North Carolina conservative who opposed civil rights, while stating he didn’t share all the views of those who opposed busing.
The amendment was intended to prevent the federal government from collecting any data about the race of students or teachers in an effort to protect districts that refused to integrate.
“I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept that, in fact, does not bear any of the fruit for which it was designed,” Biden said.
Biden urged his colleagues to reject busing and focus on access to housing, employment, credit, and voting rights. When the Helms amendment defeated, Biden proposed an amendment to prohibit the use of federal funds to assign teachers or students to schools based on race.
Biden said that his amendment would not preclude court-ordered busing. The Senate affirmed Biden’s amendment by a vote of 50–43.
Biden then introduced another amendment that narrowly targeted busing — rather than roundly forbidding all desegregation remedies. This amendment passed, too. The Senate passed the education bill with Biden’s anti-busing amendments, but after the House-Senate conference they were dropped from the final bill.
In his book “Promises to Keep,” Biden recounted facing a group of constituents who were angry about busing during the 1978 election.
“Look, I told them, I was against busing to remedy de facto segregation owing to housing patterns and community comfort,” he said, recounting what he told people in a high school gym in Wilmington. “But if it was intentional segregation, I’d personally pay for helicopters to move the children.”
Our ruling
Biden said “I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education.”
Biden qualified his opposition to busing by saying opposing the federal government forcing busing on communities. But the record shows Biden opposed busing, as shown through his positions on legislation, and statements multiple times starting the mid 1970s. We’ll note that while Biden opposed busing in the face of protests from his constituents, he nevertheless supported many other aspects desegregation and civil rights.
We rate Biden’s statement Mostly False.

Buttigieg raises $24.8M in 3 months

Texto completo: Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg announced Monday he raised more than $24.8 million from more than 294,000 donors in the second quarter.
That dwarfs his $7 million haul in the first quarter, qualifies him for the next round of Democratic debates and is sure to attract further notice from rival campaigns as a candidate with whom to be reckoned.
According to his campaign, Buttigieg still has $22.6 million cash on hand, in other words, money to spend. The average contribution size, the campaign said, was $47.42, and included donors from all U.S. states and territories.
The reporting period ended Sunday, but the reports aren't due to the Federal Election Commission until July 15. Buttigieg is the first 2020 primary candidate to release his totals, the New York Times reports.
His first-quarter total of $7 million ranked fourth among Democrats, behind $18.2 million for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, $12 million for California Sen. Kamala Harris and $9.4 million for former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas. Former Vice President Joe Biden had not yet entered the race by the end of the first quarter.
Buttigieg's total number of individual donors, including both quarters, is 400,000, according to his campaign, which puts him far ahead of the 130,000 needed to qualify for the next round of debates, in September.
The Democratic National Committee also is requiring candidates to hit at least 2% in the polls in the early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, a threshold Buttigieg also appears to meet.
The Associated Press reports that, along with Buttigieg, the only other candidates certain to qualify at this point for the September debates are Biden, Sanders, Warren and Harris, though that could change as more fundraising numbers are released.
The latest national Morning Consult poll, taken Thursday and Friday, had Buttigieg ranked fifth in the primary field at 6%. Biden was first, at 33%, followed by Sanders at 19%, with Harris and Warren tied at 12%.
The poll was taken after the opening Democratic debate Thursday, but concluded before the second debate, on Friday, in which Buttigieg participated.
In a CNN poll released late Monday — conducted Friday through Sunday, after both debates concluded — found Biden at 22%, Harris at 17%, Warren at 15% and Sanders at 14%. After a steep decline, Buttigieg was next at 4%.

Texto completo: LONDON -- For the past six months, a drama has been playing out in London's West End with all the heightened emotions of a musical.
In January, Cameron Mackintosh, the theater producer, announced that "Les Misérables," which has been running in the West End since December 1985 -- and holds the Guinness World Record for the longest run of a musical in London -- would close. The final performance will be July 13, and then the Queen's Theater, its venue, will be shuttered for refurbishment.
The musical, set in revolutionary France, would reopen in December after a series of concert performances, Mr. Mackintosh added. But it would no longer be the well-loved original production featuring a revolving stage that spins as the actors sing, giving endless movement to the production and transporting viewers from the French countryside to the sewers of Paris in an instant.
Instead, the Queen's Theater will now show the same stripped-down version that has toured worldwide since 2009. Directed by Laurence Connor and James Powell, this drops the revolving stage and instead uses projections to make the production's many scene changes. This new version has "nothing spinning around, except maybe the drunken revelers at the tavern," wrote Charles Isherwood in a review for The New York Times when the show appeared on Broadway in 2014.
The announcement of the revolving stage's demise didn't sit well with some of the musical's legions of fans. "The 'new' version does not have the power or magic that has kept audiences coming back for over 30 years," said an online petition which called for the original to be maintained. More than 3,200 people have signed it.
"You can't have the revolution without the revolve!" wrote one of the signatories.
The fans weren't the only ones annoyed by the decision. In February, Trevor Nunn, who adapted and directed the original "Les Misérables" with John Caird, was asked what he thought of the change: "'Don't go there,' is all I can say," he told The Stage, a British theater newspaper.
Mr. Nunn, who turned down an interview request for this article, was more vocal in 2010, not long after the touring production was first revealed. "The most bewildering thing -- and this is not vanity or hubris -- is why something inferior has been created when something superior could have been," he told The Daily Telegraph newspaper.
John Napier, the musical's original designer, who also designed the original sets for "Cats" and "Starlight Express," said in a telephone interview that he was contacted about the touring production, "but only to be told I wasn't required." He was offered a buyout of his intellectual property, he added, but refused.
He had no problem with musicals being remade, he said. "Shakespeare is reinvented all the time, and people do amazing things with it," he said, "but if you're going to reinvent it, reinvent it. Really have a go at things." The production was "a half-take," he added. "It hasn't let go of the original."
Mr. Napier said he could only guess at the reasons the change was being made, financial or artistic. "I've never had an explanation," he said.
Mr. Mackintosh said in an emailed statement that the decision to change the production was a "logical" one given the theater's refurbishment. "Outside of London, this version is the only one that has played for the last 10 years," he added.
In January, The Stage reported that negotiations were underway between Mr. Mackintosh's company and the Royal Shakespeare Company, which co-produced the original, over how royalties from the new production should be shared.
Mr. Mackintosh's spokesman would not provide details of the royalty splits for the original and new productions. The R.S.C. said in an emailed statement that negotiations were ongoing. "We will be sad to see the groundbreaking original production leave the West End," the statement added.
To some, it may be surprising that the original "Les Misérables" lasted 33 days, let alone years. It debuted at the Barbican in London in 1985 to sneering reviews, many of which compared it disparagingly to Victor Hugo's novel. The musical "stands in the same relation to the original as a singing telegram to an epic," wrote Francis King in The Sunday Telegraph, adding it was "the reduction of a literary mountain to a dramatic molehill."
But it proved a hit with the public. "Les Misérables" has now been seen by over 70 million people in 52 countries and 22 languages, according to its website, while the play has given the producers a return of "over 3,500 percent on their original investment." (Cameron Mackintosh's investment in the original London production was $ 450,000, with another $ 450,000 for the West End transfer, according to a New York Times article from the time.)
"It's had a pretty good run, hasn't it?" said Alun Armstrong, the British actor who played the comic role of Thénardier in the original production. "Everything changes. I don't think it matters," he added.
Colm Wilkinson, who played the first Jean Valjean -- the musical's hero, a petty criminal striving for redemption -- said in an email that he loved the revolving stage. "Tough getting used to the motion, but well worth the effect," he said. He had mixed memories of seeing the new production when it played New York, but said people who had no knowledge of the original could react differently.
"Les Miz was and is a great show, but it also takes a very creative impresario to keep a show like Les Miz running for so long," he added.
At a recent performance in London, audience members expressed mixed feelings about the change. Harrods Wong, a 22-year-old tourist from Hong Kong, said it was his second time seeing the production, and that he had come because he read the revolving stage was going to disappear. "I just feel it's iconic," he said. "It still has its value and its appeal."
Isobel Smith, a secretary from North London, at the performance to celebrate a friend's 60th birthday, said she thought the revolving stage added a lot of power to the production. But she could see the benefit of removing it for the actors, at least. "I suppose they won't have to worry about falling over," she said.

These Knicks Don't Belong In Today's N.B.A.

Texto completo: James L. Dolan might have been a perfectly fine custodian of a professional basketball team had his father given him one 50 years ago. But not in the 21st century.
Before there was such a thing as free agency, back when the privilege of ownership essentially included the players along with the franchise, Dolan's imperious ways would not have cost him transcendent talent. His self-defeating stubbornness would not have ruined the curb appeal of Madison Square Garden, the self-proclaimed World's Most Famous Arena.
If he didn't have to compete for the likes of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, Dolan might have been a contender, instead of the steward of a team that just lost a franchise-worst 65 of 82 games for the second time in five seasons and has won just a single playoff series since 2000. Which happens to be about when the Knicks began to play by the byzantine Dolan house rules.
On the subject of past and present, the evolution of the game, I stumbled upon a fascinating article while researching an archival book project on the N.B.A. for The New York Times last year -- written for the newspaper in April 1977 by that famed Boston-based journalist, Arnold (Red) Auerbach.
The headline read: "Pride and Integrity: Pro Basketball Has Changed." In the piece, Auerbach bemoaned the federal court rulings heralding the earliest form of free agency and the gradual shifting of bargaining power to where it rightfully belonged. "By and large, we're seeing an erosion of basic values -- things like pride and integrity and dedication," Auerbach warned. "We've created a system that works against motivation, desire and discipline."
To the contrary, the N.B.A. is a global phenomenon now precisely because its stars became max-leveraged commodities, soaring to once-unfathomable commercial heights in the age of techno-connectivity. The league's 2019 free-agent signing season, newly timed to kick off Sunday at 6 p.m. Eastern, was a Super Bowl of player empowerment and stimulating competitive realignment, commencing with the bombshell that the Nets -- and not the Knicks -- would be landing Irving and Durant.
A tactical savant and patriarch of the Celtics' dynasty, Auerbach was no industry visionary. Pride? Integrity? While tanking engineered or authorized by inept owners such as Dolan continues to plague the league, a gimpy Durant laid it all on the line in Game 5 of the recent finals for the Golden State Warriors -- a team he apparently had every intention of leaving -- and suffered a devastating Achilles' tendon injury on the threshold of free agency.
When the Knicks traded Kristaps Porzingis to Dallas this past winter and opened up enough salary cap space to land two so-called max-salary players, it was widely anticipated that Irving and Durant were coming to fill the void. Maybe that was the original plan. Maybe Durant's injury -- likely to keep him out for all of next season -- and Irving's boyhood predilection for the Nets when they played in New Jersey altered their thinking. Most likely, it was a stark realization that the Nets' architect, Sean Marks, had already constructed a solid foundation while the Knicks had succeeded only in tearing apart yet another blueprint: the one to build a team around Porzingis, the uniquely skilled giant.
But not just that.
People often wonder why Dolan, in his chairmanship of the Garden, has had measurable success with hockey's Rangers while faring so miserably with the Knicks. The answer seems clear: The N.B.A.'s difference makers, in addition to being corporate powerhouses, are also eminent cultural celebrities. They have a grand social platform and have been increasingly eager to use it.
Contrarily repellent is Dolan's utter intolerance of any departure from his less-than-enlightened company line. It goes much deeper than profanely arguing with a fan, or punishing journalists -- most recently the Daily News' Stefan Bondy --whose reporting Dolan objects to. Name a Knicks executive, coach or player during the Dolan years known for his outspokenness. Try to imagine LeBron James's or Gregg Popovich's political diatribes at the Garden.
Players like Durant and Irving did not grow up in a bubble. They know that to be a Garden employee who crosses Dolan is to be censored, or crushed. When Anucha Browne Sanders said in 2007 that she had been sexually harassed in her position as a Knicks marketing executive, Dolan afforded her not a shred of sympathy or respect. (She won a civil judgment in connection with the accusation.) The origin of Charles Oakley's beef with Dolan -- which led to Oakley's being cuffed and carried out of the Garden, under arrest -- was harmless criticism that rang true.
The great contemporary players all say they love performing under the Garden's famed dropped ceiling. What they apparently mean is in a visiting uniform. No doubt Porzingis can't wait to suit up there for the first time since he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in February 2018.
Upon trading him, the Knicks couldn't be content with the salaries they cleared and the draft picks acquired. They had to disparage Porzingis as an agitator, a maverick, as if the constant organizational turmoil throughout his time in New York had been nothing to be unhappy about.
The current front office folks had a year and a half after Phil Jackson's exit to appease Porzingis, and failed. Dolan went on the radio after the trade and bragged: "We hear from people all the time players, representatives who want to come. ... I can tell from what we've heard, I think we're going to have a very successful off-season when it comes to free agents."
Then came the hard part, the actual selling season. After all the hope and hype, the Knicks were suddenly filling the much-celebrated cap space with a trio of consolation prize forwards --Julius Randle, Bobby Portis and Taj Gibson -- on two-year deals that would allow them to begin selling yet another next free-agent fantasy, Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2021. They were surreptitiously letting it be known -- after the fact, naturally --that they never really wanted Durant at the full max salary price.
It is, of course, possible that the Nets, the object of free-agent affection for the first time ever, have taken on excessive risk, given the extent of Durant's injury and Irving's trademark moodiness.
The Knicks' default position -- developing their young players -- may someday even be considered a blessing. With their veteran additions, they may even slip into the playoffs next season. But those are narratives for another time. Today's is the persistence of a recurring one. Dolan, an owner from the very old school of player subservience, has once again flunked modern N.B.A. civics.
Photograph The owner James L. Dolan's imperious ways are no secret, and top N.B.A. free agents have shown little desire to play for him. (PHOTOGRAPH BY FRANK FRANKLIN II/ASSOCIATED PRESS)

Texto completo: A federal wealth tax is seriously being considered in the current presidential campaign.
The concept has been embraced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, former Congressman Beto O’Rourke, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Further adding to interest in the wealth tax is support announced last week by California philanthropist Eli Broad, and nineteen other American billionaires upon whom the tax would fall. Broad’s letter was published in the New York Times under the remarkable title, “I’m in the 1%. Please, Raise My Taxes.”
Sen. Warren estimates the tax will raise $2.75 trillion dollars in ten years. Economists have split over whether that is a realistic number, especially given the ability of the ultra-wealthy to devise evasion schemes for virtually any tax government ever proposes. However, at 50% compliance, the tax would still increase the annual revenue available for the federal government by almost 5%.
Whether this concept is wise should be analyzed under economic, constitutional, and liberty considerations.
The economics of this proposal depends on two factors. The first is the uses to which this money is put. Not surprisingly, the Democratic presidential candidates all propose spending the wealth tax on new programs; none proposes to pay back federal borrowing to reduce the debt. The economic benefit of each expenditure provides fair ground for debate. Preschool education for children whose parents cannot otherwise afford it may well generate long-term economic benefits. Giving the money to politically favored constituencies is less likely to do so.
The second factor is the dampening effect on economic activity from such a tax. Here, the wealth tax has an advantage over an income tax. People do less of that which is taxed. So, we can expect wealthy people to consume more and save less, given that every year the amount they have saved will be taxed anew. Sen. Warren estimates that only 75,000 families will be subject to her wealth tax. If they save less and consume more, it might actually stimulate economic growth. By contrast, an increase in income tax would, at the margin, depress the process of creating income—a much more damaging result.
A federal wealth tax might run into Constitutional trouble under Article I, section 9, which forbids the federal government from imposing a “direct” tax, except in proportion to each state’s population. A wealth tax is not proportional to population. In 1895, the Supreme Court held the federal income tax unconstitutional as a direct tax, not proportional to population. Proponents then passed the 16th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913, allowing federal taxes on income. However, in 1921, the court ruled the federal tax on inheritance was not a direct tax. One of these two opinions must be wrong.
My prediction is that the court will define a direct tax as one that is imposed without a person choosing to do anything. A sales tax, for instance, is indirect: it is triggered by the act of buying something; but a wealth tax is direct, it requires no action at all.
The most important concern is from the point of view of liberty. Sen. Warren was asked after the debate how the federal government could assess the value of individuals’ shares in private companies, fine art, or jewels. She lit up almost with delight to say that it would be easy to keep tabs on only 75,000 families. She appeared to relish the concept of government agents who would, year in and year out, make an inventory of all that some Americans possess. She evinced no concern at all for this invasion of privacy, the unfairness of taxing the same income multiple times (once when earned, then every year it was kept), or the evisceration of a notion that once we acquire property, we can depend on keeping it.
There may be little sympathy for the 75,000 wealthiest families in America; but that is how liberty is lost — incrementally.

'Toy Story 4' Beats The Beatles (Sort of)

Texto completo: "Toy Story 4" comfortably topped the domestic box office this weekend, unsurprisingly winning out against a horror sequel and a movie revolving around the music of the Beatles.
Disney-Pixar's latest "Toy Story" movie sold $ 57.9 million in domestic tickets during its second weekend in theaters and made an additional $ 80.6 million overseas, according to the studio. That puts its cumulative global ticket sales at a whopping $ 496.5 million so far.
It also places "Toy Story 4" slightly behind "Toy Story 3" in terms of staying power, at least in North America. While the fourth installment saw about a 52 percent dip in sales from its first weekend to its second, "Toy Story 3" held on a bit better back in 2010, with around a 46 percent decrease, according to Box Office Mojo. So while the fourth movie's performance is solid, it isn't earth-shattering for the series.

In a distant second was Warner Bros.'s "Annabelle Comes Home," a horror movie about a demonic doll, which sold $ 20.4 million in tickets. It's the latest film in the "Conjuring" saga, which began in 2013 and has made a great deal of money for Warner Bros.
"Annabelle Comes Home" concerns Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), two demonologists who attempt to lock away a haunted doll. Do you think it all goes smoothly?
The movie received a mix of negative and lukewarm responses from critics. ("No more than a shameless franchise-stuffer," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The New York Times.)
The only nonsequel or reboot in the top five was Universal's "Yesterday," which debuted this weekend and landed in third place, with $ 17 million.
Directed by Danny Boyle, the movie imagines a world in which a young English singer-songwriter (played by Himesh Patel) wakes up and realizes that he's suddenly the only person who remembers that the Beatles existed. The movie received lackluster reviews, and currently holds a 59 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Two of the studios with movies in the top three were also behind the fourth- and fifth-place finishers. In fourth was Disney's "Aladdin," which brought in an additional $ 9.3 million in its sixth weekend in North American theaters. Rounding out the top five, Universal and Illumination's "The Secret Life of Pets 2" sold $ 7.1 million in tickets during its fourth weekend.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: "Fleishman Is in Trouble" by Taffy Brodesser-Akner; Random House (374 pages, $27)
Yes, Toby Fleishman is in trouble. He’s a 41-year-old MD with a specialty in liver diseases and a position at a leading Manhattan hospital, and father of an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. That’s all good. But he’s also saddled with a wife that earlier eras would have dismissed as a shrew, but we would condemn with a coarser term.
After 15 years of marriage, Toby has had enough of Rachel. He’s divorcing this high-powered theatrical agent who leads her own agency and mocks him as not ambitious enough. He’s tired of her yearning to social climb among Upper East Side one-percenters, her angry outbursts, her materialism, her excuses for neglecting their children.
Because the author of this novel is a woman, Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, we expect it to evolve into a he said-she said saga, with both sides getting their say. After all of Toby’s whining, won’t Rachel out him for the ungrateful hypocrite he is? That’s not exactly what happens in “Fleishman Is in Trouble.”
The author does cast a satiric and sometimes amusing eye on both the frantic race for status among Rachel and her women friends and the feverish pursuit of sex among new- ly unencumbered men like Toby. For Rachel, nothing beats the pricey school, penthouse and Hamptons beach house for demonstrating your worth in the world. For Toby, never mind that he’s only 5-foot-5 and not especially handsome, internet meet-ups promise an endless orgy of phone sex and sexting.
But he’s quickly made aware of a downside: “You don’t even have to leave your house to be humiliated.”
In between these warring soon-to-be exes, Brodesser-Akner places two of Toby’s friends from his college days. Seth, the womanizing finance guy, never expects to marry. Elizabeth has given up a magazine career to be a suburban wife and mother. Neither is happy. It’s as if whatever choices they make, they’ll inevitably be covered in regret.
The author effectively contrasts her anxious, status-seeking high flyers with the mensch in their midst. Toby Fleishman is a genuinely good doctor and father.
Toward his patients, he is attentive and kind. He reminds his interns to listen to them and their family members. Patients are real people, not just cases.
On the home front, Toby treats his children with the same respect, even when sulky, prepubescent Hannah seems like a junior version of her mother. Solly, gentle and curious about everything, is cast in his father’s mold. Rachel is the rainmaker working late hours, Toby the childminder when the nanny is absent.
Toby moves to another apartment. One day, Rachel doesn’t show up to take her turn with the kids, as they’ve agreed. A day stretches to three weeks, and Rachel can’t be reached by any means. Toby is furious, their children are worried.
Restless in her own marriage, Elizabeth needs a friendly ear as much as Toby does. So these old friends renew a warm and confiding relationship, at least until she runs into a disheveled and out-of-sorts Rachel at a coffee shop.
Rachel never does narrate her story, but as it’s seen through Elizabeth’s eyes, we begin to glimpse another side of a marriage gone sour. If only a miserable childhood and sexist obstacles in the workplace were enough to make us care more about this woman. She’s unable to appreciate Toby, and any devotion for her children is only expressed in efforts to elevate their status.
Never mind that Elizabeth’s encounter with Rachel reactivates her conviction that equality between the sexes remains a distant goal. Never mind that she’s tired of wives having to “tiptoe around the fragility of a man.”
For this reader at least, it’s too late. Brodesser-Akner has been utterly successful at creating a monster. And she’s created a male protagonist who goes the extra mile to do the right thing. He may be a fool with regard to sex, but he’s no knave. That said, female readers may disagree.
This is a book shot through with the pain of divorce, the droll weirdness of our sexual drives, the inanities of people with too much money, and the bewilderment of the young looking on as adults carry on like children.
If the author had condensed her prose a bit instead of engaging in endless riffs that merely repeat a thought, “Fleishman Is in Trouble” would be even better.

Texto completo: It's been 40 years since Carmine "The Cigar" Galante's final stogie was extinguished - with lead.
His ultimo pasto was a midday bite with buddies and bodyguards on the patio at Joe and Mary's, a humble Italian joint on Knickerbocker Ave. in Bushwick.
A hit squad's ambush ended his meal and his life on July 12, 1979. Two companions also were gunned down.
Graphic images of his corpse have immortalized Galante as one of the mob's greatest hits.
Wearing sans-belt slacks and a snug button-down shirt, the bald Galante lies prostrate on the cement, his head cocked against the curbing. His left hand curls toward his chin, as though preparing to relight the cigar between his teeth.
Blood trails toward a floor drain, adding a hint of allegory. And Galante's pinky ring contributes a touch of classic mob bling.
The next day's Daily News front page featured an enduring picture of the scene by staff photographer Frank Castoral, a savvy crime-chaser who talked his way upstairs and shot from a pigeon's-eye view.
"'GODFATHER' GALANTE SLAIN," screamed The News headline.
Galante was born in a Harlem tenement in 1910, but his ancestral roots were deep in Castellammare del Golfo, the Sicilian seaside city that was a cradle of New York's Bonanno Mafia family.
In 1931, Joe Bonanno became paterfamilias of an established crime clan that would eventually take his name. Born in Castellammare, Joe Bananas continued a tradition of stocking his family with men like Galante who understood the language and customs of their corner of the old country.
Wee and wayward, Galante grew up in New York reform schools and began cultivating a rap sheet while barely out of knickers. By age 20 he was working as a freelance mob slugger, enforcing the byzantine treaties that carved up the turf and spoils of Prohibition.
With a gun in his hand he feared no one, including cops - and he made a bad habit of shooting them. He escaped indictment for lack of evidence in the murder of Officer Walter DeCastillia during a Brooklyn Heights payroll heist in March 1930.
Nine months later, Galante wounded Detective Joseph Meenahan and a bystander, a 6-year-old girl, in a wild shootout during another payroll job, at the old Rheingold brewery off Brooklyn's Bushwick Ave.
That case earned him a decade-long tour of upstate prisons.
But it also bestowed mob props because he had zipped his lip when pressed to name three accomplices who escaped the Rheingold holdup.
Paroled in 1939, Galante worked as bodyguard and wheelman for Joe Bonanno. He spent several years in the 1950s as Bonanno's man in Montreal, overseeing lucrative "French Connection" trade routes for Turkish heroin processed in Marseille, France, and bound for the ravenous American market.
But Galante was deported from Canada as undesirable in 1956 and three years later was among 21 mob figures indicted in the U.S. for drug conspiracy.
The Bonanno family buckled at the knees during Galante's 12 years in the can for that rap. Joe Bonanno was chased into early retirement in 1964 by fellow Mafia commissioners, and he was succeeded by a series of short-tenured replacements.
Fresh from prison in 1974, Galante decided he was entitled to lead - not only the Bonanno faction, but as New York's boss of bosses.
A decade before John Gotti went into his peacock strut as Gambino boss, Galante engineered his own remarkable public campaign for the role of godfather after Carlo Gambino's 1976 death (boringly enough, by heart attack in his Massapequa, L.I., bed.)
Jimmy Breslin said Galante soon rolled up on Mulberry St. and "announced he was now in charge of crime throughout the free world."
"Galante promptly began to ride around in a custom-built brown Lincoln limousine that was three buildings long," Breslin wrote in The News. "The newspapers examined him as if he were the new ruler of China."
UPI declared Galante "the most powerful Mafia chieftain in the United States."
Galante was blamed - or credited - for every mug's murder in New York, and the cases were stitched together in the press as an internecine Mafia war. Syndicated columnist Victor Riesel suggested Galante's seconds were whispering his name "to enhance his reputation for being No. 1 tough guy."
Team Galante even came up with a campaign promise - essentially, Make the Mafia Great Again.
As Lucinda Franks wrote in The New York Times in 1977, "Galante is planning to merge the five New York crime families under his own leadership and aims to become a national chieftain who would try to restore the Mafia to a position of power it has not held in at least 20 years."
But he made the narcissist's mistake of believing his own press clips, according to an often-cited comment that has become his epitaph, although its fidelity is flimsy.
"No one will ever kill me," Galante is said to have uttered. "They wouldn't dare."
He was imprisoned briefly for parole violation in 1978. He should have stayed there. His life was over, at age 69, nine months after his release.
His murder was sanctioned by rival mob bosses, who declared Galante's leadership illegitimate.
After a 50-year association with the Mafia, The Cigar got greedy and forgot his Castellammare manners.

Photographing His Dozens of Siblings

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When Kathy Ryan, the director of photography at The New York Times Magazine, was introduced to a 19-year-old photographer with a really interesting personal story to tell, she knew from the first meeting it was going to be good.
That photographer was Eli Baden-Lasar, now 20. Mr. Baden-Lasar grew up in a playful and loving family, with two mothers and a sister. He understood from a young age that his father was an anonymous sperm donor.
At 19, he learned that a few acquaintances from a camp he attended for children with same-sex parents had used DNA tests and a registry for family members to connect with donors or donor siblings. They found previously unknown half siblings, some of whom had attended camp together. Mr. Baden-Lasar was curious: Could he have family out there that he didn't know about? Had he met them? Who were they, and what was their relationship to him, a genetically similar stranger?
These questions led Mr. Baden-Lasar to the discovery of his half siblings -- all 32 of them, conceived by the same donor. The donor was in his twenties at the time of his donation at the California Cryobank, which Mr. Baden-Lasar learned described his biological father as a "celebrity look-alike" of Tom Brady. To process his new reality as a brother not just to one sibling, but to dozens, and to find an opportunity to meet these strangers who shared his DNA, Mr. Baden-Lasar decided to travel around the country and photograph them. The siblings were spread out geographically, and they ranged in age from 4 to 22, though many are the same age as he is -- often they were only a few months apart.
After Ms. Ryan met with Mr. Baden-Lasar, she wrote an email to the magazine's editor in chief, Jake Silverstein, about the initial work that she had seen, and he agreed it was an incredible opportunity. The beginnings of this personal project developed into a collaboration with Ryan and photo editor Jessica Dimson, and eventually became the Times Magazine cover story this week.
Mr. Baden-Lasar took the time to get to know his siblings as he took their portraits, sometimes spending days with them before sitting down to photograph. The siblings shared a group chat to which new members were added all the time -- and he discovered two new siblings in the last three months of the project. Some of them had become friends.
"It felt a bit embarrassing to be asking for their time," Mr. Baden-Lasar said. "One guy responded to a message and gave me an afternoon; he said, 'I'll do it for you because of blood,' as a joke."
Because of the rise of genetic testing sites like 23andMe, Mr. Baden-Lasar now has access to information that his mothers had never considered would be widely available. As this generation of donor children comes of age, they are able find their parent and one another more easily than ever before. It can seem, as Mr. Baden-Lasar puts it in the accompanying essay in the magazine this Sunday, as if they were all assigned at birth to be unwitting participants in "an inadvertent social experiment." His donor father knows that they exist, but he declined to participate in the project.
As Mr. Baden-Lasar worked with the magazine's editors on the project, there was no set plan other than to photograph as many siblings as possible as quickly as possible. "I was at the whim of other people's schedules," he said. "I would jump at any free moment that they had." For 10 months, he worked largely around the schedules of the more than two dozen siblings, all but one of whom he had never met.
One of his siblings, Mr. Baden-Lasar found out, had roomed with him in a high school program in New York. Some had grown up with siblings of their own; some are only children. One lives in Hawaii; two siblings, who share the donor father and the same mother, live 30 minutes from where Mr. Baden-Lasar grew up in Oakland, Calif. A few siblings are of mixed race. Members of the group came from vastly different socioeconomic backgrounds.
"I was apprehensive about the project in the beginning," he said, "because news about sperm donation and this world has hit full saturation in the media. It always seems to be reduced to daddy complexes or dramatizing certain things. I wanted the emotional thrust of it to be in the images."
Mr. Baden-Lasar used a large-format camera for the project -- an intentionally retro and challenging device. "So much about the world was already being mediated by online databases and registries and social media; all of this technology," he said, "and this type of camera just felt completely out of that world."
This is Mr. Baden-Lasar's first magazine assignment and his first major photography project. He took a year off from school to work on it and will matriculate at Wesleyan University in the fall as a sophomore.
Mr. Baden-Lasar said that there are plans for a reunion, or a first-time meeting for many of the half siblings, in the near future.

Supreme Court’s gerrymandering ruling represents a dangerous threat to our democracy

Texto completo: Thoughts after Thursday’s highly partisan Supreme Court ruling on gerrymandering.
Republican Supreme Court justices are from Mars, or are pretending to be. I guess the question is whether they are supposed to pretend to be.
Gerrymandering is wrong, morally wrong and an obvious violation of important moral and ethical principles of how a democracy should be organized and run. This is obvious on an earthly level, on a level of human justice as currently evolved homo sapiens are able to understand concepts like fairness and justice. But on a Martian level, perhaps not. Probably not. We’d be guessing if we tried to figure out what “fairness” means on Mars.
This may sound sarcastic, but it isn’t. This is very serious, and dangerous, and a threat to the common understanding of what it means to be a 21st-century democracy operating under an 18th-century Constitution.
I’m not a legal scholar. I do know an above-average amount about the Constitution, having studied it and written about it over the years, including a couple of books. In 1987, the bicentennial of the Constitutional Convention, I wrote a series for the Star Tribune that became a book called “Our Constitution: The Myth That Binds Us,” and later I wrote an online book of constitutional columns for MinnPost that are still available as an ebook on Amazon, titled “Imperfect Union: The Constitutional Roots of the Mess We’re In.”
The Constitution is a document. A text. But that’s not what binds us together as Americans. It’s the myth of the Constitution that binds us. The myth is that the Constitution is brilliant, fair, balanced, bordering on perfect, and that in its perfection it is the foundation of America’s rise to greatness and makes American democracy the light unto the world. It is the bible of the religion of American self-worship. And like any bible, it’s out-of-date and highly flawed and the devil can cite it for his purposes.
For the time in which it was written, the Constitution was near-perfect, and very likely the best version of a system of government that could have been written in the 1780s and ratified in the states by the decision-makers of that time (almost all white, male landowners, by the way).
The Constitution invented Congress, including the U.S. House of Representatives, which was its most democratic element. In fact, it was the only element of the new national government that would be elected by the (white, male, land-owning) people. The Senate would be elected by the state legislatures, the president by the Electoral College. Justices on the Supreme Court — appointed by the indirectly elected president and confirmed by the indirectly elected Senate — would serve life terms, rendering them even further beyond the reach of the governed. Only one of those features has been changed by actual amendment (the direct election of senators.)
But the Constitution says not a word about how the states were to draw the boundaries of the House districts. Gerrymandering is such an ancient tradition, it dates from the tortured Massachusetts district drawn by Gov. Elbridge Gerry, who actually attended the Constitutional Convention (although he opposed the final draft).
The actual Constitution also does not say that the Supreme Court is empowered to strike down acts of Congress, and there’s little evidence that this power was intended. The early Supreme Court made a power grab, in the famed Marbury v. Madison case, and got away with it. And now, without benefit of any constitutional amendment, the Supreme Court holds the power to overrule Congress.
Now let me apply all of this to what happened on Thursday. By a totally partisan 5-4 majority, the Supreme Court decided that the Constitution doesn’t require that congressional boundaries be drawn fairly. As long as the districts have equal populations, they can be drawn unfairly — gerrymandered — to the partisan advantage of whichever party has control over the drawing of the district maps, the court ruled.
It happened, just happened, to be a case of five Republican justices finding this to be the case about a blatantly gerrymandered congressional map in North Carolina that was, without any question or doubt, designed to maximize the yield of Republicans in the North Carolina delegation to a number far greater than the overall support for Republicans in the overall population of the state. With modern tools, this can be done quite efficiently and fairly openly.
From yesterday’s New York Times coverage of the North Carolina case:
The state’s congressional delegation, in a purple state in which neither party had a distinct edge, was at the time made up of 10 Republicans and three Democrats. A key goal, lawmakers said, was “to maintain the current partisan makeup of North Carolina’s congressional delegation.”
“I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats,” explained David Lewis, a Republican member of the General Assembly’s redistricting committee. “So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.”
Above, I called this “wrong, morally wrong and an obvious violation of important moral and ethical principles of how a democracy should be organized and run.” I stand by that.
I also understand that unelected justices are not supposed to interpose their values about what the laws should be, against the actions of elected legislators, like the North Carolina legislators who drew this map for partisan advantage.
I also note that all five of the justices who decided to leave the biased map in place were appointed by Republican presidents, including the current incumbent who makes little effort to disguise his view that Republican justices are expected to toe the party line. You can search the Constitution. You will not find any guidance in there about whether presidents are supposed to use their Supreme appointment powers to pack the court with justices who will vote the party line.
So if a Martian had just landed, and you tried to tell him why you are troubled by the pro-gerrymandering ruling, and the Martian asked you to show him what the Constitution says about how Supreme Court justices are supposed to decide a case like this, what would you show him?
I believe our system of “checks and balances,” which was always a bit overrated if push came to shove, is under the most extreme pressure in many generations, maybe ever. We have a president who doesn’t believe in checks and balances, who knows nothing about the Constitution, whose love of power is frightening, and who for reasons of convenience decided to pretend he is a Republican. We have a Republican Party that has decided to make whatever adjustments it needs to make to align itself with that president and his base, based in part of the belief that he will continue to pack the Supreme Court with reliable conservatives.
The best defense of what the Supreme Court justices ruled on gerrymandering is that they showed “judicial modesty,” which is a good thing. The justices aren’t supposed to ask, “What should the law be?” They aren’t supposed to ask “Is gerrymandering right or wrong?” They are supposed to ask, “What does the Constitution say?”
It doesn’t mention “gerrymandering.” It doesn’t even contain the word “democracy,” The closest it comes (Article Iv, Sec. 4) is: “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.”
They weren’t referring to the Republican Party, which wasn’t created until the 1850s.

Texto completo: Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez y Valeria, padre e hija se fueron juntos de El Salvador con la idea de llegar a Estados Unidos en busca de un mejor futuro. Lo hicieron vivos, tomados de la mano junto a Tania, esposa de Óscar y madre de Valeria. Hoy, seis días después, la única que vuelve con vida es Tania, acompañando dos féretros y volviendo al país del que huyeron.
El domingo 23 de junio, Óscar decidió que no podían esperar más en Matamoros, México , donde permanecían albergados, en medio del hacinamiento, las altas temperaturas y la poca alimentación. Le dijo a Tania y Valeria que cruzarían hacia el otro lado por las aguas del río Bravo , pero la idea fue fatal para Óscar y Valeria, que terminaron arrastrados por una corriente y murieron.
Desde entonces la imagen de los dos salvadoreños ha recorrido todo el mundo, provocando indignación y tristeza. Las portadas de periódicos en todo el mundo, como The New York Times de Estados Unidos y The Independent de Reino Unido, han evocado la tragedia durante toda la semana.
* El conmovedor testimonio de la madre de Óscar, el migrante salvadoreño que murió junto a su hija en frontera de México y EUA
“En un mundo abrumado por el populismo es fácil para los líderes demonizar y deshumanizar a los migrantes, como ha hecho Trump. Víctimas de la guerra, el hambre y la pobreza, víctimas como este padre y su hija que tratan de ingresar a Estados Unidos, no son vistas por lo que son, vidas con igual valor, hasta que es demasiado tarde”, escribió The Independent en su portada de ayer, con la foto de Óscar y Valeria, y en clara crítica a la política migratoria de Donald Trump, presidente de los Estados Unidos.
Los cuerpos de Óscar y Valeria eran esperados ayer, pero durante el día había más dudas que respuestas. La madre de Óscar, Rosa Ramírez, aseguraba que nadie les había comunicado detalles sobre el retorno de sus seres amados. En la embajada de México en El Salvador sostenían que había vuelos atrasados desde aquel país y que eran esperados en horas de la noche. Y las autoridades de Relaciones Exteriores tampoco daban información certera.
* Así avanzan los preparativos para el sepelio de padre e hija salvadoreños ahogados en río Bravo
En Matamoros, ciudad fronteriza con Estados Unidos, los cuerpos de Óscar y Valeria esperaban ser movilizados hasta el aeropuerto más cercano, en Monterrey, a 300 kilómetros.
Los medios locales que cubrieron la noticia reportaron que Óscar y Valeria, acompañados de Tania, salieron de la funeraria a las 2 de la tarde, hora salvadoreña. Desde ahí eran aproximadamente tres horas de camino al aeropuerto y luego otras tres en el vuelo hasta El Salvador.
“Es la misma tragedia de gente desesperada, de inocentes que nunca sabrán por qué murieron y los que sí lo saben, seguirán sin hacer nada. La memoria colectiva olvida pronto”, destacó el miércoles la cadena española COPE, al hablar sobre el caso.
La tragedia ha servido también para que medios internacionales hagan eco de la crisis que se vive en la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos, donde se han intensificado las medidas contra los indocumentados. México reforzó con casi 25,000 soldados para evitar que los migrantes crucen hacia el otro lado y la política en los albergues es retener a los viajeros mientras reciben una cita formal para pedir asilo. Pero la velocidad de este método no da buenos resultados.
Ayer por la mañana, dos tumbas comenzaron a ser cavadas en el cementerio La Bermeja, en San Salvador. Empleados del lugar confirmaron que son para Óscar y Valeria, pero dijeron que tanto familiares como miembros del Gobierno, que coordinan la repatriación, han exigido privacidad en el entierro, que podría ser hoy. Una medida que será difícil de cumplir, dado que la atención mundial estará puesta en la llegada de las dos víctimas a su última morada.
A la orilla del río Bravo, hoy yace una rosa.

Texto completo: Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler
R-Battle Ground
Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, was one of 305 House members who voted in favor of a bill to send $4.6 billion in emergency funds to the United States-Mexico border on Thursday.
The bill increases resources for the Defense Department and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and was regarded as a victory for Republicans, who blocked an earlier version of the legislation from Democrats that was more focused on increasing oversight at detention facilities and providing humanitarian aid.
“I'm not opposed to people who are holding out for provisions. I just want to make sure we're not playing political football against the president or Republicans or even centrist Democrats,” Herrera Beutler said in an interview with The Columbian Thursday morning, before the vote was taken.
The first version of the border aid bill
The congresswoman joined nearly all her Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives on Tuesday in voting against a bill that would have sent $4.5 billion to the southern border.
That bill, H.R. 3401, passed the Democrat-controlled House, 230-195. But it hit the wall against the Republican majority in the Senate, where lawmakers had voted for their own version of a bipartisan bill that gives federal agencies much more leeway in how to spend the money.
Herrera Beutler said she voted against that first House bill because it didn't include enough funding for teams of immigration judges.
“I felt like it was inadequate. I understand that Democratic leadership in the House need to appease different flanks of their party,” Herrera Beutler said. “They failed to really address the problem, which in my view is getting that backlog down.”
Border detention facilities have drawn a fresh round of criticism recently for inhumane conditions, with reports of children sleeping on concrete floors, being denied medical treatment and going weeks without a toothbrush or change of clothes.
The original House bill focused primarily on the conditions within detention facilities, and the funding provided to federal agencies would have come with strings attached. The Democrats' bill would have required Customs and Border Enforcement to establish plans for administering health services, hygiene supplies and sufficient nutrition at its facilities.
The House's first legislation would have additionally funded more translators in customs and immigration offices, as well as tightened standards of care among government contractors. Extending the detention of any minor longer than 90 days in a temporary intake facility would have required a written notification to Congress. Also included in the legislation was a provision that would allow lawmakers to visit detention facilities without prior notice.
The focus on the facilities themselves distracted from a higher priority, Herrera Beutler said — getting asylum requests processed and immigrants released, either into the U.S. or back to their home country.
“The goal shouldn't be, ‘Let's put up permanent housing for everyone,' ” Herrera Beutler said. “You've got to get these (cases) processed. Nobody wants to see people detained. We don't want to keep people. I don't think there's anyone arguing for that as a solution.”
The Democrats' provisions were also unpopular with President Donald Trump, who told The New York Times earlier this week that he'd like the money sent to the border but “there are a couple of points that I would like to get out of it.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, called the first bill “resistance theater.”
Herrera Beutler disagreed with McConnell's characterization, saying she wouldn't go so far as to “impugn the motives” of the Democrats who passed the original legislation. But she said she believes the House bill's focus on facility conditions diverted resources away from solving the judicial backlog of immigration cases, which she considered the bigger issue.
“I think everybody is a little bit right here, and everybody shares the blame,” Herrera Beutler said. “I've been here long enough to see immigration gets so manipulated for political ends. It's a fear-driven thing. And both sides do it.”
What version of border aid passed?
The Senate bill provides $4.6 billion to federal border agencies with far fewer restrictions about how they might spend the money.
The legislation sets aside some funds for the Defense Department, as well as more money for overtime and back pay for ICE officers. Lawmakers are allowed to visit immigration facilities under the bill, but are required to give two days' notice.
The Senate bill had bipartisan support and sailed to victory Wednesday, 84-8. It passed the House 305-102 Thursday afternoon in what's been regarded as a defeat for Democrats.
In a letter to lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., acknowledged as much.
“The children come first,” Pelosi wrote. “In order to get resources to the children fastest, we will reluctantly pass the Senate bill.”
Trump has indicated he'll sign the bill.
Herrera Beutler said she would have liked to see a few provisions from the original House bill make it into the final legislation, especially the zero-notice visits from lawmakers. But she wanted something that could ultimately pass, she said.
“I'm not interested in characterizing it the way the Left does or the Right does to make a political point. People are dying,” Herrera Beutler said.
“I'm sure everybody's going to find stuff to hate about it, but the goal would be to at least have some movement.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Candidates speaking Spanish quickly became one of the standout aspects of Wednesday night's Democratic presidential primary debate in Miami, with Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Julián Castro all delivering at least one line "en español. "
"I loved it because I represent the Bronx. There was a lot of Spanglish in the building," Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , who is of Puerto Rican descent, told Stephen Colbert. "I thought it was a good gesture to the fact that we are a diverse country. "
"I thought it was humorous sometimes," she added, saying she almost expected candidates to start dodging questions in Spanish.
"Hi, I am running for president and I'm not going to give you an answer to your question," Ocasio-Cortez then said in Spanish, mimicking the candidates.
Not all the reviews of the candidates' Spanish skills were positive, with some observers mocking their accents and their grammatical missteps.
Democratic candidates Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang both joked about the shortcomings of their own Spanish skills after the debate.
Many wondered why O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, felt the need to answer a question about tax rates in another language.
"I think it’s important that we listen to, and speak to everyone in this country, including those who happen to speak, or prefer to speak, Spanish," O'Rourke said Thursday, explaining his decision to CNN. "If this democracy is going to work, if our economy is going to work for everyone, then everyone has to be included. "
The 2020 candidates: Who is running for president? An interactive guide
But Wednesday night was not the first time presidential candidates on the debate stage tried to employ the romance language spoken by more than 13% of the U. S. population, according to the Census.
In one 2016 Republican presidential primary debate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio responded to a criticism from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in saying, "I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish. "
An agitated Cruz, who has confessed his Spanish is "lousy," fired back in Spanish, telling Rubio "dícelo ahora si quieres. En español, si quieres. " ("Say it now if you want. In Spanish, if you want. ")
Although he didn't use it in a debate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush spoke Spanish during interviews and at campaign events during the 2016 Republican primary race, prompting criticism from then-candidate Donald Trump, who said Bush should "set the example by speaking English. "
"This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish," Trump said in a September 2015 Republican primary debate.
In 1999, George W. Bush dropped a line in Spanish on the Republican primary debate stage in Arizona, telling Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch – in his iconic drawl – "Hay muchos hispanos que viven en este estado" ("There are a lot of Hispanics who live in this state").
"George W. Bush was the first U. S. president who thought that he spoke Spanish," Univision's Jorge Ramos told Esquire in 2016. "Most of the time, he was unintelligible, but voters appreciated that he tried. "
Most interpret these candidates' attempts to showcase their foreign language skills as efforts to win over Latino voters. But a 2016 Univision News poll found that only 26% of Hispanic voters said that they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who spoke Spanish fluently, while 68% said it would have no impact on their decision.
But that won't stop candidates from trying to do they can to win every vote they can from that large and key demographic.
Ramos described it as "Christopher Columbus syndrome," where Hispanic voters are rediscovered in every presidential election.
"Hispandering happens every four years," he told The New York Times.

Three losses in two weeks

Texto completo: The food world is mourning the recent loss of three of its most beloved luminaries - Leah Chase, Maida Heatter, and Molly O'Neill - who all passed away within a shockingly short two week period.

It's impossible to overstate their importance.

They were women who instructed us, and about topics beyond just food. They invited us to not only cook and bake and eat, but also to enjoy the immense pleasure that these activities can bring, especially the sharing of food. It has the power to unite, to break down barriers, and to cement relationships.

These three extraordinary women also showed us that food has a context. It has a history, and it can be an integral part of making memories and building futures.Mrs. Chase, who died on June 1 at the age of 96, was an institution unto herself in New Orleans.

As I'd written in a story about the role of food in the Civil Rights movement, her family's famed Dooky Chase's restaurant was a favored meeting place for leaders such as the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall. Humbly, as always, the Queen of Creole Cuisine summed it up by simply saying, "I like to think we changed the course of America in this restaurant over a bowl of gumbo."

A strong supporter of the arts who believed in the power of beautiful things to ennoble us, Mrs. Chase lined the walls of her restaurant with works by African-American artists.

Her profound impact affected generations of influencers. She had a cameo in Beyonce's "Lemonade" video, and notably once chastised President Barack Obama for attempting to add hot sauce to her cooking.

Ms. Heatter died at 102 on June 6, just a few weeks after the publication of her latest book: Happiness is Baking, a compilation of favorites from her decades-long career. She was a firm believer in the stress-reducing benefits of baking, which she considered to be a creative art form.

Nicknamed the Queen of Cake by Saveur magazine, Ms. Heatter just as importantly was the self-declared Chairperson of the Board of the Chocolate Lovers Association of the World, even devoting entire books to this favorite food.

And with her dedication to detail she was a consummate instructor, teaching classes and writing books dedicated to desserts. She encouraged readers to mark up her cookbooks with notes, like students with a textbook, to make the recipes more useful for future baking sessions.

And on June 16, food writer Ms. O'Neill lost her battle with liver disease and cancer. She was only 66.

Born and raised in Columbus, her career included writing for The New York Times, holding writers' retreats, and teaching online seminars.

Her New York Cookbook from 1992 - my copy of which is stained, with a nearly broken binding - sought the distinctive flavors of the city and showcased the best of its home cooking and street food long before others brought acclaim to such specialties. And she celebrated these people and their dishes without comparison or qualification, considering them as equals with four-star chefs and restaurants.

Ms. O'Neill helped to build food writing into a fascinating specialty that went beyond merely offering recipes. She shared her passion and talent with the next generation of writers.

At the heart of it all, these three women encouraged us to be curious, to be adventurous, to take chances - and not just in the kitchen.

They truly inspired us to enjoy the pleasures of a life well lived.

Jenny Slate and Seth Meyers joked about her speech for a graduating class of 1

Texto completo: Jenny Slate may be a movie star, acting in big-budget films like “Venom" and most recently voicing a character in “The Secret Life of Pets 2." But one person who wasn't familiar with her work was Gwen Lynch , the lone student at a commencement speech the Milton native gave earlier this month.
Slate stopped by “Late Night With Seth Meyers " on Tuesday to talk about the speech she gave for Lynch, the sole graduate of Cuttyhunk Elementary School, which is located on Cuttyhunk Island, a speck of land 12 miles south of New Bedford with a year-round population of about 10 people. Slate told Meyers that she found out in The New York Times that Lynch had some other requests for commencement speakers who ranked a bit above her.
“I heard from the Times that she wanted Michelle Obama , and they were like, 'Well no, you can't have that. She's busy,' " Slate said. “And she was like, 'OK, got it, I want Oprah .' And they were like, 'Yeah, she can't come here. There's like, two ferries a day. She's too busy.' "
Slate said that Lynch didn't know who she was before the actress was announced as the commencement speaker, but the two got to know each other on a walk around the island beforehand.
“We took a walk and I got to know her, and she's wonderful," Slate said. “And also the main fact is that she lives on an island and goes to school by herself, and still has more friends than I had as a teenager."
Meyers and Slate also had a little fun at the expense of the Vineyard Gazette, joking that Slate's commencement speech qualified as major news for the island publication, and discussing Meyers's own personal experience with the newspaper.
“My father-in-law had a pet goat that died and it got an obituary longer than a president's," Meyers said. “They interviewed other people, like, 'What'd you think of Raisin?' 'Well, you know, he was like most goats, but I guess we'll miss him.' "

Texto completo: Days after writer E. Jean Carroll accused President Donald Trump of raping her in a Bergdof Goodman dressing room in the 1990s, the president said she was "totally lying" and "not my type. "
It's not the first time Trump has used the tactic of criticizing a woman's appearance to discredit her.
After Jessica Leeds accused Trump of sticking his hand up her skirt while on a flight in the 1980s, he said “Believe me, she would not be my first choice. "
He suggested Natasha Stoynoff, a writer for People who claims Trump forced "his tongue down my throat," was not attractive enough to assault.
"Look at her," he told a cheering crowd at an October 2016 rally. "You tell me what you think. I don't think so. I don't think so. "
Trump adamantly denies all 20 accusations of sexual misconduct.
ANALYSIS: Writer E. Jean Carroll accuses Trump of rape. Why are we so reluctant to talk about it?
The "too ugly to rape" defense is one many perpetrators use to undermine victims, and sexual-assault experts say it feeds into the public's misunderstanding of how sexual violence works.
"We see that babies to women in their 90s are raped," said Sarah Cook, associate dean at Georgia State University Honors College, a nationally recognized expert on violence against women and a survivor of sexual assault. "Rape isn't about sexual attraction. Rape is about the expression of power through sexual behavior. "
In March, Italy’s Justice Ministry ordered an inquiry into a court ruling that overturned a rape verdict in part because of an assertion the woman was too ugly to be a rape victim.
Last year, a North Carolina Republican official shared on Facebook a fake photo mocking the appearance of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Cabarrus County Republican Chair Lanny Lancaster wrote: "This is the alleged sexual assault victim. Wow," the (Raleigh) News & Observer reported.
When Dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid in 2011, online commenters questioned whether he would have raped her because of her "ugliness. "
Linking the likelihood of sexual violence to a woman's appearance is dangerous because it implies that if a woman was somehow less sexually attractive — for example, more covered up — then maybe she could have prevented her own rape. And it's not only men who make the case.
In a 2017 interview with Radio Times Magazine, actress Angela Lansbury said ”we must sometimes take blame, women. I really do think that. Although it’s awful to say we can’t make ourselves look as attractive as possible without being knocked down and raped. ”
In a 2017 op-ed in the New York Times, actress Mayim Bialik suggested conventionally beautiful women are more likely to be targets for sexual predators.
For victims who are not conventionally attractive by society's standards, the argument is literally adding insult to injury, attacking someone's self-worth that has already been damaged by the assault.
The pervasity of the "too ugly" argument can also have a chilling effect on reporting, making victims who lack confidence in their appearance further doubt whether they will be believed.
"Most rape victims are already hesitant to disclose — whether due to fear of retaliation, shame, self-blame or doubting that others will believe their allegations," said Karen Weiss, a sociology professor at West Virginia University and an expert on sexual victimization. "Insulting their self-esteem is just another account that revictimizes women and keeps victims silent. "
Sexual assault is never about a woman's beauty, experts say, but is a unique form of control used to shame, demean and defile victims. And it can happen to anyone, regardless of their appearance, age or what they're wearing.
"There are so many different portrayals of rape in our society, and many of them feed our stereotypes that rape is about sexual attraction, that you have to be absolutely beautiful, stunning, to be raped," Weiss said. "But the reality is, all of us are vulnerable. "
If you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800. 656. HOPE (4673) or visit hotline. rainn. org/online and receive confidential support.

Smart eager to help Celtics reset

Texto completo: WALTHAM — The Celtics' roster has undergone multiple facelifts in recent years, but amid all the trading, signing, drafting, and reshuffling, Marcus Smart has remained the one constant. And while free agency will not open until Sunday evening, Smart has been around long enough to understand that big alterations could be coming once again.
“I expected things to change [this summer]," Smart said during a break at his annual kids basketball camp at Brandeis on Tuesday. “I wasn't expecting big or little; I just knew something was going to change. I think everyone kind of knew that. Now, what that is, we have no clue. Like I said, you can't really focus on that. You have to let the guys whose jobs it is to focus on that. You focus on what you can."
Smart, like everyone else, has seen the reports that Kyrie Irving and Al Horford are likely to sign elsewhere this summer. He said he has spoken to Irving since the season ended in May, but only about his family, not his basketball future. He was asked Tuesday whether it surprised him to hear that there is a good chance both players will be leaving the Celtics.
“A little bit, it did," he said. “But, those guys are grown, and they have every right to do what they feel is best for not only them and their families and their careers. Regardless of if those guys stay or leave, I have nothing but love for them. Always will. I wish nothing but the best luck for them, whatever they do."
There was a good chance that if the Celtics had acquired Anthony Davis from the Pelicans earlier this month, Smart would have been sent to New Orleans. But Davis is a Laker now, of course, and some of the frustration caused by Boston's failure to land Davis was tempered by the fact that Smart is now back.
There will be more clarity in the coming weeks, but Smart does not yet know what the roster will look like. For that matter, neither do the Celtics. But Smart is eager to help reboot the franchise.
“I'm excited," he said. “We're excited. As competitors, you have a season like we did last year and it leaves a funny taste in your mouth. We use that as our motivation and to keep going. We're very excited. Whatever team or whatever people or whoever is on the board or whoever is on this roster with us, we're excited to have them to go out there and fight."
The Celtics drafted four players last Thursday, and Smart called them “great pickups" who will be able to help the team next season.
Even though Smart is still just 25 years old, he is now something of an elder statesman on this team. Of the players under contract for next season, only Gordon Hayward is older.
“I see my role as bigger than ever now," Smart said. “Just because, once again, being that longest-tenured Celtic, going into my sixth season and really understanding Brad [Stevens] and this organization, and the system that he likes to run, and just, that's who I am. And I've got to be that times 10 now, because we are going through some things. We did have a bad year. We've just got to keep everybody on the same track."
There will be reinforcements coming in some form, however. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the Celtics could pursue All-Star free agent point guard Kemba Walker. Even if they do not, they could create about $35 million in salary cap space to find some more help for Smart and this young core. Smart said he had not been asked to provide any free agency assistance just yet.
“Just letting the front office, people who run those situations, take care of it," he said. “Whatever I have to do on my part to help this team, if that is get involved in the recruiting process [I will]."
It may seem that given these imminent and high-profile departures, the Celtics are essentially resetting. But Smart views the situation through a different prism.
“The thing is, the Raptors just won the championship, right?" he said. “But they've got to start back over from the beginning just like we do. So we all start back over at the starting line, we all start at zero, and we all get a chance to do it.
“So everybody's starting over, regardless if they have the same team or not, they've all got to start from the beginning. That's how we take it. We take it as we come in, and we have an opportunity to do something special."

NRA shuts down NRATV amid turmoil with advertising firm

Texto completo: The National Rifle Association is planning to shut down NRATV, their live broadcasting media arm, as the organization is in lawsuits with advertising firm Ackerman McQueen. The NRA has officially severed all ties with Ackerman.
“Many members expressed concern about the messaging on NRATV becoming too far removed from our core mission: defending the Second Amendment,” NRA Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre wrote in a message to members that was expected to be sent out by Wednesday, according to the New York Times.
“So, after careful consideration, I am announcing that starting today, we are undergoing a significant change in our communications strategy. We are no longer airing ‘live TV’ programming.”
Ackerman said in a statement that it was “not surprised that the N.R.A. is unwilling to honor its agreement to end our contract and our long-standing relationship in an orderly and amicable manner.”
“When given the opportunity to do the right thing, the N.R.A. once again has taken action that we believe is intended to harm our company even at the expense of the N.R.A. itself,” the company added.
The move by the NRA comes after the organization ousted its president and first vice president, as well as suspended its top lobbyist. They were accused of participating in the effort to oust LaPierre, who was reelected as chief executive and executive vice president during the NRA's annual convention.

Texto completo: The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote today on a bill that could further send $4.5 billion to alleviate substandard humanitarian conditions in migrant facilities at the southwestern border. However, Democratic lawmakers are divided on the provisions in the bill that many feel give President Trump too much leeway to use the funds to increase border enforcement, as reported by the New York Times.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., met with several congressional Democrats on Monday evening to discuss the rift over the bill which, if passed, could quickly send money to several migrant programs that are running out of cash. Many progressive Democrats wanted further restrictions in the legislation that would stop Trump from being able to funnel the funds toward border enforcement programs. Others felt that the humanitarian crisis at the border mandated that they no longer delay the bill, however imperfect. Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y, encouraged voting on the bill in its current form to expedite funding to aid migrants saying, "We cannot allow our anger at this president to blind us to the horrific conditions at facilities along the border as the agencies run out of money."
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., stated ahead of the evening meeting with Pelosi her intent to refuse to vote on the bill in its current form saying, "I will not fund another dime to allow ICE to continue its manipulative tactics." Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., expressed doubt that the president would adhere to any restrictions in the bill as it was currently written. She felt that Trump would likely ignore the legislation to promote his own border enforcement agenda saying, "We all want to address the problems at the border, but we don’t know that there are enough sticks in this bill to make sure that the Trump administration actually spends the money the way they’re supposed to."
While Democrats feel that the bill gives Trump too much power, House Republicans object to the current bill's refusal to acknowledge back pay to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers as well as other restrictions. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn., who serves as the senior Republican on the panel overseeing the bill said, "You will see just about every Republican in the House vote against the Democratic supplemental bill."
The Senate, meanwhile, has pending legislation with far fewer restrictions on the presidential administration that would quickly send $4.6 to the border.
A White House statement expressed that Trump would likely veto the House bill in its current form saying that it "does not provide adequate funding to meet the current crisis," and that it, "contains partisan provisions designed to hamstring the administration’s border enforcement efforts."
Democrats Ocasio-Cortez, Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Michigan, Ilhan Omar, Minnesota, and Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts, issued a joint statement further stating their refusal to negotiate the bill saying, "It is absolutely unconscionable to even consider giving one more dollar to support this president’s deportation force that openly commits human rights abuses and refuses to be held accountable to the American people."

Texto completo: Tiffany Cabán tiene una pequeña ventaja sobre la presidenta del condado de Queens, Melinda Katz , con más del 94% de los votos contados en los resultados preliminares de la elección primaria demócrata, aunque la brecha es de alrededor de 1,000 votos de los 75,000 votos registrados hasta el momento, reporta CSNY.
Con los resultados que muestran una carrera casi de empate, la batalla demócrata por la nominación del fiscal del distrito de Queens está al final el martes, igualando el frenesí de los medios de comunicación que se desarrolló alrededor de la carrera.
A pesar de contar con un total de seis candidatos, la mayor parte de la atención se ha prestado a la batalla entre Katz, que cuenta con un apoyo significativo de sus colegas electos y los principales sindicatos, y Cabán, una defensora pública de 31 años que ha montado una ola de apoyo de votantes progresista, con respaldos de la representante Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez y The New York Times .
También en la carrera están Gregory Lasak , un ex juez, y los abogados Mina Malik, Betty Lugo y José Nieves.
El concejal Rory Lancman se retiró de la elección, pero permanece en la boleta electoral.
Las urnas cerraron a las 9 p.m., y estamos actualizando esta publicación con los últimos resultados no oficiales de la Junta de Elecciones de la Ciudad de Nueva York.
Tiffany Cabán: 39.39%
Melinda Katz: 38.5%

Texto completo: The City Council came down on the Taxi and Limousine Commission Monday after one lawmaker located a formal warning that medallion loans may leave countless drivers mired in debt.
City Councilman Ritchie Torres began the Council's oversight hearing into the extreme taxi medallion loan speculation by announcing that his office obtained the findings of a report - given to the TLC in 2011 - that looked into medallion prices and the loans used by drivers to purchase them at auctions during the late 90s and 2000s. Analyst Gary Roth predicted that more medallion owners would experience ballooning payments greater than the value of the medallion's original price and that medallion value would depreciate. 
"In this case, owners may default on their loan, and have the medallion repossessed by the bank. If there were large number of repossessions, it could cause the major financers to go into default, and put a damper on sales," the memo read. 
Acting TLC Commissioner Bill Heinzen testified Monday that he and other TLC administrators had not read the Roth report until last week. It was first reported by The New York Times last month. He repeatedly said he could not speak for former administrators or their actions and noted that the scope of the agency's jurisdiction is limited when it comes to loans.
"TLC licenses and regulates medallion owners, but it does not regulate the lending industry, including banks and credit unions who wrote, refinanced and hold medallion loans," Heinzen said. 
Torres, however, called Heinzen's reasoning weak, especially since the TLC has had a copy of the report since 2011 and continued to promote medallion auctions to the public up until 2014. 
"The city has the same perverse incentives as the predatory loaners and speculators. They are willing to destabilize the market to generate short-term revenue," he said.
Taxi drivers and advocates have been reporting that an increasing number of cabbies have experienced financial ruin over lower revenues and increasing costs, especially related to medallion loan payments. Bhairavi Desai, the president of the New York Taxi Alliance, which represents drivers in the city, estimated that the average net income for a driver last year was a negative $24,904.
Several drivers have committed suicide and others are working more hours just to stay afloat, she testified.
"Every single person in the city of New York should feel great shame when you look into that taxi and it's a man or woman in their late 60s or 70s. That is unbelievable, because their retirement was stolen," Desai testified. 
Mouhamadou Aliyu, a driver who bought his medallion with a loan at a 2004 auction, gave emotional testimony in which he revealed he has thought about suicide because of his mounting debt but has continued to drive to support his wife and four children. 
"I'm doing everything for them, and today everything is being taking away from me. I don't understand what is going on in this city," he said. 
Heinzen apologized for TLC's role in the medallion mortgage crisis. He said the agency is providing mental health services through the city's Thrive NYC initiative and has worked with the city to reduce fees and regulations to help drivers. 
"We do hear it, it does affect us very deeply. All of these stories, and the pain that the families are feeling ... it is devastating, it can be overwhelming," he said. 
Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the TLC and Department of Consumer Affairs to investigate predatory practices behind taxi medallion purchases and their results are scheduled to be made public next month. 
The council is also reviewing four bills aimed at giving the TLC new requirements and resources to curb the loan crisis and provide drivers with relief.
One would require the TLC to receive annual financial disclosures that include all revenue, expenses and debt from all drivers while another would require the agency to review all documents related to medallion loans.
Another bill would require the TLC to review taxi brokers, agents and licensees for any misconduct and gives the agency the power to revoke the licenses if there is any fraud. The fourth bill would set up an "office of financial stability," which would issue annual re

Texto completo: MCALLEN, Tex. -- The bodies of what appeared to be a migrant woman in her 20s and three children -- two infants and a toddler -- were found Sunday night near the edge of the Rio Grande outside the South Texas city of McAllen, the authorities said.
Migrant deaths happen with grim regularity along parts of America's southwestern border, largely when adults and unaccompanied teenagers succumb to harsh desert conditions or a lack of water, and die of dehydration, heat stroke or hypothermia. The discovery on Sunday was unusual -- it is rare for officials to discover dead migrant children on the American side of the border, and rarer still for the bodies of three children to be found together.
"Most of the time, we usually find either adults or teenagers, but this is the first time we've actually found infants and toddlers, and it is pretty shocking for us," said the Hidalgo County sheriff, J.E. Guerra, who broke the news of the discovery on Twitter late Sunday night.
Officials said there were as yet no signs of foul play, and that the four may have died from dehydration and heat exposure. The bodies appeared to be those of undocumented immigrants, but neither their identities nor their country of origin had been determined on Monday.
Migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have crossed the border by the thousands in recent months, overwhelming Border Patrol agents, nonprofit groups and local officials.
The four bodies were found by Border Patrol agents across the river from Reynosa, Mexico, in an area on the United States side of the border that is heavily traveled by Central American families. They were in a brush-covered region southeast of Anzalduas Park on federal property managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, near the state-run Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area, officials said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was leading the investigation because the bodies were found on federal land.
[Death on the Rio Grande: President Trump's immigration clampdown has pushed migrants toward perilous r iver crossings .]
"It's an incredibly heart breaking situation, which seems to happen far too often," Special Agent Michelle Lee, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in San Antonio, said in a statement.
Early Monday morning, Anzalduas Park was quiet. The only noises were chirping birds and a slight ripple from the river, aside from the occasional Border Patrol truck or county constable vehicle driving by. The park -- a 96-acre recreation area with picnic tables, playgrounds and a boat dock that is about six miles from downtown McAllen -- has been a popular backdrop for visiting officials from Washington. President Trump passed through earlier this year during his only visit to the Texas-Mexico border as president.
The area near the park along the Rio Grande has been a migrant-crossing hub in Hidalgo County. Migrant families with children cross the river here in small or large groups on makeshift rafts, and then walk inland in search of Border Patrol agents so they can turn themselves in.
Migrant deaths are more common far north of the river's edge, on private ranchland deeper into South Texas. In those areas, water is harder to find, the terrain is more isolated and expansive, and migrants often hike for days ill-prepared for the journey.
It was unclear what went wrong for the woman and children whose bodies were found: whether they had gotten lost in the brush in the heat, whether they were already ill when they crossed the river, whether they were abandoned by smugglers or other migrants. Sheriff Guerra said they were found in a makeshift staging area, a clearing near the river where groups of migrants often gather after they cross the river. From there, they typically walk deeper into the countryside to look for federal agents.
South Texas is always hot in June, but the heat has been extreme in recent days.
On Monday, the National Weather Service issued a "dangerous" heat advisory for the Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas, which includes McAllen. "Heat-related illnesses will likely occur for anyone working or playing outdoors for extended periods of time today," the advisory said.
Over the last week in the valley, temperatures have regularly approached or exceeded 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Last Wednesday, the temperature hit 108 degrees.
The Rio Grande Valley is the busiest Border Patrol sector for migrant apprehensions on the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico.
In May, a total of 132,887 migrant adults and children were apprehended between ports of entry on the entire southern border, an increase from 99,304 in April, according to Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency. Earlier this month, agents in the Rio Grande Valley sector apprehended more than 4,100 migrants in just three days.
On this stretch of the river, Border Patrol agents have routinely seen children in distress. In April, agents at the Fort Brown station near Brownsville found a 3-year-old boy alone in a cornfield, with his name and a phone number written on his shoes. He was crying but was in good condition. The boy was from Mexico and had been abandoned by smugglers.
One hot afternoon earlier in April, when New York Times journalists accompanied the Border Patrol to a wooded area a few miles from where the four bodies were found Sunday night, a group of nearly 20 migrants from Central America crossed the Rio Grande and turned themselves in to the border agents. The migrants were exhausted and thirsty; some children among them were coughing and had colds and fevers. There were signs on the ground that other children had crossed the border there before them: diapers, children's T-shirts and an empty infant's bottle.
The agents walked the migrants along a dirt road to an area where the Border Patrol was processing and transporting other migrants. A 4-year-old girl from Honduras who had a fever held her mother's hand and struggled to keep up. One of the agents escorting the group, Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Marcelino A. Medina, lifted the girl and carried her in his arms, with her head shielded from the sun beneath a shirt.
"She fell asleep as soon as I picked her up," Mr. Medina said as the girl rested her head on his shoulder. "It's not ideal temperatures. It's not ideal humidity for little kids to be walking in."

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
For at least a year, federal officials and technology companies had been warning of the so-called GPS rollover, a once-in-20-year event that had the potential to wreak havoc on computer networks around the world.
The simple remedy involved some necessary upgrades.
Yet somehow, New York City's technology managers were caught completely off guard, and did nothing to prepare for the calendar reset of the centralized Global Positioning System.
As a result, a wireless network used by city agencies crashed in April, crippling many services that relied on it, including some Police Department license plate readers and a system to remotely control traffic lights. It took 10 days to get the network running again.
Officials at several city agencies, including the Police Department and the Office of Emergency Management, knew about the rollover, according to a report released by the city on Friday.
But officials at the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoiTT), which was responsible for operating the wireless network, claimed "that they were not aware" of the rollover before it occurred, the report said.
After the network went down, confusion, poor communication and a lack of coordination hampered attempts to get it working again, according to the report, which was compiled by the consulting firm Gartner at a cost of $ 300,000.
A week before the report's release, the DoiTT commissioner, Samir Saini, resigned. Mayor Bill de Blasio said that Mr. Saini wanted to return to the private sector, and disputed the notion that his departure was connected to the failure.
The report did not name any of the people who were responsible for the missteps, and the city has not publicly disciplined anyone in relation to the incident.
Nonetheless, the report, with its revelations of poor preparation and the chaotic response, could be embarrassing for Mr. de Blasio, who is running for president and has argued that his experience managing the nation's largest city makes him more qualified than other candidates.
On the day the wireless network crashed, Mr. de Blasio was in Nevada, an early primary state, as he considered whether to declare his candidacy for president. City Hall initially tried to hide the shutdown. It made no public acknowledgment of the problem and, in response to questions from The New York Times, officials initially characterized it as a routine maintenance issue.
The report does not indicate when Mr. de Blasio was told of the problem or whether he was informed of the confusion surrounding the attempts to get it working again.
In a statement accompanying the report's release, Laura Anglin, the deputy mayor for operations, who also oversees the information technology department, asserted that "there were no interruptions to city services during the NYCWiN outage," but acknowledged that "it is critical we learn from this event."
Ms. Anglin's statement, however, is directly contradicted by the report, which details several service interruptions. About half of the city-operated signs showing arrival times at bus stops were disabled, as were about 200 cameras that provide online images of traffic conditions; many other tasks handled by the network were knocked offline, requiring city workers to be reassigned to perform the tasks manually.
The report made it clear the episode could easily have been avoided. The wireless network, like many other computerized systems, uses GPS data to keep track of time. The GPS rollover was widely known, and government and industry notices encouraged technology managers to upgrade systems to avoid possible interruptions.
The report's authors interviewed eight top officials at the information technology department, including Mr. Saini. But the report said that no one at the agency admitted being aware of the approaching rollover. It does not say whether it considered those denials to be credible, given the amount of publicity related to the rollover in the technology industry.
Mr. Saini was hired just a year and a half ago by the mayor and was involved, among other key initiatives, in the modernization of the 911 system. Attempts to reach Mr. Saini were unsuccessful.
According to the report, the system could easily have been upgraded by replacing what is known as the firmware in the dozens of nodes, or antennas, that make up the network.
Northrop Grumman, the contractor that maintains and operates the network at a cost to taxpayers of $ 37 million a year, also did not alert city officials to the need for an upgrade, the report said.
"Northrop Grumman worked expeditiously" with city officials "to address the GPS rollover event," said a company spokesman, Tim Paynter, in an emailed statement. Mr. Paynter did not respond to questions about whether Northrop informed the city of the need for upgrades ahead of the rollover.
Many passages in the 35-page report were blacked out, which city officials said was done for security reasons.
The wireless network was built for about $ 500 million and has been in use since 2008. But today it is used by only about 10 city agencies. The city plans to shut it down in the coming years and shift its wireless needs to commercial carriers, which it says will save money.
But the city has been slow to carry out plans for such a transition. The report recommended that New York review its technology infrastructure and warned that the city "may be exposed to more risk than necessary regarding technology-related incidents."

UK judge rules that woman must abort her baby

Texto completo: A British court has mandated that a mentally disabled London woman must terminate her pregnancy. The decision came late last week as the woman entered her 22ndweek of pregnancy, as first reported by the Catholic News Agency. Justice Nathalie Lieven of the UK Court of Protection authorized doctors to perform an abortion on the woman despite her own objections and the objections of her mother. The woman's mother, a former midwife who is originally from Nigeria, insisted that she was able to care for the baby herself, in light of her daughter's mental disability.
Lieven said of her ruling, "I am acutely conscious of the fact that for the State to order a woman to have a termination where it appears that she doesn't want it is an immense intrusion ... I have to operate in [her] best interests, not on society's views of termination."
The U.K. Court of Protection was created as part of the Mental Capacity Act of 2005 and is meant to make decisions on personal affairs of people considered by the court to be unable to do so themselves. Although the woman has not been identified, a spokesperson for the court confirmed that she was in her twenties and is currently under the National Health Service's trust. The National Health Service requested the court intervene to give them permission to perform the abortion. A council-appointed social worker also sought the court's decision to force the woman to have an abortion.
Commenting on the diminished mental capacity of the woman in question, Lieven explained that although the woman did not want to end her pregnancy, she didn't feel that the woman would understand what it truly meant to have a baby, saying, "I think she would like to have a baby in the same way she would like to have a nice doll." The Justice then suggested that the trauma of giving birth to the child and then having it removed to foster care would cause greater psychological damage than the forced abortion because, as she stated, "It would at that stage be a real baby." The court spokesperson confirmed details of the case and Justice Leiven's quotes to the New York Times.
Leiven further rejected the notion that the woman's mother would be able to care for an infant while also providing care for her adult daughter. Abortion in the U.K. is legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. After that time, only instances of strong evidence suggesting that the baby is severely disabled would permit an abortion. It is not yet clear whether the woman or her mother will have the opportunity to appeal the court's decision. Lawyers for the women have not been reached for comment.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed back Monday against criticism of the Trump administration's immigration deal with Mexico, calling it a "significant win" for the U. S. He disputed reports that Mexico had already agreed to most of the provisions months ago, before last week's frenzied negotiations.
Pompeo also repeated President Donald Trump's claim that there are other undisclosed elements of the agreement, but he declined to provide any specifics.
"There were a number of commitments made. I can’t go into them in detail here," Pompeo told reporters in a hastily announced news conference Monday.
Mexico's foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said on Monday that there were no additional elements of the agreement.
Asked specifically about Trump's assertion that Mexico had agreed to buy more U. S. agricultural products, Ebrard responded: “There is no agreement of any kind that hasn’t been made known. Everything I am saying was made known Friday. "
In that 468-word deal announced Friday, Mexico agreed to increase security along its southern border with Guatemala, where many Central Americans are crossing into Mexico on their way to the U. S. Pompeo said Mexican officials promised to send 6,000 National Guard troops to stop those crossings, the largest such deployment.
Mexico also agreed to expand a U. S. policy in which migrants seeking asylum in the U. S. will be sent back to Mexico to wait for their claims to be adjudicated, a process that can take months.
"I’ve seen some reporting that says that these countless hours were nothing, that they amounted to a waste of time," Pompeo said in remarks at the State Department.
The New York Times reported Saturday that Mexico had already agreed to most of the provisions outlined in Friday's deal during previous rounds of negotiations. The news organization said, for example, that Mexico promised in December to let the U. S. deport more asylum-seekers back to Mexico until their asylum claims were adjudicated.
Pompeo sharply rejected that report.
"The scale, the effort, the commitment here is very different from what we were able to achieve back in December," he said. Friday's deal "wouldn’t have happened" if Trump hadn't threatened to impose an escalating series of tariffs on all Mexican imports, he said.
Trump said on May 30 that he would impose a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods, starting June 10, unless the Mexican government stopped the flow of migrants to the U. S. border. Trump said he would increase those levies 5 percentage points each month, until they hit 25%.
"It’s what prompted this series of conversations," Pompeo said of Trump's tariff threat.
Critics have said Trump created a crisis with the threatened tariffs and then "solved" it by signing off on a relatively modest agreement.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York called the deal “nothing more than warmed up leftovers. ”
“The president claims a bogus agreement with Mexico, which contains policies that Mexico volunteered to do months ago,” Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor Monday.
But Pompeo said Friday's deal was "diplomacy at its finest. "
He said the U. S. had been sending about 200 asylum-seeks a day back to Mexico and under the new deal, the U. S. could send back "thousands" every day.
"We now have the capacity to do this full throttle … in a way that will make a fundamental difference in the calculus" for migrants hoping to come to the U. S. , he said.
The Trump administration had initially demanded that Mexico agree to be designated as a safe third-party country, which would have meant accepting asylum applications from thousands of Central American migrants.
Ebrard said Mexico rejected that. He did say the U. S. would re-evaluate the migration situation after 45 days, and they might hold broader talks with other countries to negotiate asylum policies across the region.

Texto completo: The Great Firewall of China—Beijing’s AI-powered website blocker, used to shut down Western media penetration—is spelling an end to the era of globalization. While digital tech encompasses the world, the East and the West have hardened into two separate spheres. There is no looking back.
Through the Great Firewall, China’s leadership has turned off nearly every major English-language news outlet, from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on down. The Washington Post and the Guardian, two of the last survivors, were zeroed our in time for the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Social media has not been spared. All the big US platforms and services, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are access denied; group chat applications like WhatsApp are firmly out of reach.
Companies including Google have struggled, sometimes secretly, to figure out how to get back into the Chinese market, even if it means working on much cozier or even riskier terms with the country’s military than Americans—and their own workers—are ready to tolerate. The dream of one globally integrated world, networks and ultimately controlled by the masters of the internet, dies hard.
But it has died. Nowhere is the digital divide between East and West sharper than it is where Hong Kong stops and the rest of China begins. Rebellion against a draconian extradition law that would see Hong Kong residents spirited away to the mainland for punishment made national Western headlines, with huge crowds spilling into the streets—and voluntarily shutting down their own online activity to frustrate or defeat Chinese monitoring.
That’s a long way from the days of the Arab Spring, when autocratic regimes put their internets on lockdown to stop protests from mobilizing into more serious political opposition. Today, governments have learned how to reassert sovereignty over their digital domains—not just how to pull the plug.
But for China the two are hardly mutually exclusive. The goal is no Western media, just as Western religion, which is seen to breed rampant heresy, instability, and factionalism, is being all but expunged from the country. China’s digital plan is to remoralize its billion-plus population before venality and vice wrecks civil society.
That’s frighteningly Orwellian to the West. In China, by contrast, the Orwellian imagination is unwelcome: both the fear of servility and the fear of mastery at the heart of 1984. Technological times have changed since Orwell’s day—digital rule is about the triumph of machine memory, not of Big Brother’s compulsory fantasies—but in the West, the dystopian vision endures. In China, no such millennia-old tradition of the slavery-and-mastery morality play exists.
It’s not that the Chinese can have no appreciation for freedom, of course; it’s that their experience with digital will simply not shape them and be shaped by them in the same way as we in the West will ours.
That alone marks a harsh lesson for Western elites. Those clinging bitterly to certitudes that more modernization, more money, or more engagement will eventually bring down the autocratic regime in favor of Western-style democracy are indulging in a fantasy every bit as dangerous as 2 + 2 = 5.
In technology, leading Westerners are beside themselves to see Chinese researchers and companies being squeezed out from American positions. But China has so penetrated strategic American tech and science that it would be negligent at best not to do so.
In academia, leading Westerners fear that the loss of lucrative Chinese students and access to brilliant Chinese graduate students will gobble America’s development of next-generation tools and patents. But the West has grown too lazy and comfortable leaning on outside talent while home-grown students become over-credentialed and under-employable ingrates with a resentful sense of entitlement and little game plan for the future.
And in entertainment media, leading Westerners have grown similarly dependent on “international”—read Chinese—audiences to prop up box office numbers, make movies marketable and produceable, and sustain the illusion that Hollywood and its power brokers hold real cultural authority in America and beyond. But the reality of a contracting and consolidating industry with little to say about life besides formulaic and narrow-cast cultural politics is inescapable.
The message China has sent the West’s elite, in other words, is painfully simple: you need us more than we need you. And the West agrees. It is Western elites, not Chinese ones, who are still hung up on the utopian dream of creating one harmonious and standardized world. China’s bid for international power hinges on its domestic priorities of preventing chaos, civil strife, and the collapse of its sovereignty; if Beijing thought it could lock its power in and fully establish state morality through the populace without a hugely risky intercontinental economic and infrastructure program, it likely would have gone in that direction. It didn’t.
And the West? It harbors three leading assets over the Chinese: its media apparatus, its military capability, and its financial power. Of these, the first has effectively been neutralized in China. The third is holding steady, but the second is showing cracks in its mystique. If China can use technology to make its absolute sovereign control over its culture and morality complete, it will consider itself to have the upper hand.
And if the West continues to fragment into weak and Balkanized camps dominated by bureaucratic revolutionaries at odds with their country’s histories and cultures, and ultimately their own countrymen, the Chinese will be right.

The 10% bonus that Trump needs

Texto completo: True, polls have very limited value at this stage of a presidential campaign. Yes, Democrats are far from choosing their nominee to oppose President Donald Trump. Of course, a great deal can change between now and Election Day.
Or maybe not.
Since Trump’s victory, the political balance has remained remarkably stable, and that’s both good and bad news for a president who formally launched his re-election campaign this week with a raucous rally in Florida.
On the plus side for Trump, his base shows no signs of cracking. When the president mused on Twitter recently that his supporters "would demand" he stay in office after eight years — a totally unconstitutional idea — he was accurately reflecting their unswerving devotion. "To too many people, he’s not a human being. He’s a demigod," said conservative radio host Michael Savage to The New York Times.
But the downside of this frozen landscape is equally obvious. Trump’s core base of support hovers between 35% and 37% of the electorate, and despite their fervid loyalty, that base is simply not large enough to guarantee him a second term. Trump won 46.4% of the vote in 2016, and he needs at least a 10% margin above and beyond his base — call it the 10% bonus — to have a realistic chance at a second term.
Recent polls clearly reveal the president’s peril. Two surveys in Michigan, one of three states that gave Trump his margin of victory in 2016, show Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by double digits. In Pennsylvania, a Quinnipiac poll had Biden beating Trump by 11 points. A national survey conducted by Fox News put Biden ahead by a similar margin.
An average of all national polls puts Trump’s favorable rating at 43.3%. As Peter Baker points out in The Times, "He is the only president in the history of polling who has never once, not for a single day, earned the support of a majority of Americans surveyed by Gallup."
Trump’s real base is actually even smaller. In 2016, only 38% of voters told exit polls he was qualified to be president, 35% said he had the proper temperament, and 33% described him as honest and trustworthy.
The president enters the race with many strengths. The unemployment rate of 3.6% in May was the lowest in 50 years, and in the latest CNN poll, 56% approved of his economic policies, a new high. Trump, who never really stopped campaigning, enjoys a huge lead over the Democrats in building a national organization and raising money. Above all, the Democrats are far from producing a candidate who can generate the sort of energy and excitement that powered the campaigns of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the only successful Democrats in more than 40 years.
For all the turmoil generated by the Trump presidency, not much has changed politically since his election. His base remains just about the same. He won in 2016 because about 1 in 10 voters who were not part of that base, and who had serious doubts about his character and qualifications, disliked Hillary Clinton enough to vote for him anyway. Can Trump win over that 10% again? The election could well hinge on the answer.

Texto completo: FLEISHMAN IS IN TROUBLE, by Taffy Brodesser-Akner. Random House, 374 pp., $27.
Yes, Toby Fleishman is in trouble. He's a 41-year-old MD with a specialty in liver diseases and a position at a leading Manhattan hospital, and father of an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. That's all good. But he's also saddled with a wife that earlier eras would have dismissed as a shrew, but we would condemn with a coarser term.
After 15 years of marriage, Toby has had enough of Rachel. He's divorcing this high-powered theatrical agent who leads her own agency and mocks him as not ambitious enough. He's tired of her materialism, her yearning to social climb among Upper East Side one-percenters, her angry outbursts, her excuses for neglecting their children.
Because the author of this first novel is a woman, Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, we expect it to evolve into a he said-she said saga, with both sides getting their say. After all of Toby's bitching and moaning, won't Rachel out him for the ungrateful hypocrite he is? That's not exactly what happens in "Fleishman Is in Trouble."
The author does cast a satiric and sometimes amusing eye on both the frantic race for status among Rachel and her women friends and the feverish pursuit of sex among newly unencumbered men like Toby. For Rachel, nothing beats the pricey school, penthouse and Hamptons beach house for demonstrating your worth in the world. For Toby, never mind that he's only 5-foot-5 and not especially handsome, internet meet-ups promise an endless orgy of phone sex and sexting.
But he's quickly made aware of a downside: "You don't even have to leave your house to be humiliated."
In between these warring soon-to-be exes, Brodesser-Akner places two of Toby's friends from his college days. Seth, the womanizing finance guy, never expects to marry. Elizabeth has given up a magazine career to be a suburban wife and mother. Neither is especially happy. It's as if whatever choices they make, they'll inevitably be covered in regret.
The author effectively contrasts her anxious, status-seeking high flyers with the mensch in their midst. Toby Fleishman is a genuinely good doctor and father.
Toward his patients, he is attentive and kind. He reminds his interns to listen to them and their family members. Patients are real people, not just cases.
On the home front, Toby treats his children with the same respect, even when sulky, prepubescent Hannah seems like a junior version of her mother. Solly, gentle and curious about everything, is cast in his father's mold. Rachel is the rainmaker working late hours, Toby the childminder when the nanny is absent. He could not imagine a life without these kids.
Toby moves to another apartment. One day, Rachel doesn't show up to take her turn with the kids, as they've agreed. A day stretches to three weeks, and Rachel can't be reached by any means. Toby is furious, their children are worried.
Restless in her own marriage, Elizabeth needs a friendly ear as much as Toby does. So these old friends renew a warm and confiding relationship, at least until she runs into a disheveled and out-of-sorts Rachel at a coffee shop.
Rachel herself never does narrate her story, but as it's refracted through Elizabeth's eyes, we begin to glimpse another side of a marriage gone sour. If only a miserable childhood and sexist obstacles in the workplace were enough to make us care more about this woman. She's unable to appreciate Toby, and any devotion for her children is only expressed in efforts to elevate their status.
Never mind that Elizabeth's encounter with Rachel reactivates her conviction that equality between the sexes remains a distant goal. Never mind that she's tired of wives having to "tiptoe around the fragility of a man."
For this reader at least, it's too late. Brodesser-Akner has been utterly successful at creating a monster. And she's created a male protagonist who goes the extra mile to do the right thing. He may be a fool with regard to sex, but he's no knave. That said, female readers may disagree.
This is a book shot through with the pain of divorce, the droll weirdness of our sexual drives, the inanities of people with too much money, and the bewilderment of the young looking on as adults carry on like children.
If the author had condensed her prose a bit instead of engaging in endless riffs that merely repeat a thought, "Fleishman Is in Trouble" would be even better.

Texto completo: A presentation by New York Times best-selling author and Pittsburgh area native Marie Benedict will kick off Peters Township Public Library's second annual Read Local/Eat Local event this weekend.
The event, which brings together local authors and area food trucks for a day of reading and eating, will be from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. June 22 at the library. Ms. Benedict's presentation is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m., followed by a book signing.
Ms. Benedict, who hails from the South Hills, said the topic for the presentation likely will be her latest book, "The Only Woman in the Room," which was chosen as a national Barnes&Noble Book Club pick and was a New York Times bestseller.
The story is about film star Hedy Lamarr, whose career spanned from the 1930s to the late 1980s. Far away from the Hollywood scene, Ms. Lamarr's technological creation more than 75 years ago served as the foundation for Wi-Fi.
According to the official Hedy Lamarr website, at the start of World War II, Ms. Lamarr along with composer George Anthiel developed a radio guidance system called "frequency hopping" that solved the problem of enemies trying to block signals from radio-controlled missiles.
The technology involved changing radio frequencies to prevent enemies from being able to detect the messages.
Basic principles of their work were incorporated into bluetooth technology and are similar to those methods used in the first versions of Wi-Fi. Ms. Lamarr and Mr. Anthiel were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.
"It shares the astonishing narrative of a young Jewish woman in 1930s Vienna, married to Austria's richest man, an arms dealer to Mussolini and then Hitler, who escapes to the Hollywood film world, but desirous of striking out against the Nazis, invents a groundbreaking weapons system - if only the Navy would use an invention made by a woman," Ms. Benedict writes in her book.
The author also will have a question-and-answer period during her presentation. Ms. Bendict said she would be happy to discuss any of her books. She also has authored "The Other Einstein" and "Carnegie's Maid."
She said she used the city of Pittsburgh for inspiration for "Carnegie's Maid," in which she uses historical Pittsburgh and her ancestors' experiences as Irish immigrants in the 1800s.
She currently is working on a book titled "Lady Clementine," which focuses on Winston Churchill's wife. It is to be released in January 2020.
Registration is required to attend Ms. Benedict's presentation, and seating is limited. Call the library at 724-941-9430 to register to attend. Registration is not required to attend the rest of the event.
Local authors attending Read Local/Eat Local are: Audrey Abbott, Elizabeth Babcock, Chuck Beard, Brian Butko, Mike Buzzelli, Jamie Beth Cohen, Carrie DiRisio, Angele Ellis, David Finoli, Ellen Goodlett, Melanie Linn Gutowski, Ben Gwin, Peter Hayers, Tom Imerito, Lori Jakiela, Quelcy Kogel, J. Judson Lacko, Joe Moore, Jaqui Phillips, Leah Pileggi, Chad and George Shannon and Bob Walicki.

Texto completo: Question: Can you tell me the approximate value of old newspapers and magazines? I have the full copy of the New York Times newspaper from April 15, 1865, with the headline "Awful Event, President Lincoln Shot by an Assassin," as well as a newspaper of Kennedy's assassination. I also have old Playboy magazines from the 1950s-'70s.
Answer: Old newspapers covering major events, like the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, the sinking of the Titanic, the San Francisco earthquake and other major catastrophes, sell for the highest prices.
The front page of the April 15, 1865, New York Times sold at auction for $450 last year. A copy of the same issue, with eight pages, sold for $1,200 three years ago. Most Playboy magazines sell for only a couple of dollars. A collection of 30 magazines sold for $76. But beware, many copies have been made of the famous newspapers. Old newspapers yellow and fall apart unless properly stored.
Q: I am trying to find out what my silver tray is worth. It is oval and has a rope twist rim. There is a mark on the bottom with a three-leaf stem, a crown and a standing lion over two more lions and a star. The mark also has old-English-looking letters: EBM & S.
A: The letters on your tray are actually EGW & S, which stand for E.G. Webster & Son of New York City and Brooklyn. The Elizur G. Webster firm started in New York City in 1860. In 1864, Webster partnered with William Dupree and the firm became Webster & Dupree.
After a few changes in partnerships with William Dupree and Webster's brother Adelbert Webster, E.G. partnered with his son Fred H. Webster in 1886, and the firm became E.G. Webster & Son. E.G. died in 1900. His son continued the business until 1928, when it was sold to International Silver Co. In 1981, it was sold to Oneida. Your tray is silver plate and the pattern is No. 210. The mark dates it from 1886 to 1928.
Medium-size silver-plated serving trays in good condition are worth $35 to $50.
Q: I have an antique buffet that I bought 30 years ago at an antiques shop in Florida. It has two long drawers and two cupboards with interior shelves. There is a paper label that says "Fulton Street at Hoyt, Abraham & Straus, Brooklyn" and "No. 445-1" is burned into the wood. I'd like to know more about the buffet and its value.
A: Abraham & Straus started in 1865 as Wechsler & Straus. The name became Abraham & Straus in 1893 after the Straus family bought out Weschler. It became part of Federated Department Stores in 1900. The name Abraham and Straus continued to be used until 1995.
The number is probably the model number. Your buffet was made in the first half of the 20th century. Many reproductions of earlier styles of furniture were made before 1960. A buffet would sell for about $750-$1,000 depending on style and condition.
Q: Is there any value to an old box of phonograph needles? I have an unopened tin that contains 200 needles. It says "Columbia medium tone needles" on the lid. It says "Brilliant" above that and "Use each needle once only" below. It's yellow with brown and white and has music notes on either side of the writing.
A: Tin phonograph needle cases appeal to people who collect phonographs, music memorabilia or advertising items. The tins are very small, about 2 inches across, and often have attractive graphic designs lithographed on the top and sides. Your tin is from the 1920s and sells online for about $15. The unused needles are also wanted by those who play their old records.
Tip: To get rid of smoke smell, try boiling an onion for an hour or two. Make sure there is enough water so it stays covered while boiling.

Texto completo: Family secrets, every family has them. But should your estate plan be one of those secrets?
In my law practice, I am often asked by parents if they should provide a copy of their estate planning documents to their adult child(ren), or at least discuss the plan with them. And the typical lawyer answer I give is “it depends.” And it does.
It depends on the ages of those folks; whether you’re likely to make significant changes in the future; if there is anything unusual in your plan; whether anyone is being disinherited or inheriting less than what they might expect; and your relationship with the heirs and beneficiaries in general.
There are, however, some general rules.
What not to keep secret
Someone besides you (and your spouse, if applicable) should know where your documents are stored.
By the time your will, trust, health care directive, or power of attorney is needed, you are either deceased or incapacitated, so you won’t be available to hand over keys or combinations or directions to your secret storage spot.
Generally, it’s not a good idea to keep your documents in a bank safe deposit box either — access to these is notoriously difficult and they can’t be reached as quickly as may be needed in an emergency.
Your heirs and beneficiaries should know which attorney drafted your documents and how to reach them.
It’s a good idea to inform your heirs who you’ve put in charge when you’re gone. The trustee of your trust will have immediate duties and responsibilities. It’s good for them to be aware of their role ahead of time so they are prepared and willing to act.
The job of trustee is a big one — it’s not necessarily an “honor.” Thus, let them all know whom you’ve selected and why. You might find out the person you chose doesn’t want to serve, or the others object to that choice for very valid reasons.
I once had a client choose one child as trustee because the other four children “liked” that child. But during the family meeting to review the plan with all the children, it became clear that while they may have liked that child, they did not respect him. We could all see he wasn’t likely to act fairly either. Luckily, it was also apparent there was one child they all did respect. We made the change immediately.
If you are disinheriting a child or leaving one child less than the others, it’s generally a good idea to make that known ahead of time as well as your reasons for doing so. If you aren’t comfortable telling that child directly, let your attorney and your other children, and perhaps a trusted friend or adviser, know your reasons for the disinheritance. You may be able to avoid a costly fight later.
Secrets you might keep
You may want to keep the dispositive provisions of your estate plan (i.e. who gets what and when) confidential. Your children don’t need to know if you’ve left a charitable gift in addition to what you’ve left them, or how much you have, or that you’ve left the grandchildren something as well. Those things often change over time.
If you’re concerned about the spending habits of the spouse of one of your children, or the possibility of a child divorcing, you can arrange for that child’s share to be held in trust to maintain its separate property status (in California). That might be awkward to bring up at a family dinner, so you don’t have to go into details. You can simply let your child know you’ve provided for them in a trust that will give them creditor protection. (“Creditor” includes future ex-spouses, but doesn’t “creditor protection” sound so much nicer?).
Your list of assets and liabilities isn’t something anyone needs to know currently. But there should be a list (often it’s attached to your trust) and contact information readily available so that the trustee or agent acting under a power of attorney can spring into action when needed.
Many times I’ve seen family members struggle to find out where the bank accounts are, whether there was a mortgage on the house, and if there was any insurance, for weeks and months, which causes a delay in the entire administration process and unnecessary stress during an already stressful time.
Don’t take it to the grave
Finally, you’d be doing your family members a great favor if you talked about your wishes for end-of-life care and memorial services. It’s a difficult topic, but an important one. Talk about whether you want to be an organ donor, your desires for pain medication, life support and CPR.
If you prefer cremation or burial, let your loved ones know. The more plans you make on your own, including pre-paid burial arrangements, and share with your loved ones, the less their burden will be when they are grieving your loss. They’ll be able to focus on celebrating you and your life, your final gift to them.

Texto completo: Trump to appear on 'Meet the Press' for first time as president
President Donald Trump will be on NBC News' "Meet the Press" on Sunday for the first time as president. Chuck Todd, the news show's host, announced Friday via Twitter that he would be sitting down exclusively with Trump at the White House to discuss the latest tensions between the United States and Iran. During an excerpt of an interview, Trump said he does not want to go to war with Iran, but warned that there will be "obliteration like you've never seen before" if a conflict does arise. When asked if impeachment is good politics for the president, Trump said that if Democrats went through with proceedings, he would "win the election easier. " The full interview is slated to air Sunday in its entirety during the usual time slot for "Meet the Press" at 9 a. m. ET.
'Significant and impactful': The GI Bill turns 75
The GI Bill, which celebrates its 75th anniversary Saturday, was "one of the most significant and impactful pieces of legislation in American history" and it permanently changed higher education in this country, Cornell University Prof. Glenn Altschuler said. The bill was designed to help World War II veterans when they returned home and contained several features, which included severance payments and unemployment support for veterans. Arizona Sen. Ernest McFarland, who quietly carried the nickname "father of the GI Bill" because of the major role he played in shaping the legislation, helped add provisions for education and home loans, arguably the bill's most memorable and durable features. The legislation eventually breezed through Congress and President Franklin Roosevelt signed the final bill on June 22, 1944. Later, benefits were extended to Korean and then Vietnam War veterans and in 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Forever GI Bill, which eliminated the 15-year limit to use its benefits.
Immigrant advocates warn about arrest across the country
Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to target raids in 10 U. S. cities as early as Sunday, according to The New York Times and CNN, days after President Donald Trump announced that it would be the start of an effort to deport millions of people in the country illegally. Mark Morgan, ICE's acting director, said the agency would prioritize deportations of people who have criminal histories, but that no one should be exempt from enforcement. Even so, the process would involve clearing budget and logistical hurdles. ICE agents have been following orders, arresting undocumented immigrants who were showing up for their regular, annual check-ins at ICE offices. But the administration has struggled to deport all of those undocumented immigrants because of historic backlogs in immigration court and the administration’s decision to deploy ICE agents to the southern border to respond to the growing number of Central American asylum-seekers.
It's Cardi season at BET Awards
The (just-indicted) Cardi B is the one to beat at Sunday's 2019 BET Awards, at 8 p. m. ET on the network. With seven nominations in tow — including best female hip-hop artist, which she won last year — she has to defend her title from competition including new (Lizzo and Megan Thee Stallion) and old (Nicki Minaj and Remy Ma). Deceased rapper Nipsey Hussle is also up for a posthumous award, snagging a best male hip-hop artist nod. Those in the running also include J. Cole, Travis Scott, Meek Mill, 21 Savage and Drake, the latter of whom has the second-most nominations with five.
Round of 16 begins in Women's World Cup
After a thrilling opening two weeks of group stage action, the Women's World Cup enters the knockout rounds. The Round of 16 begins Saturday with Germany — one of the top remaining threats to the USWNT —playing Cameroon (11:30 a. m. ET) and Norway taking on Australia (3 p. m. ET). Tournament hosts France face off against Brazil in a heavyweight battle on Sunday at 3 p. m. ET. The United States plays its Round of 16 game Monday against Spain, an emerging power in women's soccer.

Black education declines

Texto completo: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio says that the city's specialized high schools have a diversity problem. He's joined by New York City Schools Chancellor Richard A. Carranza, educators, students and community leaders who want to fix the diversity problem. I bet you can easily guess what they will do to "improve" the racial mix of students (aka diversity). If you guessed they would propose eliminating the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test as the sole criterion for admissions, go to the head of the class. The Specialized High Schools Admissions Test is an examination that is administered to New York City's eighth- and ninth-grade students. By state law, it is used to determine admission to all but one of the city's nine specialized high schools.
It's taken as axiomatic that the relatively few blacks admitted to these high-powered schools is somehow tied to racial discrimination. In a June 2, 2018 "Chalkbeat" article, de Blasio writes: "The problem is clear. Eight of our most renowned high schools - including Stuyvesant High School, Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School - rely on a single, high-stakes exam. The Specialized High School Admissions Test isn't just flawed - it's a roadblock to justice, progress and academic excellence."
Let's look at a bit of history to raise some questions about the mayor's diversity hypothesis. Dr. Thomas Sowell provides some interesting statistics about Stuyvesant High School in his book "Wealth, Poverty and Politics." He reports that, "In 1938, the proportion of blacks attending Stuyvesant High School, a specialized school, was almost as high as the proportion of blacks in the population of New York City." Since then, it has spiraled downward. In 1979, blacks were 12.9% of students at Stuyvesant, falling to 4.8% in 1995. By 2012, The New York Times reported that blacks were 1.2% of the student body.
What explains the decline? None of the usual explanations for racial disparities make sense. In other words, would one want to argue that there was less racial discrimination in 1938? Or, argue that in 1938 the "legacy of slavery" had not taken effect whereby now it is in full bloom? Genetic or environmental arguments cannot explain why blacks of an earlier generation were able to meet the demanding mental test standards to get into an elite high school. Socioeconomic conditions for blacks have improved dramatically since 1938. The only other plausible reason for the decline in academic achievement is that there has been a change in black culture. It doesn't take much to reach this conclusion. Simply look at school behavior today versus yesteryear.
An Education Week article reported that in the 2015-16 school year, "5.8% of the nation's 3.8 million teachers were physically attacked by a student." The Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics show that in the 2011-12 academic year, there were a record 209,800 primary- and secondary-school teachers who reported being physically attacked by a student. Nationally, an average of 1,175 teachers and staff were physically attacked, including being knocked out, each day of that school year.
Here are questions that might be asked of de Blasio and others who want to "fix the diversity problem" at New York's specialized schools: What has the triumph of egalitarian and diversity principles done for the rest of New York's school system? Are their academic achievement scores better than students at New York's specialized schools? The most important question for black parents: What has been allowed to happen to cripple black academic excellence?

Texto completo: A new documentary, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed 88-year-old writer, digging into her personal history, showcasing how her work probes the interior lives of African Americans and highlighting the moments in her remarkable career that became touchstones.
Here are three things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.
1. She was castigated for not writing about white people In a 1973 review of "Sula," The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community – without including confrontation with whites. "Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life," wrote the critic.
In the documentary, Morrison addresses such claims. "I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people ... as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze," she says plainly. "I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books."
2. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali While promoting Ali's book "The Greatest: My Own Story," the two got off to a rocky start. "When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women," Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. "So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do.' And he would look up and recognize ... a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said," she chuckles.
3. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s "Navigating a white male world was not threatening; it wasn't even interesting," says Morrison candidly, recalling her first job as an editor. "I knew more than they did and I wasn't afraid to show it. You have to be a little tough and rely on yourself, and tell people 'no.'"
In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting more money when the raises were given out. "So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men.' He said. 'Yes, but.' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but.' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You."
She got the money.
Toni Morrison's life is explored in the new documentary "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am."

Texto completo: President Trump decided against carrying out a military strike against Iran that would kill approximately 150 people because he did not believe the response was "proportionate."
The U.S. military was prepared to strike several radar installations and missile sites in Iran in retaliation for Tehran shooting down a U.S. drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Trump said he decided against carrying out the planned strike, contradicting a Thursday New York Times report that said Trump ordered the attack, then abruptly reversed himself.
"Nothing is green-lighted until the very end because things change, right?" Trump said in an interview with NBC host Chuck Todd. "But we had something ready to go subject to my approval."
"They came and said, 'Sir, we are ready to go. We'd like your decision.' And I said, 'I want to know something before you go. How many people will be killed?'" Trump said, explaining what led him to scrap the planned attack. The U.S. military estimated that the attack would kill roughly 150 Iranians.
"I thought about it for a second and I said, 'You know what? They shot down an unmanned drone — plane, whatever you want to call it — and here we are sitting with 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead," Trump said. "I didn't like it. I didn't think it was proportionate."Tweet

Texto completo: One of the top prosecutors that was on ex-special counsel Robert Mueller’s team has a book deal to write about his time investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
Andrew Weissmann signed a deal with Random House to provide an insider's account of his time working for the special counsel, according to the New York Times. Weissmann is the first of Mueller’s team to sign such a deal.
It is unclear what, if any, new information Weissmann may reveal or how much detail he will give about the special counsel’s inner workings and his involvement in the investigation.
Weissmann follows several other former Justice Department officials in monetizing his experience in the Trump administration.
Former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy FBI Director Andrew G. McCabe wrote bestselling memoirs about their time in the administration and involvement in the Russia investigation. If the success of Comey and McCabe’s books are any indication, Weissmann stands to make a considerable amount off his own work.

Few NY endorsements

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio are low in the polls and lagging in donors, but also lacking when it comes to endorsements, particularly from their home-state politicos.
Gillibrand, three months into her official bid for the White House, so far has the endorsement of only one of the 21 House Democrats in New York's delegation, Rep. Carolyn Maloney of Manhattan.
De Blasio, newer to the race at one month into his candidacy, is endorsed by the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council and state Assemb. Rodneyse Bichotte of Brooklyn.
Meanwhile, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has voiced support for former Vice President Joe Biden.
And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he won't pick a preference because seven senators and de Blasio are in the running.
"I think the overwhelming view of most Democrats and even most independents is: Who's the best candidate to beat Donald Trump?" Schumer told Newsday. "And we have to let it play out. That's more important than geography right now."
By contrast, Sen. Cory Booker early in his bid secured the endorsements of New Jersey's governor, lieutenant governor, Senate president and General Assembly speaker as well as his state's other U.S. senator and all 11 Democratic House members.
Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also boast stronger home-state support from federal government colleagues and statewide elected officials.
Newsday reached out to four dozen prospective prominent Democratic endorsers in New York State, either directly or through their representatives. The pool included the federal elected officials, the statewide elected officials and 20 additional Democratic National Committee members, from former President Bill Clinton to key delegates in the private sector.
Among those who responded, the majority said they weren't ready to make an endorsement.
Some said they did not yet know if they would endorse at all.
Some said Gillibrand and de Blasio had not yet requested their endorsement.
Several cited the sheer size of the Democratic field, the multiple friends and colleagues they have in the mix and the fact that they hold party leadership positions as reasons for delaying their decision or staying neutral.
Like Schumer, some noted that their end goal was to unseat President Donald Trump with the right Democratic nominee.
"We're still looking at all the candidates," state Attorney General Letitia James said. "The bottom line is I want to beat President Trump. Period. End of discussion. Full stop."
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said he hasn't decided whether he'll make an endorsement because the primary includes six current or former House colleagues, two Congressional Black Caucus members and Gillibrand.
"So, at this point, I've decided just to let the process play itself out," Jeffries said. "I speak to whatever candidates reach out to me and will continue to do so."
Among New York's other Democratic House members, Rep. Thomas Suozzi of Glen Cove endorsed Biden and Reps. Kathleen Rice of Garden City and Sean Patrick Maloney of Hudson Valley endorsed former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, both calling him a friend.
Gillibrand, a former House member who has been in the Senate for 10 years, also has friends in the delegation but she doesn't yet have their endorsements.
Rep. Nydia Velazquez of Brooklyn said she hasn't made a decision. "But I'm listening," she added. "I'm listening to all of them."
Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester County told The New York Times in March that she was sitting out the primary. Lowey's spokeswoman didn't return Newsday's requests for comment.
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Gov. Kathy Hochul made the maximum allowable contribution to Gillibrand's bid but her spokeswoman said she has made no formal endorsement.
Gillibrand and de Blasio's teams said more endorsements are forthcoming.
De Blasio's campaign said that despite his short time in the race, "he already has more union endorsements than all but one candidate."
It cited support from local and national leaders, but did not respond to a request for elaboration. It may have been referencing endorsements by a South Carolina mayor and councilman and a statement by feminist icon Gloria Steinem that de Blasio was the "only male" candidate she'd support for president.
A Gillibrand aide said the campaign does not expect Gillibrand to be an establishment candidate and its strategy reflects that. The aide noted that the senator is endorsed not only by Maloney, but two key activists in Iowa, an activist and a state elected official in New Hampshire and a congressional candidate from Illinois.
A national party official from New York speaking on the condition of anonymity said neither candidate has generated much good will among fellow politicos in the state. Another official, also speaking anonymously, noted that Gillibrand and de Blasio rose to their posts more as individuals than as team players.
Others said it was still early in the 2020 election cycle and also said the candidates' standings in the primary may go hand-in-hand with endorsements.
Gillibrand and de Blasio each have been registering at 1 percent or lower in national polls. The senator struggled to secure the 65,000 unique donors necessary to meet the fundraising threshold set by the DNC to help qualify for the debates later this month. 
Both had expressed concerns that they wouldn't make it to the debate stage, but both qualified in the end. Gillibrand met both the polling and fundraising thresholds. De Blasio only met the polling threshold. The third New Yorker in the primary, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, also qualified for the debates.
"I think that each of these candidates before reaching out for endorsements has got to establish themselves as a possible, a genuinely possible, contender," said Jay Jacobs, state Democratic Party chairman and Nassau County party leader. "And then, I think they'll get the interest and attention in their own home state. And I think that's a good strategy."
DNC member Gerard Sweeney said endorsements would be "an indication of political support." He noted some politicians such as Gillibrand spend less time on the "political party side of things than on the government side of things."
Another DNC member, Charlie King, commended de Blasio on the hotel workers union nod, calling it "one of the more coveted endorsements in New York, if you're running in New York." But, King said, "it's not translating nationally."
Gerald Benjamin, a SUNY New Paltz professor, said state and county party leaders likely are following Cuomo's lead on endorsements. He noted the "adversarial relations" betwee

Who owns images from college's archives?

Texto completo: CAMBRIDGE — Under cover from a torrential downpour, two families came together on Harvard University's campus Thursday to demand that the institution turn over historical photographs of two slaves and reckon with its history of white supremacy.
Tamara Lanier, a Connecticut woman who sued Harvard in March, has said she's a descendant of Renty and his daughter Delia, two slaves who were forced in 1850 to pose naked for daguerreotypes, or early photographs. She said the images, discovered in 1976 and stored in Harvard's Peabody Museum, rightfully belong to her, and her lawsuit alleges that Harvard is “shamelessly capitalizing" on them.
She was joined at a press conference Thursday by descendants of controversial Harvard scientist Louis Agassiz, who commissioned the daguerreotypes in an attempt to support his theory of white biological superiority.
“I feel like I've been lifted into this extraordinary story that this woman is leading," Marian Moore, the great-great-great-granddaughter of Agassiz, said while standing with Lanier out of the rain under a concrete overhang. They were just hundreds of feet from where campus buildings bearing the Agassiz name stood. “It's like the chance of a lifetime, really."
Moore said she learned about Lanier's quest to obtain the daguerreotypes through a New York Times story, and reached out to Lanier via social media.
“I immediately contacted [Moore], and we have bonded," said Lanier, who is Renty's great-great-great-granddaughter. “When you think about . . . the fact that you have the linear descendants of Renty and the linear descendants of Louis Agassiz standing in solidarity, it's just amazing."
Harvard has used Renty's image several times, including on the cover of a 2017 anthropology book.
“Harvard has and will continue to come to terms with and address its historic connection to slavery," Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane said, stressing that the museum's high standards for preservation help maintain the fragile photos. “Harvard also strives to be an ethical steward of the millions of historical objects from around the globe within its museum and library collections."
In April, Harvard's president, Lawrence Bacow, told the student newspaper The Crimson that he thinks Harvard has “the law on our side" when it comes to possession of the daguerreotypes. The school charges a small fee for reproductions, but doesn't profit from the photos, officials have said.
“Again, I would hope, though, that we could resolve this not purely by resort to legal process," Bacow told The Crimson.
But Moore said she thinks turning over the images could help Harvard begin “crucial work of deep reckoning and repair." Her sister Susanna said she thinks the “family photos" belong to Lanier.
“Louis Agassiz, backed by Harvard University, offered a biological basis to white supremacy," Susanna Moore said. “The myth is maintained to this day by . . . institutions like Harvard, who are still saying, 'No.' It's time for reparations."
The reparations Lanier is seeking “will be significant, because the harm is significant and the benefit [Harvard] received was significant" according to Josh Koskoff, one of Lanier's attorneys. Her legal team also includes civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, an African-American teenager who in 2012 was shot and killed by a community watch member in Florida.
After Thursday's clandestine press conference, announced at the last minute to avoid the possibility of Harvard officials kicking the families off campus, the group unfurled umbrellas and embarked on a soggy slog through campus to Bacow's office in Massachusetts Hall.
“Tammy sent many, many e-mails, and many, many letters, and has only been rebuffed," Susanna Moore said. “And so we're hoping that with a more public demand that they pay attention."
The plan was to hand-deliver Bacow a letter signed by 43 Agassiz descendants, demanding that Harvard turn over the photos. The families hoped the show of unity would pressure the school to relent.
“For Harvard to give the daguerreotypes to Ms. Lanier and her family would begin to make amends for its use of the photos as exhibits for the white supremacist theory Agassiz espoused," the letter said. “It is time for Harvard to recognize Renty and Delia as people."
But the group was met at the door to Massachusetts Hall by a startled security guard who barred access to the building.
The families didn't get to see Bacow, but they did get to drop off their letter.
“We have received it, and have no further comment," Dane told the Globe on Thursday afternoon.
“They said that president Bacow is not available. . . . Whether he's here or not, I don't know," Moore said. “It's completely predictable that he would not be willing to see us, because then he would have to face his lack of humanity."

Federal minimum wage stuck at $7.25/hour since July 2009

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - America has now gone longer without an increase in the federal minimum wage than at any point in the law's eight-decade history.
In July 2009, almost 10 years ago, the federal minimum wage rose from $6.55 an hour to $7.25 an hour.
Since then, Congress has not approved any additional hikes, with Republican lawmakers rejecting Democrats' attempts to raise the minimum wage.
Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said he and President Donald Trump have not discussed the administration's position on raising the federal minimum wage.
Trump has backed a number of positions on the minimum wage, saying at one point during the 2016 presidential campaign that he supported significantly increasing it and at others that he would not lift it.
Twenty-nine states have passed state minimum wages that are higher than the federal baseline, while in the other 21 the federal minimum prevails.
Republican-controlled states are less likely to have passed minimum wage hikes, although voters in conservative-led states such as Arkansas and Alaska have approved higher minimum wages through ballot initiatives.
"We've had Congress upon Congress that can't get it done, so we're stuck with this shameful number," said Judiy Conti, government affairs director for the National Employment Law Project, which advocates a higher federal minimum wage.
Experts say the recent strong run of U.S. economic growth over the past several years bolsters the case for raising the minimum wage, given that businesses are better positioned to survive the rise in costs than they are during a downturn.
Wages have begun rising for U.S. workers as low unemployment improves their bargaining power, but some economists argue they would increase even faster with minimum wage hikes.
The "effective" minimum wage - the average wage being paid to all minimum wage workers - has surged to $12 an hour, largely due to state and local governments' hikes, according to a report in The New York Times by an economist who served in the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama.
But about 700,000 minimum-wage workers, in areas that have not passed local increases, are still paid $7.25 an hour, the report said.
The value of that wage has fallen by about 17 percent over the past decade, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, which translates into a $3,000 loss in annual earnings for a full-time year-round minimum-wage worker.
"Business profits have been steadily growing, and it's much easier to absorb what businesses view as negative economic shocks when the overall context is positive and good," said Steven Kyle, an economist at Cornell University. "That's been true for the last five years."
Hassett, of the president's economic team, pointed to recent wage growth at the bottom of the income distribution and argued the Republican tax law had helped bolster pay for low-income workers.
In November 2018, White House National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow called the minimum wage a "terrible idea" and "silly," arguing it hurts small businesses by increasing their costs.
"The best way to increase wages is to encourage capital formation, increase productivity, and drive the equilibrium wage higher," Hassett said.
Democrats in Congress have faced internal divisions over how high to raise the minimum wage, with the party's liberals and much of the 2020 presidential field pushing for a $15 an hour minimum wage.
Moderate Democrats in Congress have pushed small increases in the federal minimum wage that would vary by region, with the wage floor rising by smaller amounts in poorer areas.

Texto completo: MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin, facing simmering domestic discontent, took to national television Thursday with one of his trademark messages: I feel your pain, but I'm the only one who can ease it.
In his annual call-in show, Putin fielded questions - at least some prescreened - from citizens across the country concerned about low incomes and poor medical care. He responded as he has in the past: Yes, things are hard, but the Kremlin is working to make them better.
Asked at the top of the show whether life in Russia had gotten harder, Putin said, "This is indeed the case." Lower oil prices had indeed contributed to a shock to the Russian economy.
But then came Putin's twist. Incomes were starting to grow again, he claimed, and the government was taking measures to improve households' bottom line.
The raw numbers suggest Russia's economy is, in fact, climbing out of a hole. The International Monetary Fund predicts modest growth in gross domestic product of 1.6 percent this year.
But other measures show Russia is still gripped by corruption and fiscal mismanagement. The civil society watchdog group Transparency International ranked Russia in the bottom third of countries, saying that "cronyism remains a cornerstone of Russian social and political processes."
Putin offered a rare show of emotion at the end of the program, in what seemed to be an attempt to connect with a frustrated populace. It also echoed the state media refrain that Russia's problems are the fault of outside forces or of lower-level officials - never Putin himself.
The question to Putin was if he ever felt shame. He told a story from his early presidential travels in Russia's regions about an elderly woman who fell to her knees in front of him, apparently pleading for help, and handed him a slip of paper.
"I took it, gave it to an aide, and it was lost. I will never forget this," Putin said, his voice cracking. "Even now, I'm ashamed. Everything that gets to me gets in my hands - I try to work through everything in full. Sometimes you can't solve problems. . . . But the thing is that it was lost."
'When I say it' In another segment, reporters for state TV were shown fanning out across the country to investigate claims of long lines at medical clinics. They showed a new dentist chair in a small village and a town hospital with modern equipment.
But hospital officials and patients told the reporters that it was hard to attract skilled workers to rural areas.
"There are lots of problems, but in general the sector is developing," Putin said, referring to health care. Promising that he would make sure things keep improving, he added: "It's one thing when a minister says it. It's another thing when I say it." His health minister then chimed in by video link to reinforce the message.
Putin's annual "Direct Line" call-in show has been a core element of his image-making since 2001, sometimes lasting more than four hours. Russians are invited to send in questions to the president. He responds to dozens of them - often about granular, local matters, accompanied by on-the-ground TV reports.
Putin looks out for the common man, the message goes, even if lower-level officials don't. Pro-Kremlin media outlets showed photos of Putin preparing for the call by studying an inches-thick stack of paper while wearing a casual zip-up jacket.
On the broadcast Thursday, the hosts said their operators were receiving 900 calls per minute with questions for the president. More than 1.5 million questions were submitted in all, the Kremlin said. There was even a smartphone app allowing Russians to record their question by video.
Putin touched on geopolitics, but it was largely a sideshow. He urged Russians not to worry about international sanctions, claiming that the European Union had suffered more from its sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine crisis than Russia did.
He also promised to examine the cases of 24 Ukrainian sailors and other Ukrainians behind bars in Russia, but only in conjunction with the cases of what he said were Russians wrongfully imprisoned in Ukraine.
Trump's 'treason' tweet Asked about a New York Times report that the United States had mounted a cyber-incursion into Russia's power grid, Putin said he had seen President Trump's reaction to the article accusing the newspaper of "treason."
"I don't understand how we are supposed to interpret this," Putin said. "Does this mean they published existing, real information or that they put out a fake? In any case, we need to react somehow and understand what this is all about."
Responding to another question, Putin said that he was prepared to meet with Trump but that the U.S. president faces domestic head winds in improving ties with Russia. Trump has said he expects to meet Putin on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Japan next week, but the one-on-one hasn't been officially confirmed.
Putin's annual appearance comes at a critical time for the Russian president after two decades in power.
His approval ratings have fallen over the past year to about 66 percent, according to independent pollster Levada Center - impressively high for most world leaders but still the lowest level since his first year in office. The glow of Putin's domestically popular annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014 has faded, analysts say, and the government's sharp increase of the retirement age last year cast a spotlight on Russia's sputtering economy.
In recent weeks, the challenge to Putin has been highlighted even further with Russians showing their readiness to take to the streets. In the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, a spontaneous outpouring of anger over the construction of a cathedral in a beloved city park led to an intervention from Putin and suspension of the plans. In Moscow, the authorities freed a journalist arrested on drug charges after outrage from colleagues and celebrities who said he had been framed.

Texto completo: Since January, the Los Angeles Lakers desperately were in pursuit of pulling off a blockbuster trade that would pair LeBron James with 26-year-old superstar, Anthony Davis.
The New Orleans Pelicans did everything in their power to keep its prized possession in Davis to stay with the team, but newly named executive vice president of basketball operations, David Griffin, knew he must maximize on trade value for the three-time AllNBA forward.
ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski first reported on Saturday that the Lakers and New Orleans Pelicans had agreed to a deal to send Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round draft picks - including this year's No. 4 overall selection in the 2019 NBA Draft in exchange for Davis.
The deal can't be officially completed until July 6 due to salary cap reasons, according to Wojnarowski.
Davis will join elite big men in Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Wilt Chamberlain, and Pau Gasol to sport the legendary purple and gold for Los Angeles.
James' and Davis' agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports group, perfectly maneuvered its January trade request to move on from New Orleans to Los Angeles.
The former Rookie of The Year and No. 1 overall pick by the Pelicans in 2012, played seven seasons for New Orleans, averaging 23.7 points, 10.5 rebounds and 2.4 blocks.
ESPN NBAAnalyst and Los Angeles Sparks Forward, Chiney Ogwumike, shared her thoughts on the blockbuster deal and the impact it will have throughout the league.
"They're officially a cheat code, LeBron [James] and Anthony Davis, problems [for the league]," said Ogwumike.
"I think they are the front runners to win an NBA championship and will get another free agent with the money they still have available."
The New York Times, Marc Stein reported that the Lakers, who are well short of max cap space in the $23.8 million range, will now set their sights on signing unrestricted free agent Kemba Walker, who warrants closer to $30 million a year.
After six years of acquiring young talent through the draft, the Lakers signed James last summer and traded for Davis this summer, immediately positioning themselves as Western Conference contenders.
According to Caesars Sportsbook, the Lakers are 7-2 to win the title next year, leaping out to be heavy favorites ahead of 2019-20 season.
The Bucks and Clippers are tied at 6-1 behind Los Angeles, while the Raptors and Rockets come in with 8-1 odds.
ESPN's Ohm Youngmisuk spoke to Lavar Ball, father of recently traded Laker guard, Lonzo Ball, while at the Drew League on Saturday.
"I guarantee: Like I say again, it will be the worst move the Lakers ever did in their life and they will never win another championship," Ball said to ESPN, also mentioning how Los Angeles made a mistake in not drafting Lonzo's younger brother, LiAngelo in the 2018 NBA draft.
"They're going to regret it. I'm going to have fun with it. Because I told you all, it was crashing down. Now [the Lakers] completely crashed, but at least my son got off the boat before the thing exploded. I gave them a chance. You can rewind it and go back. I said if you get the three Ball brothers, you can survive this. You let him go, oh, it's going to be a cold day in hell. Trust and believe that."
The Lakers know they must capitalize on its timeline to win an NBA Championship while the Golden State Warriors are not at full strength.
Kevin Durant suffered a devastating ruptured Achilles tendon in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, and Klay Thompson tore his ACL late in the third quarter of Game 6. Both players for the Warriors are headed for unrestricted free-agency, as Golden State will be heavily dependent on having at least one of them resign and be healthy around playoff time, most likely being Thompson.
James, 34 years-old, a four-time NBA most valuable player and three-time NBA champion will look to take over the league with his new All-NBA big man in Davis.
With the trade, the Lakers undoubtedly should be able to make a long postseason run for the first time in six-seasons, with Anthony Davis, LeBron James and a third possible star still to be determined for the 2019-20 season.

George Will: Bernie Sanders is FDR's unimaginative echo

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — That the Democrats' two evenings of dueling oratory snippets this week are called "debates" validates Finley Peter Dunne's prediction that "when we Americans are through with the English language, it will look as if it had been run over by a musical comedy." Already a linguistic casualty of the campaign is the noun "socialism." So, quickly, before Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign sinks, like darling Clementine, beneath the foaming brine, consider his struggle to convince Americans that socialism deserves to be the wave of their future.
One European explanation of America's puzzling (to many European intellectuals) resistance to socialism was given in 1906 by the German economist Werner Sombart: "All the socialist utopias came to nothing on roast beef and apple pie." Recently, however, Sanders delivered a Washington speech explaining, in effect, that socialism is as American as a piece of frozen apple pie with a slice of processed cheese. Doing so, however, he demonstrated that socialism is a classification that no longer classifies.
Sanders' socialism turns out to be a tweaked New Deal. He began, of course, by saying that the nation is in "a defining and pivotal moment." Speechwriters actually get paid for such bromides; capitalist America remains a land of opportunity even for the untalented. What Sanders then offered as forward-looking socialism was a warmed-over version of what President Franklin Roosevelt advocated 75 years ago.
In his 1944 State of the Union address, FDR called for "rights" to "useful" jobs, "good" education, "adequate" food and clothing and recreation, a "decent" living for farmers, a "decent" home, "adequate" medical care, "adequate" protection in old age. Details, such as how to define the adjectives and how to pay for what the nouns denote, were for another day. Sanders' agenda for "completion" of FDR's New Deal is a right to a "decent" job, "quality" health care, "complete" education, "affordable" housing, a "clean" environment, a "secure" retirement. Details later.
Sanders says "what I mean by democratic socialism" is "economic rights are human rights." Really. That's it. FDR said "necessitous men are not free men," implying that government can and should remove necessity from the human story. Sanders, FDR's unimaginative echo, presumably agrees.
Sanders loathes billionaires and loves Sweden, which has more billionaires per capita than America has. Economist Deirdre McCloskey, writing in National Review, notes that "none of Sweden's manufacturing or extractive industries has even been socialized." And "when Saab Autos began its descent into bankruptcy," the government let it go, unlike the U.S government bailing out GM and Chrysler (for a second time) after 2008. McCloskey quotes a Swedish diplomat: "In many fields, we have more private ownership compared to other European countries, and to America. About 80 percent of all new schools are privately run, as are the railroads and the subway system."
The morning after Sanders' speech, The New York Times reported something momentous: "Democratic socialism has become a major force in American political life." This is amazing, considering that it was never more than a negligible force when capitalism seemed to be in a perhaps terminal crisis: In 1932, three years into the Depression, with the unemployment rate at 23.6 percent and the GDP 25.7 percent smaller than in 1929, as this column previously noted, the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Norman Thomas, received fewer votes (884,885) than its 1920 candidate Eugene Debs received (913,693) while he was imprisoned by President Woodrow Wilson's administration.
A young adult — a member of the demographic supposedly most sympathetic to socialism — who attended Sanders' exegesis of socialism told the Times: "In America we embrace a lot of socialist policies already, like public education and parks." This understanding of socialism as any government provision of public goods puts Horace Mann (1796-1859), an advocate of public education, and Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), designer of New York City's Central Park, in the socialist pantheon with their contemporaries Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Many young people who supposedly are making socialism a "major force" think it is sociability: everyone being nice to everyone.
Sen. Elizabeth ("I have a plan for that") Warren, D-Mass., who describes herself as a "capitalist to my bones," is a more authentic socialist than Sanders because she has more granular plans for government power (aka politics) to supplant market forces in the allocation of wealth and opportunity. So she, even more than the other participants in this week's Democrats' presidential scrums, would as president give the nation a helpful, if inadvertent, tutorial about this axiom: If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

Children swap stories, celebrate differences

Texto completo: The red Russian hardwood trunks with silver bracketing and removable wheels may not look like much, but inside they're packed with adventure and could revolutionize the way students learn. These red trunks are a product of the Red Trunk Project, a program focused on teaching kids about different cultures around the world. While the trunks are literally red, the "red" also stands for "respect every difference."
"The goal is to give kids a deep immersion into one culture and once they do that, they'll have the tools to uncode any other cultures they interact with throughout their life," said the project's founder, Rockland resident Kevin Thomsen.
"Learn to reach out a hand instead of a fist; to build bridges, not walls."
A producer of video games, toys, shows, ebooks and audiobooks who holds a gold record and a couple of Grammys, Thomsen is also a father of two.
"I have two adopted children, one from the Republic of Georgia, Penelope, and Sefan, from Ethiopia," Thomsen said. "For the past 17 years, the idea of keeping kids close to the culture of their birth has stuck with me. How do you introduce kids to a culture without going there? What's the best way to do this?"
The answer: trunks filled with artifacts, video, virtual reality goggles and a booklet.
Teaching through trunks isn't a new concept, but Thomsen wanted to expand on the idea and hyper-focus on a whole country and its culture, as opposed to a moment in history.
"There are people who do trunk-based kinds of things," Thomsen said, "but it's typically one trunk filled with something like Vietnam memorabilia."
Road to Red Trunks The idea came to Thomsen during an audiobook recording session for "A Path Appears," a book written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn. The book profiles charities around the world and found a new way to measure their success.
After a conversation with actress Olivia Wilde, who was recording the book, a light bulb went off in Thomsen's head.
"I was like 'I want to record the stories of children from different countries around the world,'" Thomsen said. "The differences in each other is what makes life interesting."
The idea sat with him for a couple of years and morphed into the Red Trunk Project after his wife suggested reaching out to a friend to discuss the particulars.
"The idea of kids trading stories," Thomsen said, "became cultural artifacts, or maybe some video, that kids can touch and feel."
Once the project launched, two years later, Thomsen reached out to Kristof to tell him.
"Sheryl and I are thrilled to see what Kevin has done with the Red Trunk Project and to watch how it has grown," Kristof said. "It's just the kind of project that opens and nourishes young minds."
"He's been a great supporter, he even mentioned us in his newsletter," "Thomsen said of Kristof's support.
The first Red Trunk centers on Oaxaca, Mexico.
Thomsen approached Dr. Jill Vexler, a cultural anthropologist who has curated more than 40 exhibitions, through a mutual friend. Vexler, who spend years living in Mexico, reached out to another cultural anthropologist who was living in Mexico. With minimal conversation, they came up with identical lists for what artifacts must be in the trunks. Thomsen made three trips to Oaxaca to collect the artifacts, photos and video from the lists.
"It's a particularly cultural area," Vexler said of Oaxaca. " I wanted to show American kids how daily life solutions are solving the same problems just in different places.The artifacts and material culture of these solutions is very different and the tech to make the material culture is very different."
Michele Purpura, a third grade teacher at Brookside Elementary School in the Yorktown Central School District, had a Red Trunk visit her classroom this school year.
"For me, this was an unbelievable opportunity. The Red Trunk touched upon one of my favorite themes — acceptance," Purpura said. "I cannot explain how excited by students were during this project. They truly appreciated the artifacts, especially after viewing the videos."
The Red Trunk has visited school districts on Long Island, in Eastchester and Newburgh, in Orange County, and Thomsen said he is focusing on getting into more schools in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange and Dutchess.
"We're aiming for one trunk per classroom for a two-week period," Thomsen said. "We're putting as many artifacts we can fit in the trunks with video and the 'Kids of Oaxaca' booklet. There are about 60 artifacts per trunk and we want to make hundreds of trunks to share with the world."
The next Red Trunks may focus on Kenya or China. Thomsen is in talks with the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, about a Native American trunk. He is also in talks with Rockland Pride about creating a rainbow trunk which would take a look at the history of the gay civil rights movement.
"It's about activism," Thomsen said. "We want kids to get active to help the environment whether on a micro or macro level. Recycling in their homes is a micro thing that can make a big difference."
'Mad Men' actor is helping the cause
On Thursday, the Red Trunk Project is holding a fundraiser called "Red Trunk Liftoff." There will be food, wine, a mystery raffle and an auction run by comedian Richard Kind.
What would be auctioned off to help a project such as this? How about enjoying 30 minutes of cocktail banter via Skype with "Mad Men" star Jon Hamm, who is also on the Red Trunk Project's board of directors, or the opportunity to take a two-hour boat ride via Nyack Boat Charters, complete with a picnic provided by Mimi's Plate?
"What Kevin and his team have done with Red Trunk is provide a unique cross-cultural experiential toolset to inspire a new generation of minds to understand different cultures first hand," Hamm said in a release. "To lead with acceptance and understanding and not fear is a valuable concept in today's increasingly polarized and fractured conversation. I am proud to support Red Trunk and hope to make its reach even wider and more significant."
The money raised at the Red Trunk Liftoff will be matched 3 to 1 to raise even more funds for the Red Trunk Project.
Go: Red Trunk Liftoff, OUTSIDE IN Gallery, 249 Ferdon Ave., Piermont. June 13, 6-9 p.m. $75 per person. To register for the event head to eventbrite.com/e/red-trunk-liftoff-tickets.

Texto completo: Headnote Commentary
(TriceEdneyWire.com) - For Donald Trump, America First is increasingly translating into America alone. He apparently believes that the United States is so dominant that it needs no friends. Trump prefers to act alone, often on impulse, in conflicts across the globe. He views allies as a burden, international law as an affront. He claims that America is back, more respected than ever. In fact, it is becoming more isolated than ever.
The New York Times reports that Trump was ready to impose tariffs on Australia recently, to counter a surge of aluminum imports to the United States, to all of 6 percent of total U.S. imports. Fierce opposition from the military and State Department led the White House to reconsider. Trump has launched a long overdue challenge to our trading relationship with China.
Our trade deficits with China have been the largest between two countries in recorded history. The Chinese have been masterful mercantilists, manipulating their currency and conditions to capture jobs, expand exports and build their industries. The U.S. - with our trade policies defined by global corporations and banks - has been willing to allow U.S. companies to ship jobs abroad to take advantage of suppressed labor and lax environmental and consumer standards, and then ship goods back to the U.S. Profit margins and CEO pay soared; workers and communities in the US took it on the chin. The relationship had to change.
Yet instead of enlisting allies in challenging the Chinese practices, Trump slapped tariffs on Canada and Mexico, on Europe, Japan and South Korea. He's on the verge of alienating Australia, which has been a staunch ally in relation to China. Instead of isolating China, he's isolating the United States. Now the Europeans are ignoring U.S. warnings about the Chinese high-tech company Huawei's 5G system. Trump trumpeted his NAFTA 2.0 agreement with Mexico and Canada as a great success.
Yet, he suddenly threatened to slap escalating tariffs on Mexican imports unless that country cracks down on the people traveling from Central America to seek asylum in the U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, warns this could torpedo any possibility of passing the treaty.
Trump isn't just isolating the U.S., he's isolating himself. Trump moved to take the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord that includes virtually every country in the world. He's repudiated the Iran Nuclear Deal, spurning the pleas of our allies to respect a treaty that ensures Iran cannot revive a nuclear weapons program. His bellicose bluster and military maneuvers against Iran have earned the rebuke of European allies warning against the threat of hostilities.
Instead of removing us from the endless "stupid wars" that he campaigned against, he's gone all in with Saudi Arabia, sustaining troops in Afghanistan, Syria, escalating tensions with Iran, and vetoing the bipartisan congressional resolution seeking an end to our shameful complicity in the Saudi assault on Yemen. His solo act on North Korea blew up in his face in the failed summit leaving South Korea to pick up the pieces, if that's possible.
He's ratcheted up the economic sanctions against Venezuela, adding to the miseries of the people there, while the regime-change efforts orchestrated by his aides violate both decency and international law. The United States is a powerful nation. Our economy represents about one fourth of the global GDP. Our military is the strongest in the world. Our network of alliances is unrivaled.
Our culture - movies, language, currency - spread across the world. But we are not an indispensable nation or all powerful. Acting sensibly with allies, we can have immense influence. Acting erratically alone, we make ourselves weaker, not stronger. Bluster is not strength. Isolation is not freedom. Lawless impulse is not strategy. Trump's posturing is making us weaker, not stronger.

Texto completo: One look at Sweety's in Cape Coral, and customers know they're in for a treat.
From the pink sign out front to the pink walls to its owner and baker, Yvonne Schumacher, in a pink T-shirt and pink Crocs, everything here has a sweet touch. And that's before the rows of cupcakes, mini Bundt cakes, apple-crumb cakes and German cheesecakes. Plus books filled with custom wedding and birthday cakes.
"We have cookies too," Schumacher said. "And I have, at the moment, mountain peaks — a homemade cream on a cookie covered with milk chocolate and white chocolate."
So. Much. Sweetness.
Yet, despite the name of her shop, Schumacher pointed out her treats are sweet — but not too sweet.
"I use the German recipes," she said, "so it's not too, too sweet. It's different from a cake at Publix."
Schumacher uses no mixes, no pre-made frostings. She draws from old recipes that date back to her mother and grandmother, though she's had to make some changes since setting up shop in the U.S.
"When I got here, I must test every recipe because the ingredients are different here," Schumacher said. "The butter is different, the milk is different."
She uses a light Swiss buttercream frosting on most of her cakes instead of a cream cheese frosting, and she bakes a mix of German and American favorites.
"I have a snow white cake that's a recipe from my grandmother and it is so good," she said.
"It's a vanilla cake on the bottom with
cherries on top of that, then chocolate cake, then vanilla cream, then you have a thick chocolate cover."
Some of the American specialties she's mastered? Carrot cake and oatmeal-raisin cookies. Her selection changes all the time.
"Every time you come in, there are new things," Schumacher said.
"We test a little bit in the kitchen with new treats and different cookies. At the moment I have the oatmeal-raisin cookies and butter buttons, and next week I bake two other cookies, or we design new cupcakes."
Schumacher and her husband, Andreas, opened the bakery at the end of March, and Schumacher splits her time between baking cakes and helping at Hart & Soul Cafe, which the couple bought last year south of Sweety's on Del Prado Boulevard.
She bakes all the sweets for Hart & Soul, including the apple-crumb cake, which is a customer favorite.
At Sweety's, Schumacher sells cakes by the slice, plus individual cupcakes, cookies or mini-cakes. She has a selection of coffee drinks — lattes, espressos, cappuccinos — as well as teas to go with the treats. She also takes orders for custom cakes, cupcakes and treats.
Baking is a familiar business to Schumacher, who is originally from southern Germany, near Munich. In her hometown, she ran a custom-cake business, turning out astonishing creations for her customers — towering, six-tier wedding cakes; knee-high Minions and even a life-sized ALF (yes, the ALF of '80s sitcom fame).
"I can do everything as a cake," Schumacher said, laughing.
But she's not joking. Her photo books of past custom-cake orders are filled with her customer's wildest imaginings, like a cake that looks like a fresh watermelon on the outside and, inside, each slice reveals a red velvet interior dotted with chocolate chips.
An elaborate custom cake can take several days for her to put together.
"I'm a perfectionist," she said. "When I do cakes, it's the same. I love the details and it must be perfect."
Today, her workload is divided between those same custom cakes, special order treats and sweets for the shop where everything is homemade and handmade.
"I love to bake," Schumacher said.
One look around this sweet shop, and customers know it's true.

Three reasons Trump-Russia hasn’t turned into Watergate

Texto completo: Why haven’t efforts to impeach President Trump gained Watergate-style momentum? The lack of energy has created a sense of bafflement and disappointment among some of the president’s most determined adversaries. But there are some simple reasons for it. Here are three: 1. The facts are different. In Watergate, the underlying crime was a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters, perpetrated by burglars paid by President Nixon’s re-election campaign. The scandal proceeded from there. In Trump-Russia, the underlying crime was the hacking of the DNC’s and John Podesta’s emails — a crime committed by Russians in Russia. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who indicted a number of Russians and Russian entities for their actions, spent two years trying to find conspiracy or coordination between the Russians and the Trump campaign. He failed.
That single fact has shaped every other aspect of the Trump-Russia affair. In Watergate, the cover-up flowed from Nixon’s desire to conceal his campaign’s involvement in the break-in and other political dark acts. It formed the bulk of the obstruction of justice case against Nixon, which in turn served as the basis for articles of impeachment.
2. The press is different. Just as the facts of Trump-Russia are quite unlike Watergate, so the media environment of 2019 is quite unlike what existed in 1974. Back then, there were three 30-minute broadcast network newscasts: CBS, NBC and ABC. There were two big newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post, and TV network executives sat down each day, within a few blocks of each other in Manhattan, to produce newscasts that basically illustrated the papers’ latest stories. There was no internet, no cable news, no podcasts, no social media and no talk radio. Nixon, even if he had had strong defenses, faced a solid wall of media opposition.
Today, the situation is much, much different — and infinitely better. There is far more diversity of opinion in the media writ large, and, importantly, popular access to primary sources. That troubles some media figures who miss the old days of news monopoly.
"During the Watergate era ... there were three networks," Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote recently. "Back then, what was said on those three networks ... was largely believed. Much more than now, there was a shared set of facts."
But it was a limited set of facts — just the ones selected by those network producers in Manhattan. Today’s media diversity, in terms of the Trump-Russia affair, means more facts see the light. And people inclined to support the president, or just be skeptical of the government’s investigative targeting of the Trump campaign, have a way to make their case beyond what anyone had 40-plus years ago.
3. Congress is different. Differences in the facts of the cases and differences in the media’s ability to report those facts have had a profound effect on lawmakers. They’re better informed, if they want to be, and can make a better defense of the president of their party. And having a significant number of constituents supporting the president makes representatives more likely to support him, too. (Unlike today, in 1974 opposition party Democrats controlled all of Congress, with 243 seats in the House and 56 in the Senate.) So this is a new world. It is perhaps not surprising to hear Democrats wish they could somehow turn today’s Trump-Russia affair into yesterday’s Watergate. If they could just hold televised hearings, they say, that could capture the nation’s attention and give Trump-Russia a Watergate-like urgency. Americans would turn against the president by the millions.
Others believe they just need time. It took Watergate years to grow big enough to oust Nixon, they say. But look at the numbers. The break-in was in June 1972, and Nixon resigned in August 1974 — a period of two years and two months. In Trump-Russia, the FBI began its investigation nearly three years ago, in July 2016. The Senate began investigating in January 2017. And Mueller took office in May 2017. It’s been a long time.
Trump-Russia could go longer still, and it would not change the basic facts of the case. It is simply a different case in a different world. Try as they might, the president’s opponents can’t make it 1974 again.

Del Taco adds two plant-based Beyond Burritos to its menu

Texto completo: Del Taco will begin serving meat-free Beyond Burritos on Thursday, June 20, two months after the successful launch of its Beyond Tacos.
The new burritos expand Del Taco’s partnership with Beyond Meat, a Los Angeles-based company out to revolutionize meat substitutes with plant-based products that look and taste like beef.
The two new menu items are:
Beyond 8 Layer Burrito: Made with seasoned plant-based crumbles, slow-cooked beans, guacamole, diced tomatoes, lettuce, cheddar cheese, sauce and sour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla.
Epic Beyond Cali Burrito: Beyond Meat plant-based crumbles wrapped with crinkle-cut french fries, sour cream, guacamole and handmade pico de gallo in a flour tortilla.
The two Beyond Tacos on the menu are among Del Taco’s most successful launches. It has sold about 2 million of them since they were added to the menu in mid-April, according to a news release from the Lake Forest-based chain.
Plant-based protein is a hot trend in fast food and fast casual restaurants. Beyond Meat and its main competitor, Impossible Foods, have an expanding list of partners serving their products in burgers, Mexican foods and pizzas. The New York Times reported this week that Red Robin and White Castle are struggling to keep up with demand for Impossible Burgers.
Peas are a key ingredient in the Beyond Burger, while the Impossible Burger is made with soy, but both products are engineered to grill and even bleed like real beef.
Burger King began testing an Impossible Whopper in St. Louis on April 1 and three weeks later announced it would roll out the burger to the entire chain. Bay Area restaurants began serving it last week.

Texto completo: What's the correlation between hallucinogens and a proposed pay raise for members of Congress? I think we all know the answer to that, but let's review.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wants to spend taxpayer money to make it easier for researchers to study the benefits of psychedelic drugs, including magic mushrooms, peyote and anything else that could potentially have therapeutic value.
It's not the worst idea I've heard, though that bar is pretty low, or high, as the case may be.
To be sure, there are valid reasons to explore the use of what the government labels "Schedule I" drugs — including marijuana — in the treatment of PTSD, chronic pain and end-of-life care. Of course, as soon as illegal substances are deemed legal for therapeutic purposes, it's only a matter of time until the push to make them legal for recreational use. In fact, it has already happened. Oakland and Denver recently decriminalized the use of psychedelic mushrooms. Recreational use of marijuana is now legal in 11 states.
For those not familiar with the side effects of hallucinogenic shrooms — the only mushrooms I use are in pasta sauce — we might want to pause before moving forward any further.
In a May 10 opinion piece in The New York Times, Michael Pollan, who has written books on the uses of psychedelic drugs and is largely a proponent, issues a warning.
"Someone on a high dose of psilocybin (mushrooms) is apt to have badly impaired judgment and, unsupervised, can do something reckless."
Getting into an automobile comes to mind.
Politics are also at play here. Surprise. Legalization plays well on the left and there is a fairly sizable constituency out there that really doesn't care very much about the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs and will support any candidate who makes it easier for those so inclined to get loaded.
But we can debate the moral and practical implications of further anesthetizing our population some other time. For now, I'll do you one better.
Let's start the research immediately, in Congress, with the compulsory serving of a course of magic mushrooms at the opening of each session.
We've already tried this sober. How much worse can stoned be?
Perhaps some mind-altering fungi would mellow everyone out. Maybe the next time one of our lawmakers — pick one, on either side — starts shrieking about some hot-button issue — pick one — some lightly toasted legislator in opposition will defuse the angry discourse.
"Dude. Relax. Have a mushroom. Just enjoy the pretty colors."
Think about it. Mitch McConnell shows up for work wearing a tie-die shirt and a headband. Nancy Pelosi is playing the sitar. Groovy.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — A Gobernador rancher who has emerged as one of the leading local proponents of requiring the capture of methane emissions in the Four Corners region is featured in a new documentary film about climate change airing on HBO.
Don Schreiber, owner of the Devil's Spring Ranch in western Rio Arriba County, said the director and crew members for the film "Ice on Fire" — which made its debut on HBO June 11 — visited his family three times in late 2017 and early 2018 to conduct interviews and shoot footage.
According to hbo.com, the 98-minute film is narrated by Leonard DiCaprio, and produced by him and his father, George DiCaprio, among others. It features locations around the world and focuses on solutions to what it calls the escalating environmental crisis.
Schreiber's ranch was chosen because he has advocated for stricter regulations regarding venting and flaring from natural gas wells. The Four Corners region is home to a sizable "methane cloud" that researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology have attributed largely to gas wells, storage tanks, pipelines and processing plants. Industry advocates have responded by linking the emissions to natural sources such as coal formations and have fought increased regulation, which they say will have a negative economic impact.
Schreiber, who served on the transition team for the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, said the segment of the film in which he appears deals with the issue of methane emissions in the Four Corners, a topic that he said remains relevant since he was interviewed a year and a half ago by director Leila Conners.
"These things have not lost any currency here and are more timely than ever," he said.
Schreiber said he a cameraman and Conners followed him on a tour of his ranch, where a FLIR thermographic camera was used to capture footage of methane leaking from well sites. Schreiber said Conners peppered him with questions as they walked.
"In this film, there's nothing scripted," Schreiber said, describing the experience of being interviewed by the director. "You have no idea what questions they're going to ask you. They're looking for honest, uncut reactions."
Schreiber has spoken to media outlets ranging from NPR to PBS over the years about the methane cloud, so he is relatively used to being interviewed. He said he always takes care to choose his words carefully, aspiring to be a voice for others in the region who are not on the radar of major media organizations.
"I'm always concerned that I represent in my answers the truth," he said. "I'm always aware that I'm talking for so many people who don't get the call from The New York Times or HBO. ... I feel a great burden every time they turn the camera on me to say something meaningful."
Schreiber was invited to the documentary's Los Angeles premiere at the Bing Theater on June 5 and got to view it then. He said the segment on the Four Corners lasts for approximately seven minutes and features Dr. Gabrielle Petron, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association who has studied the methane cloud for many years.
"It all went by in a flash," Schreiber said. "But I felt we were well represented."
When asked to evaluate his own appearance in the film, Schreiber burst out laughing.
"Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?" he asked rhetorically before turning serious. "Yes, I think that with their editing and their choices, they got a great representation of what it's like to live on the ground with this."
Schreiber attended the premiere with one of his daughters and his sister. He said it was an extremely rewarding experience, one made more memorable by the chance to visit with Conners again and the opportunity to meet Leonardo DiCaprio.
Don Schreiber says he hopes the new documentary film "Ice on Fire" airing on HBO brings international attention to the issue of the Four Corners methane cloud.

'Euphoria' is the latest teen TV show that isn't actually meant for teens

Texto completo: It's not unusual to see copious amounts of sex and drugs on HBO. But "Euphoria," a drama starring Zendaya as an anxiety-prone addict, still shocks.
Beyond being a notably provocative turn for the Disney alum, whose family spy comedy "K.C. Undercover" ended just last year, "Euphoria" is racy even by premium cable standards. The first few episodes of the show, which premiered Sunday night, feature abundant full-frontal nudity, a graphic overdose and several harrowing sexual encounters.
But unlike most HBO dramas, "Euphoria" is expressly about teenagers. In between monotone musings about her childhood, multiple rehab stints and relapses, Zendaya's character, Rue, evokes a uniquely adolescent brand of angst - while justifying her continued drug use: "The world's coming to an end and I haven't even graduated high school yet," she says.
"Euphoria," based on an Israeli series of the same name, is boundary-pushing in the vein of Larry Clark's controversial 1995 film, "Kids," and the British series "Skins," which followed a rotating cast of troubled teenagers in South West England. (A short-lived MTV adaptation drew ample controversy but fell flat.)
Sam Levinson, who created the American version of "Euphoria," has said that he infused his own experience as a young drug addict into the grim script, which pulls no punches in tackling teenage trauma.
Surprising no one, the conservative watchdog group Parents Television Council has already issued a stern warning about "Euphoria's" graphic content, asserting that shows about teens attract, well, teens. But adolescent drama has connected with adults since fictional Brenda Walsh was in high school. Teen TV - the increasingly appreciated genre of television about, but not exclusively for, the 17-and-younger set - has long featured teenagers played by 20-something actors. The viewing audience at home is often much older.
One pioneer of teen TV was "Gossip Girl," which quickly became a cultural phenomenon (and frequent target of the watchdogs) after its premiere in 2007. By the third season, when a threesome involving two main characters (and guest star Hilary Duff) raised eyebrows, a rep for the network noted that the median age of the show's viewers was 27.
A decade later, broad appeal has become a hallmark of the teen TV genre. Last year, a New York Times report cited a jaw-dropping 37.2 as the median age for CW's Archie Comics-inspired drama "Riverdale," which follows the increasingly supernatural adventures of a group of very beautiful high school students. The data for streaming networks - which, like HBO, aren't beholden to advertisers in the way that the CW is - is harder to come by. But Netflix, in particular, has embraced teen-centered shows that appear to be geared toward anyone who will watch them.
The approach has yielded mixed results. "13 Reasons Why" made style choices that seemed at odds with its noble but deeply flawed attempt to call out bullying and other issues faced by teens. Was it a show meant to be watched by kids, parents or parents watching with their kids? The ambiguity of the drama's intended audience was underscored by controversy surrounding its treatment of suicide and sexual assault. On the other hand, "Élite," a dark, prep school drama set in Spain, gained a cult following with a murder mystery implicating a sexy roster of immensely wealthy teenagers.
Under HBO's almost-anything-goes umbrella, "Euphoria" feels like teen TV on drugs (literally and figuratively). "Élite" is the only thing that comes remotely close, but the Spanish-language drama is so far beyond reality for most people - one character is the daughter of a marquess - that it hardly feels like a show about teenagers at all. Levinson and HBO executives, meanwhile, have touted "Euphoria's" authenticity. Casey Bloys, head of programming for HBO, told the Hollywood Reporter that there is a point behind even the most risque scenes.
"It's not sensational to be sensational," he told the magazine. "It may seem boundary-pushing, and the idea of putting them on TV may be, but somebody lived them." Zendaya echoed that sentiment in a recent New York Times interview. "I kind of accepted that people will find it polarizing," the 22-year-old actress said. "Whether people like it or not, it's real. I'm telling somebody's story."
Fittingly, one of the producers behind "Euphoria" is a veteran of teen TV. Drake, who signed on to the project alongside his manager Future the Prince, spent years on the Canadian teen drama "Degrassi: The Next Generation" before becoming a chart-topping rapper. "Degrassi," a franchise that has spanned decades, is the gold standard of adolescent melodrama. "If the kids are talking about it, we should talk about it in our show," franchise co-creator Linda Schuyler told The Washington Post in 2015.
That ethos led to story lines about sexuality, gender identity, school shootings, teen pregnancy, abortion, drug use, self-harm, suicide, sexual assault and consent, to name a few. For years, "Degrassi," the rare teen show to cast actual teens, celebrated its frank approach with the tagline: "It goes there." But the series that brought Aubrey Graham into our cultural consciousness doesn't hold a candle to "Euphoria," which arguably packs more sex and drugs into its first one-hour episode than "Degrassi" featured in its 40-year history.
"Euphoria" does take a few pages from the "Degrassi" playbook. In the first episode of "Degrassi: The Next Generation," a young girl arranges to meet a boy she has been talking to online, only to discover that he is actually an adult. One "Euphoria" scene has a similar setup, but the technology is more accessible and the outcome is much more devastating. And like "Degrassi," the HBO drama takes on issues relevant to the moment - from transphobia to Rue's distinctly Gen-Z anxiety. The show has also tapped into current discourse behind the scenes: An intimacy coordinator helped actors through the show's often unsettling sex scenes.
So far, reviews have been mixed on whether "Euphoria" is successful in its gritty depiction of children on the cusp of adulthood; critics overwhelmingly agree that the show is both sad and sexually explicit. But edgy teen dramas aren't exactly in short supply these days. If "Degrassi" went there because it had to, "Euphoria" goes there (and there and, OMG, there) because it can.

Trump’s troubling trade tirades

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has declared victory in his confrontation with Mexico. After he threatened to impose crippling tariffs on $350 billion worth of goods Mexico exports annually to the U.S., that country’s leaders agreed to measures aimed at impeding asylum-seekers from Central America that flow through Mexico headed for the American border.
The short-term headlines were certainly favorable to the president. But the long-term cost to Trump could be very damaging. The president’s strongest argument for a second term is a vibrant economy, and his actions are jeopardizing fiscal stability and his own re-election chances.
The clash with Mexico is part of a much larger pattern in which the president blusters and bullies his way around the world, threatening trading partners from China and Japan to France and Canada if they don’t knuckle under to his demands. And the backlash is already blossoming. The U.S. economy added only 75,000 new jobs last month, one of the lowest monthly totals since the last recession ended 10 years ago, and those results reflect a global economic slowdown that many economists blame at least in part on Trump’s trade tirades.
The World Bank cited "rising trade protectionism" as a prime cause of weakening economic growth in 2018.
Republican senators were so alarmed at Trump’s bellicose threats toward Mexico that they were preparing to block new tariffs before the president canceled them.
"We are going to have a lot of our members who are very concerned about where this is headed," said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican, to The New York Times.
Since a healthy economy remains a prime GOP campaign issue, he added, "I don’t know why we would want to step on that." The Wall Street Journal warned in an editorial that "the effects of trade uncertainty are rippling out," and that the May jobs report was "a flashing yellow light that Mr. Trump needs to settle his trade wars and get back to promoting growth."
The economic slowdown is not the only thing signaling danger for the president. The brightest warning light, however, foreshadows the impact of Trump’s policies on the economy. Businesses detest chaos and confusion, but the president firmly believes that he thrives in precisely those conditions. And after his encounter with Mexico, he seems more emboldened than ever to raise tensions with trading partners by threatening new penalties.
"Protectionism shows no signs of abating; rather, it is intensifying," Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., told the Times. Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, added on CNBC: "The weaponization of tariffs — the increase of threats on our economy, and on our farmers, our manufacturers, our consumers — is going to hurt our country."
Those farmers, manufacturers and consumers also vote. And Trump’s tariff tirades risk undermining economic growth, and alienating those voters, just as his re-election campaign is accelerating.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has declared victory in his confrontation with Mexico. After he threatened to impose crippling tariffs on $350 billion worth of goods Mexico exports annually to the U.S., that country’s leaders agreed to measures aimed at impeding asylum-seekers from Central America that flow through Mexico headed for the American border.
The short-term headlines were certainly favorable to the president. But the long-term cost to Trump could be very damaging. The president’s strongest argument for a second term is a vibrant economy, and his actions are jeopardizing fiscal stability and his own re-election chances.
The clash with Mexico is part of a much larger pattern in which the president blusters and bullies his way around the world, threatening trading partners from China and Japan to France and Canada if they don’t knuckle under to his demands. And the backlash is already blossoming. The U.S. economy added only 75,000 new jobs last month, one of the lowest monthly totals since the last recession ended 10 years ago, and those results reflect a global economic slowdown that many economists blame at least in part on Trump’s trade tirades.
The World Bank cited "rising trade protectionism" as a prime cause of weakening economic growth in 2018.
Republican senators were so alarmed at Trump’s bellicose threats toward Mexico that they were preparing to block new tariffs before the president canceled them.
"We are going to have a lot of our members who are very concerned about where this is headed," said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican, to The New York Times.
Since a healthy economy remains a prime GOP campaign issue, he added, "I don’t know why we would want to step on that." The Wall Street Journal warned in an editorial that "the effects of trade uncertainty are rippling out," and that the May jobs report was "a flashing yellow light that Mr. Trump needs to settle his trade wars and get back to promoting growth."
The economic slowdown is not the only thing signaling danger for the president. The brightest warning light, however, foreshadows the impact of Trump’s policies on the economy. Businesses detest chaos and confusion, but the president firmly believes that he thrives in precisely those conditions. And after his encounter with Mexico, he seems more emboldened than ever to raise tensions with trading partners by threatening new penalties.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
There is a lot that remains unknown about family separations along the United States' southwestern border that began in secret in 2017 -- nearly a year before the federal government acknowledged them publicly.
That's in part because the federal employees and contractors involved were prohibited from speaking with reporters. But in writing about Constantin Mutu, the youngest child taken from his parents, for an article on Monday's front page, I got a rare look at what it was like to care for separated children. I talked to the baby's caseworker, Alma Acevedo, a 24-year-old who handled his case in Kalamazoo, Mich.
Speaking with Ms. Acevedo helped fill out my understanding of one of the most inscrutable parts of the Trump administration's experiment with family separations. Parents affected by the policy had been able to tell me about their experience. But most children weren't old enough to recount in any level of detail what they had been through during their months or weeks in custodial care.
[Watch an episode of "The Weekly" about the youngest child separated from his parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.]
At the time, Ms. Acevedo worked for Bethany Christian Services, a foster care and adoption agency that has a federal contract to house immigrant children. She took the job out of college, hoping to help people with whom she could identify -- having come to the United States, albeit with her parents, when she was 2.
Ms. Acevedo was just settling into the role when things suddenly became more chaotic, in the late summer of 2017. Unlike the teenagers she was used to working with, who had intentionally crossed the border alone, the separated children who began to arrive were inconsolable when they reached her. Each new one seemed to traumatize the rest all over again. "It was horrible," she said. "We could not do work. It was just a classroom full of crying kids all day."
Even after covering family separations for over a year, as an immigration reporter for the National desk at The New York Times, I was struck by how much they uprooted not only the lives of family members who were divided from each other, but also the people like Ms. Acevedo who were charged with caring for them. While she was on call, Ms. Acevedo had to be available 24-7. She often waited up after midnight to meet newly separated children arriving at her office, transported from the border by contract workers. She would be roused from bed by phone calls about children who refused to eat or leave their rooms until they were allowed to speak to the parents from whom they had been separated.
Ms. Acevedo was particularly good at soothing them during outbursts, which usually meant going from classroom to classroom and pulling up videos of songs from "Frozen" or "Moana" on her phone. It helped that she could identify with the children. She still remembers the day in first grade when she had to participate in a classroom discussion about family. She didn't know how to say in English that she didn't have any siblings, so she lied and said she had a brother.
Many of the parents of children on her caseload ended up being deported, ending any hope of a quick reunion. When that happened, she would meet with her fellow caseworkers and staff therapists, sometimes for hours, to discuss how to break the news to the child. They used pictures and puppets to illustrate the distance between the United States and countries like Guatemala. And they spoke in intentionally vague terms to avoid making false promises about when the children might be able to see their parents again, after learning the hard way that even those who were barely old enough to talk would latch on to any concrete expectation.
"We would have to say, 'In many, many days you will be reunited with your parent, but we have to do a lot of paperwork,' " she told me, mimicking the soft voice she would use with an upset child. "The kids would still be like, 'O.K., when am I going?' They would start crying and it wasn't just tears, it was screams."
Parents who were in detention would call to ask whether they should give up their asylum claims, as Constantin's father had. They said they had been promised they would get their children back. Ms. Acevedo would tell them she had received no such assurance from the federal government and could not advise them on how to proceed. "The parents would sign in desperation and then, the next thing you know, they would call me from their home country and say, 'I'm here, where's my child? Give me my child back."'
Ms. Acevedo's account matched up with our understanding of how the separations began -- with little planning or communication from federal authorities to the workers who would be tasked with handling them -- yet it made clearer just how little guidance was in place to minimize harm to the children, or to ensure they would be quickly reunited with a family member.
Most days after work, she cried in her car before she left the parking lot. She checked the news on her phone constantly, watching CNN until she went to bed, hoping to find out when the family separations would end. In her dreams she would file a piece of paperwork late or incorrectly, and a child would be kept from going home.
After all the children in her care were reunited with their parents, she quit her job and took several months off work. Even now, she tries not to think about those months. "When I left," she said, "I didn't want to turn back to that."

'Men in Black' Leads Parade Of Slumping Sequels

Texto completo: The latest entry in the "Men in Black" series arrived at the top of the box office this weekend, but its black suits aren't as sharp as they once were.
Sony's "Men in Black: International" sold $ 28.5 million in domestic tickets Friday through Sunday. While that was enough to make it the best-selling movie in North American theaters this weekend, it was a moderately disappointing result given that analysts expected sales above $ 30 million -- and that the movie's production budget was reportedly over $ 100 million.
True to its name, "Men in Black: International" took in more overseas; according to the studio, it sold an additional $ 73.7 million in tickets internationally this weekend.
The sequel replaces Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, the stars of the first three "Men in Black" blockbusters, with Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, pitting the new pair against alien invaders abroad. Many critics found that formula stale, and the movie holds a 24 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
"Nearly everything here reminds you of something else, often better, cleverer, funnier," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. ("'Innocuous!' would be my pull quote," she added.)
It's the second weekend in a row to be led by a sequel that failed to meet expectations. "The Secret Life of Pets 2," from Universal and Illumination, underperformed but nonetheless opened at No. 1. That movie fell to second place this weekend, with $ 23.8 million in domestic sales. Disney's "Aladdin," another family-friendly option that's been out for four weekends now, came in third, with $ 16.7 million.
And things are looking dire for "Dark Phoenix." That "X-Men" sequel from Fox sold just $ 9 million in domestic tickets this weekend, its second in theaters. That's a 73% drop from last weekend according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data, and a feeble figure considering the movie's reported $ 200 million budget. The movie also earned $ 24.2 million overseas, according to the studio.
"Rocketman," Paramount's Elton John biopic, rounded out the top five with $ 8.8 million in domestic sales.
Warner Bros.'s "Shaft" sequel, the only newcomer in the top 10 other than "Men in Black: International," also disappointed in its first weekend, selling just $ 8.3 million in tickets -- well below expectations.
Sequel lovers (or, at least, industry players nervous about sequel fatigue) can take comfort in the impending release of "Toy Story 4," which is due later this week and promises to break the streak, for better or worse.

Backing off congressional pay raise was prudent move

Texto completo: Just when we were thinking those rambunctious young newcomers in Congress were so eager to overthrow the old way of doing things and defy their elders, they went and did something sensible.
Some of those same first-term Democrats who seem so single-mindedly dedicated to impeaching the president, advancing their "New Green Deal" and one-upping each other on the cable TV shout shows apparently had a moment of lucidity. Somebody, somehow prevailed on their political survival instincts long enough to make them realize that this might not be a real good time for Congress to give itself a big pay raise.
Rank-and-file members already make $174,000 a year. Congress hasn't had a raise in 10 years but the House leadership in both parties recently agreed on a $4,500 bump. A lot of the new members were pushing for it, having fully realized about six months ago how much it can cost to maintain homes in Washington and back in their districts – especially if those districts are in places like New York or San Francisco.
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., worked out kind of a political truce with Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the second-ranking Republican. They were going to let the $4,500 glide through with a big appropriations bill, agreeing neither party would make an issue of the pay raise in next year's elections.
Yeah, sure, that could happen. We all know that next year's races, from President Trump on down the ballot, will be Socratic discussions of real issues, devoid of personal attacks or distortion of any officeholder's or challenger's voting record. Just like our elections have always been.
But just as the spending bill was being prepared for the House floor, the New York Times reported last week, some of those fearless first-termers went to Hoyer and suggested he delete the pay raise provision for yet another year. Some of the Democrats who boosted their party into the majority had won some extremely close races and, in a presidential year with higher turnout, they did not want a pay raise around their necks as they fought to keep their new jobs in Washington.
There's a good argument to be made for a raise. A six-figure salary sounds nice, but it's not all that much by Washington standards. And it has been 10 years. And most of those members could go lobby for big companies and make a lot more, without the headaches of living in the public spotlight.
But there's an even better argument to be made against a raise. A whole lot of constituents, whose taxes pay congressional salaries, don't make anywhere near $174,000. And every member knew the salary when he or she ran for Congress. If they can do better lobbying, there are ample crowds of candidates who'd just love to replace them in the Capitol.
If timing is everything in politics, this must be the worst time since – well, maybe ever – for members of Congress to remind us what we don't like about themselves. It's surprising they'd even broach the subject. In most districts, people like their own members but, from coast to coast, Congress as a whole is held in low esteem. You name the issue – health care, immigration, political ethics, managing our money – there's hardly any pressing societal need that Congress hasn't forthrightly addressed, and made worse.
And then there's just plain old political possibilities. If the raise had stayed in the appropriations package, the Republican minority would have voted against it, along with several Democrats in politically precarious positions back home. If it escaped the House, the GOP-run Senate would have blocked it, so the Democrats would have hung themselves out there for nothing.

Waiting for new lungs, advocating for others

Texto completo: Nineteen-year-old Maddi Bertrand of Glen Ellyn is a leading voice in a somber new video by The New York Times, which notes that 11,000 Americans will die this year while waiting for organ transplants. Chicago’s Lurie Children’s Hospital will give Maddi a Hope and Courage award Wednesday for her wide range of contributions, including her advocacy efforts that helped lead to a change in the legal age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21 in Illinois as of July 1.
She’s been raising money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation since she staged Maddi’s Marvelous Mayfair fundraiser at the age of 7. She’s successfully lobbied for smoke-free bike paths and parks. She never turns down a chance as a speaker to raise funds and awareness on behalf of people with cystic fibrosis.
"And I will for the rest of my life until a cure is found," Maddi says. Then she coughs a dozen times into a paper towel, grimaces, removes the oxygen tubes from her nose to blow into a tissue, and pauses for nearly a minute to give her body time to catch up. CF is a life-shortening, progressive, genetic disease that affects the pancreas and causes a thick mucus to form in the lungs.
"I’m definitely sicker than I was a month ago," she says. The attention and awards are nice, but what she really wants is a new set of lungs.
Born in Pennsylvania, one of the few states at the time that tested newborns for cystic fibrosis, Maddi got diagnosed and started treatment earlier than many CF patients, says her mother, Linda Bertrand.
"When I was in elementary school and middle school, I could do sports," Maddi says, noting that she even played the rough game of lacrosse. "Whenever I’d join a team, I’d get sick, end up in the hospital, and then the season would wind down."
She plays the flute and piano, did martial arts with her brother, and was healthy enough to be a section leader in the marching band and take on roles in a couple of plays during high school.
"I’ve gone from this tiny backpack to a tank because I’ve been needing more oxygen," says Maddi, whose senior photos featured one with the oxygen tubes and one without. She takes a couple dozen pills each day, and undergoes three or four daily lung treatments. In spite of missing weeks of school, she made it to prom and graduated from Glenbard West High School in 2018 with the rest of her class. On Feb. 2, 2018, she went on the lung transplant waiting list.
"She’s a very smart, determined and wonderful young woman," says Lisa Mulvaney, coordinator of the creative arts program at Lurie Children’s, and the person who recruited Maddi for the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board in 2013. "From Day One, she was really invested in this group of kids and about making the hospital even better. She never wants to miss a meeting."
Maddi dragged her oxygen tank onto a Metra train and ordered a ride service once she got into Chicago to make one board meeting. Because CF patients can get sick when near other CF patients, Maddi is the only representative of that disease on the board, which has members aged 12 to 19.
"She really displays such hope and such courage," Mulvaney says. "She wants to give as much as she can."
As a freshman in high school, Maddie became the first CF patient to complete the Xtreme Hike: a one-day, 21-mile hike with her mom through the hills of the Manistee National Forest in Michigan. Maddi has helped host three proms for the inpatients at Lurie Children’s. She attended the first International Children’s Advisory Network summit in Washington, D.C. Her mother recalls how Maddi didn’t get a chance to meet with then-U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois. "But I recognized his wheelchair at the airport," says Maddi, who walked up, introduced herself, and had a nice chat about the importance of funding research for CF and other diseases that affect children.
The New York Times video featuring Maddi was produced by Kendall Ciesemier, an original member of the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board from Wheaton, and a member of the 2010-11 Daily Herald Leadership Team. At age 11, Ciesemier founded Kids Caring 4 Kids, which helps children in Africa impacted by AIDS. Her work was recognized by then-President Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey. Born with a rare liver disorder, Ciesemier was the recipient of two liver transplants.
"I want people to know that donating organs is so important and that I wouldn’t be alive without the generosity of a stranger," Ciesemier says via email. "I take the gift that someone gave me very seriously and I focus a lot on paying it forward. … I like to believe that I can give people hope."
Maddi says she maintains her hope.
"Of course, I want new lungs, but I’ll wait as long as it takes. I’m happy," says Maddi, who notes the transplant wait is tricky. "I have to be really sick to be at the top of the list, but I have to be healthy enough for the surgery. This is so crazy."
She gets support from her brother Zach, 16, and sisters Grace, 13, and Gabbi, 11, but Maddi says her strength comes from her Christian faith. "God’s in control," she says. "Whenever I’m down and don’t know if I can do this, I lean on God. I know He will get me the right pair of lungs."
She’s learning to play a new religious song on the piano, with the lyric, "I will fight for you." Transplanted lungs would be free of CF, but recovery from the surgery can be grueling, and requires lifelong medications and care. Imagining her life with new lungs and the ability to breathe, Maddi sees herself going to college and becoming a trainer who works with dolphins at Clearwater Marine Aquarium, the Florida not-for-profit whose care of sick and injured marine animals was made into two "Dolphin Tale" movies. Anchored close to home while she waits for her transplant, Maddi also dreams of traveling to Florida, New York, Hawaii and California, and doing some of those things that CF denied her.
"When I get these new lungs," Maddi says, breaking into a sly grin, "I want to live a little first."

Texto completo: Earlier this month, Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator and original star of the hit musical “Hamilton,” made a surprise trip to Austin. He hung out with Robert Rodriguez and dropped in on the touring production of his show, which closes at Bass Concert Hall on Sunday. He also joined his father, community organizer Luis Miranda Jr., at a fundraiser for the Latino Victory Fund, a political action committee dedicated to increasing Latino representation at all levels of government. Luis Miranda is the PAC’s board chair.
The two Mirandas sat down with the Statesman after the fundraiser, and with Father’s Day on the horizon, our conversation drifted toward fatherhood. Here are a few excerpts from our interview; read the full interview at austin360.com.
American-Statesman: I’ve read in interviews that when you read Ron Chernow’s biography of Alexander Hamilton, you immediately thought of your father. What are some parallels you see between your father’s life and that of Alexander Hamilton, and are there any moments in the production that are peak Luis Miranda?
Lin-Manuel Miranda: When I started reading Ron Chernow’s biography, the first thing I was struck by was, oh, he was born in the Caribbean like my dad. He was born in Nevis and raised in St. Croix. My dad was born and raised in Puerto Rico. He came to New York on the strength of his scholarship, just like my dad, at the same age, at age 18. And also, he sort of got everywhere he wanted to get on the strength of his intellect, and that, to me, reminded me a lot of my father. And also, he was never content to do one job when he could be doing five jobs, and that was also Luis Miranda.
I tell people I’m the laziest member of my family, and they never believe me until they meet my parents and they go, “Oh, yeah, you’re kind of a slacker compared to everyone else in your family.” And so, when I’m playing Hamilton, I honestly think I’m playing a variation on my father of this sort of “we only have so much time, let’s go.” I was the kid who did his homework on the bus to school Monday morning, and this guy did it Friday night, and that’s what you need to know about Hamilton, or my version of Hamilton.
Early this year, you took the touring production of “Hamilton” to Puerto Rico. What made that experience so special?
On a purely selfish level, to bring your art to your parent’s birthplace is incredibly meaningful. I brought my first show “In the Heights” there in 2010. It was the first equity show ever to go to Puerto Rico. It just doesn’t occur to people to put their sets on a boat and go to Puerto Rico. They stay on the mainland, most major U.S. tours. That week doing “In the Heights” there was the best week of my life, and so I knew as soon as we got a good review (of “Hamilton”) in The New York Times that this show would be lucky enough to have a tour and I was going to bring the tour to Puerto Rico. And then, in the wake of Hurricane Maria, the conversation changed from “How do we bring ‘Hamilton’ to Puerto Rico?” to “How do we do as much good as we can in our three weeks on the island?”
The idea of legacy comes up a lot in Hamilton. Your father has obviously left a huge legacy for you. As a young father yourself, what is the legacy you hope to leave for your children?
My oldest son is 4 1/2. My littlest one is 16 months, I have two boys. We had a parent-teacher conference Monday, and our teacher told us that our son has been really great at story time, but he has a friend play drums in the background while he (reads), and I went, “Oh, boy.”
I think your biggest job as a parent, and I try to do this every day, I’m sure I fall short, but what I try to do is instill empathy in our children, because I think that’s the magic bullet for everything else. I think if you could walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, if you could imagine what they’re going through, you’re a better person. You’re a better collaborator. You’re a better friend. You’re a better sibling. That’s what we work the hardest on is empathy, and it’s amazing.
It really is a time machine to have children, because you watch everything you struggled through. You watch your kids go through it at every age, and so it’s been one of the great joys of my life.

El Paso said it wasn't paid when President Trump visited

Texto completo: Days after President Donald Trump announced that he would kick off his 2020 presidential bid with an Orlando rally June 18, news surfaced that El Paso, Texas, was still waiting to be paid $470,000 from a February campaign visit.
The El Paso Times revealed this week that the Trump campaign did not pay the border town what it was owed after the "Make America Great Again" event that Trump used to tout his plans for a wall.
So far, Trump is making on-time payments to Orlando. The city received the first $72,000 installment from the campaign that was due June 3, said Cassandra Lafser, a spokeswoman for Mayor Buddy Dyer. The final installment is due June 10.
That is business as usual in Orlando, where venues require payment in advance of events, Lafser said.
The campaign was charged $145,771.34 for the Orlando event, which reflects the total cost for using the Amway Center - $15,000 plus tax for a set-up day, and $15,000 plus tax for the event - plus other expenses and taxes, according to the contract.
"There will be additional impacts to the area outside of the event venue," Lafser said in an email. "As with any presidential visit, these costs for police will be absorbed by the local agency."
The Trump campaign paid $5,000 in advance to use the El Paso County Coliseum for the February rally, the Times reported. The majority of the money owed, about $381,000, is to its police department, with other costs going toward the fire department, streets and maintenance, public transit and aviation.
Beto O'Rourke, who led a counter-protest in El Paso the same day as Trump's rally, made good on the $21,000 he owed the city.
By April, the Trump campaign had raised more than $40 million, the New York Times reported, and has a goal of raising $1 billion.
The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit news organization, reported at least three dozen local agencies - governments and law enforcement agencies - were owed money by presidential campaigns about two months after the 2016 election.
Citing interviews with 60 local officials as well as invoices and other records, the Center reported that campaigns for Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders owed "hundreds of thousands of dollars" in bills from campaign events.
Trump announced his Orlando visit last week, stating that First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Second Lady Karen Pence would be in attendance as well.
The rally highlights the importance of Florida and the I-4 Corridor in the upcoming campaign, with the state capable of swinging the presidency for either party.

Radio days alive and well at Marshfield studio

Texto completo: Radio, the theater of imagination, brought live drama to millions of American homes in the decades before the arrival of the television screen. This month the Talking Information Center, a regional reading service with thousands of daily listeners, is drawing on the techniques and traditions of live radio theater to share the old magic of the spoken word with both the visually impaired and the general audience.
Powered by its volunteers, the Marshfield-based station will stage a live production of “Rebecca," a taut psychological mystery penned by Daphne du Maurier in 1938, a dark year when families regularly gathered around their radios to listen to inspiring speeches by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
The Talking Information Center's main business is to provide live and recorded content for visually impaired and “print-impaired" listeners. Conditions such as advanced MS and Parkinson's disease can make the act of turning pages impossible, executive director Anna Dunbar said.
The service's volunteers read content from daily newspapers every day on the station. Readings from magazines and books also are broadcast. In addition to live readings, recorded readings are available at ticnetwork.org.
But entertainment such as live radio theater is also part of the package.
“We think it's important to provide well-rounded programming for our listeners," Dunbar said. “Our goal is to help our listeners to live autonomous, independent, and fulfilled lives."
Attending a radio theater production reveals how actors, directors, and sound-effects wizards put on their shows in radio's heyday, volunteer reader Mary Kay of Quincy said.
“They read from scripts, use several different mikes, have great sound effects," said Kay, who attended a recent production of “Arsenic and Old Lace," a film classic featuring Cary Grant's comic hamming.
Volunteer Karen Hayes of Kingston, a former Boston Globe staffer, is making her directorial debut in “Rebecca." After a career in journalism, Hayes looked to the reading service as an opportunity to give back. She began by reading newspaper stories live, then took part in the active radio theater program led by theater professional Eric Joseph, who has since departed.
Hayes has performed in eight productions, recently voicing the role of an elderly poisoner in “Arsenic."
Unlike film or TV, radio narrows an actor's focus. “It's all about the voice," she said.
But directing poses another challenge. Sound effects are crucial in radio dramas, Hayes said, and it's up to the director to produce the right sound at the right moment. The center's live productions use recorded sound effects, but nuance is important and timing is crucial. Doors are knocked hard or tapped softly. Footsteps may scamper with agitation, or amble slowly.
Both the general audience and the visually impaired are invited to attend the live broadcast in the center's studio at 130 Enterprise Drive on Thursday, June 27, at 7 p.m. Seating is limited; reserve a space by contacting Lorraine Bottelli at 781-834-4400 or e-mail lbottelli@ticnetwork.org. There's no admission fee, but donations are appreciated.
Radio theater productions also give the audience a chance to meet some of the center's dedicated volunteers. Relying entirely on volunteer readers, the service broadcasts 24 hours a day to 30,000 listeners statewide.
Edith Griffiths of Marshfield is one of those steady listeners who depend on the day-in, day-out efforts of volunteer readers to connect with the world of print.
“I could not do without it," she said. At age 93, blind in one eye and suffering from macular degeneration, her memory is strong. “I can tell you what's on from 8 in the morning until noon."
Here's the schedule devoted listener Griffiths has memorized: The Wall Street Journal at 8 a.m.; Boston Globe at 9 a.m.; Boston Herald at 10; Washington Post at 11; and New York Times at noon.
“Most of the people who read are angels of mercy," she said. “That's the way I feel. I really depend on it a lot. I do love the TIC. . . . I can't say enough about it. They do so much good, give so much time, and present it in a lovely manner."
Kay is one of those “angels," reading from the Globe for an hour on Wednesday mornings since her retirement a couple of years ago.
“My partner and I read it together as a team and it's one of my favorite times of the week," she said. Two readers share the hour because “you need to take a breath between stories."
Though not a fan, she throws in a sports story, recently reading one that focused on a controversial “big hit" in the Stanley Cup finals. “I don't think it's fair to listeners," she said, “to read only the stories that would interest me."
Listeners can hear the service's dedicated readers via a TIC radio receiver, or access the service online at ticnetwork.org by clicking on the “listen now" button; recorded readings and podcasts also are available through the website. You can also call 781-834-5836 on your phone; or get a smartphone app. Members of Android nation using Amazon Alexa and Google Home are invited to command, “Alexa (or Hey Google), play radio station Talking Information Center!" For more information on the range of options, see the website.

A 'Daily' Series for a Crucial Moment

Texto completo: [Welcome to our newsletter for "The Daily" podcast. You can listen to the latest episode of "The Daily" here and subscribe to our newsletter here .]
This week, we aired a five-part special series, " The Battle for Europe ," on the state of the European Union. Producers Lynsea Garrison and Clare Toeniskoetter tell us about one of the people they met along the way:
At the end of the series, you heard from Uwe Dziuballa, a Jewish restaurant owner in Chemnitz, Germany, who spoke about the fragility of democracy. But during our travels, we heard from another person whose story stuck with us.
As we made our way by train from Warsaw back to Berlin, we were sitting in a small, six-person train car when an attendant opened the door. She said something to us in Polish. We had no idea what she was saying.
But a man sitting across the aisle from us helped translate -- helped us get a coffee. And we struck up a conversation with him. He'd overheard us talking, and was interested in our series on nationalism and populism.
His name was Wit. He was heading home to Poznan, a city in western Poland. He's 36, and part of a generation in Eastern Europe that knows life both with and without the European Union.
We asked him about the importance of the E.U. His answer surprised us.
He said, the world in which the E.U. was born -- that world is gone.
Globalization, big corporations, a powerful China -- when Europe was fighting for democracy, these forces were not in the equation. Today, these new forces are colliding with old systems, and that's creating the populism we're seeing today, he said. That's creating the unrest, the desire for something new.
In Wit's eyes, Europe was losing relevance in a changing world, and liberal democracy was no longer serving the needs of its people. He didn't think we faced the problem of a split Europe yet, but thought that it might be on the horizon. That perhaps, in his words, "we're on the verge of something new."
While Uwe, the restaurant owner, talked about the impermanence of a democratic system, Wit questioned whether it was the right one at all.
As we traveled from country to country, we heard from many people who shared Wit's concerns. They spoke of their sense that this was a crucial moment, with no less at stake than a narrative of history and a sense of national and personal identity.
But these concerns are leading to very different visions for the future of Europe.
We don't know which vision will come to pass. But we'll keep following them as they play out on the world stage.
Talk to Lynsea Garrison ( @lynsea ) and Clare Toeniskoetter ( @claretoenis ) on Twitter.
______
About those covers of "The Daily" theme song
For the series this week, Lynsea and Clare wanted to do something different with our theme song. So they asked the musicians they encountered while walking through the streets of Europe for help. They'd play a recording of the theme song, or sometimes sing the notes, and ask the musician to play it back.
"Everyone was pretty confused as we approached them with giant microphones," Clare told us, "but all of the musicians we met gave it a shot." Our producers came back with cover versions performed on an acoustic guitar (which we heard in the France episode), a piano (Italy), a music box (Poland), an accordion (which perhaps we'll hear one day) and an electric guitar (today's episode). Listen to a clip of Marek Roscovski, the electric guitarist pictured above, playing today's theme song in Gdansk, Poland. Bonus: Lynsea and Clare sing along.

The story behind the trip
A couple of newsletters ago, we told you we were headed to London for an event about our week of episodes focused on Europe. Listen to a live recording of the event to hear the backstory of how the series came together, from why Katrin wanted to hit the road in Europe to how Clare invited herself along for the ride.
______
On "The Daily" this week
■ Part 1: With nationalist movements sweeping Europe and the U.K., can the E.U. survive? Katrin Bennhold, Lynsea Garrison and Clare Toeniskoetter hit the road, stopping first in Germany, to find out.
■ Part 2: "It was almost like after Macron, people here were kind of done with leaders." We head to France and spend a day with a group of Yellow Vest protestors.
■ Part 3: Italy is on the front lines of a wave of populism, and it's where we follow a rising far-right star on the campaign trail to understand what's driving the movement.
■ Part 4: In Poland, a nationalist party has been in power since 2015. We went to Warsaw and Gdansk to see what that means for democracy.
■ Part 5: Back in Germany, we reflect on the future of Europe. "I guess one of my biggest takeaways is that I don't think we have a Europe problem," Katrin says. "I think we have a democracy problem."

Texto completo: NBC has announced the lineup of candidates who will appear during each night of the first Democratic National Committee debates later this month.
The field of 20 candidates has been split into two groups. According to NBC, which is hosting the debate, the group debating on the first night will feature Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro, Tim Ryan, Bill de Blasio, and Jay Inslee. The candidates will debate Wednesday, June 26.
The second group, who will debate Thursday, June 27, will feature Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, Michael Bennet, Marianne Williamson, Eric Swalwell, Andrew Yang, and John Hickenlooper.
The Democratic National Committee says it divided the candidates at random but ensured that contenders considered front-runners would not be stacked on one night to avoid the impression that one night was more important than the other.
The debates in Miami will offer a prime opportunity for many White House hopefuls to reshape a race defined in recent weeks by Biden's domination of national and many early state polls.

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Un bebé de 4 meses llamado Constantin Mutu es el niño migrante de menor edad identificado hasta el momento entre las miles de víctimas de la separación de familias en la frontera Estados Unidos-México por la política de “tolerancia cero” del gobierno de Donald Trump, reveló este viernes The New York Times.
Exclusive: We found the youngest known child separated from his parents at the border under President Trump. He was only 4 months old https://t.co/IHSAe6ebrs
— The New York Times (@nytimes) June 14, 2019
Un episodio en “The Weekly”, la nueva serie de televisión producida por el NYT, aborda las vicisitudes que atravesó el pequeño rumano, enviado a los cuatro meses a un hogar de acogida lejos de sus padres, que habían viajado a México desde Rumania con dos de sus cinco hijos -él y un niño de 4 años- para pedir asilo en Estados Unidos en 2018.
Los agentes fronterizos estadounidenses detuvieron en Texas al padre, Vasile, y al bebé Constantin, y después la madre, Florentina, y el otro hijo y los padres y el hijo mayor tuvieron que volver a Rumania.
De acuerdo a la historia que adelanta el diario, el padre de Constantin tiene antecedentes criminales y aseguró haber recibido “presiones para retirar la petición de asilo”.
Vasile Mutu fue enviado a un centro de detención y finalmente lo deportaron a Rumanía, mientras que las autoridades colocaron a Constantin, que tenía solo 4 meses de edad, en una familia de acogida en el estado de Michigan, al noreste de Estados Unidos.
“Cuando el presidente Trump se rindió a la presión y firmó una orden ejecutiva que paralizaba las separaciones, un juez dio paso a una demanda que pretendía reunir a las familias y preparó el camino de vuelta a Rumanía para Constantin”, señala el rotativo, que visitó al pequeño en el hogar de acogida y a sus padres en Rumania.
El Times reveló el año pasado que las autoridades estaban separando a los menores de sus familias en la frontera, acusó a las autoridades de no cuantificar el problema, y después calculó que en octubre había más de 700 niños migrantes separados de adultos que los reclamaban como sus hijos.

Southern border crisis is real, and Congress must act

Texto completo: Last week, as American and Mexican officials haggled over how to address the migrant crisis at their countries' shared border, United States Customs and Border Protection released its monthly migration statistics. They tell an alarming story.
In May, 144,278 migrants were taken into custody. It was the third consecutive month in which apprehensions topped 100,000 and the highest one-month total in 13 years.
Unequipped to deal with the crush, border facilities and migrant shelters are dangerously overcrowded, and the staff is overburdened. Dysfunction, disease and even death are a growing reality.
"We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger: The system is broken," the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, John Sanders, said.
Also last week, officials said that the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency assigned to care for unaccompanied migrant children, would begin cutting services "not directly necessary for the protection of life and safety." This includes English classes, legal aid and recreational programs.
Democrats and other administration critics called the move "cruel" and "illegal," but the financial reality is that the agency is overwhelmed. So far this fiscal year, it has taken charge of nearly 41,000 unaccompanied children — a 57 percent increase over last year. The entire program could run out of funding by the end of June. In short, it is time for Congress to stop dithering and pass emergency funding to deal with this nightmare.
It has been more than a month since the administration sent Congress a request for $4.5 billion in additional border assistance. A large portion of the money, $3.3 billion, was earmarked for humanitarian aid. But a relatively modest piece of the request aimed at shoring up border security operations has tied negotiators in knots.
Early on, Democrats were opposed to funding additional detention beds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Republicans had problems with Democrats' demands for changes in the administration's asylum policies. At one point, negotiators thought they were close to resolving these conflicts, only to have other issues snarl the process. Beyond the money for security, one of the remaining disagreements is how much data sharing will be allowed between the agencies responsible for caring for migrant children and those that handle border enforcement.
The broader problem is that many Democrats have come to view the Trump administration as untrustworthy, and they are loath to hand over one more penny for anything to do with immigration. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have been particularly adamant, insisting that their leadership take a hard line in negotiations. In part, they fear that the administration will spend any additional funding on enforcement rather than humanitarian needs.
There is much to despise about this administration's immigration policies, which are exacerbating this crisis, but there should be no ambivalence about the urgency of addressing the humanitarian needs. While lawmakers wring their hands and drag their feet, tens of thousands of migrant children are suffering.
Congress needs to get serious about dealing with that suffering.

Tax fights swirl inside, outside

Texto completo: The two New Jersey tax incentive programs at the heart of multiple investigations may be extended before their June 30 deadlines, as two Assembly committees voted Thursday to keep the programs alive until some point in 2020.
Meanwhile, thousands of union members and activists rallied outside the Statehouse in favor of a millionaires tax and against Senate President Stephen Sweeney's proposed changes to public pensions and health care.
Two tax credits meant to spur development and create and keep jobs in the state, GrowNJ and the Economic Redevelopment & Growth (ERG) programs, are set to end at the end of the month, around the same time when the Legislature and governor must agree on a budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
The Assembly Commerce and Economic Development committee and the Appropriations committee considered a bill that would push the deadline from June 30, 2019, to Jan. 31, 2020, proposed by Budget Chair Eliana Pintor Marin, D-Essex. The commerce committee also discussed a bill to change GrowNJ requirements.
Only invited individuals from unions, trade associations and nonprofits were allowed to speak at the commerce hearing in order to make sure the bill can be handed off on time for the appropriations committee to consider. If members of the public want to weigh in, they have to submit comments in writing, said Kevin McArdle, spokesman for the Assembly Democrats.
Activists with the group Working Families, a group critical of the tax incentives, interrupted the start of the hearing by placing seven cardboard boxes on the witness desk to submit as public testimony in protest.
The boxes contained more than 50,000 pages of emails between a lawyers at Parker McCay and officials at the Economic Development Authority. The New York Times, ProPublica and WNYC reported that an attorney with Parker McCay named Kevin Sheehan suggested language into late drafts of the legislation that created the tax incentives and frequently communicated with members of the Economic Development Authority, which issues the credits, as the bill was being written.
"These emails are a representation of unregistered lobbying between a politically connected corporation and until every single one of these emails have been reviewed by this committee, this law should not be extended," said Sue Altman, head of Working Families. "It is unprecedented that today there is no public testimony."
The invited speakers included Brandon McKoy, the president of the left-leaning NJ Policy Perspective, Megan Chambers of the union SEIU 32BJ, and members of the business community, including Michael McGuinness and Anthony Pizzutillo of the real estate nonprofit NAIOP-NJ, Andrew Musick of the NJ Business & Industry Association, Michael Egenton of the NJ State Chamber of Commerce and Christina Renna of the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey.
Gov. Phil Murphy has introduced his own set of five new incentives late last year that would cap awards for job creation and development, and said last week he would not "simply renew a set of incentive programs when serious questions exist about whether they have been successful."
"Extending bad legislation is not the way to attract business to our state. While the deadline is fast approaching, we believe there is still time to work with the Legislature to pass comprehensive tax incentive reform before the current programs expire," Murphy said in a statement.
Members of the New Jersey business community said it would be unwise to make hasty changes or let the programs timing run out.
"Recognizing that the current programs took approximately 18 months to effectuate, we cannot create a new, more effective, functioning program within the next two weeks," said Michael Egenton, executive vice president of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. "Nor can we allow for the current ones to expire. A state that lets its economic growth incentives lapse signals that it is 'out of business.'"
The commerce committee members unanimously voted the tax credit extension deadline out of committee, but many said they were doing so because they had no other option.
"Even though my name is on the extension bill, I'm disappointed that we're here," said Assemblyman Roy Freiman, D-Somerset, a sponsor of the bill. "We should have vetted through the governor's proposal. That said, [extending the programs] is the lesser of all evils."
The bill now heads to Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin to consider.
The Economic Development Authority tax break programs are the subject of multiple investigations, including by a state grand jury, both Assembly houses, and an independent task force hired by the governor. Murphy ordered the inquiry after a blistering comptroller's report suggested the agency didn't have processes in place to confirm companies were creating the jobs they promised in exchange for credits.
The task force raised questions about whether companies provided misleading information on applications to the state. Insurance broker George Norcross and companies connected to him that received tax breaks sued Murphy and the task force, claiming they had been falsely accused of misconduct and not given the opportunity to respond. In the midst of the suit, the task force postponed its final public meeting and the release of its findings.
Unions rally for millionaires tax As lawmakers moved forward legislation to keep the business tax incentives alive, union members rallied to pass a millionaires tax in this year's budget, a policy Murphy is pushing but Legislative leaders refuse to include. The protest was organized by the largest public workers union in the state, the Communication Workers of America, which also criticizes Sweeney's "Path to Progress" plan, a set of 27 bills that would change public health benefits and pension plans.
In a sea of protesters, most wearing red, 4-year-old Eva Slovinski stood out. Donning a red tutu, she hefted a sign reading: "I'd rather be playing but mommy can't afford a babysitter."
Her mother, Niki Slovinski, has taught high school in Franklin Lakes for 17 years.
"When I started teaching we paid nothing into health benefits," Niki Slovinski said. Over time that's increased to more than $500 a paycheck, she said, a burden for her as the sole income-earner in her family.
"Teaching is turning into a dead end profession," she added. She worries pension reform proposed by Sweeney would dip even further into her earnings.
"I worry about my pension," she said. "Since my pension is already underfunded, I worry by the time I retire maybe there won't be people paying into it so I can retire."
The Legislature is expected to send a budget bill to Murphy by June 20. It is unclear what Murphy will choose to do with it.

Oberlin, bakery lawyers fight over punitive damages; Jury decision expected on Thursday

Texto completo: ELYRIA, Ohio - In a small courtroom in Lorain County, attorneys litigating from both sides made sure the jury - barred from the media - knew the national waves their verdict was making about a case between Oberlin College and a family-owned bakery.

On Wednesday, the court reconvened to hear arguments pertaining to the second phase of the bifurcated case: Following the compensatory damages phase, the jury needs to decide on punitive damages.

Last week, the jury arrived at a compensatory dollar amount of $11 million to be paid by Oberlin College, which they determined to be the economic and noneconomic harm and loss suffered by the Gibson family, owners of Gibson's Food Mart and Bakery.

Punitive damages can be set to any amount under $22 million, which is twice the compensation amount awarded.

There can be no crime without appropriate responsibility and punishment. In our country, no one can expect or demand special treatment. -… The fabric of our country would fall apart if, in fact, you are a victim who tries to stop or protect against crime, [and] you are retaliated against, said Lee Plakas, lead attorney for the Gibson family.

Punitive damages are meant as both a punishment for the college and a deterrent for similar future conduct - not only for Oberlin, but for any other institution from committing similar acts, Mr. Plakas said. He said that the deterrence aspect of the case is the most important aspect for himself and the nation.

He told the jury that the punitive damages determined will protect everyone else in our country, in our state, in our community - protects them to ensure that they don't have to go through what the Gibsons went through.

If indeed there was interest, if indeed you come across stories in the New York Times, or the Washington Post, or FOX News on TV or CNN or Wall Street Journal -… why do you think they would have been and are so interested? Mr. Plakas asked the jury.

Mr. Plakas submitted to the jury that national interest in the case has arisen because of a national tipping point spurred by twin purposes: How society is recognizing a changing atmosphere in the country and how words have become weapons, and the importance of our educating youth properly.

Rachelle Zidar, an attorney for Oberlin College, reminded the jury of the power they have and the magnitude of their verdict nationwide. Ladies and gentlemen, you have spoken. You have sent a profound message. We have heard you. Believe me when I say, colleges across the country have heard you.

Ms. Zidar said the school knew something needed to change even before the jury issued their verdict. She said the school is more closely monitoring activities of student organizations, including how the college responds to student protests. She said the school is increasing oversight over its student senate and the resolutions it passes, improving internal communications, and making it clear from day one that the students will be held accountable for their actions and have a duty of good citizenship.

The college introduced a new orientation program named Community 101: An Obie's Guide to Being a Good Neighbor in August, 2018, for the new Oberlin first-year class. The program, which featured speakers including the chief prosecutor, city manager, and police chief, is designed to help new students think through their responsibilities as residents of the city of Oberlin, according to an email sent out by the college's president.

What are some things that aren't malice? Well obviously, negligence is not malicious. It's wrong; you can hold somebody liable for it. But it's not malicious, Ms. Zidar said. It's not bad judgment. It's not aloofness. It's not misguided ideology. It's not a failure to investigate. It's not foul language. It's not being inconsiderate, being rash, being impulsive.

The Gibson's legal team capitalized on the argument that was disallowed in the first compensatory, phase of the trial: the wealth and resources of Oberlin College.

Everything is relative, Mr. Plakas told the jury, saying that paying over $100 is a mosquito bite for a millionaire.

Mr. Plakas utilized the refrain comparing the trial to a David and Goliath battle, characterizing Oberlin as a billion-dollar institution that can afford, in this case, 11 attorneys.

Both sides cross-examined Rebecca Vazquez-Skillings, Oberlin vice president of finance and administration, attempting to give the jury a picture of the economic state of the university.

Representing the Gibson family, attorney Owen Rarric said that the college has over $1.4 billion in total assets. He pointed out that the college's endowment - a pool of donated money - holds a total of $887 million. He stated that annual student charges for tuition and room and board are roughly $70,000.

However, defending Oberlin, attorney Matthew Nakon clarified Mr. Rarric's numeric claims. He said that the college has been operating in an unsustainable deficit situation year after year - a situation caused largely by substantial declines in enrollment numbers. Mr. Nakon said that outside of a small portion of the endowment, the college has little to no discretion over how the endowment is spent.

Instead, individual donors hold this discretion. He also added that roughly 90% of Oberlin students are on scholarships.

Ms. Vasquez-Skillings emphasized that enrollment numbers have declined, and that the college has been operating at an unsustainable deficit. Ultimately what the punitive damages portion intends is to teach an institution not to pour gasoline on fires. What will it take to get them to change their attitude? What will it take to get others, similarly situated, to change their attitude?

The Gibson family attorneys also brought forward Meredith Raimondo, Oberlin vice president and dean of students, as a witness, who confirmed her writing of textual evidence - including text messages and emails - from the case. Oberlin lawyers brought current Oberlin president Carmen Twillie Ambar to testify about changes the college has been making.

Gibson attorneys also called Donica Thomas Varner, vice president, general counsel, and secretary for Oberlin, to testify about college public communications about the incident. She said the college respects the jury's decision, and also believes in the legal case that it put forward and in the truth of its defense.

On Thursday morning, attorneys from both sides will make their closing statements and the jury is expected to make a decision by the end of the day.

Texto completo: Even in the best of conditions, investigative reporting is hard -- digging up what people do not want exposed, sifting through hidden records, confronting the powerful. It is doubly difficult in closed societies without guarantees of press freedom. Two recent examples in Russia and China show just how hard and risky it can be.
Ivan Golunov's work for the online news organization Meduza displays an unusual knack for unearthing the Moscow city government's lavish spending. He reported that the purchase price for one of Moscow's most noticeable holiday decorations in 2017, lighted, wine-glass-shaped garlands, was overpriced by a factor of five. He exposed how a Moscow deputy mayor purchased nine penthouses in elite Moscow housing complexes for his family. He raised questions about the $46.3 million cost of renovating a city fountain. He also delved into the shady dealings of the funeral industry in Russia.
Last Thursday, while he was on his way to meet other journalists, police detained Golunov and charged him with intent to distribute illegal drugs. Such drug charges are a common way for the Russian police to set up people they want to punish. Golunov denied the charges, and tests did not show his fingerprints on any of the alleged contraband. Dozens protested the arrest, and three major newspapers published nearly identical front pages declaring in large type: "We are Ivan Golunov."
The very existence of Golunov's probing journalism in President Vladimir Putin's system of soft authoritarianism in Russia shows how pockets of independence persist amid overall state domination. The protests show that many of Golunov's colleagues remain willing to stand up for freedom despite the risks. On Tuesday, their protests were rewarded with an extraordinary turnabout: The government dropped all charges and announced that police officers who made the arrest would be investigated.
In China, investigative journalist Liu Wanyong was also a fearless prober, writing for the China Youth Daily, a paper run by the Communist Party but with a reputation for pushing censorship boundaries. Liu told Jane Perlez of the New York Times recently that he has quit journalism because the regime of President Xi Jinping has all but muzzled the hard-hitting stories he used to produce.
"At least 100 'juicy' stories were killed at the Youth Daily in the past two years," the Times article said. Instead of probing revelations, he said, the party wanted "positive-energy stories" that would make people feel good. For example, the facts behind a huge explosion at a chemical factory were never explained, Liu said. "The question of who is responsible is one of the first things people want to know in a calamity like that," he added. "But if you read our news, do you find this out? No." So Liu has gone to work in business.
Meanwhile, Xi has insisted that China's news media must have "the party as their family name." China has also begun blocking access to The Post and the Guardian within the country.
Journalism brings revelation, accountability and truth to a society. No wonder despots hate it so.

Fareed Zakaria: America squanders its power

Texto completo: NEW YORK — This week we watched an unusual spectacle. The foreign minister of Germany, one of the United States’ closest allies, went to Tehran and announced that a European payment system, designed as an alternative to the dollar-based one, would soon be ready. This visit was made in coordination with Britain and France, both of which helped create the new payment mechanism, called INSTEX.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2714612" src="https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Fareed-Zakaria-color.jpg?resize=300%2C232&ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="232" data-recalc-dims="1" />
INSTEX will probably fail or prove to be wholly inadequate in the short term. The dollar’s dominance in global transactions — which has been a huge benefit for America — will be hard to displace, but INSTEX is a warning sign, the canary in the coal mine. America’s closest allies are working hard to chip away at a crucial underpinning of U.S. global power.
Why? It’s simple: the Trump administration’s abuse of this power. The United States sits atop the world for now, but there are forces eroding that lofty status. Some of these are deep structural shifts, like the rise of China. But as The Economist points out, others are reactions to a pattern of hegemonic abuse.
Consider the trigger for this search for an alternative to the dollar. Britain, France and Germany are all signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. When the Trump administration unilaterally reneged on the pact last year — even though Iran had abided by it — the U.S. reimposed sanctions, using its dollar power to prevent other countries from doing business with Iran (since most international transactions use the dollar for convenience). Furious at this misuse of authority, the Europeans have set about trying to create a new payment system.
They are not the only ones. The Chinese, Russian and Indians have also been trying to create mechanisms that would allow them to escape the hegemony of the dollar. So far, these efforts have been largely ineffective. But if so many major trading nations, including key European ones, set out to subvert the dollar, they will eventually have some impact. Once upon a time, the British pound was the dominant international currency, but it was supplanted by the dollar. There is no iron law that says the dollar will be king forever.
Or look at the way the Trump administration has been wielding the threat of tariffs. In many cases, the administration has invoked “national security” concerns. The law that allows the president to levy such tariffs was passed during the Cold War to enable the country to preserve critical industries that might be needed to sustain the geopolitical contest with the Soviet Union. Canadian aluminum and Japanese-made SUVs don’t fit the bill, even if Trump thinks otherwise. As Jennifer Hillman, the former general counsel to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, wrote recently in The New York Times: “If the United States can justify tariffs on cars as a threat to national security, then every country in the world can most likely justify restrictions on almost any product under a similar claim.”
The United States has legitimate complaints about China’s trade practices. Beijing will often follow the letter of the law but find clever ways to undermine its spirit through loopholes and exceptions. But that is precisely what the Trump administration is itself doing. By misusing the national security exemption, it is weakening the very trade rules and international laws that it is asking China to follow. If I were a Chinese negotiator, I would simply explain that I would follow trade rules just as much as Donald Trump does.
Or consider Trump’s efforts to crush Chinese tech behemoth Huawei. So far, very few countries have followed America’s ban, but almost all are surely noting that if they remain reliant on crucial American technologies, Washington could suddenly cripple them on a whim. The result will be a greater desire for technological self-reliance and a shift away from American companies.
America still occupies a unique position in the world. But it is clear that we are moving into an era in which more players will have more power. Twenty years ago, China accounted for 3% of global GDP; today its share is 15% and rising. In such a period, it is all the more important that Washington act with restraint, use international institutions and try to establish consensus. As I write in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, “The rule for extending liberal hegemony seems simple: be more liberal and less hegemonic.” Trump appears intent on doing the opposite.
The administration is acting to achieve some short-term gains in limited transactions with other countries. But by abusing its power to do so, it is putting at risk the structure of the international system in which American power is so deeply embedded. It is a bad trade and one for which all Americans will pay the price in decades to come.

Pignanelli and Webb: Socialism will be a big issue in upcoming political races

Texto completo: Debate about socialism is already a big part of the presidential election currently underway. Bernie Sanders has doubled down on embracing Democratic Socialism and polls show many Democrats and young people prefer socialism over capitalism. We’re happy to join the argument.
Most Democratic candidates for president are advocating greater government control over large sectors of the economy. Does this indicate the country is moving toward socialism and rejecting capitalism?
Pignanelli: “Capitalists failed to defend the system that made them rich. They dummied up, hunkered down and waited for (the Recession) to pass." — Peggy Noonan
Socialism today is like yogurt, with various flavors and multiple perceptions of quality (nutritious or unhealthy) depending upon age of the customer. A majority of Americans are suspicious of too much government control. But many have a positive view of socialism as indicating equality or a Nordic style safety net. Further, polls indicate a majority of younger Americans (millennials and Generation Z) favor socialism and capitalism equally.
These trends are creating consternation. But the capitalists have only themselves to blame. Their public defense of the free market is wimpy. The fear of negative reactions by the New York Times or liberal lawmakers has silenced full-throated advocacy.
A classic example is the revisionist history of the Great Recession. With the best intentions to increase home ownership, Democrats and Republicans pushed government agencies to lower lending standards, fostering creative financing instruments. Although left-wing activists were privy to this behavior, they successfully molded public perception that greedy financiers were entirely at fault. Consequently, companies and organizations who should be defending the free market shiver in fear. No wonder young adults possess mixed, confusing, views. (The Pignanelli children are weary of my ranting on this topic.)
The good news is while millennials do not abhor “socialism,” they overwhelmingly express concern with too much government intrusion. So, in 20 years we may squint at the label used to describe the national economic yogurt, but it will have a tasty, healthy dose of capitalism.
Webb: Whether we call it socialism or just Big Government, we’re suffering an expansion of statism in virtually every aspect of our lives. And the Democratic presidential candidates would dramatically accelerate the trend.
We now look to government to solve every problem, large or small, which is why we have a $22 trillion national debt and the federal government spends (and borrows) about $3 billion more each day than tax revenues bring in.
As a society, we have concluded (and I don’t disagree) that a government-funded safety net is necessary. Thus, we have free public education, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and myriad additional welfare and other support programs. It would be politically impossible to eliminate or even scale back most of those programs.
But at the very least, we ought not to throw gasoline on the socialism fire by allowing nationalization of the entire health care system, by providing even more handouts like free tuition, and by mandating draconian control of most of the economy to fight climate change.
Margaret Thatcher was right that, “The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.” But we’ve been out of other people’s money for a long time. So we continue to borrow and spend ourselves into oblivion.
Bernie Sanders won over 80 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary in Utah in 2016. So, will Utah Democrats be pegged as socialists in 2020?
Pignanelli: Much depends on the how the Democratic nominee defines his or her policies early next summer. Although the majority of Utahns supported Medicaid expansion in 2018, they would reject anything labeled as “socialistic.” So local candidates will need to adhere to the principles of a strong social safety net, but openly distance themselves from national Democrats the GOP have successfully targeted with this moniker.
Webb: It’s worth remembering that what distinguishes government from other institutions in society is that government can employ the power of force and coercion. Bigger government, higher taxes and more regulation expand the amount of coercion and reduce the amount of freedom in our lives.
Certainly, some amount of coercion is needed and tolerable to ensure a well-ordered society. But voters ought to decide what level of taxation, debt, regulation and government coercion they’re willing to accept, and reject candidates at all levels who go beyond that point.
Republicans overwhelmingly reject socialism as a philosophy, but have they been consistent in their governing?
Pignanelli: Historically, Republicans encountered difficulty in scaling back entitlement programs, even when controlling Congress. They have greater success in reforming agency regulations.
Webb: I believe free enterprise, the profit motive, competition, capitalism, the magic of the marketplace, private ownership, success based on performance – whatever we want to call it — provides maximum freedom, happiness, jobs and economic vibrance.
However, capitalism is easily corrupted as gigantic corporations deploy hordes of lobbyists to influence government to tip the scales in their favor. Capitalism becomes crony capitalism when government picks winners and losers.

Planned Parenthood Will Sponsor Candidate Forum on Women's Health

Texto completo: Planned Parenthood Action Fund is set to host a forum on reproductive rights for the Democratic primary field this month, as the issue of abortion emerges as a central topic in the 2020 presidential race.
The forum, hosted by Planned Parenthood's political arm, is the first event in recent presidential campaigns singularly focused on women's health. The candidates will be individually questioned for 15 minutes about their positions and records on issues like abortion rights, access to health care and contraception.
So far, 16 candidates have agreed to participate, and more are expected. The event will take place in Columbia, S.C., on June 22, the same weekend as the state Democratic Party convention, when nearly all the candidates will be in the city to woo activists and officials.
[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]
Among the confirmed attendees are Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has recently moved left on the issue of abortion after facing sharp criticism from members of his own party. NowThis News, a video news outlet, will live-stream the event.
Organizers said the event aims not only to shape the views of the candidates but also to further energize Planned Parenthood's own supporters.
"It's crystal clear that access to reproductive health care -- including safe, legal abortion -- is a top issue heading into 2020," said Kelley Robinson, the group's executive director. "If the 13 million-plus Planned Parenthood supporters turn out to the polls and activate their networks, they can tip the 2020 election."
Planned Parenthood, which provides reproductive health care to 2.4 million people nationwide, has been facing intensified attacks during the Trump administration. While polls have found that most Americans have a favorable view of the organization, Republican critics are pushing to cut its federal funding by millions of dollars and to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
The forum comes toward the end of a busy legislative season in which Republican-controlled states have passed some of the strictest abortion laws in modern American history. Last month, Alabama passed a law that bans abortion at any stage of pregnancy, and in Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, signed a law banning abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.
While those laws are expected to be challenged in court, the new restrictions, combined with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, has turned support for abortion into a nonnegotiable position for Democratic candidates.
With all 23 Democratic presidential candidates supportive of abortion rights, the debate has centered on how aggressive party members should be in combating the state restrictions and what they would do if the Supreme Court were to overturn abortion rights nationwide.
As the candidates crisscrossed Iowa last weekend, nearly all pledged to fight for abortion rights, with several vowing to appoint only judges who would uphold the constitutional right to abortion.
"Make no mistake -- abortion is health care, and health care is a right, not a privilege," said Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.
Some of the remarks offered an implicit critique of Mr. Biden, who, after a career of trying to delicately navigate the issue, denounced a ban on all federal funding for abortions, known as the Hyde Amendment, that he had long supported.
[What is the Hyde Amendment? Here's a look at what it does, and why the politics have shifted.]
"I don't think there's room in our party for a Democratic candidate who does not support women's full reproductive freedom," said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
Many Democrats see abortion rights as a winning issue for the party, one that will energize the younger and female voters whose record turnout in the 2018 midterm elections helped the party win back control of the House of Representatives. They point to polling that shows broad majorities disapprove of abortion bans that do not include an exception for rape or incest, like the Alabama law.
Over all, 94 percent of white, college-educated, liberal Democrats say a woman should be able to obtain a legal abortion if she wants one for any reason, according to a New York Times analysis of the General Social Survey, a highly regarded survey that has asked Americans about their views for decades. But the rest of the party is split: Just 55 percent of all other Democratic-leaning respondents had the same opinion, and black Democrats were divided 50-50.

Democratic 2020 candidates shouldn't bother appealing to Trump Republicans: Today's talker

Texto completo: In the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, candidates appear to be splitting into two camps: presidential hopefuls who are calling for sweeping policy changes, and those who want to pursue a middle-ground strategy to attract Republicans voters.
Don't weaken the Democratic agenda
By Rekha Basu
Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper called Donald Trump the worst president in U. S. history; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , called Trump the most dangerous: “a liar, a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, a religious bigot and someone who believes that he is above the law. ”
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , a former prosecutor, said she could prosecute the case against the president. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said Trump’s behavior includes “lies, Twitter tirades and temper tantrums,” and must not be normalized.
Those depictions may have been red meat to the ears of 1,500 Iowa Democratic activists in Cedar Rapids Sunday. The Des Moines Register's Iowa Poll found that most Democrats who plan to caucus said they'd take any Democrat who could beat Trump. They have plenty of options among the 23 candidates, 19 of whom showed up, excluding the front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.
Talker: Think America can ditch Trump in 2020? The world says otherwise: Today's talker
The Democrats polling in second, third and fourth place in Sunday’s Iowa Poll for president also called for bold, sweeping structural changes. Sanders, in second place, challenged Democrats who believe in a middle-ground strategy "that antagonizes no one, that stands up to nobody and that changes nothing," saying that approach could cost them the election. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in third place, called for a wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1% of Americans, which she said could pay off student loan debts and cover child care and preschool.
But a stop heading out of town Sunday was a return to reality on what the Democrats are up against in Iowa: Voters who are squarely, defensively and angrily in the president’s corner, no matter what he says or does.
At the Wild Hogs Saloon & Eatery in Walford, Iowa, just mentioning the Democrats' event drew pushback. One man in the group of three people I approached to interview at the bar asked whether I'd be putting "fake news" in the paper.
A white woman who gave her age as over 70 said she left the Democratic Party years ago. She said calls for Trump’s impeachment come from Democrats who just can’t accept a Republican in office.
Asked why they support Trump, one of the two men with her said people used to be able to leave their cars unlocked but can’t anymore. A retired engineer, this man also has a problem with welfare recipients.
These are probably the sorts of Republicans Hickenlooper had in mind when he warned against Democrats giving Republicans the opportunity to attack them as socialists by promoting too much government. But there's little chance that the Trump supporters susceptible to such characterizations would vote Democratic anyway.
Working people would do better under Democratic policies. But the president effectively appealed to racial and religious bigotry, anti-gay sentiment and plain sexism. Democrats can't and shouldn't try to win by worrying what Republicans might think or say. Any victory that requires sacrificing universal health care, adequately funded education, immigration reform, reproductive rights, sentencing reform and a ban on corporate funding of elections would be a hollow one indeed.
What they should do was what former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas proposed. He called for bringing in tens of millions of new voters by allowing same-day voter registration and ending voter purges. Candidates and Democratic activists will need to do the long-term grassroots work of registering new voters by showing how their policies could most benefit them. Their outreach must include people of color, new citizens, union members, seniors, young people and low-wage workers.
Unless they stand up for truly Democratic principles, any electoral victory would be a hollow one.

What others are saying
Mike Davis, The Des Moines Register: "If Democrats want to appoint more judges, they should do it the tried-and-true way: simply win elections, instead of changing the rules because they lost. It will be no surprise if voters reject the Democrats’ radical court-packing agenda in the upcoming election. Voters have a choice between a president who has appointed judges who respect the rule of law, versus Democrat candidates who are attacking the independence of our federal judiciary. "
Mark Leibovich, The New York Times: "If there is something that unites the nearly two dozen Democrats currently in the field, it is that no one, really, knows how this works. It’s a cliché at this point to say that Trump changed politics in 2016, and that everyone — candidates, operatives and media — is still scrambling to understand the implications of his victory. No doubt, Trump humbled the experts (you’d hope) and blew up notions of how politicians should behave and what voters would allow. "
Betsy McCaughey, National Review: “It’s a worrisome spectacle. For 150 years, our two-party system has provided political stability envied by the rest of the world. Republicans and Democrats put forward broad agendas to compete for the widest number of voters. When one party wins, the other cedes power and cooperates in governing. Not this time. The Democratic contenders are espousing policies few Americans support and giving moderate and conservative members of their own party the cold shoulder. ”
What our readers are saying
I disagree. If Democrats want to stand a chance of beating Trump, they need to move toward the middle. I would love for them to put up a candidate I would vote for. So far, Biden is the only possibility.
— Kurt Johnson
The Republican Party has drifted so far to the right. And the Democrat Party has drifted so far to the left. There is no such thing as a moderate, which is what this country needs.
— John Gabriel
Centrists don't win because they have no plan, only repeated rhetoric year-after-year. So people jump to the extremists.
— Edward W. Greenlee
Frankly, I'd just as soon have a president who is an adult, knows and understands how government works, and has no need for near daily temper tantrums, while having his or her ego stroked. Competence would be high on the list.
— Steve Evets

Texto completo: Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson, business mogul from England, founder of multinational conglomerate Virgin Group, with a net worth of $4 billion (give or take), has a question for South Dakotans:
Why won't you get on my boat?
No, it is not a joke. Representatives from Branson contacted reporters at the Argus Leader on Wednesday to let them know Branson would be calling out the state's residents via billboards across the state and in a "open letter" advertisement in the New York Times on Thursday.
Branson's Virgin Voyages is launching a new cruise ship next year it has dubbed the Scarlet Lady. Reportedly passengers from 49 states have signed up, but not anyone from South Dakota.
Branson's reps shared photos of cheeky billboards in Rapid City and Sioux Falls ("Sioux...Ya gonna book or what?") asking the state's residents to, quite literally, get on board.
"Ahoy South Dakota – Richard Branson here. Where are you?" This was the opening line in Branson's advertisement in the New York Times.
"We hope to sea you soon," Branson concluded.
There is a perk for the first South Dakotan to sign up, his reps said. That person will get a prize package that includes plane tickets, a hotel stay, a limo ride to the ship and $605 in "Sailor Loot" for use on board the cruise ship.
There was no word as of Friday whether Branson's gambit to woo South Dakota has resulted in him booking another passenger.
Richard Branson is shown penning a letter to South Dakota in this publicity photo for his new venture, Virgin Voyages.

It is time to protect California’s energy diversity

Texto completo: The benefits of diversity are seemingly everywhere in California. We celebrate different lifestyles, religions, cultures, music, languages, cuisine and geography. The value of diversity can be seen in other ways, too, practical ones such as the popularity of mutual fund investments, eating a balanced diet or making sure an NFL team has a playbook with multiple options.
Everywhere one looks, we see the value of diversifying. If all your eggs are in one basket, you are more vulnerable should something happen to your basket. Diversifying makes obvious sense.
While California needs to harness its sun, wind and water to make us more energy independent, some people are blindly trying to make California 100 percent electric.
Certainly, most people want to continue expanding energy sources that are earth-friendly. But wearing electricity-only blinders is misguided on numerous levels.
Whether transitioning to electric vehicles or “de-carbonizing” buildings, the importance of a multipronged approach to renewable energy has gotten lost or ignored – even energy sources that are renewable, sustainable, and help the environment.
First, relying on a single source of energy is a dangerous proposition. The last time California regulators tried to micromanage the energy market was two decades ago when the state was gripped by a massive energy crisis that brought electrical shortages and skyrocketing consumers prices. Rolling blackouts threw hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses into darkness and zero power.
Second, consider that our electrical grid is computer based. Hackers – inside the U.S. or around the world – pose a serious threat.
Last summer, the New York Times reported that “State-sponsored Russian hackers appear far more interested this year in demonstrating that they can disrupt the American electric utility grid than the midterm elections, according to United States intelligence officials and technology company executives.”
Third, a shift toward a 100-percent electrical society reneges on the promise of building a vibrant and innovative California. There have been incredible innovations involving many different types of energy sources that are already helping California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
Major developments are taking place in the natural gas and propane industries, which has the flexibility to meet the needs of rural Californians. A growing number of California dairy farmers are converting methane into renewable natural gas, which would help California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
An electricity mandate would kill all of these advances.
Fourth, even if demand for electricity explodes, can California realistically provide enough renewable electricity? For the foreseeable future, the answer is no. And according to the Los Angeles Times, new demand will “tax a system already fragile, unstable and increasingly vulnerable to outside forces.”
Fifth, other sources of energy are simply better for the environment and our California lifestyle. Home and professional chefs prefer cooking with gas – as do consumers who grill with propane. Electricity is not exactly portable. How will restaurants and homeowners conveniently provide outdoor heating without tripping over dozens of extension cords?
Consumers also are vehemently opposed to being stripped of energy choice. By a margin of 5 to 1, Californians prefer natural gas for home heating and cooking. And 80 percent of voters oppose laws that would take away their natural gas appliances.
While most people like and appreciate electricity, they cannot and should not have to imagine a world with only one source of energy. Like everything else, energy diversity needs to be celebrated and promoted as a key to a clean and green future.

“Voy a dejar a México que lo anuncie en el momento adecuado” , expresó el mandatario al tiempo que sacó un papel doblado, aparentemente en blanco, el cual no mostró a la prensa.
El Gobierno mexicano ha negado que haya un acuerdo secreto.

Bret Easton Ellis is afraid of the social justice movement

Información de publicación: Washington Examiner ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]. 10 June 2019.

Texto completo: Bestselling novelist Bret Easton Ellis was on to something when he mocked the “childlike fascism” of liberals in his new book. But he’s curiously not so brave when asked to defend his views in person.
That means he's lost. He's afraid, and that's precisely the goal of the social justice movement he hates.
Ellis was a guest Friday on HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” and, when faced with criticism over his commentary on the terrorizing social justice movement, he froze. Ellis had said on the show that the millennial generation, along with the social justice movement, was reacting to the apathetic nature of Generation X. Liberal New York Times columnist Charles Blow on the panel then asked Ellis what the problem was with social justice.
A stuttering Ellis said that he actually thought the #Resistance “is great” but that there was “overreach” from some liberals who could find racism in everything.
Blow, without offering details or naming any names, said he knows plenty of people who do “social justice” in “the courtrooms,” people who “do the work.” Nobody had a clue what Blow was talking about, but Ellis shrunk further.
“I think there has been an ironic use of the term ‘social justice warrior,’” he pleaded. “And I think it’s used ironically when there is a social justice warrior that does overreach and starts doing things like that. What you’re talking about is completely authentic and cool, but this stuff that goes on on Twitter ... is a different kind of social justice. It’s a fake social justice.”
Ellis did this same graceless dance in an April interview with the New Yorker. In his book, he blamed liberals for their “demented narcissism” in being unable to accept the results of the 2016 election. Yet when confronted with baseline questions about Trump, Ellis caved.
“I do think birtherism was racist and the Tea Party was an abomination,” he said in the interview. “The hysteria over Trump is what I am talking about. It’s not about his policies or supposed racism. It’s about what I see as an overreaction to Trump.” He said that he thought Trump was “probably” a racist, while also calling the liberals who oppose Trump “shrilly” and condescending for how they view the president’s supporters.
This is social justice in action and Ellis didn’t even know it, despite writing what he thinks is a book that rebuts it.
As detailed in my forthcoming book, “Privileged Victims: How America's Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People,” social justice isn’t a freak accident. It’s not political correctness. It’s not over-sensitivity. It’s not “overreach.” It’s not, as Ellis said on “Real Time,” a reaction to a previous generation.
Social justice is a system and an ideology. It’s the belief that grievances experienced by nature of race, gender, or sexuality can only be ameliorated when those who have “privilege” — those who are white, straight men or some combination thereof — submit to the supposedly oppressed classes.
That means anyone deemed unworthy of their position, their "privilege," is expected to hand it to someone else, someone with "grievance" status.
The social justice movement forces the process along by using terms such as “racist,” “sexist,” “homophobe,” and “anti-trans” to intimidate and bully those who don’t belong to the cult. Labeled any one of these and you’re expected to apologize and submit, which is effectively what Ellis did on “Real Time.”
Oh, no, I’m not talking about the real social justice warriors. I’m talking about Twitter!
If Ellis were only talking about “Twitter,” he’d have no reason to complain. It’s the real social justice monsters that are destroying the country, the ones who tried to derail Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, who try to cow the faculty and staff of their colleges into submission, and who bully and intimidate business owners, not the geeks on social media.
Screw the nobodies on Twitter. And screw Bret Easton Ellis for becoming a shrinking violet when confronted by the social justice mob.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and his acting Homeland Security secretary on Sunday defended their new agreement with the Mexican government to curb migration at the southern border, striking back at Democratic critics - including accusations that at least some parts of the deal predated Trump's recent tariff threats.
In a series of tweets, Trump said Mexico "was not being cooperative on the Border" before the deal reached Friday. Now, he said, "I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done."
He also said he could move to reimpose tariffs if Mexico doesn't follow through on its promises. Some aspects of the deal, he added, remain to be announced - "one in particular," he said, "will be announced at the appropriate time."
Meanwhile, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan credited Trump's tariff threats - which would have placed a 5% levy on Mexican goods starting Monday, ratcheting up over several months to as much as 25% - with producing a breakthrough.
"The president put a charge in this whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threat, brought them to the table," McAleenan said in a "Fox News Sunday" interview, noting that Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard "arrived within hours" to begin talks.
Mexico announced it would implement "strong measures" to slow the flow of migrants across its territory toward the southern U.S. border, including the deployment of thousands of Mexican national guard troops. It also agreed to expand a program allowing Central American migrants to wait in Mexico while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims.
On Sunday, two Democratic presidential candidates said Trump had exaggerated what his tariff threats against Mexico had accomplished. They echoed a New York Times report alleging that the Mexican government had already agreed to several terms of the deal before Trump publicly floated the prospect of tariffs.
"These are agreements that Mexico had already made, in some cases months ago," former congressman Beto O'Rourke said in an interview on ABC's "This Week." "They might have accelerated the timetable, but by and large the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has."
During an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also said Trump had repackaged earlier agreements with Mexico to declare success in the trade standoff.
"I think what the world is tired of, and what I am tired of, is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war, with our allies," Sanders said, adding that Trump should focus on achieving comprehensive immigration reform.
Trump, in his tweets, lashed out at The New York Times for suggesting the deal was not entirely new and also pointed out that tariffs could be back on the table if the Mexican government does not honor its end of the deal.
"There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn't exist for decades," he said. "However, if for some unknown reason ... there is not, we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs."
McAleenan echoed that sentiment, saying the dangling threat of tariffs amounted to "a mechanism to make sure that they do what they promise to do, that there's an actual result that we see a vast reduction in those (migrant) numbers."
Republican lawmakers appeared relieved in talk-show appearances Sunday.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, had voiced anxiety about the tariffs before the deal was reached. On Sunday, he had nothing but praise for Trump.
"Republicans understand that tariffs are attacks on American consumers, and we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does, either," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations, and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly."
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., speaking on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," defended Trump.
"Republicans need to provide the president with a lot of leeway," Tillis said, adding that if lawmakers give Trump some "unorthodox" options for negotiating trade agreements, "then America wins."
Top congressional Democrats on Saturday delivered dual attacks on the deal, saying that the agreement amounted to less than meets the eye while also arguing that the tariff threat that prompted it was reckless.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the deal was "likely to be one of the president's typical, bogus solutions" to justify retreat from the tariffs, which had prompted a fierce backlash from business interests and many Republicans.

"Fire Shut Up in My Bones" is Terence Blanchard's second opera. Like his first, 2013's "Champion," it's a co-commission by Opera Theatre of St. Louis and Jazz St. Louis and is directed by one of the operatic world's leading producers of contemporary opera, OTSL artistic director James Robinson.
Based on New York Times columnist Charles Blow's memoir of the same name, "Fire Shut Up in My Bones" is the fourth and final production of the season. It's the company's 28th world premiere.
Blow wrote about growing up as the youngest of five boys in a turbulent household in the small town of Gibsland, La. Quiet and intellectual, Charles is sexually abused by an older cousin; later, in college, he discovers that he's quite capable of actions he dislikes.
Robinson says he's excited to be working on what he calls a "memory collage."
"It's an unusual subject for an opera, but it's quite compelling," he says. "It's not necessarily something that has a strict narrative, although there is a story. It's a very reflective piece -- a contemplative piece. It also has a lot of heart and a lot of humor in it, in spite of its subject."
Robinson thinks that Blanchard and his librettist, screenwriter Kasi Lemmons ("Eve's Bayou"), did a good job of "condensing a rather sprawling and harrowing memoir. It does have a cinematic quality, as one would expect from the two of them. It's also a very different type of music for Terence. It's a very mature and beautiful score, and that is very exciting."
The music, he says, is tuneful and has a rich harmonic language for orchestra and jazz combo. Robinson thinks the story speaks to Blanchard in part because he, like Blow, is a native of rural Louisiana.
"Obviously, it's jazz-inspired; it sounds like it's 100 percent Terence Blanchard," Robinson says. "He's found wonderful ways of using music to further tell a story with these various characters. It's a very rich palette."
The conductor, William Long, is making his OTSL debut with "Fire."
Robinson's approach to the material, he says, is similar to his work with operas such as "The Grapes of Wrath" or "The Death of Klinghoffer."
"In many ways, it reminds me of (them)," he says. "You have a road map for a piece, and you have to figure out how to bring the scenes to life -- and sometimes in a very unconventional way. That's the challenge of it, and that's what's fun for everybody involved."
Robinson's production team includes set designer Allen Moyer, costume designer James Schuette, video projections engineer Greg Emetaz, lighting designer Christopher Akerlind, wig and makeup designer Tom Watson, and choreographer SeÃ¡n Curran.
"Because of the many themes in the piece, we are treating it both in a cinematic way and also in a very minimalist theatrical way," he says. "I don't think we've seen anything quite like this at Opera Theatre, in terms of how the space is used. It relies heavily on the participation of the cast, the ensemble and the dancers."
The all-African-American cast includes five local boys. Treble Jeremy Denis, 10, plays the young Charles, a sung role, as a 7-, 8- and 9-year-old. His older brothers, in speaking roles, include his real-life brother Jayden Denis, along with Rhadi Smith, Nathaniel Mahone and Najee Coleman.
"It's fantastic to see how they are all embracing the project and what a great experience they're having," Robinson says. "They're really a great group."
Two performers spend most of their time onstage: bass-baritone DavÃ³ne Tines, as the adult Charles, who seriously contemplates murder, and soprano Julia Bullock. Bullock plays three different characters: Destiny, Loneliness and Greta, a woman with whom Charles falls in love. Soprano Karen Slack is Billie, Charles' strong mother. Many in the ensemble play multiple roles.
Don't go to see "Fire Shut Up in My Bones" expecting a repeat of "Champion," Blanchard's opera about boxer Emile Griffith.
"The piece is so different," Robinson says. "It's a much more challenging subject, and I think it pushed (Blanchard) in lots of different directions. It's a series of scenes and vignettes, and it takes us on a very unusual journey.
"I think that both are very challenging pieces. For me, this is harder to put on its feet because of the nature of the piece, but I think it's fantastic."
Robinson says that those who have sat in on rehearsals have been moved.
"I always like seeing when a cast takes possession of a story. What's beautiful, too, for this cast is that this speaks to many of their own experiences. That's what makes this so rich and rewarding: all the things they've brought to it."

Saudis seeking death penalty of teenager for protesting when he was 10

Texto completo: A Saudi teenager is facing the possibility of the death penalty from his government for crimes he committed years before.
“There are few more serious breaches of international law than the execution of a child,” Maya Foa, director of the human rights group Reprive, told the New York Times. “The Saudi regime is advertising its impunity to the world.”
Murtaja Qureiris, 18, was arrested by the Saudi government when he was 13 years old and held without charge for more than four years.
Now that Qureiris is old enough to be charged with capital crimes, the government has brought charges against the boy related to participating in anti-government protests when he was 10 with prosecutors recommending the death penalty.
“There should be no doubt that the Saudi Arabian authorities are ready to go to any length to crack down on dissent against their own citizens, including by resorting to the death penalty for men who were merely boys at the time of their arrest,” Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East research director, said.
The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, a nonprofit committed to strengthening human rights in Saudi Arabia, released an extensive report on the case where they detail how Qureiris was tortured to force a confession out of him.
“During the period of investigation, Murtaja was subjected to coercion and deception by the interrogators. He remained in solitary confinement for a month, during which he was tortured and beaten, and he was also promised repeatedly that he would be released if he cooperated with the investigation and admitted the charges against him,” the report said. They added that the facilities Qureiris was held in have had allegations of sexual crimes against children.
Qureiris was the youngest political prisoner in the world at the time of his arrest.
The Washington Examiner has reached out to the Saudi Arabia embassy for comment.

Texto completo: En los años 90, Freddy Padilla vivía en Puerto Rico trabajando de cualquier cosa, la situación estaba tan mala que pintar casas le permitía sobrevivir.
En esa época, su abuelo trabajaba como portero en un edificio ubicado en la calle 47 y 7 Avenida de Manhattan, donde se ubicaban los Quad Studios y, en el segundo piso, la famosa librería “Drama Book Shop”. En marzo de 2001, el abuelo le consiguió un trabajo en el área de seguridad y, sin dudarlo, se instaló en Nueva York.
En el verano de ese mismo año, la librería (250 West 40th Street, ubicada frente al edificio del New York Times) necesitaba a un cajero, y fue así como Padilla entró al mundo de los libros especializados en teatro, recibiendo los pedidos, clasificando las revistas y atendiendo clientes, entre ellos actores y directores en ascenso o ya consagrados, como Bette Midler, Danny De Vitto y James Gandolfini, entre muchos otros.
Recuerda con especial cariño su amistad con el actor Earle Hyman (1926-2017), conocido en la pantalla chica como el abuelo Russell Huxtable, en “The Cosby Show”. “Él era uno de mis favoritos. Era fanático de Shakespeare, siempre que salía una nueva edición, aunque él tenía las anteriores, llegaba a comprarla. Decía que le gustaba llegar a la librería porque nadie lo molestaba, y hasta se tomaba fotos con los empleados y clientes”, contó.
Vender libros nunca ha sido fácil, y menos al tratarse de temas tan especializados como el teatro. Los esposos Rozanne y Arthur Seelen compraron el negocio en los años 50, al fallecer él, el sobrino Allen Hubby compró la mitad y siguieron adelante. Se las ingeniaron para sobrevivir por décadas, manteniendo un surtido de revistas con instrucciones para elaborar vestuarios, las cuales eran buscadas por los estudiantes de Parsons School of Design.
En 2002, Padilla recuerda la creación de un teatro en el sótano del edificio. Back House Productions, el lugar donde el actor y director Lin-Manuel Miranda escribió su primer musical, “In The Heights”, basado en sus experiencias creciendo en Washington Heights.
Uno de los momentos más interesantes de todo el tiempo que Padilla trabajó allí fue una lectura (reading/performance) de Miranda que acaparó mucho la atención, entre otras, por la presencia de Mónica Lewinsky, quien estuvo en el ojo del huracán en los años 90 por una relación que casi le cuesta la presidencia a Bill Clinton. De hecho, ella dijo tener la grabación de esa presentación en el sótano de Drama Book Shop entre sus “tesoros”, en un artículo que publicó en 2018 en la revista Vanity Fair.
Padilla describe ese trabajo en la librería como ideal, aunque él – como la mayoría de sus compañeros de trabajo, quellegaron a ser unos 30– nunca estudió para ser librero o bibliotecario, tuvo que aprender el oficio para ayudar a los actores, a los estudiantes que llegaban buscando monólogos o guías para conseguir un agente. Cuando un nuevo espectáculo se estrenaba en Broadway (“Wicked”, “Raining in the Sun”), eran días ocupados porque la gente llegaba corriendo a buscar las obras.
Pero la historia de las librerías comunes y especializadas por lo general no tienen un final feliz. Padilla recuerda que en los mejores años solo había tres librerías especializadas en teatro en Nueva York, también estaban “Samuel French” y “Applause Books”. Ambas cerraron y parte del inventario fue tomado por “Drama”.
En 2012, “Drama” realizó un evento literario en el que cada día un escritor distinto iba a formar parte de un “performance”: estaban sentados frente a una computadora en la vitrina principal de la tienda, dando la espalda hacia afuera, es decir, a los peatones, lo cual llamó mucho la atención.
Los escritores tomaron turnos de dos horas para improvisar sus creaciones y Padilla se dedicó a hacer fotografías para colocarlas en las redes sociales del negocio. Fue así como una de las escritoras, Gina Femia, le pidió que colocara su nombre y nació una amistad que se transformó en amor. Se casaron en 2018.
Para 2016 Padilla ya era mánager a tiempo parcial y la lucha para mantener a flote el negocio era dura; la recesión les afectó mucho, así como el aumento de la renta. “Optamos por vender libros usados, lo cual ayudó un poco”, comentó. Pero el desastre causado por la congelación y ruptura de las tuberías en el invierno de ese año, causó una pérdida de más de $50,000 dólares.
El 20 de enero de 2019 fue el anuncio oficial del cierre de “Drama”, pese a tener el corazón roto y la incertidumbre sobre los hombros, los empleados estuvieron al lado de los dueños cerrando el inventario hasta el último día. “El sitio es importante para mí porque no solo era una tienda, hay mucha memoria; conocí a mi esposa allí, vi el proceso de creación de ‘In The Heights’, tantos eventos importantes que tuvimos, además con los otros empleados no solo éramos eso, éramos amigos, casi familia”, añadió.
Padilla aguarda la esperanza de retomar su antiguo trabajo cuando el negocio reabra, como fue prometido por Lin-Manuel Miranda. Junto a tres de sus cercanos colaboradores en el musical “Hamilton” -Thomas Kail, Jeffrey Seller y James L. Nederlander- se asociaron para salvar la librería, y se espera que reabra en el otoño.
Mientras busca un nuevo empleo, Padilla ha emprendido el negocio de tshirts Cafe con Cawfe https://www.teepublic.com/user/cafeconcawfee con frases inspiradas en el mundo del teatro y además ayuda a su esposa, autora de las obras teatrales “For the Love of (or, The Roller Derby Play)” y “The Virtuous Fall of The Girls From Our Lady of Sorrows”.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump tuiteó desde temprana hora acerca el acuerdo con el Gobierno mexicano sobre inmigración, seguridad y materia comercial para evitar aplicar las tarifas de hasta 25% a productos de ese país; destacó que hay un elemento importante que se dará a conocer más adelante.
Los comentarios del mandatario formaron parte de la respuesta al reporte de The New York Times, sobre que los puntos que integran el pacto entre su Administración y la de Andrés Manuel López Obrador fueron cerrados en marzo por la entonces secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen , y la secretaria de Gobernación, Olga Sánchez Cordero .
El mandatario republicano dijo que México no había cooperado con los Estados Unidos adecuadamente, pero ahora tiene completa confianza, especialmente luego de hablar con su homólogo López Obrador.
“Hay algunas cosas importantes que no se mencionaron ayer en el comunicado de prensa, una en particular, sobre la que acordamos” , indicó el presidente en un tuit. “Será anunciada en su debido momento” .
Agregó que ahora existe una gran cooperación entre ambas naciones y recalcó que era algo que no existía “en décadas” por razones desconocidas.
…..not mentioned in yesterday press release, one in particular, were agreed upon. That will be announced at the appropriate time. There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn’t exist for decades. However, if for some unknown reason…
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2019
Las críticas sobre el acuerdo se desataron en ambos países, incluso en voz de la lideresa de la Cámara, Nancy Pelosi .
“Las amenazas y las rabietas no son una forma de negociar la política exterior”, dijo Pelosi en un comunicado el sábado.
Grupos de activistas, como Families Belong Together México consideraron que poner a inmigrantes como un elemento de negociación entre países los coloca en una posición más vulnerable.
“La celebración del acuerdo migratorio entre México y los Estados Unidos en Tijuana no toma en cuenta la desesperación y el sufrimiento de los miles de migrantes que son afectados por las políticas migratorias de Trump. Hemos deshumanizado la migración” , afirmó Soraya Vázquez , directora de Families Belong Together México. “Nos hemos vuelto insensibles frente a una realidad lacerante de miles de niños y familias que deben esperar su proceso de asilo en Tijuana sin seguridad, comida o refugio adecuado”.
El presidente Trump afirmó que México se había comprometido a aumentar la adquisición de productos agrícolas de los Estados Unidos.
Cuestionada al respecto, al Embajadora mexicana, Martha Bárcena , evitó desmentir o reafirmar dicha revelación, aunque destacó que en los últimos cuatro meses el país vecino del sur se convirtió en el socio comercial número uno de EEUU.
En entrevista en el programa Face The Nation de CBS, la Embajadora destacó que con la aprobación del Acuerdo Estados Unidos-México-Canadá (USMCA o T-MEC ) habrá ese incremento.
“Hará un incremento de productos agrículos y manufactureros”, apuntó, pero la entrevistadora Margaret Brennan insistió sobre el mensaje tuiteado por el presidente Trump acerca del incremento en productos agrícolas.
“Ahora somos el segundo comprador de los Estados Unidos en ese sector” , dijo Bárcena. “Tenemos una economía integrada en el sector agrícola”.

El canciller mexicano, Marcelo Ebrard , afirmó que el acuerdo evitó la pérdida hasta de 900,000 empleos en México en forma inmediata, sí como la cancelación del T-MEC.
Sobre los inmigrantes que se enviará a México señaló que se les dará asistencia legal y orientación para laborar en el país, además de registrar todos los extranjeros que busquen llegar a EEUU.
“Necesitamos saber quiénes son, si no, no los podemos proteger” , afirmó.

Texto completo: ALGANSEE TOWNSHIP, Mich.
Pickup hits carriage, killing 2 Amish kids
Authorities say a pickup truck rear-ended an Amish horse-drawn carriage in southern Michigan, killing two children and seriously injuring two others and a woman who were in the carriage.
The state police say the two adults and five children who were in the carriage were ejected when the truck hit it Friday night in Algansee Township, a small farming community not far from Michigan's borders with Indiana and Ohio.
The children who were killed were 6 and 2 years old. They were pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities say two other children, ages 3 and 4, were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and that a woman also suffered serious injuries.
Sgt. Todd Price told ABC News that the pickup truck's driver was intoxicated at the time of the crash and is being held in Branch County Jail.
BROWNSVILLE, Texas
Border agent saves 2 migrants from bees
A U.S. Border Patrol agent in Texas is credited with saving a migrant woman and her young son who were attacked and covered by thousands of bees.
The agency said in a statement Friday that the agent was patrolling the Rio Grande in Brownsville, in southernmost Texas, when bees entered his patrol vehicle.
The agent was looking for the origin of the bees Tuesday when he found what he thought was just a bundle of clothing covered in the insects. He then realized it was a woman curled into a ball.
He ordered her to run into his vehicle and discovered she was covering her 8-year-old boy.
The child began to vomit and the agent rushed the pair to a hospital, where they're expected to recover.
Authorities say they were traveling from Guatemala.
BOSTON
Subway car derails, injuring 10 people
A subway car has derailed in Boston, sending nine people to the hospital.
Local emergency officials said none of the injuries is life-threatening.
Officials with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said the accident occurred at about 11 a.m. Saturday when a Green Line subway car derailed in a tunnel near Kenmore Square.
A 10th individual was reported injured but declined treatment.
Emergency workers said they were told by witnesses that everything went dark and they were thrown around the train car.
The cause of the derailment is under investigation.
NEW YORK
Four Seasons Restaurant closing its new location
New York's famed Four Seasons Restaurant is closing less than a year after it reopened in a new location.
The New York Times reported that the midtown Manhattan restaurant known as the original power lunch destination will close Tuesday.
The Four Seasons lost its home in the Seagram Building when developer Aby Rosen took over the landmark skyscraper in 2016. It reopened in August 2018 three blocks away.
Managing partner Alex von Bidder told the Times that the revamped restaurant had a great team in place but "just couldn't make it.

Trade fears take bite out of U.S. job growth

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — U.S. hiring slowed in May as employers added 75,000 jobs, a sign that businesses have become more cautious in the face of slowing global growth and widening trade conflicts.
The tepid job growth, along with rising pressures on the economy, makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in the coming months. Bond yields fell after the jobs data was released, signaling investor expectations for lower Fed rates.
May’s modest job growth followed a much healthier gain of 224,000 in April. The unemployment rate remained at a nearly 50-year low of 3.6%.
The hiring gains last month were the fewest since February. The government also revised down the job growth for March and April by a combined 75,000. In the first five months of this year, hiring has averaged 164,000 a month, a solid pace that is enough to lower the unemployment rate over time. Still, it’s below last year’s pace.
The economy is showing signs of sluggishness just as the current expansion has reached its 10th anniversary. Next month, it will become the longest period of uninterrupted growth on records dating to 1854. Yet consumers have turned cautious about spending, and companies are scaling back their investment in high-cost machinery and equipment.
The Federal Reserve has signaled that it would consider a rate cut in the event of economic weakness, and May’s data is likely to be a
factor in that decision.
“This gives us a real sense of deceleration in the U.S. economy,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting firm Grant Thornton. “We knew this was occurring, but this could be a summer of discontent. It also gives the Fed a green light to cut rates.”
The economy expanded at a healthy 3.1% annual rate in the January-March quarter, but the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates that annual growth will dip to 1.5% in the April-June quarter.
In May, wages rose 3.1% from a year earlier, down slightly from last month’s gain of 3.2%. That was the smallest annual gain since September.
Hiring was weak last month across a broad range of industries. Manufacturers added only 3,000 jobs, a fourth straight month of anemic gains. Construction companies hired just 4,000, financial services only 2,000.
Employers in several industries cut jobs. Retailers shed workers for the fifth straight month as stores struggle with online competition. A category that includes telecom, publishing, and media shed 5,000 jobs. Federal, state and local governments cut 15,000.
“The slowdown is really coming from the sectors that are most susceptible to trade tensions like manufacturing, construction, mining and logging. That does make me worried,” said Martha Gimbel, research director for Indeed.com’s Hiring Lab.
Trump’s trade wars have become a growing threat. Last month, he increased tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports from 10% to 25%. And last week, he threatened to impose 5% tariffs on all Mexican imports to the United States beginning Monday. Those taxes would rise each month until they reach 25% in October unless the Mexican government cuts off a flow of Central American migrants entering the United States from through Mexico.
The higher costs from the import taxes — and the potential for more — are causing some companies to scale back plans for spending, investment and expansion. Orders for machinery and equipment fell 1% in April. A strong dollar, which makes U.S. goods costlier overseas, has also slowed the production and export of manufactured goods. A separate report from the Fed showed that factory output fell 0.5% in April.
Automakers are cutting jobs and production as U.S. sales have slowed. Analysts expect auto sales to fall below 17 million this year after four years above that level.
Ford Motor Co. said last month that it was shedding 7,000 white-collar jobs — about 10% of its salaried workforce — as part of preparations for an industry driven more by electric and autonomous vehicles. Last year, GM said it would lay off 14,000 workers.
Home sales have also been weak this year despite a sharp drop in mortgage rates. Sales fell 4.4% in April compared with a year earlier. Price increases are slowing in much of the country, though, which, combined with more affordable mortgages, could soon revive sales.
This report includes material from the Associated Press, the New York Times and the Washington Post.

Why Austin leads in homicide arrests

Texto completo: Andre Lanier Davis Jr., a beloved presence in the 12th Street area in East Austin, was gunned down in Givens Park on April 9 when police say two men pulled up in a black Nissan and robbed a group of people playing dominoes.
Fifty-one days after the crime, a witness came forward in late May with the tip police needed to close their case and file a capital murder charge against 25-year-old Glenn Madison Deal Jr.
Davis’ 28-year-old son, Andre, said he’s grateful for investigators’ work toward making an arrest and is confident they will identify the second suspect.
“It’s very comforting to find out they’re doing everything they said they were going to do,” he said.
Davis’ shooting is one of 11 homicides in Austin this year. Police have made arrests in seven and issued an arrest warrant in another, which is not too far from the homicide unit’s usually high clearance rate.
From 2007 to 2017, Austin police arrested a suspect in 73% of the city’s homicide investigations, the highest rate in a Washington Post analysis last year of homicide arrests in the nation’s 55 largest cities. Austin loomed significantly above the analysis’ average arrest rate of
49.6% and other large Texas cities like San Antonio (57%), Fort Worth (54%), Dallas (52%) and Houston (49%).
Austin detectives as well as local and national experts point to several reasons why the city’s police have been so successful in solving homicides. Community members often come forward with information about killings — like the witness who identified Davis’ killer to police as “Deal” — or respond to media reports and calls for tips, like when a firefighter watching the evening news recognized the suspected attacker in the 2016 strangulation of University of Texas student Haruka Weiser and notified police. That person, Meechaiel Criner, was arrested and found guilty of capital murder last year.
“Time and time again, it’s a key witness who will say they heard or saw something and it breaks a case,” homicide Detective Nathan Sexton said. “If they wanted to sit on that information we would not be where we’re at. To have a good rapport with the community goes miles.”
A well-staffed unit
Another factor is Austin’s low level of gang activity compared with other big cities. Homicides committed by gang members, experts say, are tougher to solve because witnesses are less likely to cooperate for fear of retaliation and due to a code of silence common among gangs.
Several experts also noted the abundance of resources Austin pumps into every homicide investigation, something they say is lacking in many other major cities with more homicides than their overwhelmed detectives can handle.
Even while Austin’s population has grown to become the 11th largest in the country, the city has remained relatively safe with an average of 28 homicides per year since 2000. Yet even in 2016, when annual killings in the city reached a record 39, the 4.3 homicides per 100,000 residents was well below the 12.9 average homicides in similarly sized cities.
As was the case in Davis’ killing, Austin homicide detectives say that allows them enough time to exhaust all leads before moving on to their next investigation.
John Skaggs, a retired Los Angeles police officer who travels the country evaluating homicide units and training their detectives, called Austin’s homicide unit “probably the fattest unit I’ve ever seen or heard of.”
In addition to the Austin Police Department’s 12 homicide detectives, a tactical intelligence unit frees detectives to canvass neighborhoods or interview witnesses by scouring digital databases for useful information. Two homicide sergeants and a lieutenant chip in when needed, as does the multiagency Lone Star Task Force.
“It’s inspiring and helps motivate us to work as hard as we can to find answers for the families of the victims,” homicide Detective Paul Chavez said.
In contrast with the homicide unit’s robust staffing, Austin police’s overtaxed sex crimes unit handles 1,800 cases per year with only one more detective than their counterparts in homicide. That, according to an American-Statesman analysis from last month, leaves sex crimes investigators with an average of 10 hours to solve a case.
The sex crimes unit currently has one less detective than the number suggested in a 2012 recommendation from the Police Executive Research Forum. By 2018, six years after the study, the number of cases the unit handles had gone up 34%.
Best practices
Operating on an on-call rotation, each homicide detective takes the lead on about three cases per year and assists on maybe three more. They also stay busy looking into drownings, suicides and accidental deaths.
The annual budget for Austin’s homicide unit is $2.3 million, with $124,737 of it set aside for overtime so detectives can continue to work cases beyond the allotted time in their shift.
Skaggs, who investigated homicides in Los Angeles for more than 20 years, said Austin implements best practices by not diverting the attention of homicide detectives to other crimes, such as burglaries or nonfatal assaults.
“The majority of success for homicide squads in this country comes from two things: how many cases detectives handle per year and the time between cases they receive,” said Skaggs, whose police work is highlighted in The New York Times bestseller “Ghettoside: A True Story of Murder in America.”
Chicago police, for instance, tackle more than 500 homicides per year and made arrests in just 26% from 2007 to 2017, according to The Washington Post analysis. Detectives in Detroit, where there are more than 300 homicides per year, arrested a suspect just 41% of the time over eight years. And Jacksonville, Fla., a city with a population comparable to Austin’s, had 106 homicides over an 11-year period and made an arrest in less than half of them.
Former Austin Police Monitor Margo Frasier agrees that Austin’s high homicide arrest rate is likely a reflection of the low number of homicides that come across detectives’ desks.
“While I think the homicide unit is not sitting around with their feet up, they don’t have (a heavy) workload because our city doesn’t have as many homicides as others,” she said.
But Frasier also said the city is fortunate to have “some very solid detectives.”
The Police Department has some longtime veterans like Detectives Rogelio Sanchez and Dave Fugitt, who have been with the homicide unit for 17 and 16 years, respectively. Former homicide detectives have used their experience in the unit to springboard to higher positions, including Chief Brian Manley, who investigated homicides for two years in the late 1990s.
Solving tough cases
The homicide unit puts together a summary each year with details about killings, including location, race and the victim’s relationship to the killer.
In 2017, eight of the 25 homicides were “stranger-on-stranger,” which police define as killings in which the victim was chosen at random or the victim and the suspect were brought together by a location (like a bar) or an activity (like buying drugs).
Experts say those homicides are harder to solve than when, for instance, the victim had a dispute with a significant other or a roommate. But Austin police solved all eight stranger-on-stranger homicides in 2017, having made arrests in seven and filing a warrant in the other to arrest a suspect they believe fled to Mexico.
Police made an arrest in 80% of the 2017 homicides and issued arrest warrants in three others.
Lt. Jeff Greenwalt of the homicide unit said teamwork plays a big part in the high arrest rate.
“We don’t draft people who don’t want to be here,” he said. “Long hours, time away from family, a rigorous on-call schedule. You have to work in a team environment. It’s not a one-man show.”

It’s a big job to make a single work of art that will capture the essence of an event rich in history and tradition, an economic powerhouse ($268 million in 2018), something near and dear to Minnesota hearts and one of the few places where everyone feels they belong and are welcome.
The art must also have broad appeal and raise money for the fair. Sales of limited-edition signed prints, posters and other merchandise support educational programs and improvements to the buildings and grounds. And, like any commissioned work of art, it must make the patron happy.
The first 15 artists included painters, illustrators, muralists, printmakers and a collage artist. R.J. Kern, whose art was unveiled last night at a special event on the fairgrounds, is the first photographer to be chosen as the fair’s official commemorative artist. Kern is an award-winning fine-art photographer whose work has been shown in exhibitions around the world. In Minnesota, he’s represented by Burnet Fine Art & Advisory.
Kern also has history with the fair. He’s been accepted into the Fine Arts Exhibition three times. Last year, he won both the First Glance Award from the Minnesota State Fair Foundation and the Great State of Minnesota Award from Minnesota Citizens for the Arts. He hopes to get in again this year, but being the commemorative artist is no guarantee. Like everyone else who submitted, he’ll just have to wait to hear what the jury decides.
Shown above, “Minnesota State Fair Supreme Champion Pairings from 2018” features Kern’s portraits of the top male and female open-class exhibition winners in several categories. Kern photographed them two-by-two moments after their wins, then created a composite image. Standing still (momentarily), looking calm and serene (they weren’t), these are the best of the best of 2018’s turkeys and ducks, chickens and geese, rabbits and draft horses, sheep and goats, llamas and pigs, cattle and stock dogs.
We spoke with Kern on Wednesday, with one of his limited-edition prints resting between us on a table. This interview has been edited and condensed.
MinnPost: You’re the first photographer to be commissioned by the State Fair to create the commemorative art. Why do you think there hasn’t been a photographer before?
R.J. Kern: If you step back and look at photography as an art form, we’re relatively new. It’s taken a while for photography to gain acceptance in the art world. The National Gallery of Art just started collecting photography in 1994. Before, if you were a photographer, you were an editorial or newspaper photographer. Ansel Adams was commissioned by Congress. The photography legends were hired by Life magazine and the New York Times. They were never in art galleries. That’s changing very quickly.
MP: Why this particular photograph?
RJK: Animal husbandry is the roots of the fair. Who had the best ram to mate for breeding purposes? This wasn’t about showmanship. These were working animals, This was a business. The supreme champion was a mating animal, one you would lend out to other folks.
That’s where the Minnesota State Fair started, with the animals. Today it’s the music and food. The fair liked it when I wanted to focus on the animals. Let’s remind people that this is what kickstarted it all.
If you look at the origins of photography and fairs, they happened at the same time. Animal judging started in the mid-19th century. The first state fair in the United States was in New York in 1841. The 1851 World’s Fair [in London’s Hyde Park] was the first photography exhibition. Some of the first photographs were of prize-winning animals. Champion bulls and champion horses.
I really wanted to keep the focus on the animals. What would the Great Minnesota Farm Family look like? Here’s my artistic interpretation.
MP: Tell us a bit about the process of photographing all of these animals.
RJK: We constructed a studio on the fairgrounds for 12 days. It was right by the horse barns. It was like a wedding reception tent. The owners were notified in writing that if their animal was selected as supreme champion, it would be part of the commissioned art. The owners were all supportive. They are also very particular about how their animal is photographed. Some of these animals are auctioned off. Some are sold for a lot of money. They want to put the animal in the best light possible.
As soon as the animals were judged, within five to 10 minutes, they were escorted to the studio by their handlers and owners. I had everything mapped out ahead of time, including where the animals would stand. Most of the images were shot in periods of five minutes.
This all took place over 12 days — what the fair called “12 days of fun.” It really was fun! They rolled out the red carpet. It took 12 days because they can’t manage all of those animals at the same time in the barns. The bull and dairy cow were on the last day. The horses and dogs were on the first day
MP: What were some of the challenges?
RJK: The animals were coming right off the supreme champion ceremonies. They were excited. It’s like a beauty pageant, so they’d been groomed and detailed all day long. They’ve been waiting in line and held. That’s a lot of stimulus. Plus they were stressed. The dairy cow had to be milked. The animals had to relieve themselves and cool themselves off. The dogs were hyped up. They had just gotten off agility trials.
You can’t pose an animal. You have to have patience and a sense of humor. You have to stay persistent and try again.
For some animals, we had to make a conscious decision. With goats, there are dairy goats and meat goats, with champions for each. I asked the superintendent to choose. For the draft horses, the supreme champions are a stallion, a gelding and a mare. Just for pure safety and logistics reasons, you don’t put a stallion in close quarters with a mare. Stallions have one-track minds. We used the gelding and the mare.
MP: Which animals were the hardest to photograph?
RJK: I was expecting the dogs to be the easiest, but they were the hardest. Herding dogs are working dogs. They’re not lap dogs. Getting them to sit still … They were pretty juiced up. The draft horses had also been performing. They’re like champion athletes after a big contest.
MP: Which animals were the most fun to photograph?
RJK: It’s a toss-up between the ducks and the llamas. They were the most alert and just comical. Easy to be around. The pigs were drama queens and kings. They have a one-track mind and a sharp sense of smell. They’re smelling all around, and they’re big animals.
MP: How did you create the final image?
RJK: The compositing process took about 80 hours. We wanted to make sure it looked like all the animals were there at the same time in the same place. They were all in the same place, but not at the same time, for safety reasons and logistics reasons. It was important to have a neutral backdrop that was not distracting, so we used the straw bales.
MP: How would you like people to respond to your photograph?
RJK: I think it will put a smile on people’s faces. That’s a step in the right direction. I think it will appeal to a wide age demographic. I think kids will really enjoy it. I know the owners of the animals are very excited to have their animals featured. For them, this is a document.
If you look at a lot of traditional agricultural photographs of animals, they’re all from the side, so you can see the structure of the animal — the loin, the gait, the posture. But these are portraits. They’re looking at us. I hate to anthropomorphize, but they kind of look like people.
“Minnesota State Fair Supreme Champion Pairings from 2018” will be on display in the Fine Arts Building for the duration of the 2019 Minnesota State Fair.

Texto completo: 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said he believes Stacey Abrams was robbed in Georgia's 2018 gubernatorial election against Republican Brian Kemp.
"Stacey Abrams ought to be the governor of Georgia," the Democratic South Bend, Ind., mayor said Thursday.
"When racially motivated voter suppression is permitted, when districts are drawn so that politicians get to choose their voters instead of the other way around, when money is allowed to outvote people in this country, we cannot truly say we live in a democracy," he said.iFrame ObjectAbrams also expressed Thursday how she views the voting process in the state.
"You don’t have the right to vote in the state of Georgia. We have the opportunity to possibly think about maybe being able to participate in the right to vote in the state of Georgia. … We don’t know the truth because there wasn’t a fair fight," she said.
Kemp received 1,978,408 votes, or 50.2%. Abrams received 1,923,685 votes, or 48.8%, according to the New York Times.

Texto completo: Dolly Parton's skincare regime? Sleeping in her makeup.
The singer, 73, revealed the reasoning behind why she doesn't take off her makeup before bed in an interview with The New York Times Thursday.
"I clean my face in the mornings. You never know if you're going to wreck the bus, you never know if you're going to be somewhere in a hotel and there's going to be a fire," she said. "So I leave my makeup on at night and clean my face in the morning. "
The owner of Wildwood Grove, a park within the Dollywood amusement park, also doesn't like to mess up her look by riding any of the rides.
"With all my hair I got so much to lose, like my wig or my shoes. I don’t like to get messed up," she explained. "I’m gonna have some handsome man mess it up, I don’t want some ride doing it.
Wanting to keep her look intact doesn't mean she's a diva, however. Instead, Parton describes herself as a "Gypsy at heart. "
"I just love the rocking of those (tour bus) wheels and smell of diesel," she said, adding she'd prefer to take a bus than a private jet to get around.

Outside the U.S., It's All About WhatsApp

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Adam Satariano, a technology correspondent based in London, discussed the tech he's using.
You reported from the United States before moving to London. How has your tech setup changed?
I moved to London three years ago, and the biggest change has been how to communicate with colleagues, family and friends.
It's hard for many Americans to grasp how pervasive WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook, is outside the United States. I'm in family groups on WhatsApp for sharing photos of my kids, another with friends called "Steve Kerr 2020" to banter about Bay Area sports, and others for news about my sons' elementary school classes. One group, called "Anybody Fancy a Pint," is just for friends in my neighborhood in London to use if one of us is going to a local pub and seeking company.
This isn't unique to living in Europe, but I'm laughably reliant on Google Maps. I invariably end up being that annoying person on the street staring down at my phone doing circles to figure out which direction to go.
Sure, I worry about privacy and the ungodly amount of data that Google collects, but it feels like a fair trade when I'm lost or navigating a new place. I bookmark restaurants, bookstores and cafes that I want to visit or remember for a future trip. (Product suggestion: Google, please add a way to write notes for saved locations in Maps.)
On the road, I also use a debit card from Revolut that you can top up with money through an app and doesn't have foreign transaction fees.
With the G.D.P.R. and other regulations, Europe has been tough on tech companies when it comes to digital privacy. How is that affecting the internet and apps in Europe?
The biggest difference for the average person is the comical number of notifications you receive when visiting a website or signing up for a new online service. A key part of the General Data Protection Regulation is that people must be given detailed information about the data being collected about them. But it's overload. I feel ground into submission. Most people I know express annoyance more than gratitude about the law.
That said, there are changes below the surface that people are benefiting from.
One aspect of the law I'd love to see made easier to use is letting people ask a company to turn over all the data it has on them. It's currently not an easy or inviting process. When I asked a few companies for information, the data that came back wasn't complete or comprehensive.
Why do Europeans seem to care about digital privacy so much more than Americans?
There isn't a unified view on privacy across Europe. Citizens of a country like Germany put a priority on privacy for unique historical reasons. Yet in Britain, where there is more surveillance than in probably any other Western country, people don't seem to be overly concerned.
In general, people view privacy the way they do in the United States: The amount of data collected by the likes of Facebook and Google makes them somewhat uncomfortable, but not enough to stop using Google or Instagram. I hear much more concern about the amount of time we're spending staring at screens.
What technology do you use that helps you do your job as a tech reporter?
My setup needs an upgrade.
I was in Paris recently for a news conference, and a reporter at a different news publication pulled out a keyboard that wirelessly connected to an iPhone that he placed in an impressive-looking stand. He also had an audio-recording app called AudioNote that synced with the notes he was typing. By clicking on a word within his notes, he could jump to that part of the audio recording to check the exact wording of a comment.
As I was rummaging through my notes, I was seething with envy picturing him efficiently writing a finely crafted story.
This is a safe space, so I'll admit that I have organizing issues. I have notes scattered in paper notebooks, email draft folders, Google Docs, Evernote, Word and the Notes program on my MacBook. I have at least three different "story ideas" files. There is a method to the madness, I swear, but I am constantly panicking that I lost a quote, an anecdote or a phone number. It's an affliction. The Times needs somebody on staff who can Marie Kondo my digital work life.
Outside of work, what tech product are you personally obsessed with, and what do you do with it?
This isn't really tech, but I'm a devotee of Parker pens. They write smoothly and fit easily in my pocket, but aren't so expensive that I feel bad losing one.
I'm also always looking for a better backpack. I have one made by a company called Knomo in London that has a good mix of space for a laptop and other stuff, but could use extra compartments and more comfortable shoulder pads. Instagram serves me a constant stream of backpack ads, and I don't even mind.
There are a few apps that I can't live without. One is The Athletic. In Europe, it's hard to keep up with American sports, but The Athletic hired some of the best sportswriters in the Bay Area to cover my favorite teams. The subscription isn't cheap, but it's the best digital twist on a newspaper sports page that I've seen.
I use Twitter an unhealthy amount, but I've started deleting it on weekends.
My favorite app is Spotify. I'm listening constantly. I have a playlist called "Sunday Morning" that I've been curating for years and love -- even if my wife jokingly calls it "music that makes you want to kill yourself."
In Tech We're Using, Times journalists give us a peek into the technology they love and use for work and life.
Photograph Beyond tech, Adam Satariano loves his Parker pens. Above left, a reminder for his weekends.

Texto completo: One bowl, one pan, a spoon for stirring and a spatula or tongs for flipping ingredients.
There are dozens of books about how to tackle and perfect sheet pan cooking — and for good reason. The lure of fixing an entire meal with minimum fuss and mess is a strong one.
At its most basic, sheet pan cooking is exactly what it sounds like: preparing a protein/vegetable combination meal using a sheet pan in the oven. Seasonings, finishing touches and timing may vary, but it’s a technique that eliminates the need to juggle multiple pots and pans on the stove. If you can cook everything together, more or less, why not give it a try?
Mix and match
At their most basic, sheet pan meals combine a protein with vegetables to create a full meal, all cooked together. The possibilities, of course, are endless, but you can start at the simplest level by drawing on what you have on hand.
------------
5 TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Across the board, these suggestions will boost your sheet pan meals:
1. Heat your sheet pan: This can cut down on cooking time and enhance the browning process.
2. Flavor One: Sturdy herbs like rosemary, thyme, bay leaves and oregano can handle the high temperatures for the full span of cooking. Save more delicate herbs such as basil, parsley and chives for garnishing.
3. Flavor Two: When you take the sheet pan out of the oven, a last-minute squeeze of citrus, a sprinkling of grated cheese or drizzles of vinaigrette, chili sauces, yogurt or sauces can boost the flavor quotient even more.
4. Use your wire cooling rack: Layer vegetables underneath and a steak on the rack to take advantage of drippings, or place ingredients you want to get extra-crispy on the rack.
5. Easy flipping: Make sure your ingredients are well-oiled, to prevent sticking, and use the right tools for turning — a spatula or tongs.
— Sources: Food52, New York Times Washington Post.
------------
Try breaking down the process into five mix-and-match steps (we combined suggestions from The New York Times and Eating Well, a magazine and website for foodies). For four servings, pick at least one ingredient from each category as pictured above, and combine into your own creation:
— A protein. Figure on about 1 to 1 1/4 pounds of a protein such as chicken, steak (skirt or flat-iron work well), fish (a firm type such as salmon or cod), sausage, or seafood, such as scallops or shrimp. Tofu works, too; use an extra-firm variety, patted dry and cut into cubes.
— Root vegetables. Figure on 1 pound, cut into 1-inch cubes. Think carrots, sweet or regular potatoes, beets, parsnips.
— Other veggies. Either 6 cups of dark, leafy greens such as kale or collards, or 4 cups of your vegetable of choice: asparagus, green beans, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms.
— Spices. Your choice of flavor combinations, 1 teaspoon total.
— Flavor-boosters. Again, your choice, 3 tablespoons total, depending on preference. Some options: citrus juices, vinaigrette, cheeses, fresh herbs, bacon, toasted nuts and seeds.
------------
5 COMMON MISTAKES
As simple as sheet pan meals can be, there are some common pitfalls:
1. Using lightweight pans: A pan that will warp under high heat, or with frequent use, won’t cook your food evenly. Look for heavy-gauge aluminum or uncoated aluminized steel baking sheets. The most common recipes call for an 18-by-13-inch pan — technically called a half-sheet pan — with a rim of about 1 inch all the way around that keeps ingredients contained.
2. Overcrowding or overlapping food: If you want nice, even browning, don’t overcrowd the food on the pan — spread it out. Otherwise, the food will steam, not sear.
3. Everything sticks: A messy cleanup negates the benefits of a simple one-pan meal. Use a nonstick pan, or cover the pan with aluminum foil, parchment paper or a baking sheet.
4. Food “steams” and gets limp: Don’t rinse veggies and put them directly on the pan. Pat them dry before cooking, and do the same with the protein.
5. Food cooks unevenly: There can be several causes, from radically different cook times (pair fish and green beans, for example, since they’ll cook at about the same rate) or an oven that cooks unevenly. Try rotating your sheet pan halfway through cooking (either top shelf to bottom, or just turning it front to back), add foods in stages (root vegetables before fish, for example) and make sure you’re cutting your vegetables to about the same size.

------------
Once you have your combination, there’s a basic strategy to follow. Depending on the thickness of your protein, and whether you decide to cut it into smaller pieces for faster cooking or leave it whole, you may have to tweak the timing.
Heat your oven to 400 or 425 degrees. Toss root vegetables with 1 tablespoon oil, season with salt and pepper and roast on sheet pan for 15 minutes.
Toss all other vegetables with 1 tablespoon oil, salt and pepper, and mix in with root vegetables. Sprinkle your choice of protein with salt, pepper and spices, spread out on top of vegetables and put sheet pan back in oven for another 10 to 15 minutes, until protein is cooked through and vegetables are tender. The timing will vary a bit based on the protein you choose.
Remove protein from pan, stir flavor booster into the vegetables and serve.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Donovan Mitchell spent some time in China last offseason. He's hoping to do it again this year.
The Utah Jazz star guard is planning on participating in the USA Basketball minicamp in August in preparation for the FIBA World Cup in China.
The New York Times' Marc Stein first reported that Mitchell's name was "gaining momentum" to be included on the roster. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Wednesday that Mitchell was indeed going to be at the minicamp with the intention to make the final roster.
Mitchell averaged 23.8 points, 4.2 assists and 4.1 rebounds while shooting 36.2% from 3-point range during his second NBA season.
Other players planning on attending are Portland's Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, Washington's Bradley Beal, New Orleans' Anthony Davis, Houston guards James Harden and Eric Gordon, Boston's Jayson Tatum, Milwaukee's Khris Middleton and the Lakers' Kyle Kuzma.
The training camp will take place Aug. 5-8 in Las Vegas, with the World Cup running Aug. 21 through Sept. 15 in China.

Texto completo: SYDNEY, Australia -- The Australian Federal Police raided the Sydney offices of Australia's public broadcaster on Wednesday, apparently in connection with an article published in 2017 about Australian special forces being investigated over possible war crimes in Afghanistan.
The raid of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's offices came a day after the same agency searched the home, computer and cellphone of a journalist who reported on secret correspondence between government ministries over a plan to expand intelligence agencies' surveillance powers. The police said the two raids were not related.
John Lyons, the executive editor of ABC News and the head of its investigative journalism unit, said on Twitter that the police had arrived at ABC's headquarters with a search warrant that named three journalists. "We'll be taking material with us. It will be sealed," he quoted one of the officers as saying.
The federal police said the raid was connected to allegations of publishing classified material, saying they had received a referral on July 11, 2017, from the Australian military and the then-defense secretary. On that date, ABC published "The Afghan Files," an article based on leaked military documents that detailed clandestine Australian operations in Afghanistan, including cases in which children and unarmed men were killed.
It is against the law in Australia for government officials to disclose classified or secret information. That allows the police to investigate leaks to journalists.
ABC's managing director, David Anderson, said in a statement that it was "highly unusual for the national broadcaster to be raided in this way."
"This is a serious development and raises legitimate concerns over freedom of the press and proper public scrutiny of national security and defense matters," he said. "The ABC stands by its journalists, will protect its sources and continue to report without fear or favor on national security and intelligence issues when there is a clear public interest."

The journalist whose home was raided on Tuesday, Annika Smethurst, is the political editor of The Sunday Telegraph of Sydney, one of Australia's most-read newspapers. She was at her residence in Canberra, the capital, on Tuesday morning when Australian Federal Police officers arrived with a warrant to search her house and belongings.
The police said in a statement that the warrant was related "to the alleged publishing of information classified as an official secret, which is an extremely serious matter that has the potential to undermine Australia's national security."
Asked about the raid on Tuesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said, "It never troubles me that our laws are being upheld."
The raid on Ms. Smethurst's home was believed to be the first such action against an Australian journalist in more than a decade. The Australian union for journalists, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, called it "an outrageous attack on press freedom."
"Australians are entitled to know what their governments do in their name," the union's president, Marcus Strom, said in a statement. "That clearly includes plans by government agencies to digitally spy on Australians by hacking into our emails, bank accounts and text messages."
The Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp. Australia, the parent company of The Sunday Telegraph, said that Ms. Smethurst had complied with the warrant. News Corp. called the raid "outrageous and heavy-handed."
In April 2018, Ms. Smethurst reported that a top-secret proposal to expand the powers of the Australian Signals Directorate, the equivalent of the National Security Agency in the United States, was to be submitted for ministerial approval. She wrote that the proposal would allow "cyber spooks to target onshore threats without the country's top law officer knowing."
In the article, she quoted Mike Pezzullo, then the secretary of the Department of Home Affairs, as advocating "further legislative reform" to help law enforcement agencies combat "online, cybercrime and cyber-enabled criminal threats facing Australia."
Under current law, the signals directorate cannot gather intelligence on Australian citizens. But the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the country's domestic spy agency, have the power to do so with a warrant. They can also turn to the signals directorate for technical guidance.
Since the article was published, there has been no formal government proposal for legislative amendments on the issue.
While the police are allowed to investigate leaks to journalists, members of the news media do have some recourse. Legislation passed in recent years gives journalists protection from having to disclose their sources. But courts can decide that the public interest in learning the identities of sources outweighs any adverse effect of disclosure.
After the raid on Ms. Smethurst's home was reported, an Australian talk radio host, Ben Fordham, told listeners that his executive producer had been contacted by the Department of Home Affairs after he said on the air that several boats full of asylum seekers had tried to come to Australia from Sri Lanka, citing a source he did not identify.
He said the department told his producer it had begun an investigation, targeting his source. "The chances of me revealing my source are zero," Mr. Fordham told his listeners.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS - While historian and best-selling author David McCullough was preparing to deliver a commencement speech at Ohio University 15 years ago, he noticed a building called Cutler Hall.

His curiosity piqued, he ended up at the library archives of Marietta College.

I knew we had opened King Tut's tomb, he told about 450 paying guests gathered Monday at the Ohio Statehouse. The opening of that tomb led to The Pioneers: The Heroic Story of the Settlers Who Brought the American Ideal West, his latest New York Times best seller.

Cutler Hall was named for Manasseh Cutler, one of the founders of Ohio University, the first of its kind west of the Allegheny Mountains. His is one of the stories told in Mr. McCullough's book of European-American settlers who followed the Ohio River from the colonial east into the wilderness of the Northwest Territory.

Mr. Cutler lost two of his sons to disease along the way.

The work they had to do, and the onset of epidemic disease, and the natural fiascoes, storms and earthquakes, all of it happening one after another, Mr. McCullough said. One year they almost starved to death. Compared to them, we are all a bunch of softies. Truly.

With them, the settlers brought principles that would have ramifications for the country that followed - freedom of religion, a taxpayer-financed system of public education, and a prohibition against slavery.

Mr. McCullough, an 85-year-old Pittsburgh native, has made a career out of writing about tragedy and triumph (the Johnstown flood, the Wright Brothers) and re-evaluations of previously overlooked presidents (John Adams, Harry Truman), winning two Pulitzer Prizes along the way.

He told how Ephraim Cutler, one of Manasseh's sons, was roused from his sickbed by Gen. Rufus Putnam to cast what turned out to be the deciding vote in the territory legislature that halted adoption of a resolution that would have opened the territory to slavery.

If that resolution had passed, he said, American history would have been very different.

There would have been no Underground Railroad, Mr. McCullough said. There would have been no Harriet Beecher Stowe or Uncle Tom's Cabin, the most powerfully influential novel ever written by any American.

-… There probably would have been no Abraham Lincoln or Ulysses S. Grant, he said. The whole picture would have been different. -… One man. There's no statue of him. He's not mentioned in any of the history books. He is, in effect, totally forgotten.

Until Mr. McCullough rediscovered the Manasseh's private correspondence in Marietta College as well as that of Putnam.

Mr. McCullough took particular note of the founding of Ohio University and the territory's recognition of a publicly funded education.

The people who are doing the most important work in our society are our teachers, our professors, he said to applause from the audience. And I don't think we can forget that or underestimate the importance not just of paying them more, but of giving them more of our gratitude, more of our respect, more of our sense of appreciation.

His stop at the Statehouse was part of a lecture and book-signing tour, taped by C-Span for later airing on its Book TV program. Prior to his Columbus visit, he appeared in Marietta, which features prominently in the stories.

He spoke in the Statehouse Atrium, just yards from where President Abraham Lincoln delivered a pre-Civil War speech in 1859. He was introduced by Gov. Mike DeWine, with former Govs. Ted Strickland and Bob Taft in attendance.

Fellow historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning authority Doris Kearns Goodwin will return to the Statehouse on June 25 as part of a separate lecture series called Capitol Conversations. She will discuss her latest work, Leadership in Turbulent Times, looking at the presidencies of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson.

Texto completo: How Emma Boettcher Beat James Holzhauer on 'Jeopardy!'
By Julia Jacobs
Before Emma Boettcher arrived at the "Jeopardy!" studio in California on a Tuesday in March, she hadn't heard of James Holzhauer.
Boettcher, a 27-year-old librarian at the University of Chicago, did not know that the contestant she would soon face had already won 32 games, amassed $ 2.46 million and established himself as one of the game show's greatest players of all time. Games are prerecorded, usually five in one day; Holzhauer's first win would not air until April 4.
"It was weird to be a daily watcher of 'Jeopardy!' and somehow there's this phenomenon that I'd never heard of," Boettcher said in an interview last week. (The interview was conducted before the episode aired under the condition it not be published until Monday.)
[After 33 games, James Holzhauer is defeated on "Jeopardy!" ]
Holzhauer was working to beat one particular record: the highest all-time winnings during regular-season game play, a title held by Ken Jennings, who won $ 2.52 million during 74 games in 2004. At the rate Holzhauer was going, it seemed possible for him to surpass Jennings's mark during the first game recorded on March 12, when Boettcher arrived along with about a dozen other contestants who were prepared to play that day.
"I was holding out a small sliver of hope that maybe one of these other people in the room that I'm with will get called up first," Boettcher said.
But as the first game was coming together, Boettcher's name was called.
A master's paper on "Jeopardy!" clues
As a book and theater lover growing up outside Philadelphia, Boettcher first tried out for "Jeopardy!" in high school. As she continued to chase her goal, her father, Kevin Boettcher, bought her books on topics that she needed to bone up on, such as sports.
After finishing college at Princeton, she went to graduate school at the University of North Carolina, where she studied information science. While there, Boettcher decided to write her master's paper on her longtime obsession with a certain game show.
In her 70-page final paper, Boettcher explored whether certain characteristics of a "Jeopardy!" clue could predict its difficulty level. She said she wanted to determine if a computer could predict whether a clue was easy or difficult based on the words it was using or the length of the clue. In essence, she was asking if there was a material difference between a $ 200 clue and a $ 1,000 clue.
Boettcher included nearly 22,000 different "Jeopardy!" clues in the analysis. She concluded, among other things, that the number of component phrases in a clue could help a computer predict its difficulty level. She said the paper helped her understand what makes people perceive language as easy to read, a concept that applies to her current job, where she tries to ensure that the library's website and catalog are user-friendly for university students and faculty.
Meanwhile, she kept trying to get on "Jeopardy!" and after four in-person auditions, Boettcher got the call asking her to appear.
"When she wants something, she is very focused," her father said.
Boettcher prepared for her appearance by simulating the experience of a "Jeopardy!" contestant. Each day, she would stand several feet from the television, pretending that she was standing behind the studio's podium.
Boettcher would hold a pen in her hand, clicking it when she had the answer to one of Alex Trebek's clues. She soon realized that a pen was too skinny, and a toilet-paper holder would work better as a stand-in for the "Jeopardy!" buzzer. She wore different shoes to figure out which pair would be the most comfortable for standing. And she recorded her scores in a notebook, trying to figure out her weak spots on the board.
A winning strategy
In the studio, Boettcher stood behind the podium with a real buzzer in her hand. She was on one end, with another contestant standing between her and Holzhauer, a professional gambler from Las Vegas who was running out of personal facts to share with Trebek during the episode's round of small talk.
"I was trying just not to dwell on it," Boettcher said of Holzhauer's dominance. "I had already steeled myself to expect the unexpected, just roll with whatever was happening, take one clue at a time."
The game started as usual for Holzhauer: with him going straight for the high-value clues, hunting for the Daily Doubles and betting everything he could when he found them. Boettcher had never seen his strategy in action, but she said she knew that players with his level of success typically deployed similar tactics.
Holzhauer's ease making large bets was one reason for his success. His opponents did not always have the same affinity for risk-taking. But Boettcher, who had calculated her rate of accuracy with Daily Doubles while watching at home, felt confident enough to go all in.
When Boettcher hit on a Daily Double, she wagered everything she had, $ 7,600. Boettcher got the clue right, and she felt like she was back in the game.
By Final Jeopardy, Boettcher was ahead of both her opponents. She felt confident that she had the answer right (it related to Shakespeare, and she had been an English major), and she knew she had wagered enough to come out on top. But it didn't quite feel real yet.
"I don't think I felt like I won until Alex said so," she said.
After her victory, Boettcher said she had to begin preparing for the next game and did not get to have much of a conversation with Holzhauer. (To calm herself, she sang out loud the music from "Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812" until the next game.)
Later, Boettcher said, Holzhauer emailed to congratulate her and offer some insight from his weeks in the spotlight. In an email to The New York Times, Holzhauer said he told Boettcher to expect a lot of attention and advised her to have a "game plan to get what she wants out of it."
In an interview, Holzhauer commended Boettcher for playing a "perfect game." All three contestants played impressive games, in fact. Neither Boettcher nor Holzhauer answered a single clue incorrectly, including the Final Jeopardy clue: The line "A great reckoning in a little room" in "As You Like It" is usually taken to refer to this author's premature death. (The correct response: Who is Marlowe?)
"As soon as the game was over," Boettcher said, "I turned to the guys and I said, 'I'm so proud of us. This is so rare. Look at what we did."'

Texto completo: House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings notified Attorney General Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that his committee is moving forward with a vote to hold them in contempt of Congress.
In a pair of letters sent Monday, the Maryland Democrats said the vote will be scheduled due to their failure to comply with congressional subpoenas issued more than two months ago regarding a citizenship question was added the 2020 Census.
“Unfortunately, your actions are part of a pattern. The Trump Administration has been engaged in one of the most unprecedented cover-ups since Watergate, extending from the White House to multiple federal agencies and departments of the government and across numerous investigations,” Cummings wrote to Barr and Ross.
On Thursday, the New York Times reported Republican consultant Thomas Hofeller conducted a study that concluded adding a citizenship question would help Republicans better gerrymander districts to thwart Democrats. Before his death, Hofeller pushed the Trump transition team to consider such a question and then wrote a portion of the Justice Department's draft letter that said it would help enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
“The tactics of this cover-up are now clear,” Cummings said. “The Administration has been challenging Congress’ core authority to conduct oversight under the Constitution, questioning the legislative bases for congressional inquiries, objecting to committee rules and precedents that have been in place for decades under both Republican and Democratic leadership, and making baseless legal arguments to avoid producing documents and testimony.”
The contempt votes could be postponed if Barr and Ross choose to comply with the subpoenas by June 6.

Everest long been a deadly destination; Novice alpinists contribute to ; 11 fatalities in 2019

Texto completo: "The plain truth," the author Jon Krakauer wrote, "is that I knew better, but went to Everest anyway."
It was 1996. Krakauer, a correspondent for Outside magazine, was to hike to Mount Everest's base camp and write a story for the publication. Instead, he met the guides who helped pioneer the commercial climbing business on the world's highest peak, and convinced the magazine to let him climb to the top. His editors obliged.
By the end of his trip, eight climbers had died during a storm. At the time, it was the deadliest attempted ascent on the mountain. Eleven people have died on Everest this year, due in large part to the vast contingent of unqualified and unguided alpinists who now flock to the mountain during climbing season, the very phenomenon Krakauer went to document.
Three years before his trip, life on Everest changed, but to understand that, you have to understand the mountain's history.
British climbers made early attempts to reach the peak on the northern side of the summit in Tibet in the early 20th century. George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were spotted within hundreds of feet of the top in 1924, but the two never returned to camp to relay whether they'd made it. Mallory's body was found in 1999. Irvine's remains missing.
Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay made the first official ascent in 1953 on the mountain's southern side, in Nepal. The first Americans summited in 1963.
But amid the Cold War, access to the mountain was severely restricted. China closed the Tibetan portion of Everest from 1950 to 1980. Nepal for years did not allow foreigners into the country to climb Everest unless they were accompanied by scientists, and when it finally opened its border in 1985, it issued one Everest permit per season per route.
By the 1990s, international tensions had eased and more qualified alpinists began showing up at the mountain, hoping to gain access to climb.
"Everest, you could always get a permit, but you had to be sponsored by your country's climbing agency," said Todd Burleson, founder and president of guide service Alpine Ascents International. He's led two guided journeys to Everest's summit, and said aspiring climbers used to wait several years until their turn for a permit arrived.
"Up until about 1990, you'd take a group of the best climbers from your country to Everest and if one of those climbers got to the top, you were a national success," he said. "But during the '90s we learned a lot, and there were a lot of people who couldn't get on those groups who were very skilled. And then we started bringing them to the mountain."
Sensing opportunities for revenue and fresh off an economic modernization, China began granting more permits. Then Nepal liberalized the permitting process to keep up. Where fewer than 2,000 people attempted to climb the mountain in the 1980s, according to the Himalayan Database, nearly 4,000 have tried each of the past two decades.
"In 1993 the world changed completely," said Eric Simonson, director at International Mountain Guides and a multiple-time Everest summiteer.
Guiding agencies like Adventure Consultants and Mountain Madness, the subjects of Krakauer's 1997 book "Into Thin Air," began leading trips up Everest. Local Sherpas, who experienced mountaineers say are excellent climbers but sometimes unqualified guides, established companies that offered trips at less than half the cost, but not every agency did a thorough vetting of clients to see if they were physically capable of scaling Everest.
And so crowds arrived at the mountain as the services at base camp improved, aided by technology and more precise weather tracking that allowed climbers to reach the peak in more predictably safe conditions.
But the cluster of people on the mountain is dangerous, too, sometimes preventing swift evacuations and cramming climbers together on perilous slopes.
By 1996, one of the world's most remote locales was becoming a tourist attraction. Krakauer, an avid climber, arrived to tell that story.
He summited the mountain on May 10, then returned to a forward base camp. As he descended, the weather turned, and dozens of climbers from three groups were stuck in a traffic jam and exposed to a hurricane-strength storm. So many climbers assaulted the summit at once - even after delays in securing ropes along the treacherous "death zone" some 26,000 feet in the air - they couldn't turn around in a timely fashion and retreat for cover.
Eight climbers died, including three guides.
"The commercialized trips and the overcrowding were what caused the tragedy (in 1996)," Hillary, who died in 2008, told Time magazine in 2003. "It was inevitable. I've been forecasting a disaster of that nature for some time. And it will happen again."
Krakauer wrote a 17,000-word article about the tragedy for Outside, then turned it into a book that made The New York Times bestseller list and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Sony bought its film rights nearly immediately after publication, and it was adapted into a TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest") in 1997, and a feature film ("Everest") in 2015.
(Krakauer has criticized the 2015 movie for departing from actual events on the mountain. He told the Los Angeles Times it was "total bull." Director Baltasar Kormakur responded that his script was not based on the book.)
"I walked off of that mountain," said Burleson, who was awarded the American Alpine Club's most prestigious honor for his part in the 1996 rescue effort, "and I had phone calls from all over the world asking, 'Can I climb Everest? Can I climb Everest?' Before that, there were only a few of us and we knew what we were doing. But now everybody wanted to do it."
The new demand for Everest expeditions outpaced the supply, especially from the mostly Western guide agencies that had offered such services, said Alan Arnette, an Everest expert, summit coach and blogger.
Those firms typically took small groups, often no more than 10 clients, and brought along up to four guides with several more Sherpas, who help fasten ropes and haul gear. Since acclimatizing to Everest's elevation can take days, and the climbing is slow going, the average Everest quest takes close to two months and costs around $70,000.
Other guide agencies began leading larger trips at lower prices without requiring climbers to have certain requisite experience, experts say, and the mountain got even more crowded. And as more underqualified adventurers attempt to summit the peak, Everest was normalized as a tourist destination.
"If you have the money, you can go," Burleson said.

Texto completo: "Full Count, The Education of a Pitcher" hit the New York Times' Best Sellers list last week and "this book would not be successful unless David (Cone) delivered," Jack Curry said of the insights and anecdotes culled from a 17-year big-league career that included five world championships.
NEW YORK – A couple years back, inside the Yankee Stadium press box, Jack Curry made his pitch to David Cone.
"I would love to get inside the mind of a pitcher, you being that pitcher," Curry told Cone. "Tell us what it's like to be on the mound, when times are great and when times are dreary."
After about two minutes, Cone said: "I'm in," and a book was born.
"Full Count, The Education of a Pitcher" hit the New York Times' Best Sellers list last week and "this book would not be successful unless David delivered," Curry said of the insights and anecdotes culled from a 17-year big-league career that included five world championships.
"His honesty about how insecure pitchers can be, how much self-doubt they have out there on the mound, that really stands out to me," Curry said before a recent Red Sox-Yankees game.
"As successful as he was, there were probably moments in every start where he thought, 'Wow, am I going to get through this next inning?' "
Yet, the original book idea probably dates back 20 years, when Cone was pitching for the Yankees and Curry – an Emmy-winning YES Network analyst since 2010 – was covering the Yankees for the Times.
"When he'd talk to us after the game, there was always so much thought that went into the craft of pitching," Curry said. "Once we started working together at YES," where Cone serves as a game commentator, "that burst to the forefront even more."
Jersey strong The pinnacle of Curry's own baseball career is preserved in a laminated newspaper clip from the Jersey Journal:
"Jack Curry bounced a two-out single over third base in the bottom of the seventh inning to give the Hawks a come-from-behind-decision..."
Hudson Catholic wasn't in the midst of a memorable season, but any victory over rival St. Peter's Prep "was a big deal," Curry said of his "one shining moment" as an outfielder for the Jersey City high school.
As a freshman at Fordham University, Curry's thoughts about walking on to the baseball team ended after one practice, surveying the Rams' cast.
"I signed up for the school newspaper and the school radio station the next day," said Curry, a Bergen County resident for the past 27 years.
Around the same time Curry began at Fordham, Cone was in the low minor leagues of his hometown Kansas City Royals, recovering from a torn ACL in his left knee – one of his first major professional hurdles.
Working on the book with Cone, "he talked about some of his Midwest life lessons, and there's some overlap there," Curry said of his Jersey City upbringing.
"There's a toughness of growing up in New Jersey," Curry said. "It's okay to get knocked down in life and prove that you can get back up again."
An inside pitch "Full Count" opens with Cone having a conversation with himself, three outs shy of his perfect game in 1999.
Staring at his reflection in a clubhouse bathroom, "His first words were: 'You better not blow this,' " Curry said of Cone's internal chat. "I think that was indicative of who he was as a pitcher."
Over 300-plus pages, Cone recounts his youthful hardheadedness and the heartbreak of being traded by the Royals. Years later, he hated being dealt by the Mets but loved the idea of returning as a Yankee.
There are stories about his interactions with the late George Steinbrenner that "the late '70s Yankees would never have gotten away with," Curry said.
The authors go inside Cone's need for a catcher as a co-pilot, connecting with Joe Girardi and Gary Carter but struggling with Jorge Posada and explaining why.
"It started out as a pitching journey, and I think the more we dug in...it became a personal journey for him too," Curry said.
And that includes Cone's relationship with his father, "his first and best pitching coach, but his dad was tough."
Guided by Curry, Cone's personal honesty has made 'Full Count' a best-seller.
In a recent interview, Cone described himself as "forever pitcher," who'll never stop thinking about the craft.
"When I die, I'll be thinking about pitching," Cone concluded, prompting Curry to tell him what a phenomenal quote that was. Oh, and one more thing.
"You think you might have given me that for the book?"
"Full Count, The Education of a Pitcher" hit the New York Times' Best Sellers list last week and "this book would not be successful unless David (Cone) delivered," Jack Curry said of the insights and anecdotes culled from a 17-year big-league career that included five world championships.

Texto completo: You don't have to be a physicist or geologist to know that the Earth's climate is changing in ways that are destined to make the landscape less hospitable for humans. Just look around. The dangers are evident.
In the final weeks of May, tornadoes ripped through the center of the United States day after day, destroying homes and schools, hurling trees as if they were mere matchsticks, inflicting countless injuries across communities and leaving some families to mourn their dead. This virulent tornado season is just one example of extreme weather: The past few months have also seen record cold, record heat and record flooding.
If human beings were rational, our top scientists and political leaders would be huddled together, hashing out plans and policies to try to mitigate the damage from greenhouse gases - with the goal of salvaging human life. Faced with an existential threat, a fierce peril that will alter the planet in significant ways, presidents and premiers and prime ministers would overcome their traditional
Enmities, as they do in the movies, and come together to save humanity.
Alas, that has not happened.
Human beings, it turns out, are deeply irrational, tribal, ignorant, greedy and selfish. Sometimes, we are just plain crazy. President Donald Trump has reversed a series of steps taken by his predecessors to ameliorate climate change and has commenced initiatives that will further damage the environment. Moreover, the president has launched a war on the science of climate change and the experts who practice it, trying to create widespread doubts about their expertise.
Here's one example: James Reilly, whom Trump appointed to head the United States Geological Survey, has ordered his staff to produce computer-generated climate assessments that stop at the year 2040, rather than continuing through the end of the century, as the agency had done before, according to The New York Times. That's because the most severe consequences of global warming will kick in after 2040.
And that's only the beginning. Trump is toying with an idea pushed by 79-year-old William Happer, who serves on the National Security Council, to create a special climate review board to denounce the work of respected climate scientists. Happer was a well-respected physicist at Princeton for many years, but he is also a climate quack with no expertise in climate science.
While even elementary schoolchildren now know that carbon dioxide is among the greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, warming the Earth, Happer made this idiotic statement about carbon dioxide in an interview in 2014: "The demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler."
The flat-earthers notwithstanding, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continue to wreak such havoc that the survival of humanity is in doubt. One million animal species are at risk of extinction, with climate change among the causes, according to a recent report from the United Nations. The polar ice caps have melted faster in the last 20 years than in the previous 10,000, raising the water level in the oceans, which will increase flooding. By the end of the century, some coastal cities will be uninhabitable, scientists predict.
So, despite the blithe denials of the climate skeptics, the planet is undergoing fundamental shifts that will prove hostile to humankind. All the know-nothings have accomplished is to ensure that humanity won't change its habits quickly enough to survive.

Texto completo: The May 23 Espionage Act indictment of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange evoked justified outrage and condemnation from media organizations and free speech advocates. Federal prosecutors claim in the indictment that Assange illegally received classified U.S. government information on United States military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, State Department cables involving U.S. foreign relations and the identities of human sources helping American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Carrie DeCell of the Knight Institute at Columbia University observed on Twitter that the “government argues that Assange violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and then publishing classified information. That’s exactly what good national security and investigative journalists do every day.”
Masha Gessen at The New Yorker addressed an equally weighty issue when she observed, “The last thing we want the U.S. government, or any government, to do is to start deciding who is and who is not a journalist.”
I’m going to take that analogy one step further: the last thing we want is executive branch departments and agencies unilaterally and selectively asserting what should or should not be considered legitimately classified information.
The very law being used to charge Assange was passed over 100 years ago at the beginning of America’s entry into World War I. The Espionage Act of 1917 was used by the Justice Department and Postal Service to cow, investigate, shut down and even prosecute news outlets that challenged the Wilson administration’s wartime policies.
One of the most prominent targets was former Rep. Victor Berger of Wisconsin and his newspaper, the Milwaukee Leader. For publishing editorials critical of the war, Berger was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act in 1919. Though the conviction was overturned two years later, in the interim, Berger won reelection to the House twice but his colleagues refused to seat him.
In Assange’s case, he and Wikileaks did exactly what newspapers have done for decades — seek information about U.S. government policies and actions that were either questionable or outright illegal and publish information accordingly.
In 1971 for the New York Times it was the Pentagon Papers — the classified history of the Vietnam War leaked by then-RAND Corporation analyst and former Marine Corps infantry captain Daniel Ellsberg.
For the Washington Post, it was Watergate, including then-Attorney General John Mitchell’s illegal, secret surveillance slush fund used to target Democratic politicians. For Assange and his then-U.S. Army intelligence analyst accomplice, Chelsea Manning, it was about exposing U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the Assange Espionage Act indictment, federal prosecutors specifically invoke Manning’s sharing and Assange’s receipt of classified information as also involving violations of Executive Order 13526, National Security Information, which states (Sec. 1.4(a)) that “military plans, weapons systems, or operations” are considered classified under the executive order.
But the Army officials who classified the 2007 Apache helicopter video released by Assange showing the killing of Iraqi civilians misused the classification system to conceal criminal conduct — something expressly forbidden by Sec. 1.7(a) of the very same Executive Order federal prosecutors cited in the Assange indictment.
So where are the indictments against Pentagon or CIA officials who knowingly and deliberately misused the classification system to conceal acts of torture or other war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere? The hypocrisy and selective application of federal laws, regulations and executive orders in matters of national security is on full display in the Assange indictment. And there is another deeply troubling thing about the latest Assange indictment: the Justice Department’s attempt to criminalize the digital transfer of government information to third parties.
The 18th count against Assange focuses on alleged violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), namely that Assange (via Manning) sought to “knowingly access a computer … to obtain information that has been determined by the United States Government … to require protection against unauthorized disclosure” and to “willfully communicate, deliver, transmit, and cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same, to any person not entitled to receive it.”
The indictment also mentions three times Assange and Manning using “a cloud drop box” for the exchange of the purloined documents. In effect, prosecutors are arguing that the entire chain of digital exchanges between Wikileaks and Manning were illegal, and that the use of a “cloud storage” mechanism was a key feature of the crime.
Multiple news organizations utilize the Freedom of the Press Foundation’s encrypted SecureDrop system for receiving sensitive, including classified, documents from sources seeking to expose illegal or questionable government activities. If federal prosecutors prevail on Count 18 of the Assange indictment, it would open up every news organization in the world utilizing SecureDrop or a similar system to a CFAA prosecution — whether a whistleblower was digitally passing along Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports of immigrant abuse, Pentagon documents showing contracting irregularities, etc.
Prosecutors are attempting to overturn the Supreme Court decision in the Pentagon Papers case through a statutory Trojan Horse (the CFAA) all while deliberately ignoring the real crime in this episode — the deliberate misuse of federal classified information statutes and executive orders to conceal American government war crimes.

Rhubarb lovers unite! (Everyone else can eat dirt) As a wise food writer once said, 'In my world there is no such thing as too much rhubarb!'

Texto completo: Last year, during the most important season of the New England calendar - rhubarb season (need you ask?) - my colleague Meredith Goad made a sweet, thoughtful gesture.
She knew how much I loved Ten Ten PiÃ© bakery/cafe in Portland (now gone, alas). And she knew that I adored rhubarb. So one day in June, she returned to the office from an interview bearing a small bag with an unexpected treat for me: a jewel-like Ten Ten PiÃ© rhubarb-almond tart.
I had barely thanked her, barely wiped the crumbs and butter and bliss from my face when Meredith spoiled everything with a tweet:
"I don't care for rhubarb but I brought this tart from @MarkossMiller (who co-owned Ten Ten PiÃ©) for @PGrodinsky & she spent the next 10 minutes trying to convince me to taste it. Rhubarb fans are like Southern Baptist evangelists - always certain they can change your mind so you'll go to rhubarb heaven."
A declaration of war
Yes, that's how I took it. Wouldn't you?
The tweets - and Facebook posts - did not stop with Meredith. I was dumbfounded and despondent to learn that rhubarb haters are all around us, cleverly disguised as otherwise intelligent, perfectly reasonable people. One such person tweeted, "I'm with her! Rhubarb and Fiddleheads: Sounds good, taste bad." Another messaged Meredith on Facebook in support of her foolish, wrong-headed rhubarb notions, "Rhubarb is awful. Stick to your guns."
Really? These so-called Mainers do not care for this most quintessential of New England fruits??!
Yes, I wrote "fruits." Please don't send me a gotcha note. As food editor, naturally I am aware that rhubarb is technically a vegetable - despite a court in Buffalo, New York, classifying it as a fruit in 1947 on the grounds that, botany aside, Americans treat/eat it like a fruit. (The decision, in which the judge quotes from court testimony, is a fun read. A Mr. Louis Muchnik testifies "that he had eaten rhubarb pie in restaurants, stewed rhubarb at home, and rhubarb with cream for breakfast; that he had never eaten it as a side dish with poultry; and that he considered rhubarb pie a fruit pie since it was made like apple pie or peach pie." Also testifying was a Mr. George R. Bewley, who said that "he had eaten custard pie, chocolate pie, and squash pie as dessert, but would not call those items fruit.")
I am also aware that rhubarb started life far from New England. I've variously read China, Mongolia and Siberia. No wonder it's at home in Maine - it likes the cold.
The war drags on
Two months later, and the rhubarb hubbub still simmered. (Note to readers: Rhubarb is not only delicious, it's also fun to say.) I baked an applesauce cake and brought it to work. My colleague business reporter Ed Murphy wrote me a thank-you note. A backhanded thank-you note. "It's delicious," he emailed me, "so glad it's not rhubarb season." When I responded that he was on my guest list for my All-Rhubarb Dinner Party, already scheduled for 10 months later during the upcoming and highly anticipated 2019 rhubarb season, he declined the invitation. "I'm busy that month," he emailed me.
I discovered others on the anti- (or anti-ish) rhubarb list. Culinary superstars who have since sunk in my esteem. There was renowned English food writer Jane Grigson, who called herself a recovering "rhubarb sufferer" in "Jane Grigson's Fruit Book"; James Beard, Father of American Cooking and inspiration for the New York City-based foundation where I spent seven formative years of my life as a professional food writer; and, Eliza Leslie, a popular 19th-century cookbook writer from Philadelphia, my hometown, as it happens.
"Despite Miss Leslie, rhubarb has come into general use," Beard wrote in "James Beard's American Cookery," "although I would not describe it as a champion among spring fruit." Seemingly holding his nose, he proceeded to give his readers recipes for Baked Rhubarb, Rhubarb Fool and Rhubarb Ring with Strawberries.
With all due respect, who are these people? Do they hate puppies and babies and raindrops on roses, too?
Comfort zone
Like cranberries, lemon and sumac (other ingredients I find it a pleasure to cook with), rhubarb offers a sour wallop in an American diet that has, at times, skewed sweet. It brings balance and interest to many an otherwise one-note dessert and liveliness to many a savory dish. After a winter diet of braised, brown, mellow foods that make one want to nap, it's as energizing as an early June dip in Casco Bay.
In the garden, rhubarb is tough and reliable. Unlike my rose bushes, it never gives me a moment's worry. Rhubarb is, I once read on a gardening website, "a happy plant." And for those who understand and appreciate it, it makes for happy eaters, too.
It was a huge relief to find some rhubarb lovers. My crowd.
There was Thyra Porter, who wrote on Meredith's Facebook page, "Jamie Oliver has an amazing pork/rhubarb recipe that might change your mind."
And our Green Plate Specialist Christine Burns Rudalevige, who chimed in with a recommendation for rhubarb pound cake from the New York Times. "I've made this twice and it is fabulous."
Cookbook writer Nancy Harmon Jenkins magnanimously offered to eat Meredith's portion of the Ten Ten PiÃ© rhubarb-almond tart that had launched this rhubarb ruckus. Harmon Jenkins may have written some half dozen cookbooks on Italy and the Mediterranean, but when it comes to rhubarb, this 13th-generation Mainer knows her roots. Several sources, including Maine's Cooperative Extension, credit a Maine gardener with bringing rhubarb to America in the first place, from Europe between 1790 and 1800. God bless Maine gardeners.
Right-thinking rhubarb eaters are not, of course, confined to New England. You can find them in many parts of the world: England, China, Poland, Iran and Afghanistan among them (though not in Texas. When I lived in Texas, I devoured figs from the trees and pined for rhubarb. Now it's the other way around). Last winter, when the pleasures of Maine rhubarb lay dormant under feet of ice and snow, I encountered Trine Hahnemann's recipe for Choux Pastry with Rhubarb in her cookbook "Copenhagen Food." It brought a green-tinged, pale pink ray of sunshine into my chilly, rhubarb-deprived house.
"I think most cakes should be made with rhubarb," Hahnemann wrote with that recipe. "In my world there is no such thing as too much rhubarb!"
The 2019 rhubarb season
A year passes in which I try to not to let Meredith's shocking misjudgment affect our working relationship. Rhubarb gives way to blueberries, the tourists arrive, the tomatoes ripen, the kids go back to school, the leaves color, the snow falls, the red-winged blackbirds return, the daffodils bloom, and here we are at rhubarb season once again. We are sitting around a table at our weekly features meeting brainstorming story ideas when Meredith has the nerve to bring up this sore subject. Admittedly, it is not my best moment, but I go on the attack: "I simply cannot understand how you can dislike rhubarb," I say in a superior yet evangelizing tone.
Meredith lines up her defense: "Lots of people don't like some ingredients."
Trying hard to keep the peace, I am ready to concede the point. Then she makes a fatal mistake: "Canned pig brains in milk gravy," she says defiantly.
It was a dish that chef Christian Hayes, of Dandelion Catering in Yarmouth, rode to a $10,000 victory last year on the television contest show "Chopped." Meredith has taken it out of her back pocket in an attempt to bolster her point, but I am having none of it. This is her comparison??!!
Sour, emphatic, frisky, peppy, lovable rhubarb (oh delightful herald, at long last, of summer's arrival in Maine)
Versus
Canned pig brains in milk gravy. Even Hayes conceded that the pig thing was "super vile" and "really disgusting."
Rhubarb lovers, victory is ours! And in this case, it tastes gloriously sour.

Texto completo: Chinese President Xi Jinping's vision for putting Beijing at the center of global economic affairs is about forging new connections of all kinds, from building infrastructure to strengthening cultural ties. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) offers lofty promises of "win-win" investments that have persuaded some 126 countries to sign on. But critics caution that the project, which began in 2013, stokes corruption, harms the environment, creates financial dependencies and extends Chinese military power. The BRI is ambiguous by design, which has birthed several myths.
Myth No. 1 China is spending trillions. "China's $8 trillion construction programme 'riskiest environmental project in history,'" warned a British headline last year. The New York Times has called it "China's $1 Trillion Plan to Shake Up the Economic Order."
Exact figures are elusive, because the BRI is loosely defined, ever-expanding and open-ended. Many estimates reflect China's promises for infrastructure investment, only a fraction of which has been delivered so far. According to data from the American Enterprise Institute, China had spent roughly $400 billion as of mid-2018. The highest estimates tend to count all trade and investment between China and partner countries, mistakenly attributing it all to the BRI, or they conflate the BRI's size with the world's needs for infrastructure.
Compared with those needs, the BRI doesn't look so big. Asia alone requires $26 trillion for infrastructure by 2030 to maintain growth and adapt to climate change, according to the Asian Development Bank. That provides an opportunity for countries, including the United States , to shape and benefit from the world's infrastructure boom. Officials in Beijing have allowed BRI estimates to balloon for political gains , but Chinese lending has been declining and faces head winds. The country's foreign reserves have dropped since the BRI was announced, meaning it has less money to dole out but more partners to please - potentially a recipe for disappointment.
Myth No. 2 Military motives drive the BRI. China's " efforts to build ports around the world aren't because they want to be good shipbuilders and stewards of waterways, but rather they have a state national security element to each and every one of them," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned . "It is a concerted, strategic endeavor by China to gain a foothold and displace the United States and our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region," the head of U.S. Pacific Command said last year.
To be sure, most infrastructure can serve both commercial and military purposes. Some BRI projects, like ports in Pakistan and elsewhere, could eventually benefit China's military or encourage its expansion. But to date, the BRI is mostly an economic and political program with military implications, rather than the other way around.
Ultimately, China's desire to find new markets for its bloated state-owned enterprises is a stronger motivating force than the quest for military power. China is home to seven of the world's 10 largest construction companies and used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the United States did during the entire 20th century. The overriding incentive for Chinese state-owned enterprises is simply to build. They get paid regardless of whether projects are economically viable or serve Chinese foreign policy objectives.
Myth No. 3 Chinese projects are cheap. China's partners often claim they have struck great deals. "The Chinese Government and China's export import bank will offer better conditions than any development bank loan available in Europe," Hungary's minister of foreign affairs and trade explained in 2016. "Our banks don't offer these kinds of interest rates," the head of Malaysia's Finance Ministry said in 2017.
But the BRI is a middleman's dream, offering up big projects with little oversight, and China's opaque lending practices increase the risk of cost inflation and corruption. After reports of missing funds, including some related to Chinese projects, that same former Malaysian finance minister faces jail time, as does Malaysia's former prime minister, Najib Razak. In Myanmar, the cost of a port for which Beijing was originally planning to charge $7.3 billion was slashed to $1.3 billion after U.S. officials sent technical experts to help review the deal. Without adequate oversight, officials fill their pockets, and citizens foot the bill.
When China's offer is the only one on the table - which it often is in risky business environments - Beijing naturally presses for its own interests. Most Chinese lending is on commercial terms , with higher interest rates than standard foreign aid. Chinese firms overwhelmingly get the contracts , and deals can include other one-sided provisions . In Montenegro, a highway deal worth 20 percent of the country's gross domestic product requires that any disputes be settled in Beijing courts and allows China to take land as collateral. It's not a terrific bargain for Montenegro.
Myth No. 4 Belt and Road is centrally run. BRI maps depict a world in which all roads lead to Beijing. The project sounds like it's centrally run in government white papers and speeches by Xi, who has called for the creation of six "economic corridors" that stretch across the supercontinent of Eurasia. "China's government has taken other actions to centralize [BRI] within its foreign policy," explains a U.S. Defense Department report, pointing to those corridors as well as Chinese policy planning and aid coordination groups.
But the reality is messy on the ground, where interest groups within and outside China are shaping activities to suit their own agendas. Xi's six corridors remain mostly aspirational; there is little evidence that more projects are happening within them than outside them. With projects in the Arctic, cyberspace and outer space, managing everything may be impossible. No wonder the BRI brand has been appropriated for fashion shows, marathons, dentistry and other unrelated activities. With generous subsidies up for grabs, China's provincial governments have rushed to announce new China-Europe railway services, undercutting one another on pricing and sowing confusion. The result is a set of activities that is often more chaotic than strategic.
Myth No. 5 The Silk Road is returning. The BRI was initially divided into two components, the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, names that evoke the travels of explorers like Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta. In the years since, advocates of the project have embraced this romanticized marketing device. "I hope President Xi's visit will further strengthen the ties between Italy and China: two countries that, since Marco Polo's time, have a long-lasting friendly commercial relationship, built and developed along the Silk Road," a senior Italian official wrote this spring when defending Italy's recent decision to join the BRI. When a train from China arrived in London in 2017, on the first direct freight route between the two countries, the Telegraph declared it "a new chapter in the history of the centuries-old trading route."
Overland trade is not making an epochal comeback, since 90 percent of the world's goods travel by sea, but great-power competition is. A better comparison is the struggle among colonial powers that lasted from the mid-19th century to World War I. Many of the BRI's key technologies - deep-water ports, high-speed railways and fiber optic cables - are descendants of technology that Western powers leveraged during this period to expand their access to foreign markets. Britain, Germany and the United States pursued major infrastructure plans at great costs. In some places, China is literally replacing and retracing colonial projects, building railways in Africa and laying data cables under the sea.

Texto completo: It’s going to be more difficult for Democratic presidential candidates to the make the stage of the third and fourth debates, according to new qualifying rules released by the Democratic National Committee Wednesday.
For debates scheduled for September and October, candidates will have to hit 2% in four qualifying polls and tally at least 130,000 individual donors, according to the DNC guidance. For the first and second rounds of debates, the DNC is requiring candidates to either hit at least 1% in three polls or receive campaign contributions from at least 65,000 donors.
The higher polling threshold could certainly narrow who from the nearly two dozen candidate field will make it to the stage. So far, eight candidates have hit received 2% or more support in four national or early-state voting polls: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke.
Can Biden's lead hold? 2020 frontrunner in May? It's probably not a good thing
Where things stand: What you need to know about the 2020 election so far
For the September debate, each poll must be publicly released between June 28, 2019, and August 28, 2019. The DNC said it will announce deadlines for qualifying polls ahead of the October debate will be released in the future.
The approved polling includes surveys conducted by the Associated Press, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Des Moines Register, Fox News, Monmouth University, NBC News, New York Times, National Public Radio (NPR), Quinnipiac University, University of New Hampshire, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Washington Post, and Winthrop University.
The DNC also announced Wednesday that the third debate will be hosted on Sept. 12 by ABC News, in partnership with Univision. A second night of debating will be held to accommodate a large field if necessary, according to the DNC.
The first debate is scheduled to be held over two nights on June 26 and 27 in Miami, and the second round is scheduled for July 30 and 31 in Detroit.
The campaigns of Biden, Sanders, Harris, Warren, Buttigieg, O’Rourke, Booker as well as entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, Gov. Jay Inslee and Marianne Williamson, say they have met both the polling and donor qualifications to take part in the first two rounds of debates.
Klobuchar, former Rep. John Delaney, former Gov. John Hickenlooper, Gov. Steve Bullock, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Rep. Tim Ryan and Rep. Eric Swalwell report they’ve met one of the thresholds to take part in the first debate.
Rep. Seth Moulton, Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam, Sen. Michael Bennet and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio have yet to meet either qualifying threshold.
Delaney, who announced in July 2017 that he was running for the White House, wrote a pointed letter to DNC chairman Tom Perez Wednesday raising questions about how the committee put together the criteria.
Among the questions Delaney asked in the letter was who on the committee was involved with putting together the criteria and whether Perez or his staff spoke with any candidates or their campaigns about the new qualifying thresholds.
The DNC is capping participation at 20 candidates for the first two round of debates and says it will announce who will make it to the stage about two weeks before each scheduled debate.
