Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump recently asked the Australian prime minister and other foreign leaders to help Attorney General William Barr with an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that shadowed his administration for more than two years, the Justice Department said Monday.
The White House restricted access to the transcript of the call to the Australian prime minister to a small group of the president's aides, one of the officials said, an unusual decision that is similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president that is at the heart of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Trump.
Like that call, the discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia shows the extent to which Trump sees the attorney general as a critical partner in his goal to show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt and partisan origins and the extent that Trump sees the Justice Department inquiry as a potential way to gain leverage over America's closest allies.
And like the call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, the discussion with Morrison shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.
Trump initiated the discussion in recent weeks with Morrison explicitly for the purpose of requesting Australia's help in the Justice Department review of the Russia investigation, according to the two people with knowledge of the discussion. Barr requested that Trump speak to Morrison, one of the people said. It came only weeks after Trump seemed to make military aid to Ukraine contingent on Zelensky doing him the “favor" of helping Barr.
The Washington Post on Monday disclosed a similar set of overtures.
Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in the Justice Department inquiry, people familiar with the matter told the Post.
The direct involvement of the nation's top law enforcement official shows the priority Barr places on the investigation being conducted by John Durham, the US attorney in Connecticut, who has been assigned the sensitive task of reviewing US intelligence work surrounding the 2016 election and its aftermath.
Barr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter. It was not Barr's first trip to Italy to meet intelligence officials, the person said.
Monday night, Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec confirmed the call to Morrison and other foreign leaders.
"At Attorney General Barr's request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the attorney general and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials," Kupec said.
Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct.
Justice Department officials have said that it would be neither illegal nor untoward for Trump to ask world leaders to cooperate with Barr. And it is within Barr's powers to speak with foreign law enforcement officials about what his prosecutor needs from them.
In the request to Australia, Trump was in effect asking the Australian government to investigate itself. The FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election began after Australian officials told the bureau that the Russian government had made overtures to the Trump campaign about releasing political damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
Australian officials shared that information after its top official in Britain met in London in May 2016 with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who told the Australians about the Russian dirt on Clinton.
Papadopoulos also said that he had heard that the Russians had “thousands" of Clinton's e-mails from Joseph Mifsud, an academic. Mifsud, who was last seen working as a visiting professor in Rome, has disappeared. Trump allies, like the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have put forth an unsubstantiated claim that Western intelligence agencies planted Mifsud to trap Papadopoulos.
Barr began a review of the Russia investigation this year with the stated goal of determining whether law enforcement or intelligence officials acted inappropriately in their decision during the height of the 2016 presidential campaign to begin investigating whether the Trump campaign was conspiring with Russia's election interference. But the president has made no secret he sees a larger purpose: to validate his victory and to settle scores with his perceived “deep state" enemies.
The investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election outraged Trump, who cast it as a politically motivated "witch hunt."
The Justice Department said last week that it is exploring the extent to which other countries, including Ukraine, “played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign." At the very least, Barr has made it clear that he sees his work treading into sensitive territory: how the law enforcement and intelligence agencies of the United States' closest allies share information with US officials.
Mueller's investigation confirmed that Australia played a central role in the origins of the original FBI investigation, even if his final report does not mention the country by name. It said that information from a “foreign government" prompted the FBI to “open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities."
Morrison, the Australian prime minister, met Trump in Washington this month for official meetings and a state dinner at the White House. Barr attended the dinner.
The attorney general sparked a controversy in April when he said during congressional testimony that “spying" on the Trump campaign had taken place as part of the Russia investigation and that there was a “failure among a group of leaders at the upper echelons" of the intelligence community. He later announced that he was reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation., and Trump said, “I am so proud of our attorney general that he is looking into it."
In May, Trump told reporters that he wanted his attorney general to scrutinize all of the countries that he believes conspired to damage his 2016 election hopes.
Stephen Miller, a top adviser to Trump, said on “Fox News Sunday" that the president initiated the July call with Zelensky in part to discuss “the collusion investigation that is inflicted so much pain and damage to our country."
But separately Sunday, the president's first homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, said the theory that the Ukrainian government had intervened in 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign had been “completely debunked."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has asked multiple countries, including Australia, to help Attorney General William Barr's ongoing inquiry into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's examination of Russian interference in the 2016 election investigation, White House and Justice Department officials said Monday.
Trump has sought the assistance – most recently with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison – on behalf of his attorney general who is leading a politically charged internal inquiry to determine whether U. S. officials abused their authority in the now-concluded Russia investigation.
“As the Department of Justice has previously announced, a team led by U. S. Attorney John Durham is investigating the origins of the U. S. counterintelligence probe of the Trump 2016 presidential campaign," Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. "Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr’s request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the attorney general and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials. ”
It was not immediately clear how many countries Trump has contacted on Barr's behalf.
The disclosure, first reported by The New York Times, comes as Congress is examining a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.
Barr's role in Ukraine?: Trump inserts AG Barr into political firestorm in call with Ukraine president
During that call, which has prompted a House impeachment inquiry, the president invoked Barr's name, repeatedly indicating that Barr would be calling to assist in reviving a then-dormant inquiry into a Ukrainian energy company, where Biden's son, Hunter Biden, served as a board member.
Neither the former vice president nor his son have been accused of wrongdoing by the Ukrainian government.
Justice officials said Barr had no prior knowledge that Trump had suggested the Ukrainian president work with the attorney general.
Australia, however, played a pivotal role in the FBI's decision to launch the initial investigation into Russia interference in 2016. At the time, Australia's top diplomat in the United Kingdom passed information to U. S. authorities after a meeting with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. The diplomat said Papadopoulos confided that Russians were offering up damaging information on then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Papadopoulos later served served two weeks in prison for lying to FBI agents about his interactions with a Russian national while working for the Trump campaign. Trump has dismissed Papadopoulos as a low-level campaign aide.
He was the first former Trump aide to be sentenced in Mueller's investigation of Moscow's interference operation.
Papadopoulos admitted that he lied to the FBI about interactions in which people he thought were linked to the Russian government described Moscow having “thousands of emails” containing damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
An Australian government spokesman Monday acknowledged Trump's recent entreaties.
"The Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation," the government said in a written statement. "The (prime minister) confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the president. "

'Horrific and chilling': Whistleblower advocates complain as Trump tries to identify source of Ukraine complaint
Earlier this year, Trump appeared to offer a preview of the attorney general's expected efforts to pursue contacts with other governments in the Mueller examination.
"He can look, and I hope he looks at the UK, and I hope he looks at Australia, and I hope he looks at Ukraine," Trump said in a May 24 exchange with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.
"I hope he looks at everything, because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country. It's the greatest hoax in the history of our country, and somebody has to get to the bottom of it. "
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley characterized Trump's outreach on Barr's behalf a legitimate effort to assist the inquiry into the Mueller investigation.
“I’m old enough to remember when Democrats actually wanted to find out what happened in the 2016 election," Gidley said. "The Democrats clearly don't want the truth to come out anymore as it might hurt them politically, but this call relates to a DOJ inquiry publicly announced months ago to uncover exactly what happened. The DOJ simply requested that the resident provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that's all. "
But Mary McCord, former acting assistant attorney general for Justice's National Security Division, said there are other existing means of seeking introductions to foreign counterparts, including through law enforcement, intelligence and diplomatic channels.
"As the attorney general of the United States, he almost certainly would have his calls returned even without an introduction," McCord said. "I am not surprised that the attorney general is involved in the Durham investigation, as he is the one who directed Durham to conduct the investigation and Durham reports to him. It is more concerning if the president is involved, given his attacks on the FBI and others involved in the Russia investigation, and the potential for him to benefit politically from the investigation.

Texto completo: The monster apocalypse has arrived, and it’s up to middle-schoolers to fend for themselves.
Max Brallier’s “Last Kids on Earth” series — billed as “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” meets “The Walking Dead” — follows the sometimes perilous, always funny adventures of 13-year-old Jack and his best friends as they tussle with monsters, zombies and puberty.
“What got me so excited was to take a Godzilla-like creature and put it in a suburban town and let the kids do all the things that the adults usually do,” Brallier says of his initial inspiration for the
series. He’ll be in Austin on Tuesday at BookPeople as part of his tour for the newest installment, “The Last Kids on Earth and the Midnight Blade” (Viking/Penguin, $13.99).
And the zombies?
“There’s something about them. It’s your next-door neighbor, or a celebrity, but this alternate weird creepy scary version of them. You could see anybody as a zombie,” Brallier says. “I’ve had a lot of fun in the ‘Last Kid’ series doing the giant monsters as the big scary bad guy and using zombies partially for laughs.”
The series melds text and heavy illustration in a format familiar to anyone who knows “Wimpy Kid” or “Dork Diaries.” Using that format intrigued Brallier, who liked the ability to use illustrations as visual punch lines. He worried, though, whether it would work with the story he wanted to tell.
“One of the most intimidating parts of this was that I couldn’t tell if it would work as a format for high-stakes adventure,” Brallier recalls. “I thought maybe the only reason it worked was with settings that were instantly recognizable, where you would see a school hallway with lockers and know exactly what it was. Could you do that in sort of a wasteland world?
“So I got really lucky when (illustrator) Douglas Holgate was assigned. He took it and he added something that was so much more than I was expecting. I love the format. I love the way it selfishly, for me as a writer, allows me to step back and not have to describe everything. Instead of giving all the details about this big epic landscape, I can just say, ‘Please, show me some of this,’ and Douglas steps in and it looks amazing.”
Readers agree. What started as a single book now numbers five volumes and a companion “survival guide.” The books have topped the New York Times and USA Today bestseller lists. The series launch was on the 2017-18 Texas Bluebonnet List. And “Last Kids” has inspired a Netflix animated series that began streaming this month. It’s anchored by a 66-minute special co-written by Brallier and “Phineas and Ferb” alum Scott Peterson that hews to the first book and will include subsequent shorter episodes written by a team with Brallier’s input.
“When I’m writing, it’s definitely a job — I’m not sitting around waiting for inspiration to strike and lighting a candle and having tea. I get up and get my job done so I can spend time with my family,” Brallier quips. “This was the least like a job I think I’ve ever felt. For hours to sit with these people and watch them use their imagination to one-up each other in the most wonderful way, with these characters I’d created — it was very, very eye-opening.”

UNDERSTANDING THE IMPEACHMENT CHARADE DEMOCRATS' OBSESSION WITH DESTROYING TRUMP WILL DESTROY THEIR PARTY

Texto completo: Washington scandals are moving at a record pace. It was little more than a week ago that The New York Times launched its unfair hit piece on Brett Kavanaugh. This is the Trump-era news cycle. Scandals that used to go on for months now seem to end in hours. Nothing illustrates this better than the bizarre Ukraine story we're all living through. A week ago, no one had even heard of it. Then we were on the brink of impeachment because of it, and now it seems it may be over already.
The same angry news anchors who brought you Stormy Daniels and the Russia hoax now want you to know Big Orange's days in the White House are over. Why? Because Donald Trump, they say, threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Ukraine did something bad to Joe Biden and his family. Supposedly, Mr. Trump was finished.
Once again, the mob turned out to be wrong. The administration released a transcript of the president's phone call with the Ukrainian head of state, and it says none of the things the news anchors claimed it would. Read it for yourself. It's online. Try to find the extortion in there. There isn't any. Mr. Trump never even mentions military aid. There's certainly something unseemly about a president asking a foreign government to investigate an American citizen, but it's not illegal, and it's not all that different from three Democratic senators' writing a letter to Ukraine just last year demanding investigations into Mr. Trump.
Now that the call turns out to be nothing like what the media told us it would be, some on the left have started a conspiracy theory that the transcript can't be real; it must be doctored. These conspiracies aren't confined to weird corners of the internet. Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff have already questioned the trustworthiness of the transcript, despite the fact that there's no evidence of wrongdoing. Numerous career national security officials - many not fans of our president - have access to the original call and would have to be in on any conspiracy.
What's driving all this insanity? Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, has been more honest about it than most. Mr. Green admitted it straight up: "I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected."
Lots of Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jerry Nadler, stood up when Bill Clinton was impeached to give impassioned speeches about the perils of taking away the American people's choice.
Sadly, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Nadler were right in 1998. Republicans should not have impeached Mr. Clinton, and they paid the price. Democrats today hate Mr. Trump. It's not about justice or truth. What they care about is winning the 2020 presidential election. Democratic leaders have decided that impeaching Mr. Trump is essential if they're going to win next year. So they're staking everything on this bizarre, flimsy scandal that the rest of us can barelyunderstand.
Personal attacks on Mr. Trump have proven ineffective. If calling him a racist or a traitor actually worked, Hillary Clinton would be running for her re-election right about now. That's not going to work. If you want to beat Mr. Trump, make a case on the issues. He won on the issues. So make a countercase. But the geniuses can't figure that out.
In the end, the loser in this impeachment nonsense is likely to be Mr. Biden, who, you will recall, is the apparent front-runner. He's supposed to be the safe choice, the guy who's going to re-energize the Obama coalition and win back the White House. Yet Democrats have now in effect demanded that we spend the next six months talking about Mr. Biden and his son's alleged corruption. That's what's at the core of this Ukraine story.
The issues aren't really complicated. Why in the world would a Ukrainian company pay Hunter Biden $50,000 a month? We still haven't heard an answer. If we're talking about Ukraine and impeachment, we're talking about Mr. Biden's alleged corruption. That can't help his campaign for president. In fact, it's likely to tank it. It looks like sabotage, really. They must have gamed this up. Or maybe Democrats have just become so obsessed with destroying Mr. Trump that they're accidentally destroying themselves.

Yeti sightings were anything but rare this weekend -- if a fluffy, digital version of that creature counts.
Universal's "Abominable," an animated family movie that revolves around a young abominable snow-thing, opened to a solid $ 20.9 million in domestic ticket sales this weekend. It comfortably outperformed every other movie in theaters.
A creation of DreamWorks Animation and China's Pearl Studio, "Abominable" tells the story of Yi (Chloe Bennet), a tween who discovers a yeti living on the roof of her family's Shanghai apartment building. The plot involves Yi's attempts to return the yeti to its home, with the help of her friends Jin (Tenzing Trainor) and Peng (Albert Tsai). They have to work against both a zoologist (Sarah Paulson) and Burnish (Eddie Izzard), a villain with deep pockets and a taste for exotic creatures.
"Abominable," a rare big-studio animated movie with Chinese characters voiced mainly by Asian-Americans, does not have a long roster of celebrity vocal talent to help sell tickets. That makes its solid sales more impressive. Reviews were generally favorable; it currently holds an 80 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In his review for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny called the movie "exceptionally watchable and amiable."

In second place at the box office was "Downton Abbey," which saw around $ 14.5 million in domestic ticket sales. The movie, distributed by Focus Features, is an adaptation of the hit TV show. This was its second weekend in theaters, and came on the heels of a surprisingly strong opening.
Third place went to "Hustlers," a strip-club drama distributed by STX Films that saw around $ 11.5 million in ticket sales this weekend according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. It was the movie's third weekend in theaters.
Rounding out the top five: "It Chapter Two," from Warner Bros.; and 20th Century Fox's "Ad Astra." This was the fourth weekend for "It Chapter Two," which saw around $ 10.4 million in sales. "Ad Astra," a sci-fi movie with Brad Pitt as a brooding astronaut, sold roughly $ 10.1 million in tickets during what was its second weekend in theaters.

Texto completo: This is how Republicans can redeem themselves.
It is the clarity of Donald Trump's transgression that is most remarkable.
By his own admission, and backed up by the quasi-transcript released by the White House and by the whistle-blower complaint, he abused the power of the presidency to enlist a foreign government to help him politically.
People don't have to wade through the tome that Robert Mueller produced, through the murky parts and the fine legal points. This is as clear as a bell. Trump has confessed to the central allegation.
No matter how much his defenders squirm -- and they certainly are squirming -- to justify or diminish that fact, it is nevertheless a fact. He did it.
Now, they can squabble over whether or not this thing is impeachable, a process over which the founders fretted. That's Congress's job. But, the brazen betrayal of his office, the Constitution and the American people is undeniable.
The man developed a kind of Superman syndrome, in which the more crises he survived, the more he came to believe that he was invincible.
He could get caught on tape boasting about sexually assaulting women, and he would survive. He could desperately want Russian help in his election, and obstruct the investigation into that entanglement, and he would survive. He could cozy up to dictators, and he would survive. He could lock children in cages, and he would survive. He could be an open white supremacist, and he would survive. He could lie incessantly, and he would survive.
It must have been an awesome feeling, to float above the rules made for the commoners, to be unbound by trust, virtue, morality and responsibility. But that positioning in the world was unsustainable. Eventually, the bill comes due, and it must be paid.
Trump's bill has come due. Impeachment is in the offing. The Democrats must impeach this malignant fraudster. They don't really have a choice. There is no off-ramp for them from this course, and neither should there be.
Now, the decision falls to the Republicans in Congress, in the House but particularly in the Senate: On which side of patriotism will history record them? Will they stand for the Constitution and the rule of law or will they stand for partisanship and political expediency?
I will not hold my breath for mass defections from Trump. He has a stranglehold on the Republican Party. And, Republicans in Washington have not only been absolute cowards about standing up to Trump and holding him accountable, some have been completely unseemly in their obsequious kowtowing. I'm looking at you, Lindsey Graham.
But, I refuse to believe that the totality of the Republican Party system is corrupt beyond the possibility of contrition, that every single Republican senator would turn their backs on the country. Call me naïve. Or, call me hopeful for the future of the country.
There must be some patriots, at least a handful, in the Republican Party. There must be some who have the courage -- the guts! -- to stand up for righteousness, to not look like hacks and hypocrites in the annals of history.
There must be, right?
Or, will they all go down with Trump as flaming sycophants? I'm sure many will. Most may. But, some surely won't.
The truth is that many will likely allow the polls to dictate their decision on impeachment. Their ethics are transactional. They'll go whichever way the wind is blowing at the time, they'll follow the easiest path for themselves to maintain power and position.
Others, though, will need to develop a language of penance and conciliation, a way of explaining to the world how they followed in lock step behind Trump and his corruption until that was no longer tenable. It was craven. It was immoral. It was unpatriotic.
But, if these people emerge, they will likely be a lonely few. History teaches us that most Republicans are likely to rally around Trump rather than fall away from him. As Nicole Hemmer wrote on Vox in 2017:
"Until the very end, Watergate gave Nixon a stature on the right that he had previously lacked. And even after Nixon's resignation, the right never quite accepted the liberal narrative" of Watergate "as a heroic moment for investigative journalism and a cleansing moment for American politics."
For many, this is simply read as a witch hunt, sour grapes, an attempt to annul an election. From it they will take bitterness. Trump will be the victim and Democrats will be the abusers. That is just the way politics play out on issues like this.
The Senate has never voted to convict and remove a president, and that precedent is likely to stand. It's not even clear that Mitch McConnell would hold a trial if the House votes to impeach. But, the exercise itself will reveal the true character of the people in Washington, even more than has been revealed already.
The impeachment of Donald Trump offers an opportunity for redemption for Republicans. The only question is how many will seize it.

Probe the Effort to Sink Kavanaugh; Leland Keyser tells a new book's authors she felt pressured to testify falsely.

Texto completo: The effort to sink Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation cries out for investigation. The Senate Judiciary Committee has already made a criminal referral to the Justice Department regarding alleged material misstatements by lawyer Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick. And a new book by two New York Times reporters contains a potentially explosive revelation.
In "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly report that Leland Keyser—who was unable to corroborate high-school friend Christine Blasey Ford's allegation of youthful sexual misconduct—says she felt pressured by a group of common acquaintances to vouch for it anyway. The book quotes an unnamed male member of the group suggesting in a text message: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is"—a remark the reporters describe as reading "like a veiled reference" to Ms. Keyser's "addictive tendencies." (The authors quote her as saying she told investigators "my whole history of using.")
A concerted effort to mislead the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Senate, especially if it involved threats to potential witnesses, could violate several federal criminal statutes, including 18 U.S.C. 1001 (lying to federal officials), 18 U.S.C. 1505 (obstruction of official proceedings) and 18 U.S.C. 1622 (subornation of perjury). Investigating and, if the evidence is sufficient, prosecuting such offenses would deter similar misconduct in the future.
It's bad for the country when nominees are subjected to what Bill Clinton calls "the politics of personal destruction." It intensifies political polarization and bitterness, traduces due process, dissuades good people from government service, and injures the reputation of the judiciary and other institutions.
The Senate and FBI could also consider changing the background-check process for nominees. Justice Kavanaugh's opponents seem to have expected a full-fledged criminal-style inquiry into Ms. Ford's allegations, although Senate Democrats had sat on them for months. But that's not how background investigations work. They're carried out by a special unit whose job is to verify information the nominee has provided and gather additional information that may reflect on his character and reputation. This process does not involve the same sort of searching questions that are characteristic of a criminal investigation. Nor do FBI background investigators routinely assess individual witness credibility. They reach no conclusions but collect information and then forward it to the White House and Senate. It is then up to the elected officials to decide who and what to believe. It is a political, not a criminal, process.
This is a matter of practice and tradition, not law. The FBI could be asked to conduct background investigations in a manner more comparable to its criminal and intelligence work, where agents will assess witness credibility and use those assessments to guide the focus and course of the inquiry. It should be especially vigilant to the possibilities of collusion and witness tampering, which are uniquely troubling in high profile confirmation battles.
Messrs. Rivkin and Casey practice appellate and constitutional law in Washington. They served in the White House Counsel's Office and Justice Department under Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

Receiving an incomplete education? As some states ban teaching climate change, SPS gives leeway to address it

Texto completo: During last week's climate strike in downtown Spokane, students weren't shy about sharing what they've learned about climate change.
Kids as young as 15 cited statistics and historical trends on everything from increasing carbon dioxide emissions to the extinction of of animal species.
They knew their stuff. But in most cases, they didn't learn it in class.
"That's part of the problem," said Lily Ashdown, a student at Lakeside High School in Nine Mile Falls. "We're not learning much about this in school."
That's true in Spokane and the rest of the nation. According to a recent poll by National Public Radio, more than 80% of parents in the U.S. support the teaching of climate change.
That support is bipartisan; nine in 10 Democrats and two-thirds of Republicans agree the subject needs to be taught.
Teachers are even more supportive, with 86% believing that the next generation needs a better academic background in what could be its most important issue.
And yet, the climate protests highlighted an ongoing disconnect: While most states and many school districts have classroom standards that at least mention human-caused climate change, many teachers aren't dealing with the subject.
Several students at the climate protest said the subject wasn't taught in class.
Cerissa Moeller, a senior at Mead, said teachers "don't discuss it at all."
Ainsley Johnson, a senior at Cheney High School, said climate change science also isn't taught extensively there.
"My science teacher discussed it one time, that was it," she said.
"Maybe it's an avoided issue," said Seth Bachman, a sophomore at Lewis and Clark who said he gets much of his information from the New York Times.
Another LC sophomore, Cesca Konshuk-Mas, believes that "it's an important issue that everyone seems to be dodging."
Well, not everyone.
LC history teacher Carolyn Petek has made climate change study a part of current-events discussion.
"I welcome that because it's my philosophy of teaching," said Petek, who for more than four decades has viewed social studies and history as the proper context for current events - no matter how political they may be.
As a high school student in California in the late 1970s, Petek brought up the still-simmering subject of Watergate. Her teacher replied that the subject was off-limits.
"Social studies is meant to inform students and help them become participants in our political system and make their own decisions," said Petek, who works hard to present climate change as an exercise in identifying key facts.
That means examining what President Donald Trump said on the subject, as well as comments from former President Barack Obama.
"You need to look at the reasons Trump believes what he does," Petek said. "That's a skill: to be able to look at an issue and ask what are the key facts connected to this side and the other side."
"Sure it's controversial, but life is controversial," Petek said.
However, Petek is in the minority. Most teachers say they don't have the time, while nearly two-thirds of teachers in the NPR study said it's outside their subject area.
Then there's the political background. National surveys and anecdotal evidence suggest that some students have told their teachers that their parents don't feel it should be taught.
The subject also faces mainstream opposition. This year alone, several states have introduced bills and resolutions that would restrict the teaching of climate change.
In Connecticut, a recent bill would have cut climate change materials from the state's standards. An Iowa bill would have directly repealed the state's use of Next Generation Science Standards.
Legislation in Arizona, Maine, South Dakota and Virginia would have prohibited the teaching of any issue included in a state political party platform, on the grounds of anti-indoctrination.
In Spokane Public Schools, the situation is different: climate change is addressed in a high school ecology-environment section that touches on human impacts and the carbon cycle.
High school teachers also have the option to discuss climate change in certain chemistry, physics and environmental science classes. District middle school teachers have the option to cover climate change in sixth-grade earth and space science, seventh-grade ecology and eighth-grade physics and chemistry.

G.O.P. Lawmaker Clarifies Comments on Complaint From the Whistle-Blower

Texto completo: The lawmaker on Saturday parsed his words about supporting congressional oversight of a whistle-blower's complaint against President Trump.
A Republican member of the House of Representatives spent Saturday clarifying his support for congressional oversight of a whistle-blower's complaint against President Trump, which the lawmaker's office contended was not the same as endorsing the impeachment inquiry being led by Democrats.
The congressman, Mark Amodei, rejected the distinction that he was the first Republican House member to support the inquiry, with his spokeswoman, Logan Tucker, saying that the word "inquiry" gave the wrong impression that the congressman supported Mr. Trump's impeachment.
That could be problematic for Mr. Amodei, who is chairman of Mr. Trump's re-election campaign in Nevada, a state the president lost by about 27,000 votes to Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Mr. Amodei spoke with Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, on Friday to clarify comments he had made earlier in the day during a conference call with reporters from his home state, Ms. Tucker said.
He also spoke to Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the House minority leader, and to Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, according to Ms. Tucker, who said the word "inquiry" had been hijacked.
"It now means if you use the word 'inquiry' you support impeachment of the president," Ms. Tucker said.
Mr. Amodei said on Friday that it made sense for Congress to investigate a whistle-blower's complaint that Mr. Trump used a July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president to advance his personal interests, including asking him to look into unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his younger son.
The congressman, a former federal prosecutor, said that he was a big fan of oversight and that Congress should let the chips fall where they might.
"Please, nobody hang up the phone and say, 'Amodei is Pelosi's defender,"' he said on the conference call.
Ms. Tucker said that while Mr. Amodei was on the same page as House Republican leaders and the White House, "misinformed conservatives," such as Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host, had twisted his words.
"You can quote him on that," Ms. Tucker said of Mr. Amodei, 61, who is from Carson City and was first elected in 2011.
A majority of House members now support the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, according to a New York Times survey and public statements. All are Democrats but one. On Tuesday, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the House speaker, announced that the House would begin such an inquiry.
Justin Amash, independent of Michigan and a former Republican, had publicly favored impeachment even before the whistle-blower's complaint.
Mr. Amodei discussed the impeachment inquiry process during a conference call on Friday with reporters and in a follow-up statement issued by his office.
The follow-up statement affirmed the accuracy of an article by The Nevada Independent that Mr. Amodei had supported the House's inquiry into whether Mr. Trump should be impeached.

Texto completo: BY ZEKE MILLER, ERIC TUCKER and MICHAEL BALSAMO
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Sparring line by line over a whistleblower's complaint, the White House on Friday confirmed a key detail from the unidentified CIA officer who has accused President Donald Trump of abusing the power of his office. At the same time, Trump insisted anew that his actions and words have been "perfect" and the complaint might well be the work of "a partisan operative."
The White House acknowledged that a record of the Trump phone call that is now at the center of the House impeachment inquiry had been sealed away in a highly classified system at the direction of Trump's National Security Council lawyers.
Separately, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters that the whistleblower "has protection under the law," something Trump himself had appeared to question earlier in the day. He suggested then that his accuser "isn't a whistleblower at all."
Still at issue is why the rough transcript of Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president was put on "lock down," in the words of the whistleblower. The CIA officer said that diverting the record in an unusual way was evidence that "White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired" in the conversation.
The complaint alleges that Trump used his office to "solicit interference from a foreign country" to help himself in next year's U.S. election. In the phone call, days after ordering a freeze to some military assistance for Ukraine, Trump asked new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to dig for potentially damaging material on Democratic rival Joe Biden and volunteered the assistance of both his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
As for the Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday framed the impeachment inquiry as a somber moment for a divided nation.
"This is no cause for any joy," Pelosi said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," and she said she was praying for the president.
"I would say to Democrats and Republicans: We have to put country before party."
Pelosi refused to set a deadline for the probe but promised to act "expeditiously."
The House intelligence committee could draw members back to Washington next week. The panel with other committees jointly issued a subpoena on Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents in the Ukraine matter.
At the White House, it was a senior administration official who acknowledged that the rough transcript of Trump's conversation with Ukraine's Zelenskiy had been moved to a highly classified system maintained by the National Security Council. The official was granted anonymity Friday to discuss sensitive matters.
White House attorneys had been made aware of concerns about Trump's comments on the call even before the whistleblower sent his allegations to the intelligence community's inspector general. Those allegations, made in mid-August, were released Thursday under heavy pressure from House Democrats.
All the while, Trump was keeping up his full-bore attack on the whistleblower and the unnamed "White House officials" cited in the complaint, drawing a warning from Pelosi against retaliation.
Late Thursday, Trump denounced people who might have talked to the whistleblower as "close to a spy" and suggested they engaged in treason, an act punishable by death. Then on Friday, he said the person was "sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn't a Whistleblower at all."
He also alleged without evidence that information in the complaint has been "proved to be so inaccurate," though none of the allegations have been demonstrated to be incorrect.
Pelosi told MSNBC, "I'm concerned about some of the president's comments about the whistleblower."
She said the House panels conducting the impeachment probe will make sure there's no retaliation against people who provided information in the case. On Thursday, House Democratic chairmen called Trump's comments "witness intimidation" and suggested efforts by him to interfere with the potential witness could be unlawful.
Trump's Friday comment questioning the whistleblower's status seemed to foreshadow a possible effort to argue that legal protection laws don't apply to the person, opening a new front in the president's defense, but Conway's statement seemed to make that less likely.
The intelligence community's inspector general found the whistleblower's complaint "credible" despite finding indications of the person's support for a different political candidate.
Legal experts said that by following proper procedures and filing a complaint with the government rather than disclosing the information to the media, the person is without question regarded as a whistleblower entitled to protections against being fired or criminally prosecuted.
"This person clearly followed the exact path he was supposed to follow," said Debra D'Agostino, a lawyer who represents whistleblowers. "There is no basis for not calling this person a whistleblower."
Lawyers say it also doesn't matter for the purposes of being treated as a whistleblower if all of the allegations are borne out as entirely true, or even if political motives or partisanship did factor into the decision to come forward.
"What a whistleblower needs to have is a reasonable belief that the information they're disclosing and complaining about could be a violation of a law, rule or regulation," said Eric Bachman, another Washington lawyer who represents whistleblowers. "They do not need to be certain that there is a violation. It does not need to be proven in a court of law that there is a violation."
Republicans were straining under the uncertainty of being swept up in the most serious test yet of their alliance with the Trump White House.
"We owe people to take it seriously," said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a onetime Trump rival who is now a member of the intelligence committee.
"Right now, I have more questions than answers," he said. "The complaint raises serious allegations, and we need to determine whether they're credible or not."
Fresh questions were raised late Thursday about how the White House and the Justice Department handled the whistleblower complaint.
White House and Justice Department attorneys were aware of the concerns about Trump's call with Zelenskiy before the complaint was filed, according to a U.S. official and a person familiar with the matter. The intelligence official initially filed a complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine with the CIA, which then alerted the White House and the Justice Department, before filing with the intelligence community's inspector general, a process that granted the individual more legal protection.
The person familiar with the matter, as well as another person with knowledge of the case, confirmed that the whistleblower was a CIA officer.
The Associated Press is publishing information about the whistleblower's background because the person's credibility is central to the impeachment inquiry into the president. The New York Times first reported that the individual was a CIA officer.
The U.S. official and the two people familiar with the matter spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, said publishing details about the individual places the person in a dangerous situation, personally and professionally. The CIA referred questions to the inspector general.

Trump Report Card: Zogby says Trump’s no Nixon, removal impossible with good approvals

Texto completo: This week’s White House Report Card finds President Trump closer to facing House impeachment hearings, a nightmare for West Wing war room staffers and a dream for Democrats who have sought his removal since before his inauguration.
Pollster John Zogby said that while the latest affair, Trump’s phone request to Ukraine’s president for a “favor” involving former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter, puts him on a path to impeachment, there is “no way” the Senate convicts.
Like with former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment, Zogby said that the Senate won’t remove a president with a growing approval rating like Trump’s. He’s not former President Richard Nixon, who at 23% approval, stepped down.
Tweet
And conservative grader Jed Babbin dismissed the impeachment drive as a lot about nothing. “This is going to be a Seinfeld impeachment. Remember the running joke in Seinfeld that the sitcom was about nothing?” he said.
John Zogby
Grade D-
There is no way to spin this week for President Trump. Yes, his polling numbers are actually up in most polls — some of his highest approval ratings and averages yet.
But he painted his way into an impeachment corner, and there appears to be real evidence, real witnesses, and a White House staff who must be vomiting around the clock. He went to the United Nations to give a speech about foreign policy. No one listened, no one cared, no one will remember.
Tweet
But everyone will remember that he is now close to being impeached. This will have to play out. The House of Representatives will probably present articles of impeachment in October (one month) so as not to drag this out.
But no way does Trump get convicted in the Senate. Not unless his polling numbers plummet. So again each side gets to make its point, not policy. Remember Nixon was at 23% when he left office in the face of certain impeachment. Hard to remove a president who is polling at 46%. The GOP tried that once with Bill Clinton, remember? Can Trump handle this pressure?"
Jed Babbin
Grade B
You’d never know it if you read the Washington Post or the New York Times, but this week was actually a pretty good one for President Trump.
Trump’s “Howdy, Modi” rally in Houston with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped boost relations with the world’s largest democracy. The two leaders spoke before a crowd of about 50,000, many or most of whom are Indian Americans. Modi spoke witheringly about Pakistan, which both America and India accuse of sponsoring and harboring a variety of terrorist networks.
Trump also gave a good speech at the United Nations General Assembly and led a meeting on religious freedom there.
Tweet
All of that faded into obscurity in the aftermath of last week’s “whistleblower” complaint about Trump’s 25 July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Congressional Democrats and other Trump haters in the media seized upon it as proof that Trump was trying to get help from a foreign government to steal the 2020 election. After days of haranguing, both a rough transcript of the call and the whistleblower complaint were declassified and unveiled. Both were devoid of illegal or impeachable conduct by Trump (there’s a treaty requiring legal cooperation in investigations and such between the U.S. and Ukraine) but more than enough for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to begin a formal impeachment inquiry. But into what?
This is going to be a Seinfeld impeachment. Remember the running joke in Seinfeld that the sitcom was about nothing? That’s what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi are running. Trump will be impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate because there’s no basis on which to convict him in either the phone call with Zelensky or the whistleblower complaint. Meanwhile, he’ll be diverted from very important domestic and international matters by the impeachment proceedings. The impeachment mess will be the focus of every media outlet and Democratic presidential candidate all next year. Not that it’ll do them any good.

Excompañeros del abogado de Trump, Rudy Giuliani, creen que cometió crímenes por trama ucraniana

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani, el abogado personal de Donald Trump, es una de las personas que acabaron en el centro de una gran tormenta política que involucra actualmente al presidente de Estados Unidos. Un viaje que el letrado hizo a España este verano podría representar uno de sus encargos recientes que más dolores de cabeza podría costarle.
El nuevo escándalo que embistió a Trump estalló después de que un informante anónimo denunciara en una queja dirigida al Congreso que el presidente intentó presionar a su homólogo de Ucrania para que este lo ayudara con un plan para investigar a Joe Biden , político demócrata y actualmente destacado rival político. Giuliani, quien fue alcalde de Nueva York entre 1994 y 2001, tuvo un papel clave en esta maniobra política, según el denunciante.
Mientras que la Cámara de Representantes la mayoría demócrata abrió una investigación de juicio político contra el mandatario para averiguar si abusó de su poder, seis abogados que trabajaron con Giuliani en el Departamento de Justicia, donde el actual abogado personal del presidente cubrió distintos cargos, aseguraron a NBC News que creen que el letrado, una de las personas más cercanas a Trump, cometió crímenes en esas circunstancias.
En su viaje de finales de julio a la capital del país ibérico, Giuliani se reunió con un asesor de Volodymyr Zelenskiy, el presidente ucraniano, según el informante. El encuentro se produjo un día después de que Trump llamara a su homólogo para pedirle que investigara a Biden y su hijo Hunter, involucrado en negocios en el país eslavo, por posibles actos de corrupción. Y la misión servía supuestamente para afianzar ese plan.
“Ciertamente, este no es el Giuliani que conozco”, afirmó a NBC Jeffrey Harris, quien trabajó como asistente principal de Giuliani cuando estaba en el Departamento de Justicia durante la administración del presidente Ronald Reagan. “Creo que el Giuliani que conozco pondría bajo juicio al Giuliani de hoy”.
El excompañero del abogado de Trump , que ahora ejerce la profesión privadamente, agregó que el Gobierno de EEUU tiene “todo un aparato” que está configurado para tratar con funcionarios extranjeros. “Y Rudy Giuliani no es uno de ellos”, dijo.
La queja del informante anónimo asegura que el abogado también tuvo otros contactos con oficiales ucranianos. “Si esto se considerara como uso de recursos del Gobierno para beneficio propio, esta conducta estaría asociada a una serie de delitos.”.
NBC contactó en total a siete ex colegas de Giuliani. Uno no contestó, pero todos los demás coincidieron en no defender su conducta. E indicaron una serie de delitos que podría haber cometido, desde la violación de leyes electorales federales hasta el soborno y la extorsión.
Bruce Fein, quien trabajó en el Departamento de Justicia con Giuliani a principios de la década de 1980, dijo que cree que Giuliani podría ser procesado por violar las leyes federales de elecciones si se demuestra que intentó influir en la campaña de las presidenciales de 2020, en las que Biden quiere postularse como adversario a Trump.
“Las leyes electorales federales hacen que sea ilegal solicitar algo de valor de un Gobierno o ciudadanos extranjeros para influir en el resultado de una elección”, sostuvo. Fein dijo que Giuliani también podría exponerse a cargos por soborno ya que Trump supuestamente retuvo fondos militares para presionar a Ucrania. “Si Giuliani estuviera al tanto de eso, podría ser cómplice de Trump al conspirar para solicitar un soborno”, dijo.
Daniel Richman, quien trabajó con Giuliani en la Oficina del Fiscal de los Estados Unidos en Manhattan a fines de la década de 1980, dijo que necesitaba ver más evidencia antes de tomar una determinación concluyente. Pero estuvo de acuerdo en que un esfuerzo por ayudar en un complot para retener fondos de una potencia extranjera a cambio de un favor personal o político podría exponer al abogado de Trump a cargos criminales que podrían ir del fraude a la extorsión.
Otros ex fiscales que trabajaron con Giuliani plantearon la cuestión de que aparentemente influyó en la política exterior estadounidense, lo que podría suponer violación de la antigua Ley Logan, aprobada en 1799, que prohíbe a los ciudadanos privados negociar con un gobierno extranjero en nombre de los EEUU.
GIULIANI NIEGA
Giuliani calificó estas opiniones de “tonterías”. “No saben de qué están hablando. ¿Qué crímenes?”. También dijo que no pudo haber sobornado a nadie porque no ofreció nada de valor a los ucranianos. “¿Son estos tipos abogados o son imbéciles?”, preguntó en referencia a sus excompañeros, antes de negar que haya ejercido algún tipo de influencia en las elecciones.
El exfiscal federal John Flannery, que trabajó con él a mediados de la década de los setenta, dijo que estaba desconcertado por lo que describió como un flagrante abuso de la ley por su parte.
“Se ha puesto en una posición de ayudar e incitar, y tal vez dar comienzo, a un intercambio de favores con un gobierno extranjero para una campaña política estadounidense a instancias del propio candidato”, dijo Flannery. “Ninguno de los dos lo niega, y de hecho lo están profusamente, repetidamente y dolorosamente admitiendo”.
Flannery dijo que el Giuliani de hoy no se parece en nada al hombre con el que trabajó hace unos 40 años. “Es una sombra del que fue el mejor Rudy, y no el gran abogado que pensé que sería”.
La llamada de Trump a su homólogo ucraniano fue descalificada esta semana, y su contenido difundido en un resumen. También se difundió públicamente la queja del denunciante. Fuentes de la Casa Blanca aseguraron a algunos medios (CNN, The New York Times, The Associated Press) que la administración restringió la accesibilidad al contenido de las conversaciones entre Trump y los líderes de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, y la familia real de Arabia Saudí .

Texto completo: Locast, a little-known nonprofit behind a free streaming service, sued ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox on Friday, alleging that the television networks colluded in an effort to chill its business.
Locast streams network shows and sports programs through a free app that relays broadcast feeds online. People can get the streams without a cable or satellite plan, potentially cutting off licensing fees to the broadcasters. (More traditionally, viewers can also receive broadcast signals over the air, at no charge, with a digital antenna.)
In July, the networks banded together to sue Locast, arguing that it had violated their copyrights and chipped away at the revenue they get from pay-television operators like AT&T and Comcast. The networks are expected to receive more than $ 10 billion in such fees this year.
The broadcasters' lawsuit also named David Goodfriend, a former media executive and lawyer with stints in the Federal Communications Commission, who started Locast in January 2018.
Under federal law, broadcast stations must provide their signals free to the public, making network programming easily available through the use of an antenna. But broadcasters won a provision in copyright law in the 1990s that required pay-TV providers to negotiate what are known as retransmission-consent fees to carry those signals.
"We believe the broadcasters' lawsuit was brought without basis as part of a larger plan to unlawfully limit the public's right to access that free programming," David Hosp, a lawyer for Locast, said in a statement.
Locast argues that its service complies with copyright law because, as a nonprofit entity, it is allowed to act as a so-called signal booster for the broadcasters' programming.
The broadcasters disagree.
"We trust the courts to see right through this facade and recognize Locast for what it is -- not a public service organization but a creature of certain pay-TV interests with an entirely commercial agenda," said Gerson Zweifach, an attorney for the broadcasters, in a statement.

Locast's countersuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, is the legal response to the broadcasters. In addition to denying their allegations, the nonprofit, led by Mr. Goodfriend, put a twist on the proceedings, arguing that the big broadcasters have "colluded" as part of an effort to undermine and shut down Locast by "threatening business retaliation" against any potential partners.
The Locast complaint cites YouTubeTV as one example of a company that got cold feet. YouTubeTV, which is owned by Google, sells a streaming service that replicates a cheap cable bundle.
According to the complaint, Google executives alerted Locast in April that the networks had warned the tech company not to allow YouTubeTV to provide access to Locast. If it did, according to the complaint, Google would be "punished by the big four broadcasters."
The broadcasters -- working together -- could put pressure on Google (and other pay-TV operators) by refusing to sell rights to cable channels that are allied with the broadcast networks, the complaint suggests.
ABC and ESPN, for example, are both controlled by the Walt Disney Company. NBC and the USA cable channel are owned by NBCUniversal, while the broadcast station Fox and the cable network Fox News are controlled by the Murdoch family. CBS, which owns the Pop TV and Showtime cable networks, recently agreed to merge with Viacom, which owns MTV and Nickelodeon.
"This is classic copyright abuse," the lawsuit reads. The networks have "misused copyrights to expand their market power beyond what those copyrights were intended to protect."
The complaint also accuses the networks of failing to transmit their over-the-air signals with enough power, thereby "forcing consumers" to pay for cable or satellite service, or the broadcasters' own direct streaming services.
Locast sits mostly under the radar, but it has gained in popularity at a time when more consumers are watching television digitally. More than 700,000 users are signed up in 13 cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington.
The networks have argued that the service is designed to rob them of licensing fees, calling Locast a "rogue streaming service skirting the law for the benefit of telecom giants" in their complaint, which was also filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Tensions around programming costs have increased as more viewers cut the cord. On Thursday, over 2.5 million Dish subscribers were blacked out of Fox broadcasts after Fox and Dish couldn't agree on a contract renewal.
Although Locast relies on donations from viewers, it accepts money from corporations and recently received $ 500,000 from AT&T, which also operates the DirecTV satellite service. When a fee dispute blacked out CBS for more than 6.5 million AT&T television subscribers for a few weeks this summer, AT&T encouraged its users to try Locast.
The escalating legal fight is reminiscent of a courtroom showdown between the networks and Aereo, a start-up backed by the media tycoon Barry Diller. Aereo captured over-the-air TV signals and streamed them to subscribers for a monthly fee but did not pay the networks anything. Mr. Diller lost the legal challenge in 2014 when the Supreme Court ruled Aereo had violated copyright laws.
Mr. Goodfriend started Locast partly as a thought experiment on the Aereo case, which he taught in a law lecture at Georgetown University. He wanted to show how the ruling might affect the public interest.
"I had to teach them that more often than not, it's through huge stakeholders battling it out that change happens," Mr. Goodfriend told The New York Times in January. "There should be something that challenges the broadcasters."

Texto completo: UNITED NATIONS -- President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said Friday that President Trump had offered to meet with him at the United Nations this week and then lift all sanctions, but that Mr. Rouhani declined because the "optics" of such a meeting were unacceptable.
Mr. Rouhani's assertions, reported on his website as he returned home from the United Nations General Assembly, were quickly disputed by Mr. Trump on Twitter.
"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet," Mr. Trump said. "I said, of course, NO!"
The contradictory narratives added a new twist to the frantic diplomacy that America's allies at the United Nations engaged in while trying to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Rouhani, in an effort to halt spiraling tensions between the United States and Iran.
Mr. Trump has imposed onerous economic sanctions on Iran since he abandoned the 2015 nuclear agreement last year, calling it "a disaster" that would not deter Iran from making nuclear weapons.
Iran has responded by halting its compliance with some provisions of the agreement while insisting that it would return to compliance -- if the sanctions were lifted first and if the United States rejoined the agreement.
Tensions have been further roiled by American and Saudi Arabian accusations that Iran attacked oil facilities in Saudi Arabia on Sept. 14 -- accusations that Britain, France and Germany have now joined. The Iranians have denied responsibility for the attack and have warned that retaliation would invite war.
Mr. Rouhani told a news conference in New York on Thursday as he was about to leave for home that if the Trump administration first dropped all the sanctions, "then negotiations with the U.S. are a possibility."
On Friday, Mr. Rouhani said more about what he described as the diplomatic efforts to arrange a meeting with Mr. Trump and Iran's response.
"The Americans had sent a message through nearly all European leaders that they are ready to negotiate," Mr. Rouhani said, according to his website. "The U.S.'s request was for bilateral talks, meaning the two presidents negotiate with each other, and we had rejected this many times."
He said Iran was willing to negotiate with the United States as part of a meeting with the other members of the 2015 nuclear agreement -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.
"The German chancellor and the U.K. prime minister and France's president were all in New York and they were all insisting that this meeting happen and the U.S. saying it would lift all sanctions," Mr. Rouhani said.
He said they had discussed which sanctions would be lifted and in what order, and that "the U.S. government said very clearly that it would lift all sanctions."
But Mr. Rouhani said that "the optics of this were not the kind of optics that would be acceptable to us."
Such a meeting, he said, would mean that Iran would have been negotiating with the United States "in the atmosphere of maximum pressure and sanctions," which Mr. Rouhani has repeatedly said he would not do.
The spokesman for Iran's United Nations Mission, Alireza Miryousefi, elaborated on Mr. Rouhani's response in his own Twitter account, saying that the Iranian president had insisted that the United States would "first have to create the proper environment by removing the poisonous atmosphere of sanctions."
Political analysts who follow Iran said the posturing on both sides that followed the failed diplomacy suggested that Iran was still interested in talking.
"The major hangup was choreography and sequencing," said Ali Vaez, the Iran director for the International Crisis Group. "But the idea is not dead, and the main quid pro quo remains viable."
Mr. Rouhani's portrayal of his dealings at the United Nations also seemed partly aimed at countering the appearance of Iran's isolation this year at the international gathering, particularly over the attack on the Saudi oil facilities.
He challenged the leaders of Britain, France and Germany for evidence that Iran had been responsible for the attack.
"They did not have any answer," Mr. Rouhani said. "I said I'll be waiting in Tehran to receive your evidence."
Even as the Europeans were seeking to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Rouhani, the Trump administration was intensifying sanctions on Iran. On Wednesday, the State Department barred top Iranian officials from entering the United States and confined those visiting the United Nations to a tight radius of a few city blocks.
The visa restriction had an immediate impact on Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, who wanted to visit the country's United Nations ambassador, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, a patient at the Sloan Kettering Memorial Cancer Center a mile away. The State Department rejected the request.
"Foreign Minister Zarif would like to visit a colleague who is in the hospital receiving world-class care," the State Department said in a statement confirming the rejection of his request, which was first reported by Foreign Policy magazine.
"Iran has wrongfully detained several U.S. citizens for years, to the pain of their families and friends they cannot freely visit," the statement said. "We have relayed to the Iranian mission that the travel request will be granted if Iran releases a U.S. citizen."
In a positive development on Friday against otherwise tense relations with the West, a British-flagged oil tanker seized by Iran two months ago near the Persian Gulf was finally permitted to leave Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas, and it headed for Dubai. Iran had impounded the ship, the Stena Impero, in apparent retaliation for the British seizure of an Iranian tanker near Gibraltar that was later released.
Lara Jakes contributed reporting from Washington, and Michael Wolgelenter from London.

Trump’s corruption is obvious

Texto completo: With so many ludicrously conflicting conspiracy theories being spread by all sides in the Trump-Ukraine controversy, we should at least be able to agree that the Wall Street Journal news section is a generally neutral, careful, fair-minded source. It doesn’t have the conservative, increasingly Trump-apologist bent of the paper’s editorial page. It doesn’t have the crusading liberal reputation of the New York Times. The Journal is generally sober, reliable, and trustworthy.
Its lead story on Thursday was a model summary, shorn of right-wing excuse-mongering and left-wing bloodlust. Therein, in one concise sentence almost halfway through the article, one finds the nub of the scandal.
To wit: “There is no known precedent for a president to offer his private lawyer and the attorney general to assist a foreign country with an investigation into his own political rival.” Exactly. This was a terrible misuse of presidential power and the international prestige of the office. It served no legitimate policy aims, yet Trump engaged in it for his own political interests.
Meanwhile, Trump keeps showing a strange fixation on a wild theory that a cybersecurity firm known as Crowdstrike somehow fabricated evidence of a Russian hack of the computers of the Democratic National Committee. The Wall Street Journal news story, though, describes Trump’s fantasy, flat-out, as “a debunked conspiracy [theory].” It notes that Crowdstrike’s conclusions were “corroborated by U.S. intelligence and [special counsel Robert] Mueller.” As for Trump’s assertions that Crowdstrike is “Ukrainian-based,” the Journal says unequivocally that this claim “is false.”
Formerly rational conservatives seem to be having none of it. In private messages and in favored publications they have constructed a bizarre explanatory contraption, with pretzel-twisted logic, to the effect that the entire U.S. intelligence community, the entire FBI, the career-long-respected Mueller, and probably the whole diplomatic corps are a thoroughly corrupted, vast left-wing deep state. By these lights, if “U.S. intelligence” corroborates something, we should believe the exact opposite. This is nearly insane.
Reasonable conservatives and respected newsmen are finally making their voices heard. National Review’s Ramesh Ponnuru, friendly enough to some of Trump’s views that Trump seriously considered appointing him to the Federal Reserve Board, dispassionately analyzed the Ukraine case for Bloomberg and carefully picked apart the “flawed arguments in defense of Trump.” He wrote that it takes “willful naiveté” to deny that Trump was pushing a quid pro quo.
Conservative policy wonk Yuval Levin, one of the least histrionic and most thoughtful writers on the right, opines that “the president’s behavior seems plainly corrupt on its face,” but that “the incoherent jumble of Trump’s own mind, backed now with the enormous power of the American presidency, has the capacity to create a real world that doesn’t hang together.”
Conservative legal favorite Paul Rosenzweig, a Whitewater prosecutor under independent counsel Ken Starr in the 1990s, said: “It seems to me almost impossible not to think that this is a big problem for the president. Instead of being able to say ‘No collusion,’ he now has to say, ‘Yes collusion. Why does it matter?' If the Mueller investigation had revealed that President Trump had had personal conversation with (Russia President) Vladimir Putin and promised him something -- assistance in Syria in exchange for dirt about Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea -- everybody would’ve said that’s collusion, that’s conspiracy, that’s wrong. That’s exactly what happened here.”
And Fox News’ Chris Wallace, certainly no left-wing bomb thrower, said that the “spinning” being done by supporters of Trump is “astonishing” and “deeply misleading.”
Forget the spin. The Journal had it right. There is “no known precedent” — and absolutely no acceptable reason — for a president to sic a foreign government on his own political rival.

Texto completo: El presidente, Donald Trump, le dijo este jueves a un grupo de funcionarios que quiere saber quién suministró la información sobre su llamada al presidente de Ucrania, lo que provocó que la Cámara de Representantes haya iniciado un juicio político en su contra.
El presidente insinuó que les castigaría con la pena de muerte, según ha reportado el diario The New York Times, lo que sorprendió a algunos en la audiencia.
“Quiero saber quién es la persona que le dio la información al informante porque eso se acerca a un espía”, dijo Trump. “¿Sabes qué solíamos hacer en los viejos tiempos cuando éramos inteligentes con los espías y la traición, cierto? Solíamos manejarlo un poco diferente de lo que hacemos ahora”, agregó.
Asimsimo, Trump indicó que el informante no había escuchado la llamada en cuestión y que había obtenido detalles a través de los comentarios de varios oficiales.
El informante, que aún no ha sido identificado, lo reconoció aunque citó cuentas de la Casa Blanca relacionadas con “negocios interagenciales oficiales”, reportó Los Angeles Times.
El mandatario ha hecho las declaraciones en una reunión con representantes estadounidenses ante la Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU).
El mismo diario ha reportado que una persona presente en el evento le compartió una grabación de los comentarios del presidente.
Algunos asistentes rieron, como si se tratara de una broma.
Durante el evento al que no tuvo acceso la prensa, Trump se quejó varias veces del informante y criticó a los medios por haber reportado la denuncia, la cual describió como “deshonesta”.
Trump ha dicho también que la prensa es “escoria”.
La Comisión de Inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes ha hecho pública esta mañana la denuncia del informante.
El documento ha sido divulgado dos días después de que la presidenta la Cámara, la demócrata Nancy Pelosi, anunciara el inicio de una investigación de juicio político en contra de Trump debido a los hechos vinculados a la llamada entre él y el presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, el 25 de julio.
“El presidente de Estados Unidos está usando el poder de su cargo para solicitar interferencia de un país extranjero en las elecciones de Estados Unidos en 2020” , ha dicho el informante.
En la denuncia, con fecha del 12 de agosto, el informante indica: “en los últimos cuatro meses, más de media docena de funcionarios de Estados Unidos me han informado de varios hechos relaciones con este esfuerzo”.
El informante dice que el abogado personal de Trump, Rudolph Giuliani, es una “figura central” en las acciones y que el procurador general, William Bar, “parece estar involucrado también” en la trama.
“La interferencia incluye, entre otras cosas, presionar a un país extranjero para investigar los principales rivales internos del presidente ”, señala el reporte.
Luego del evento en las Naciones Unidas, Trump participó en un evento de campaña para recoger fondos, de donde salió diciendo que la llamada es la “cosa más grandiosa” que le ha pasado al Partido Republicano porque había recaudado mucho dinero luego de la polémica.
El portavoz de la Casa Blanca no ha respondido a una solicitud de comentarios sobre el tema, ha señalado el diario.
Sobre el documento del informante, Stephanie Grisham, directora de comunicaciones de la Casa Blanca, ha respondido diciendo que “no es más que una colección de relatos de eventos de terceros y recortes de prensa improvisados” .
La presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, olvidó en un avión el discurso con el que iba a anunciar el inicio de una investigación de juicio político en contra de Trump, ha informado la agencia de noticias Reuters.
Pelosi había pasado el fin de semana analizando las acusaciones en contra de Trump y empezó a redactar su discurso en un vuelo de Nueva York a Washington, pero lo dejo en un avión, ha dicho una persona familiarizada con el incidente
Sin embargo, no todo se perdió. “Al menos lo había organizado en su cabeza”, ha agregado la fuente.
Fue así como Pelosi reconstruyó el discurso de memoria, en el que dijo que las acciones de Trump ponían en peligro la seguridad nacional y violaban la Constitución.

What the Press Doesn't Know About Ukraine; Reporters will have to ask a lot more questions to understand the missing context of the Trump call.

Texto completo: We might not be here if the mainstream media, which loved the Steele Dossier when it seemed to incriminate Donald Trump, had later shown an equal interest in investigating its origins as a partisan fabrication.
In his now-famous transcript, Mr. Trump mainly presses Ukraine's new president for dirt not on the Bidens but on the known unknowns of 2016. "I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine," he says. "There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation."
This is the "favor" he actually seeks from Ukraine's president.
Yes, Mr. Trump's musings about the Democratic National Committee's server may be deluded, though it remains true that the FBI never directly examined the server. His next reference, however, begins "I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people." Here he may be referring to Ukrainian legislator Serhiy Leshchenko, who injected into the U.S. race a secret document on Paul Manafort's finances that later became a major factor in the Mueller investigation. Only intermittently have outlets like Politico and the Hill ever shown interest in the alleged pro-Clinton efforts of the previous Ukrainian government. Ukraine at the time was pell-mell becoming a U.S. client. Billions in civilian and military aid were starting to flow from the Obama administration. Vice President Joe Biden was dispatched to help clean up Ukraine's reputation and make it an acceptable partner.
This was the moment when Hunter Biden, with no relevant expertise, and last seen being booted from a short-lived career in the Navy Reserve because of a failed drug test, received a lucrative role with a Ukrainian company. Where might Mr. Trump have gotten the idea there was something fishy about this? From the U.S. media of course:
"Was Hunter Biden profiting off his dad's work as vice president and did Joe Biden allow it?" asked an ABC News "investigation" just weeks before Mr. Trump's call with the Ukrainian president. A lengthy account in the New Yorker quoted a 2017 divorce allegation that Hunter spent his considerable earnings on "drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations."
As recently as this week, the New York Times allowed only that there is "no evidence so far to support Mr. Trump's claim that Mr. Biden improperly intervened to help his son's business in Ukraine" (emphasis added).
And simply fraudulent are news reports insisting that Mr. Biden wasn't influenced by his son's presence on the Burisma board, because it's impossible to know. Mr. Biden, instead of insisting that Ukraine's chief prosecutor be fired, might have insisted he prove his bona fides by reopening his dormant Burisma investigation. We just can't know. This is why the mere "appearance" of a conflict of interest is rightly considered compromising to U.S. policy (as the vice president's own aides reportedly tried to warn him).
But all such questions now are illegitimate in a rush to paint Mr. Trump as impeachable. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough quotes the White House transcript until its words no longer suit him and then invents his own to portray Mr. Trump as asking for information to "smear an opponent."
The transcript says no such thing. Mr. Trump certainly has political motives, as all politicians do, but asking a foreign government what it knows about a story that fills the U.S. media (the New Yorker's extraordinarily detailed report had appeared that very month) simply may not be the unprecedented act that some assume. (They haven't seen transcripts of other presidents' calls.)
OK, you aren't shocked that much journalism is conducted not in a spirit of inquiry, but to realize the desired talking points. Everything in the Ukraine call is ignored that doesn't fit the reductionist trope of "inviting foreign interference" in a U.S. election. I get it. Journalism is a business. The "talent" is rewarded for bringing in the desired demographic. But if we really want to restore measured discourse, let's go back to being reliable arbiters of fact and reason, rather than producing home pages designed as clickbait for target audiences (the Washington Post is an especially ignominious showpiece in this regard).
More than anything, today's coverage dumbifies everything it touches in our interesting country, in our interesting time.
A final point: A consensus has formed that Joe Biden will be collateral damage in the Democrats' desired Ukraine-related impeachment spectacle, with some progressives seeing this as a feature and not a bug. Mr. Biden never struck me as presidential material but he might well be the best we can do in 2020. He doesn't think America wants a socialist revolution. He's old. He might decide he doesn't care about a second term. He'd be free to enter office with a mandate from himself to govern from the middle, to work with the GOP regardless of his party's Twitter shriekers.
That possibility, which might look pretty good a year from now, is likely disappearing fast in the media's latest half-cocked frenzy.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Justice Department officials learned about allegations of impropriety concerning President Trump's July conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart before the formal whistleblower complaint was passed along from the intelligence community, people familiar with the matter said.
The revelation sheds new light on how the administration handled the allegations, which are now driving House Democrats' impeachment probe .
The Justice Department had initially blocked sending the whistleblower report to Congress, but relented this week after a legal dispute and pressure from lawmakers. The report was released to the public Thursday.
New information also emerged Friday about the White House's handling of the records of the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , a central focus of the whistleblower complaint.
According to the complaint, several U.S. officials told the whistleblower that senior White House officials had "intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call" by moving the transcript to a computer system typically reserved for the most sensitive of American secrets, such as U.S. covert actions in other countries. One White House official described the move as an "abuse of this electronic system" given the lack of sensitive material discussed in the call, according to the complaint.
On Friday, a senior administration official said the decision to move the records of the call to a more restricted location had come from lawyers on the White House National Security Council in line with normal practice. "NSC lawyers directed that the classified document be handled appropriately," the official said. The NSC didn't respond to a request for comment.
Former officials familiar with the operation said the classified computer system is usually used for the most precious U.S. secrets.
In the call, Mr. Trump emphasized U.S. aid to Ukraine, while also asking Mr. Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden and his son. Mr. Trump has defended his conversation with Mr. Zelensky as appropriate and called investigations into it a witch hunt.
Mr. Trump also has cast doubt on the accuracy of the whistleblower's claims, which the whistleblower has said were based on information from multiple U.S. government officials. The president tweeted Friday that it was "all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate."
On Friday, a State Department official denied an assertion in the whistleblower's complaint that an important adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, State Department counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, listened in on the Trump-Zelensky phone call.
The whistleblower, now known to be a Central Intelligence Agency officer, lodged the formal whistleblower complaint under a process designed to protect him from reprisals and safeguard his anonymity. He filed the complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community on Aug. 12. The inspector general presented the matter to the acting director of national intelligence on Aug. 26.
But the Justice Department learned of the allegations separately.
The top lawyer at the CIA, Courtney Simmons Elwood, told a Justice Department official on Aug. 14 that she had received anonymous information detailing broad concerns about a call between Mr. Trump and a foreign leader, a person familiar with the matter said.
The following day, that Justice Department official, John Demers, who leads the national security division, went to the White House to review a rough transcript of the call, the person said.
Over the following days, Mr. Demers alerted other law-enforcement officials, and together they discussed how to handle the information, this person said. Within days, the head of the criminal division and Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen were also made aware.
About the same time, Attorney General William Barr learned of the allegations and that Mr. Trump had invoked Mr. Barr's name several times during the July 25 conversation, one of the people said. But it isn't known whether Mr. Barr learned of the whistleblower's allegations from other department officials who were aware of them, or from its referral to the Justice Department by the director of national intelligence, which happened around the same time, this person said. Mr. Barr didn't supervise discussions about how to proceed, this person said.
The CIA referred questions to the office of the intelligence-community inspector general, which declined to comment.
In the July call, Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky he would have Mr. Barr call him about investigating Mr. Biden. The Justice Department said Wednesday that the president never asked Mr. Barr to make the call nor did he ask the attorney general to investigate Mr. Biden.
In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community and the acting director of national intelligence both referred the allegations for possible criminal investigation, but the Justice Department declined to open a probe, citing lack of evidence. It was several weeks before the acting director of national intelligence turned over the whistleblower complaint to Congress.
The revelation that government officials knew about the allegations prior to the complaint's filing, first reported by the New York Times, adds a new wrinkle to the controversy that has shaken Washington and become the biggest political threat to Mr. Trump.
Some experts on intelligence law said the fact that Justice Department officials were made aware of the concerns within the CIA about the July call outside the formal whistleblowing channel highlighted difficulties federal employees face when trying to anonymously raise alarms about perceived wrongdoing—especially if it involves the president.
"I almost always recommend taking actionable misconduct to inspectors general rather than running through internal dissent channels," said Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst at the whistleblower protection group Government Accountability Project and whose father is on the legal team representing the CIA officer. "That's because inspectors general work for both Congress and the President, while agency officials work for their agency-head and the president."

Texto completo: Bishop Gunn, Colony House, Seratones—you may not know these headliners' names, but one of these could be your new favorite band.
The 44th annual Red River Revel Arts Festival will be Sept. 28 to Oct. 6 at Festival Plaza in downtown Shreveport.
Each year, Red River Revel Arts Festival organizers book local, regional, and national acts from music genres ranging from blues to gospel to rock to world music to play the two festival stages – the Chase Entertainment Stage and the Eldorado Performing Arts Depot Stage.
The festival puts the audience in the prime position to be exposed to new, eclectic sound experiences — and for a low ticket price.
In addition to veterans of the music industry, Revel 44 will showcase newcomers on the scene and up-and-coming bands on the cusp of mainstream stardom. No doubt, these musicians have earned their place on the stage—and they're ready to prove it.
If unfamiliar with the headliners of Revel 44, now's the time to check them out and make sure you're front and center at showtime. Here's a crash course in headliners to play Revel 44, beginning with an exclusive interview with Bishop Gunn's bassist, Ben Lewis.
Bishop Gunn
bishopgunn.com
On Saturday, Sept. 28, Bishop Gunn will play from 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. as the headliner of Revel 44.
"It's a rock and roll show. It's kind of fast-paced but we take some slower times, as well," bassist Ben Lewis told The Times. "There's lots of energy. It's a very one-on-one kind of experience. It's interactive with the crowd. If you're into cool guitar riffs and big vocal stuff, this is the show to see. Lots of energy and just a good time all around."
Bishop Gunn — of Natchez, Mississippi — is fronted by the gritty, soulful singer Travis McCready with Drew Smithers on lead guitar, and bassist Ben Lewis and drummer Burne Sharp making up the rhythm foundation.
The musicians have made quite the impression on the music industry and their efforts are paying off in a big way.
"They say, 'The harder you work, the luckier you get,'" Lewis said.
The Mississippi Delta rock-and-blues band began the year on a European tour opening for guitar guru Slash. In July, they opened for rock icons the Rolling Stones. Next month, they will exchange concert energy with Slash once again as the openers for Guns N' Roses. But opening for Kid Rock was an early-on game changer.
"That helped us establish a fan base," Lewis said. "Then, we hit Europe and that was a big turning point. We were able to open a handful of dates for Slash and Myles Kennedy (and the Conspirators) and made a good impression with those guys. Slash was talking to his manager in L.A. and he said, 'You've got to check these guys out' and we ended up getting new management. That's opened a lot of doors and since then it's been one stepping stone after the next."
Bishop Gunn has played bar club and theater venues, including a couple in Shreveport, since emerging more than two years ago. Now, they've entered "a different world" playing the largest stages they've seen yet with pioneers of rock and roll.
At Revel 44, Bishop Gunn's setlist list will include songs from their latest album, "Natchez."
"With our 'Natchez' album, our intention was to draw attention to our town and the culture in Natchez," Lewis said. "We're trying to keep moving forward, grow to a bigger size, reach a bigger fanbase, continue to tell our stories and celebrate Southern culture— Mississippi culture."
Listen to the new album, including popular singles "Shine" and "Devil is a Woman" on Spotify and watch the behind-the-scenes video documentary series for "Alabama" on YouTube.
Fun fact: Bishop Gunn's band name was inspired by a name seen on a tombstone.
Celtica — Pipes Rock!
celticarocks.com
Revelers will have two chances to hear the majestic-mystic sound of Celtica Pipes Rocks—8 p.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 1 and 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. Oct. 5.
The six-piece band creates quite the auditory and visual production from their symphonic-epic melodies to their Medieval-meets-Steampunk fashion.
Hear Great Highland bagpipes, the rolling of thundering toms, violins, keyboards, and an e-guitar heightened by powerful vocals.
The international musicians, hailing from Scotland, the U.S., Bulgaria, and Austria, will convene to create a live concert experience with influences of Celtic, Irish folk, symphonic metal, rock, and Gothic music.
Watch them in action in more than 30 official music videos on YouTube. If you love them, purchase of any of their six CDs at celticarocks.com.
Colony House
colonyhousemusic.com
The four-piece alternative rock band from Franklin, Tennessee will perform 7:45 p.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 2. with brothers Caleb Chapman (frontman) and Will Chapman (drummer) along with Scott Mills (guitarist) and Parke Cottrell (bassist).
The young, energetic musicians will perform catchy, upbeat rock originals and heartfelt melodies in the Revel 44 set. And listen out for the surf rock jam, "You Know It."
Hear songs from the indie band's albums debut and sophomore albums, "When I Was Younger" and "Only the Lonely," on Spotify.
Watch official music videos for "Silhouettes" and "You & I" on YouTube.
Fun fact: Colony House's band name is inspired by an apartment complex in the musicians' hometown where each has called home, at some point in their lives.
Chase Bryant
chasebryant.com
Texan Chase Bryant will take to the Revel stage with his guitar in tow. The Country music singer-songwriter will perform from 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 3.
Bryant comes from a lineage of country musicians – his grandfather played for Roy Orbison and Waylon Jennings, and his uncles co-founded the band, Ricochet.
Bryant's smooth voice and Southern twang come across in his original songs, including the come-hither love song, "Little Bit of You" from his self-titled EP. Also, fall for the crooning Country singer in the singles "Hell If I Know" and "Room To Breathe."
Watch behind the scenes interviews and music video shoots on YouTube.
Macy Kate
facebook.com/MacyKateMusic/
Macy Kate will bring the party vibe –and her bold fashion styles—to Revel from 8:45 p.m. to 10 p.m. Friday, Oct. 4.
The indie songstress' alluring voice impressed judges and the live audience on ABC's "Rising Star" reality TV singing competition where she made the Top 8 finals.
The St. Petersburg, Florida native will travel to Louisiana to dish out a healthy serving of cool and smooth vocals, blending the stylings of pop, soul, and R&B.
With more than 1 million YouTube subscribers, the singer-songwriter's worth checking out. Listen to Macy Kate take on covers of Billie Eillish's "Bad Guy" and Drake's "God's Plan" and watch her live performances on YouTube.
Seratones
seratones.band
Welcome home, Seratones!
The Shreveport natives will return to their hometown festival in true Louisiana fashion.
The soulful rock band is lead by powerhouse vocalist and guitarist A.J. Haynes, who will lead a second line parade with the New Breed Brass Band and local Mardi Gras krewes through Festival Plaza.
The procession will begin at 7 p.m. with a stage performance from New Breed Brass Band to follow at 7:30 p.m.
Bandmates Jesse Gabriel (drums), Adam Davis (bass), Travis Stewart (guitar), and Tyran Coker (keyboard) will perform a mainstage show from 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 5.
In August, the critically-acclaimed rock-and-soul band released their sophomore album, "Power," produced by Brad Shultz, a founding member of Cage the Elephant.
Since then, the musicians have embarked on a U.S. tour and later will set off overseas.
Seratones have received raving reviews from music critics from Rolling Stone, The New York Times, Billboard, Paste, and other publications.
Watch their latest music videos for "Power" — filmed in Shreveport — and "Gotta Get to Know Ya" on YouTube.
Bishop Gunn will perform at 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 28 at the 2019 Red River Revel Arts Festival in Shreveport.

Mafia Don: Our lawless president

Texto completo: You know what they say, it's not the crime, it's the cover-up.
And now, finally, we have the cover-up.
It was bad enough that President Trump decided to hold up American aid to beleaguered Ukraine, then told that country's president he wanted help digging up dirt on his political opponent Joe Biden.

Turns out, the request was so outrageous, so alarming that White House officials apparently decided they had to find a way to hide it.
According to the now celebrated but still anonymous whistleblower, a transcript of the phone call was placed into a super-duper-secret computer system used only for "codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action."
Furthermore, the whistleblower alleged in a complaint made public Thursday that White House officials told him this was not the first time a Trump transcript had been placed in the electronic vault "solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive -- rather than national security sensitive -- information." (Also Thursday, the New York Times reported that the whistleblower was a male CIA officer who was detailed to the White House and had since returned to the CIA.)
Knowing what we know about the White House occupant's lack of morals, ethics and integrity, do we really have to stretch our imaginations to believe that he was willing to hold American funds hostage while importuning a dependent foreign ally to do his domestic political dirty work?
It's really a shame a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.
::
Counting this one, I've lived through three of the country's four impeachment traumas.
That's not a large enough number from which to draw meaningful lessons, but we can say this: Republican presidents who face impeachment are accused of selling out the office for political gain; Democrats who face impeachment are accused of lying about sex. Which kind of president would you prefer?
Even as a teenager, I had no trouble understanding why President Nixon had to go. His henchmen ordered a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate apartments in June 1972, and Nixon helped orchestrate a cover-up of the crime. Nixon smartly preempted his own impeachment; he resigned at the urging of Republicans, who by then had turned on their president.
By 1998, I was certainly old enough to be outraged that then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich put the country through another impeachment trauma because President Clinton lied under oath about having an extramarital affair. (That was the cover-up.) Clinton was impeached by the House and acquitted after a trial in the Senate.
Funny, though. Puritanical Republicans who whipped themselves into hysteria about Clinton's personal behavior just don't seem to care anymore about whether a president lies.
The American people, as it turned out, never really got on board the Clinton impeachment train. Clinton's popularity ratings soared after the impeachment. Maybe partly that was because he was finishing up his second term and would never run for office again.
Trump, on the other hand, is facing a daunting reelection campaign. He seems to be trying to persuade himself that an impeachment ordeal will whip up his supporters and help him win a second term.
I think it will have the opposite effect. Who wants to live in this chaos another four years?
::
On Thursday morning, the House Intelligence Committee invited acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to testify about the whistleblower who filed the complaint about Trump's July 25 phone conversation with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
In his opening statement, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, a Democrat, did something that was risky but smart.
He decided to parody Trump in his call with Zelensky, which Schiff described as "a classic, organized-crime shakedown."
Schiff is not the first person to compare Trump's speaking style to that of a Mafia boss. And though it's hard to parody something that already reads like parody, he pulled it off:
"We've been very good to your country," Schiff paraphrased. "No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what, I don't see much reciprocity. You know what I mean? I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though, and I am going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up political dirt on my opponent, understand? ... You know what I am asking so I am only gonna say this a few more times, in a few more ways. And by the way, don't call me again. I'll call you when you've done what I asked."
This was Schiff's way of saying, Hey, President Trump, we got your number. It doesn't take a trained spy to break your code.
Republicans were in no mood for parody.
Committee member Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) condemned Schiff. "It is disturbing and outrageous that ... Schiff opens up a hearing of this importance with improvised fake dialogue between President Trump and President Zelensky. We should focus on the facts."
I doubt she's serious. After all, the unpalatable facts for Republicans are that the American president implicitly threatened to withhold millions of dollars in foreign aid to an allied country under invasion from a major American foe if it didn't help his reelection campaign.
His minions tried to hide it.
This is Nixon-level lawlessness. Trump's impeachment trauma is well-deserved.

Texto completo: Headnote Guest Columnist
"I started when there were no cameras and no newspapers writing nice things about you, instead they were writing all sorts of ugly things. But we kept going. It wasn't about us. It wasn't about me. It has always been about right and righteousness. Justice and equality. Not just for me and my family, but for all of God's children." - Juanita Jones Abernathy
In this digital age, we can organize a protest march, urge a boycott or raise awareness about social issues with a click of a mouse.
In the dark and dangerous days of Jim Crow, half a century ago, civil rights activism was more labor intensive. And nothing embodies the boots-on-the-ground labor that was involved more than the image of Juanita Jones Abernathy, pounding away at her typewriter, creating fiers for the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
"She said that if she typed with a heavy hand, she could make seven copies at once," her son Kwame Ab-ernathy told the New York Times.
And the image of the Abernathys' frebombed home illustrates the danger of such work.
Juanita Abernathy, who passed away last week, was not only a stalwart of the 20th-century civil rights movement, she was a champion for marginalized people, a brilliant businesswoman and a dedicated community servant.
Her husband, Ralph Abernathy, who died in 1990, was known as Martin Luther King Jr.'s close friend and collaborator. She, like most of the women of the civil rights movement didn't receive their due recognition at the time, as Mrs. Abernathy would be the frst to tell you.
"The men ran the movement, but we were the actual bodies that made it happen," she once told an interview-e r.
Mrs. Abernathy worked in the Alabama chapter of the NAACP when Rosa Parks was arrested, sparking the 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott. In addition to typing up fyers, she organized a transit plan to get people to work without patronizing the buses, arranging intricate car pools using extra cars lent by a local funeral home.
A few weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Browder v. Gayle, that bus segregation was unconstitutional, a pregnant Mrs. Aber-nathy was at home with her toddler daughter. Her husband was away with Dr. King, organizing the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
Ku Klux Klan members, enraged by the desegregation ruling, fre-bombed her house and First Baptist Church, where Ralph Abernathy served as pastor.
She and her daughter escaped the house unharmed. The church was destroyed. The white supremacist terrorists who confessed to the bombings were acquitted by an all-white jury.
Her grace, determination and bravery in the face of life-threatening danger remain overwhelmingly inspirational.
Mrs. Abernathy was the youngest of eight children born into a farming family designated by Tuskee-gee Institute as the most successful Black farmers in the Black Belt in the 1940s. She earned a bachelor of science degree in business education from Tennessee State University in Nashville and married Rev. Aber-nathy in 1952.
In 1961, the family left Montgomery for Atlanta, where she worked to integrate the public schools and fought for the creation of the fought for the Food Stamp program and a National Free Meal Program for public school children.
She stepped back from the civil rights movement following the assassination of Dr. King, and became a successful saleswoman for the Mary Kay cosmetics company, eventually rising to national sales director and proudly piloting a series of pink Cadillacs, the company's signature high-sales award.
Her activism continued, however, as she traveled the world on peace missions, risking her life in Northern Ireland in 1972.
She fttingly occupied a place of honor at President Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009.
Mrs. Abernathy's passing touches me personally, as she was a contemporary of my parents - also NAACP members during those turbulent years, and who also faced death threats as a result of their work. She, like they, have my eternal gratitude and continue to inspire not just myself but everyone in the Urban League Movement. WI

Santa Anita faces existential questions as fall meet opens

Texto completo: ARCADIA — Santa Anita opens its 23-day fall meet Friday with many questions to answer, and the future of horse racing in Southern California may be at stake.
As Santa Anita opens with a nine-race program, including three graded stakes races, horse owners, trainers and the operators of Santa Anita have bigger questions than which horse runs fastest.
— Will it be a safer meet than the winter-spring season from December through June, when 30 horses died either in morning workouts or during afternoon racing?
— Will Hall of Fame trainer Jerry Hollendorfer, banned from all race tracks owned by the Stronach Group since June 22, be allowed to race horses at any time during the meet?
— Is the horse population in Southern California large enough to allow the track to follow through on its plan to hold four-day race weeks, as opposed to the three-day schedule track officials were forced to adopt during the final portion of the spring meet?
— Will racing fans stay away, from both the track and the betting windows, like happened during Del Mar’s 36-day summer meet that ended Sept. 2? Del Mar enjoyed a very safe meet, but a hangover from Santa Anita’s troubles hurt its business.
— What kind of spotlight will come with the Breeders’ Cup on Nov. 1-2? Horse racing’s biggest event also raises the pressure on Santa Anita to run a safe meet.
One thing is perfectly clear, and carries no question marks: This is the most important meet in the track’s history.
“For what’s at stake, I think absolutely (it’s the most important),” said Aidan Butler, the new acting executive director of California racing for Santa Anita’s parent company, the Stronach Group. “There are a lot of eye balls on Santa Anita, both on the positive and the negative. I think we need to put our best foot forward and make sure things are done better than they’ve ever been done historically in any country.
“The way I look at it, if this many people are interested, let’s show ’em what horse racing can do. Let’s show ’em how good horse racing, when done right, truly is.”
California governor Gavin Newsom is watching closely. He issued a scathing review of horse racing when he met with reporters from the New York Times this week.
“What happened last year was unacceptable, and all of the excuses be damned,” he told the Times. “We own that going into the next season, and we’re going to have to do something about it.
“I’ll tell you, talk about a sport whose time is up unless they reform. That’s horse racing. Incredible abuses to these precious animals and the willingness to just spit these animals out and literally take their lives is a disgrace.”
The 42-year-old Butler, a native of Great Britain who came to the Stronach Group from a Toronto law firm in 2018 and assumed his new position in early August, says he sees the need for horse racing to adapt and not conduct business as usual.
“Just because things back in the day were done a certain way and were acceptable does not mean they’ll be acceptable in today’s day and age,” he said.
For example, he cited the days when a racing fatality was treated as back-page news. The nightmare at Santa Anita has changed all of that.
“The way I actually look at it is, if a horse gets injured, everything that happened around that horse, what happened, why did it go on, that needs to be addressed, needs to be looked at,” Butler said. “This is a very fast-paced, active sport and accidents do happen. But that being said, transparency I think will set us all free. I hate to say back in the old days no one cared, well no one cared about a lot of stuff going back a few years.
“There are so many eyeballs on us now that it makes everybody wan to be better. I think if we’re going to try to grow the sport — and I’m not here to keep the status quo, I’m here to try and grow the sport — if we’re going to do that, we need to get confidence back, show (the sport) is as good and safe as can possibly be.”
Thoroughbred owner Jon Lindo is taking a wait-and-see approach, while agreeing that this is Santa Anita’s most important meet ever.
“I think it’s huge,” he said. “Right now, Santa Anita has to earn back the trust and the confidence of not only the horsemen, the owners and trainers, but the fans and the general public. The messages sent during that last meet, that was so confrontational, with the new management team in place we need to see if it’s one that everyone can work with toward a common goal.
“I mean, if this goes the wrong way, we could be out of business. That’s how important it is. It’s a short meet and unfortunately I think we’re all watching, not because we want to see the races, but we just want to see this thing go smoothly. They’ve got to earn my trust back.”
Two-time Kentucky Derby-winning trainer Doug O’Neill is taking an optimistic view.
“After the success of Del Mar (no fatalities during live racing), I can speak on the behalf of the majority of the horsemen that we’re real excited to continue it and have a real great Santa Anita,” he said. “There’s no reason why we shouldn’t.”
Is this Santa Anita’s most important meet ever?
“I haven’t thought of it in those terms,” O’Neill said, “but it’s just real important that we all work together and continue to work together, have a good open dialogue and realize we need to share in all the great times and share in all the accidental stuff.
“From what I can see, I really like the way Santa Anita is going into the meet and we’ll know more as we get going. I know we’re all optimistic that we’re going to have a heck of a meet.”
But that doesn’t mean there is no anxiety in the executive offices at Santa Anita this week. Even Del Mar officials admitted to some nervousness on the eve of their pivotal meet.
“Am I a little bit apprehensive? Of course,” Butler said. “I’ve got a few butterflies because I want everything to go as well as it should. But if preparation and hard work and having the right people around (means anything), my confidence level is pretty good.”
The Hollendorfer situation is still under review. The 73-year-old trainer with more than 7,600 lifetime victories was banned from the Stronach Group’s five race tracks — Santa Anita, Golden Gate Fields, Gulfstream Park, Laurel Park and Pimlico — after his fourth fatality at Santa Anita on June 22.
Butler would not comment on Hollendorfer, citing litigation, but he did offer a rebuttal to people who believe the Stronach Group banned Hollendorfer in an attempt to take the onus off the race track.
“There is absolutely no truth to that whatsoever,” he said. “I was involved, I was there, I was on the grounds and that was never once contemplated or thought of.”

Texto completo: Two Trump supporters are offering a $50,000 reward for information about the national security whistleblower at the center of the Ukraine phone affair.
Controversial conservatives Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl said they would pay the money for “information relating to the identity of the ‘Trump Whistleblower.’”
The New York Times on Thursday reported that the whistleblower works at the CIA and was stationed in the White House when the call was made.
The duo have said their goal is to provide full transparency on the issue in which the administration has already released the transcript of the July 25 call and the inspector general’s report on it.
“This individual is key to understanding exactly what happened and how we can move forward,” said Burkman in a statement. “We’ve put forth this reward in hopes of bringing more information to light and putting this dark chapter behind us,” he added.
The duo have a sketchy record and made headlines for past efforts to attack the Russia election claims against the president. The Washington Examiner dubbed them "right-wing smear merchants" in a recent story.
Below is what the two sent to Secrets:
Trump Whistleblower: Major reward offered for infamous whistleblower to come forward
Conservative activists Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl team up to offer $50,000 for information relating to the identity of the ‘Trump Whistleblower’
ARLINGTON, Va. - Jack Burkman, a D.C.-based lobbyist and lawyer, has partnered with conservative social media personality Jacob Wohl to announce a reward for information relating to the identity of the whistleblower at the center of the Trump-Ukraine phone scandal.
“This individual is key to understanding exactly what happened and how we can move forward,” says Burkman. “We’ve put forth this reward in hopes of bringing more information to light and putting this dark chapter behind us.”
Burkman and Wohl are offering $50,000 for the individual, or anyone with credible information corroborating the whistleblower’s identify, to come forward.
The nation has been embroiled in controversy since news broke last week that an anonymous intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint in relation to a phone call between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Donald Trump.
Since then, tensions in the nation’s capital have escalated at a dramatic pace, ultimately leading to an impeachment inquiry from the House of Representatives.
“The situation in our nation’s capital is a national disgrace,” said Burkman. “Political grandstanding, partisan politics and anonymous sources have contributed to a level of toxicity we haven’t seen in decades. It’s imperative that the truth is brought to light so we can move past this disappointing time in our history.”

Un agente de la CIA es el informante que desató proceso de juicio político contra Trump

Texto completo: Un agente de la CIA que laboró durante un tiempo en la Casa Blanca sería el informante que alertó sobre la petición del presidente Donald Trump a su homólogo ucraniano para investigar al exvicepresidente Joe Biden .
The New York Times afirma que corroboró la identidad de esa personas con tres fuentes distintas, además de señalar que es posible que el agente tenga un amplio conocimiento de la política ucraniana.
El denunciante presentó una queja que fue enviada al Comité de Inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes para alegar un encubrimiento de la Casa Blanca de la llamada telefónica de julio en la que el presidente Trump solicitó al presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky que abriera una investigación sobre Hunter Biden , hijo del exvicepresidente aspirante a la candidatura presidencial de su partido.
El diario defiende la decisión de publicar la información sobre el denunciante, argumentando que el contexto de su posición y su experiencia le da credibilidad a su queja, sobre la cual este jueves compareció el director interino de Inteligencia Nacional, Joseph Maguire , quien dijo desconocer la identidad del informante.
La denuncia — que fue dada a conocer este jueves — advierte que la llamada del mandatario republicano al presidente ucraniano Zelensky también intentó ser ocultada por personal no identificado de la Casa Blanca.
“En el curso de mis deberes oficiales, he recibido información de varios funcionarios del gobierno de EEUU de que el presidente de los Estados Unidos está utilizando el poder de su oficina para solicitar la interferencia de un país extranjero (sic) en las elecciones estadounidenses de 2020” , escribió el denunciante en la queja con fecha del 12 de agosto sobre la llamada de julio. “Esta interferencia incluye, entre otras cosas, presionar a un país extranjero (sic) para que investigue a uno de los principales rivales políticos internos del presidente”.

Pulitzer Prize-winning author and celebrated historian Jon Meacham spoke Thursday morning at the 26th annual R. Dan Boulware Convocation on Critical Issues at Missouri Western State University.
Meacham’s speech, titled “The Soul of America: Moving Beyond Division and Hostility,” focused on the country’s history and how it parallels a number of current events. He also spoke of the need for empathy among government leaders as well as society in general.
“By talking about the American past, we raise the odds of being able to create a kind of mutual recognition of what the national project should be,” Meacham said during his presentation.
He would go on to emphasize the importance of factual data and forming personal opinions apart from various media outlets, online posts and tweets.
Meacham’s conversations with President George H.W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush anchored many of his topics, oftentimes to a humorous degree. Having written the former’s presidential biography (Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush) which debuted at No. 1 on the New York Times bestsellers list, Meacham utilized a near spot-on impression of the former president to get his points across.
“I think you make the case that there's a distinction between politics and public life, and so you have to lay that out and say, ‘What role do you want to play in the world beyond yourself?’" Meacham said in a news conference setting prior to his presentation. “And that may take a political manifestation, it may take a service manifestation, but the underlying motivations, I think, are the same, which is to what extent do you want to temper and shape a broader reality for other people?”
Identifying himself as neither a Republican nor Democrat, Meacham explained the importance of the nation’s history to the community members and students in attendance.
“By looking back, we gain a sense of proportion. … It offers a kind of diagnostic guide. If you look back, you can detect that there are certain symptoms that occur when a particular ailment is present, and that suggests possible routes of treatment in order to survive,” he said. “I talk historically about the present largely because it offers us the best piece of common ground possible to have a slightly more illuminating conversation. We all want to push on toward a more perfect union and have conversations that produce more light than heat. By talking about the American past, we raise the odds of being able to create a kind of mutual recognition of what the national project should be.”
Dan Boulware, for whom the convocation is named, was impressed with Meacham’s speech and the lessons contained therein.
“He nailed it. I'm so pleased with the comments I've already received from people, students and members of the community about how they reacted to him. And they're all saying that this may have been the best convocation,” Boulware said. “I'm sorry for the people that missed it. I'm happy for the people that were here. He was terrific.”
Students from Missouri Western as well as various schools from across the district attended the convocation, as did members of the Student Government Association at Missouri Western.
For SGA Vice President Nathan Scott, the information was most certainly relevant to the current political climate.
“I think (what I observed was) just the insight that can be gained from looking at history and studying issues from the past and how that can inspire others to make an impact in the future,” Scott said.

Texto completo: A year after she was one of 11 women ordained in Philadelphia to the Episcopalian priesthood, at a time when the denomination's hierarchy wouldn't officially recognize them as priests, the Rev. Alison Cheek took stock of the difference between public perception and her personal calling.
“Some people call me a rebel. Well, the truth is that I'm not rebelling against anything or anybody," she told the Globe in late September 1975.
“I'm living creatively — and at a high risk. I could lose my career and some golden friendships," she added. “But, in the final analysis, what does it matter? Right now I don't have a sense of belonging — so I'm living for the moment."
The Rev. Cheek, who was one of what became known as the Philadelphia 11 when they were ordained in 1974, and who later taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, died Sept. 1 in her Brevard, N.C., home. She was 92. Her son Timothy told The New York Times that the cause was congestive heart failure.
She and 10 other women made history on June 29, 1974, when they were ordained at the Church of the Advocate in Philadelphia in a ceremony not authorized by the Episcopal Church's leadership.
“The church dismisses the women's movement as only secular," she told a Knight Ridder reporter in 1980. “It fails to take into account the new lifestyles and aspirations of women."
Two years after the Philadelphia 11 were ordained, the church formally allowed the ordination of women as priests. By 1985 about 600 had been ordained. In 1989, Barbara Harris became the first female Episcopal bishop. But the initial reaction was hard to endure, the Rev. Cheek said in a 40th anniversary video made for the church in 2014.
“All the nastiness that happened right after the ordination would have been unbearable if we hadn't all stuck together," she said.
After being ordained, the Rev. Cheek initially maintained her practice as a pastoral psychotherapist, yet she recalled in the 1980 interview that she immediately became a public figure.
“Those were exciting, but very painful and unusual years," she said.
Alison Mary Western was born on April 11, 1927, in Adelaide, Australia, to Hedley Western and Dora Whiting. Her father was a fruit farmer; her mother a homemaker.
She graduated from the University of Adelaide in 1947 and married Bruce M. Cheek, her economics tutor there. In 1957, when he got a job at the World Bank, they settled in Washington.
The Rev. Cheek became a lay minister for several congregations and in 1963 was one of the first two women admitted to the Virginia Theological Seminary's master of divinity program. She graduated in 1969 and became a deacon in 1972.
Two years later, she received a life-changing telephone call from Nancy Wittig, who was helping to plan the groundbreaking ordination and would become one of the Philadelphia 11. It was a recruitment pitch.
“My heart was leaping up and shouting, 'Yes, oh, yes,' " the Rev. Cheek said in an account in “The Story of the Philadelphia Eleven," a 2014 book by Darlene O'Dell, but “my body was registering symptoms of panic; my head was beginning to calculate the risks."
Those included her ability to remain in the United States, where she was on a work visa. If she were deposed by the church — permanently excluded from any ministry — it could mean, she thought, the end of her private counseling practice, which had grown out of her church training.
But, she said, she experienced an odd sensation, one similar to her reaction to her grandfather's death when she was 12: She felt that an era had ended.
“Something deep inside me recognized the inevitability of it," she wrote.
Though the House of Bishops, a church governing body, declared the ordinations of the 11 invalid, the Rev. Cheek remained defiant. “I would invite the presiding bishop and the House of Bishops into a new age," she said in a sermon that August.
In late October 1974, she and two other members of the Philadelphia 11, the Rev. Carter Hayward and the Rev. Jeannette Ridlon Piccard, celebrated the Eucharist at the interdenominational Riverside Church in New York City before 1,500 people who burst into applause when the three walked to the altar.
In a statement at the time, the women responded to a declaration by the House of Bishops that affirmed the ordination of women “in principle" but that still did not endorse the Philadelphia ceremony. They wrote: “While we rejoice in this action, we must note that women do not exist merely 'in principle.' We are people and we are priests."
Weeks later, the Rev. Cheek celebrated the Eucharist at a Washington church, whose website records the event this way:
“On November 10, 1974, the Rev. Alison Cheek stood before the altar of St. Stephen and the Incarnation Church, said the words 'On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ broke bread,' and thus launched the public ministry of Episcopal women priests in their own church."
The Rev. Cheek was not universally embraced there, however.
“Often there is clear-cut animosity at the Communion services at which I officiate," she told the Globe in 1975. “Some people — mostly men — won't come to the rail. And, yes, there are inevitable character assassinations behind your back."
In 1977, her husband died, at 51, of a heart attack.
“It really blew me away. I'm only just beginning to feel alive again," she said in the 1980 interview, adding that her spiritual and emotional relationships at church helped her through the loss.
She subsequently became codirector of a church fund-raising program in Philadelphia. In 1996, she graduated with a doctorate from the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, where she taught and directed the feminist liberation studies program. She later became a teacher at the Greenfire women's retreat in Tenants Harbor, Maine, before retiring in 2013.
In addition to her son Timothy, she leaves two other sons, Malcolm and Jonathan; a daughter, Bronwen Cheek; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
Being part of the Philadelphia 11, the Rev. Cheek said, had opened her eyes to the obstacles faced by other groups that felt marginalized by the church.
“Quite a few oppressed groups of folk then reached out to us and wanted us to come and celebrate for them," she said in the 2014 video.
In 2004, for example, she and Carter Heyward officiated at the weddings of two lesbian couples. “I feel as though my consciousness was raised, but it certainly got raised a lot higher after the ordination," the Rev. Cheek said.
In the 1980 Knight Ridder interview, she said that “for me, the roots of my feminism came out of the church."
“That's where I heard that women and men are equal, in the preaching of the Gospel, not in the structure of the institution — it's a double message women get," the Rev. Cheek added. “At the height of the Gospel, Jesus is a feminist. He doesn't put down women."

Florence Knoll's Art Will Be Auctioned

Texto completo: Phillips is offering a peek into how the designer decorated her homes in New York, and then Florida: 50 artworks are being offered at sales this fall.
Before there was "Mad Men" and Don Draper, there was Florence Knoll, as she was known, arguably the designer most responsible for the square-jawed corporate look that conquered American offices after World War II.
Florence Knoll Bassett, who died this year at 101, lived to see her spare, handsome office landscapes televised more than a half century after Knoll Associates -- where she was the eye and force majeure -- invented the structured style that we now call "midcentury modern." Trained as an architect, she translated Bauhaus architecture into low, clean-lined, floaty furniture, and helped establish interior design as a profession.
"I am not a decorator," she pointedly clarified in 1964 in a New York Times interview. "The only place I decorate is my own house."
Phillips is now offering a peek into just how, in fact, Florence Knoll Bassett decorated her homes in New York, and then Florida, where, after the death of her husband Hans Knoll, she married Harry Hood Bassett, a Miami banker. Some 50 artworks are being offered at two evening sales, on Oct. 25 and Nov. 14.
From the late 1940s until the early '70s, the most intensive period of her collecting, she bought from galleries and from artist friends during studio visits. Though she saw with the eye of a Modernist, her eye was eclectic rather than strict, and open to different forms of abstraction.
"Atmosphere Chromoplastique," a gridded wood-and-acrylic relief by Luis Tomasello, offers optically subtle plays of geometry, as does "Torsions," a relief in stretched polyvinyl by Walter Leblanc. Besides geometry, Knoll liked color. Rufino Tamayo's "Five Slices of Watermelon" is, unsurprisingly, watermelon red, and Morris Louis painted "Singing" with stripes of rich, saturated colors. Some abstract works flirt with figurative forms, such as Paul Klee's caustic "Der Exkaiser."
A ceramic vase by Picasso captures in a few quick strokes the smile on a face. The exception to the Modernist rule is a collection of antique weather vanes that decorated a wall of her last living room.
Did Knoll's personal eye differ much from her professional eye? The evidence at Phillips suggests that she brought her Modernism home. But if she designed her houses the way she planned offices, the artworks gave her rational designs a freer, more experimental, sometimes emotional dimension, and as biography of her intimate and abiding visual interests, the collection offers a key into how she thought and saw.
The collection is personal. Even when she moved, she never traded or sold. She bought what she liked, and then lived with it until she died.

'No one is above the law,' unless you're a Democrat running against Trump in the 2020 election

Texto completo: For absolutely no identifiable reason at all, it's taken for granted by Democrats and liberals in the media that because we're only 14 months away from a presidential election, it was inappropriate for President Trump to ask the leader of Ukraine to look into potentially corrupt conduct by Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
That's quite a grace period for any high-profile Democrat who might be interested in enriching his or her family by pulling some strings within the federal government.
We still don't know if Joe Biden ever did anything like that, though it looks like he might have. What we do know, though, is that it was apparently an outrageous "abuse of power" for Trump to have asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into the possibility.
If Biden, as vice president, pressured Ukrainian officials in order to protect the financial interests of his son, it would have been a stunningly corrupt act in a country already drowning in corruption.
As part of a broader discussion on government corruption, Trump said on the call that "there's a lot of talk about Biden's son" and that "a lot of people want to find out about that." He said to Zelensky, according to the White House transcript of the call, that "whatever you can do with the [U.S.] attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me."
And that's it. That's why House Democrats are now beginning the impeachment process. At no point in the call does Trump suggest a punishment or any consequence at all if Zelensky doesn't follow through on the request, nor does Trump bring up the subject about Biden more than the one time.
Yet the media have been hysterical. The New York Times' Peter Baker wrote that "the man who once said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan without consequence seems to be testing whether he can do the political equivalent."
A Washington Post story this week said Trump's request on the call revealed a president "apparently willing and even eager to wield the vast powers of the United States to taint a political foe."
Lost in the dust is the fact that Biden is not even the nominee. Democrats haven't even begun their nomination contests. How long, exactly, does Biden, as a "political foe," retain immunity from scrutiny?
During her announcement about the launch of an official impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday in dramatic fashion that "no one is above the law." Well, we're apparently suspending that rule for Biden — and just because we're only 14 months away from the next election.

The college admissions trilemma

Texto completo: For decades, America's universities have made extensive efforts to achieve racial diversity within their student bodies. The official justifications for these efforts have changed depending on political currents and Supreme Court whims: What began as explicit redress for African Americans eventually morphed into a commitment to diversity as an educational good unto itself.
For a long time this system was challenged mostly from the right, by critics of affirmative action who argued that it legitimized meritocracy at the expense of academic merit.
But lately the critiques have come from all directions. Asian Americans have noticed that the current racial balance on campuses is sustained, in part, by suppressing Asian numbers. Populists of the left and right have pointed out that meritocracy often has racial diversity without socioeconomic diversity, reproducing a multihued but still immensely privileged elite. And the new progressivism has attacked that racial diversity as insufficient, because it still leaves blacks and Hispanics alienated within the system dominated by rich white kids.
In general I think the meritocracy deserves almost all the criticism it gets. But there is no obvious reform that would satisfy all of these objections, no simple step that would bring the idea of meritocracy, the diversity of class and race, and the need to attract tuition dollars into balance.
Consider the reform that has the most bien-pensant support - the abolition of legacy and athletic preferences. The theory is that these preferences amount to affirmative action for well-off white kids.
This argument seems to be buttressed by a new paper that uses Harvard admissions data to estimate the importance of preferences for athletes, legacies, the children of donors and Harvard faculty. The authors find that those preferences benefit the white and well-to-do: More than 43% of white admittees to Harvards had those advantages, and roughly three-quarterswouldn't have gotten in without them.
However, dropping those preferences might not alter the racial mix dramatically. In the study's simulations, the white share of the Harvard student body fell by 4% without legacy admissions and 6% without athletic preferences, while minority shares increased by comparable percentages. The authors suggest theirmethods are limited and the real changes could be larger. But it's still a sharp contrast with the simulation that eliminated racial preferences. That change reduced Hispanic and black numbers by about 40% and 70%, while Asian numbers climbed by over 50%; white numbers barely budged.
It may be that white percentages stay pretty stable, even without upper-class affirmative action, because white legacies and athletes are often admitted at the expense of less-affluent white kids, rather than minorities. As the authors note, the "holistic" approach to admission often benefits the affluent "within racial groups" because they know how to stack up extracurriculars.
If this is right, then abolishing upper-class affirmative action could make the system fairer, but many beneficiaries would be white - meaning the reform wouldn't eliminate Asian quotas or satisfy racial progressives.But leaving aside the justice of such a policy, it's not clear how colleges would pay for such a shift, because tuition from well-off white kids is what keeps many of them solvent.
True, Harvard and the other elite-of-the-elite have plenty of financial flexibility. But many private colleges have a business model that's under strain already, and likely to become more untenable thanks to the birth dearth of the last 10 years.
So what is to be done? One answer is that there isn't a single answer, and that we need to weaken the Ivy cartel and allow other schools to go different ways - some more SAT-centric; some with frank racial quotas; yet others focused on socioeconomic mobility alone; all seeking more economical ways to educate.
Another, grimmer answer is that the modern meritocracy has too many flaws and contradictions to either allow dramatic reform or to command widespread support without it. Which means that a system lacking legitimacy and under siege from all directions may be with us for many matriculations yet to come.
Ross Douthat writes for the New York Times.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Republicans appear to be sticking by President Donald Trump despite concerns he sought foreign help to discredit Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
The latest controversy riling up the White House revolves around Trump's contacts with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, a whistleblower complaint at a U.S. intelligence agency and whether Trump conditioned the granting military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into the former Vice President's son, Hunter Biden.
Trump has acknowledged bringing up Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic 2020 presidential contender, in a July phone call with Zelensky, but he denied offering the aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden.
"I didn't do it," Trump told reporters on Monday in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Many Senate Republicans on Monday resisted saying too much about the controversy, dodging questions by reporters and stressing that none of the information about the complaint or the president's conversations has been verified. But others downplayed the issue, saying this was another attempt by Democrats to amplify impeachment efforts. Some also repeated comments that the president himself has made that Biden should be investigated and that's what the media should be focusing on.
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin met with Zelensky in Ukraine earlier this month and said before his visit, he talked with Trump on the phone. Johnson said he hoped he could convince Trump to approve of the aid so he could relay that message in person to Zelensky. Trump declined.
"The rationale that he gave [me] is the concern about corruption in Ukraine, which is what I relayed to President Zelensky, and they all acknowledge it. It's why he won the election. They're trying to rid the country of corruption," Johnson said, adding Trump "did not mention anything about Joe Biden or anything" during their phone call.
Johnson said he didn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be made available to Congress, nor should a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. "It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have."
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue." He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner."
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum."
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it."
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance."
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that's a quid-pro-quo." She said it would be "helpful" having a transcript of the president's call and more information on the whistleblower complaint from the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Both the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the inspector general Michael Atkinson could appear this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption.
Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
The prosecutor was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

Texto completo: One summer night in 1986, 7-month-old Christopher Abeyta vanished from his crib at the foot of his parents' bed.
After grabbing books from his locker at Cedaredge High School on Colorado's Western Slope in 1981, 17-year-old Roger Ellison was never seen again.
Beth Miller — a lively 14-year-old who "didn't know a stranger" — set off from her Idaho Springs home on a jog one August day in 1983. She never came home.
With the recent discovery of 12-year-old Jonelle Matthews' remains 34 years after she went missing from her Greeley home, we took a look at years-old missing children cases that have puzzled Colorado authorities.
There are 59 missing juveniles listed in the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's cold case database, according to the CBI. Here are eight of those children who vanished, seemingly, without a trace in Colorado.
1. Chris Vigil Missing since: April 30, 1978
Chris Vigil, a 9-year-old boy from Laporte, was last seen on a Sunday afternoon hike with his mom, Marian, and younger brother, Eric, in Northern Colorado's Poudre Canyon. The three set off together on the Greyrock Mountain trail on April 30, 1978, but Chris ended up hiking ahead and disappearing. Despite one of the "most expansive" searches in Larimer County history, Chris has never been found. If you have any information about the disappearance or whereabouts of Chris, contact the Larimer County Sheriff's Office at 970-416-1985.
2. Marie Blee Missing since: Nov. 22, 1979
On Nov. 22,1979, after attending a 4-H Club dance in Craig, 15-year-old Marie Blee went to a party at the nearby Shadow Mountain Village mobile home park with a friend, according to the Charley Project. Blee left the party with an unidentified driver who had agreed to take her back to her home 15 miles away in Hayden. She has never been heard from again. If you have any information on Blee's disappearance, contact the Routt County Sheriff's Office at 970-879-1090.
3. Roger Ellison Missing since: Feb. 10, 1981
It's been almost 40 years since 17-year-old Roger Ellison, a popular A-student with seemingly no reason to disappear, vanished from his Western Slope high school. Ellison was last seen getting his books from his school locker in the small Delta County town of Cedaredge. He never made it to his next class and never came home that day, according to the Denver Post. Despite posters being distributed — and his family offering an $8,000 reward for information — Ellison has never been found. For months after Roger's disappearance, his father, Ernest, reportedly stood at a curb waiting for the school bus that once dropped off his son. He would scan the students getting off, hang his head and cry when he didn't see Roger, according to the Post. Ernest died of a heart attack the spring after Roger's disappearance. If you have any information on Roger's disappearance, contact the Delta County Sheriff's Office at 970-874-2000.
4. Victoria Sanchez and 5. Yvonne Mestas Missing since: Nov. 1, 1982
Victoria Sanchez and Yvonne Mestas, both 15 and students at Rocky Ford High School, were last seen at the school on Nov. 1, 1982. Their disappearances have stretched on decades, but new information in the case led the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and Rocky Ford police to reopen the case in 2017. It currently remains unsolved. If you have information on Yvonne's or Victoria's disappearances, contact the Rocky Ford Police Department at 719-254-3345.
6. Beth Miller Missing since: Aug. 16, 1983
On Aug. 16, 1983, 14-year-old Beth Miller went for a morning jog in her hometown of Idaho Springs, just west of Denver. She never came home and hasn't been seen since. Witnesses claimed to have seen Miller talking to a man in a red pickup truck, but the alleged truck was never found by law enforcement, according to 9News. If you have information on Beth's disappearance, contact the Colorado Bureau of Investigation at 303-239-4221.
7. Christopher Harvey Missing since: July 11, 1984
After visiting a friend in the Hinsdale County mobile home park where his family spent their summers, 14-year-old Christopher Harvey set off to walk his dog. Though the dog returned, Christopher never did. The teen's disappearance — which was further muddled when a badly-beaten boy around the same age was incorrectly identified as Christopher six weeks later — was chronicled in a November 1984 story in the New York Times. If you have any information on his disappearance, contact the Hinsdale County Sheriff's Office at 970-944-2291.
8. Christopher Abeyta Missing since: July 15, 1986
Christopher Abeyta was just seven months old when he vanished from his crib at the foot of his parents' bed in Colorado Springs.
Though more than 30 years have passed, the Abeyta family has actively searched for Christopher ever since.
Before her death of cancer in 2017, Christopher's mother, Bernice, traveled across the county chasing down tips about his whereabouts.
Last year, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released an updated, age-progressed rendering of what Christopher could look like today.

Texto completo: A video is widely interpreted as capturing officers kicking a man in a yellow shirt. But the police say it was merely a "yellow object."
HONG KONG -- Distrust between pro-democracy protesters and the Hong Kong police deepened on Tuesday after a senior police official suggested that a man in a yellow shirt, whom officers are accused of abusing in video captured last weekend, was in fact a "yellow object."
At least two bystanders in Yuen Long, a neighborhood that has been the site of some of Hong Kong's worst violence during its monthslong protest movement, filmed what was widely interpreted to be police officers kicking the man as he lay on the ground on Saturday.
But at a news conference on Monday, Vasco Williams, the police official, insisted that the officers had done nothing wrong and that videos appearing to show otherwise were doctored.
Mr. Williams's description of the man as a "yellow object" -- suggesting that officers in the sometimes-blurry videos could have been surrounding a bag or a vest, not a human -- roiled protesters and opposition lawmakers who considered it obfuscation straight out of China's playbook.
"It sums up the insensitive, callous nature of the Hong Kong police force," said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator who has supported the protests. "It's a communist tactic: You dehumanize, you demonize, you reduce your enemies to nothing and then you attack."
The flare-up illustrated how precipitously views of the Hong Kong police force -- once known as "Asia's finest" -- have deteriorated as officers have cracked down on increasingly violent protests.
Witness videos reviewed by The New York Times indicate the "yellow object" was in fact a man. But it is less clear whether the officers kicked the man -- the scene around them was chaotic, and other officers aimed their flashlights at cameras to try to obscure the view.
Roy Chan, a preacher at the Good Neighbor North District Church, said the man seen in the video was a member of a campaign known as "Protect Our Kids" that has tried to act as a peacekeeper during the often violent protests. He said the man had bleeding gums and was experiencing dizziness from the encounter. The man was charged with assaulting a police officer, Mr. Chan said.
"According to the footage and the report from our members, we have strong reasons to believe that these injuries are caused by police abuses of power," he said in a statement that did not identify the man. "We are profoundly concerned and angered by the situation."
Mr. Williams, an acting senior superintendent, defended the police officers by saying that the videos were not clear enough to determine what had happened.
"You mentioned a video which shows what appears to be an officer kicking a yellow object on the ground," he said to a reporter. "Now, we don't know what that object is, but there are other videos that are more clear that show the entire incident and there's no malpractice by the police whatsoever in the clear video."
It was not known which video he was referring to. The police did not immediately respond to a request for a link to the video.
Later in the news conference, Mr. Williams asserted that bystanders had "doctored the video to show police kicking people," without offering evidence.
He received support on Tuesday from Carrie Lam, the territory's beleaguered chief executive, who declined to take a stance on the video.
"It would be very difficult for me as a chief executive to offer my own opinion on individual video footage or shots to determine what is right, what is wrong, what is true, what is fake, because there has been so far always different versions to the same incident," she said at a news conference.
The various video clips circulating on social media and messaging apps popular with protesters show several dozen officers in an alley, surrounding the man in yellow. At least one video showed a man wearing similar clothing leaned up against a wall with his arms behind his back.
While the video quality leaves it unclear whether the officers kicked the man, protesters saw such abuse as consistent with the recent conduct of officers, who have often referred to protesters as "cockroaches" and have been criticized by several international watchdogs.
Agnes Chow, an activist who was arrested in August, said the incident showed that the government "wouldn't criticize, condemn or investigate the police force that has gone out of control."
"This shows the police's complete lack of respect for protesters, the basic respect not just for protesters but also for humans," she said.
Ken Tsang, an activist who was beaten up by seven officers during the 2014 Umbrella Movement and later jailed for resisting arrest and assaulting the police after he splashed a liquid at them, said he was "disappointed and angered by the police's nonsense."
"Police have said, knowing there are cameras everywhere, would they be so stupid as to beat up protesters in front of the cameras?" he said. "They are doing exactly that, even lying."
Hong Kong is preparing for what's expected to be a tense week. Demonstrations are expected on Friday, the fifth anniversary of the end of the Umbrella Movement, and on Oct. 1, China's National Day holiday, which this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China under the Communist Party.
On Tuesday, Roy Kwong, a pro-democracy lawmaker, was ambushed by three masked men as he walked toward his car near a wetlands park in the Tin Shui Wai area on Tuesday morning, according to lawmakers who spoke to Mr. Kwong after the attack. They said the three men kicked and punched him, injuring his cervical vertebrae.

House Democrats to Begin Formal Impeachment Inquiry of Trump

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that the House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump, saying he had betrayed his oath of office and the nation's security in seeking to enlist a foreign power for his own political gain.
“The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution," she said after emerging from a meeting of House Democrats in the basement of the Capitol. Trump, she said, “must be held accountable. No one is above the law."
The announcement was a stunning development that unfolded after months of caution by House Democrats, who have been divided over using the ultimate remedy to address what they have called flagrant misconduct by the president. The inquiry has the potential to reshape Trump's presidency and to cleave an already divided nation only a year before he plans to stand for reelection.
In this case, with an avalanche of Democrats — including many who had resisted the move — now demanding it, Pelosi said that Trump's reported actions, and his administration's refusal to share details about the matter with Congress, have left the House no alternative outside of impeachment.
At issue are allegations that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to open a corruption investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son. The conversation is said to be part of a whistleblower complaint that the Trump administration has withheld from Congress.
Trump said Tuesday that he would authorize the release of a transcript of the conversation, practically daring Democrats to try to find an impeachable offense in a conversation that he has called “perfect." But Democrats, after months of holding back, demanded the full whistle-blower complaint, even as they pushed toward an expansive impeachment inquiry that could encompass unrelated charges.
“The actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections," Pelosi said in her announcement.
The president, in New York for several days of international diplomacy at the United Nations, issued a rageful response on Twitter, in a series of fuming posts that culminated with a simple phrase: “PRESIDENTIAL HARRASSMENT!"
“Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage," Trump wrote. “So bad for our Country!"
Pelosi said she had directed the chairmen of the six committees that have been investigating Trump to “proceed under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry." In a closed-door meeting earlier in the day, she said the six would put together their best cases on potentially impeachable offenses by the president and send them to the Judiciary Committee, according to two officials familiar with the conversation. That could potentially lay the groundwork for articles of impeachment based on the findings.
The decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry does not necessarily mean that the House will ultimately vote to charge Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors — much less that the Republican-controlled Senate will vote to remove him. But Pelosi and her leadership would not initiate the process unless they were prepared to reach that outcome.
Pelosi met privately Tuesday with the leaders of the six key committees involved in investigations of Trump, and later huddled with the full Democratic caucus. Her announcement came amid a groundswell in favor of impeachment among Democrats that has intensified since late last week, with lawmakers from every corner of her caucus lining up in favor of using the House's unique power to charge Trump if the allegations are proved true, or if his administration continues to stonewall attempts by Congress to investigate them.
The House Judiciary Committee has been conducting its own impeachment investigation focused on the findings of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, as well as allegations that Trump may be illegally profiting from spending by state and foreign governments and other matters. But that inquiry has never gotten the imprimatur of a full House vote or the full rhetorical backing of the speaker, as Democrats remained divided about the wisdom and political implications of impeaching a president without broader public support.
Now, after the revelation of a conversations between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine in which Trump pressed the foreign leader to investigate the Bidens, a cascading flood of Democrats has come out in favor of a formal impeachment proceeding.
The shift in outlook among Democratic lawmakers has been rapid, and could yet still turn away from impeachment if exculpatory evidence comes to light. The developments that have turned the tide began less that two weeks ago, when Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee chairman, first revealed the existence of a secret whistle-blower complaint that the intelligence community's internal watchdog had deemed “urgent" and credible but that the Trump administration had refused to share with Congress.
Democrats have given Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, until Thursday to turn over the whistle-blower complaint or risk reprisal. And they have threatened to subpoena the Trump administration for a copy of the transcript of the president's call with Zelenskiy and other relevant documents after Thursday if they are not shared voluntarily.
On Wednesday, the House is expected to consider a symbolic but still notable resolution insisting the Trump administration turn over to Congress the whistle-blower's complaint. The Senate, in a rare bipartisan moment, approved a similar resolution Tuesday.
There were also indications the whistle-blower might not wait around for the complaint to be disclosed. Democrats said Tuesday that a lawyer for the whistle-blower had informed the committee his client wanted to speak with the House and Senate Intelligence panels, and had requested directions from the office of the director of national intelligence on how to do so.
Though it has attracted much less fanfare, the Senate Intelligence Committee intends to meet privately with the inspector general and Maguire later this week to discuss the whistle-blower complaint.
Trump has authorized the release of a transcript of the call, which is to be made public on Wednesday.
"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call," Trump said.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, declined to say Tuesday what he would do if the House voted for impeachment. However, he did issue a statement, saying Pelosi's "efforts to restrain her far-left conference have finally crumbled."

Texto completo: In the Trump era, a columnist risks appearing like the boy (or girl) who cried wolf. Time and time again, we say this scandal is the big one.
But in our ill-fated version of the story, the wolf comes every time. The violations of morality and law have become progressively bolder and more dangerous to the constitutional order. And they have culminated in an abuse of power both highly serious and totally unconcealed.
By his own admission, the president of the United States urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open a criminal investigation of the son of a political rival. Trump denies that this request involved a quid pro quo. But with Ukraine engaged in conflict with Russian-backed separatists, and with $250 million in American military aid being held up (at the time) for "review," the threat did not need to be explicit in order to be palpable and powerful.
This groundbreaking form of political corruption shocked everyone with a conscience who was privy to it. U.S. embassy staff in Kiev expressed alarm about Rudy Giuliani’s contacts with Ukrainian officials. A whistleblower in the intelligence community risked his or her career to report it. The intelligence community’s inspector general found the matter of "urgent concern." But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Department of Justice — playing the role of political enforcers — have blocked the transmission of the whistleblower’s report to Congress. They are pursuing a cover-up in plain sight.
Here we need to be clear. Treating the presidency in this fashion is not only corrupt but unpatriotic. Trump has set his own interests above the interests of the nation. The American criminal justice system was created to deal with normal types of political corruption, not with a rogue president, testing the limits of executive power. That form of warped ambition must be checked and balanced by the coequal branches of government. But many members of Congress — mostly Republicans but also some Democrats — appear to have lost their taste for that role.
The political risk to elected Republicans when they oppose Trump appears very real. But the moral hazard is far greater. When they use their office to shield shady political dealings, they become a party to public corruption. When they ignore or excuse Trump’s use of the nation’s power and influence for private reasons, they have chosen Trump above their country. Worst of all, they are teaching their political supporters that the rule of law is a small and expendable thing.
In the scarier regions of the Trump right, the problem is far advanced. Every revelation of the president’s abuse of power is met with a sentence beginning: "But Biden ..." Their tolerance for corruption seems limitless — and frightening. By what firm political principle would they condemn Trump if he closed down The New York Times (an "enemy of the people") or arrested a few whistleblowers (part of the "deep state" that is conducting a "coup")?
None of this seems possible. But too many impossibilities have recently become realities. Opposing Trump’s corrupt abuse of power — here, now, before it goes further — is the calling of patriotism in our time.

Texto completo: Is U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh a villain or a victim? But what if it's the wrong question to ask?
During his confirmation hearings a year ago, lots of circumstantial evidence turned up suggesting that Kavanaugh was a drunken cad in his youth and early adulthood. Then the confirmation process was upended by testimony by Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh and a friend sexually assaulted her.
Very powerful institutional forces came to Kavanaugh's defense, painting him as the victim of a persecution campaign by political opponents. The proceedings ended with Kavanaugh's confirmation, leaving many critics of the process claiming that the relevant authorities -- the Senate Judiciary Committee (under Republican control) and the FBI (ditto) -- failed to scrutinize with due rigor the evidence presented by Blasey Ford and other witnesses to the alleged debauchery of the young Kavanaugh. Positions tend to align with people's politics, a fact that's being mined for all it is worth with the release of a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation." The authors, reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly of the New York Times, wrote an article for the Times unveiling a previously unreported allegation. In an embarrassing later clarification, the paper noted that the woman supposedly involved refused to be interviewed and that her friends say she denies having been involved in such an incident.
The book also delves into similar allegations by Yale alumna Deborah Ramirez, who never received the federal investigative attention paid to Blasey Ford.
For President Trump, the emergence of Pogrebin and Kelly's book is tailor-made for his Twitter obsession, his disdain for journalists and a penchant for snarling judgments. All the better that the rollout of the reporters' 10-month investigation was hobbled by an editorial misdeed. The Times has been roundly and rightfully pilloried within journalism circles for failing to note the noncooperation of the supposed female victim.
The fact has been red meat for Republican leadership. Meanwhile, many Democrats, including several presidential hopefuls, have pounced on the possibility of damning new details, stoking the hope that Kavanaugh may somehow be thrown off the court through impeachment.
Stepping for a moment out of the political maelstrom, we ought to consider what message young people are receiving.
Here's the admonishment I fear they hear about the alcohol-filled parties of high school and college where something awful might happen: Don't tell anyone. Keep it to yourself. Forever. Nothing good comes of it.
Sometimes it feels as if nothing has changed for young people in America. They are navigating working a first job with an older male supervisor who might catcall or try to fondle them. They're young men attending fraternity parties who don't realize that they hold extraordinary power to influence their friends, that their intervention might save another person from sexual assault.
Wouldn't it be better for all, amid all the accusation and defense, amid the political contestation, to recognize that this does not address the trauma of sexual assault -- trauma that in many cases goes untreated for years. We can do better to make sure that new generations of women and men will not have to suffer in the same way. Part of that is to change a culture in which sexual assault is shrouded in secret shame.

Top Democrats unload on New York Times for covering Hunter Biden’s Ukraine activities

Texto completo: Some top Democratic strategists were less than impressed by the New York Times coverage of Joe Biden's possible involvement in a scheme to help his son Hunter in Ukraine.
The report, written by Kenneth Vogel, was partially in response to recent allegations by President Trump that Biden was involved in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that benefited his son and an energy company that was under investigation.
The newspaper and Vogel were both sharply criticized for their characterization of Biden and his son's involvement, citing the fact that no evidence has emerged that implicates any legal malfeasance on the part of either Biden. Trump seemed to be basing his allegations on a sound bite from a 2018 event in which Biden mentioned the ousted prosecutor.
Trump, who was accused of pressing the Ukrainian leader into investigating Joe Biden, has suggested that while he was vice president, Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion dollars in U.S. loan guarantees from Ukraine to ensure the prosecutor would be fired.
Vogel had promoted his most recent report by saying that there was "more to the story" about Joe and Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine, but upon publication there did not appear to be any new information that indicated guilt.
"It's turns out that the 'more to the story' that @kenvogel was touting on TV is that ... there is less to the story," said Ronald Klain, Biden's former chief of staff.
Tweet
"This story could have ended after the first paragraph- it finds Joe Biden did nothing wrong. End of story," said Neera Tanden, a top adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016. "Why the NYT can’t basically concede they’ve wasted a lot of ink on a story that has no there there, especially when Trump is using the smoke as a weapon, is beyond me."

Biden Family Business; What value does the former vice president's son add to overseas ventures?

Texto completo: Nobody is arguing that the Bidens are in the same league with the Clintons when it comes to monetizing political power. But somewhere along the campaign trail, former Vice President Joe Biden will need to provide a better explanation than he has to date for his family's business dealings—especially in countries where he was representing the United States.
A Journal editorial describes an inappropriate request by President Donald Trump to the president of Ukraine to investigate inappropriate Biden behavior which commenced in 2014. The editorial board notes:
As vice president, Mr. Biden threatened to withhold U.S. loan guarantees to a previous Ukraine government if a prosecutor investigating corruption wasn't fired. The prosecutor was investigating, among other things, a Ukrainian natural gas company that hired Hunter Biden, Joe's son, as a director and also retained Hunter's law firm. The prosecutor was fired.
Things worked out better for the gas company's American associate. The Journal's Allan Cullison reports, "According to one official with ties to the company, Hunter Biden's compensation was around $50,000 a month," and lasted until April of this year.
The Ukrainian gas company is called Burisma and it's still not entirely clear what they were getting for the millions of dollars they paid for Hunter Biden's services. In July the Washington Post's Michael Kranish and David Stern wrote that according to the fired Ukrainian prosecutor, "the appointment of Hunter Biden to the Burisma board was 'rather questionable' because he lacked relevant experience." Messrs. Kranish and Stern added:
The focus on Hunter Biden's business dealings... spotlighted how, for more than two decades, his professional work often tracked with his father's life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China.
It's hard to see what qualified Hunter Biden for the work other than political juice. Kenneth P. Vogel and Iuliia Mendel reported on the Ukraine dealings in the New York Times in May:
... Hunter Biden and his American business partners were part of a broad effort by Burisma to bring in well-connected Democrats during a period when the company was facing investigations backed not just by domestic Ukrainian forces but by officials in the Obama administration. Hunter Biden's work for Burisma prompted concerns among State Department officials at the time that the connection could complicate Vice President Biden's diplomacy in Ukraine, former officials said.
"I have had no role whatsoever in relation to any investigation of Burisma, or any of its officers," Hunter Biden said Wednesday in a statement. "I explicitly limited my role to focus on corporate governance best practices to facilitate Burisma's desire to expand globally.
It seems a stretch to claim that Hunter Biden was an expert on corporate governance, any more than he was an expert on natural gas or Ukraine. He had spent years as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C., helping various clients to secure earmarks in congressional appropriations bills.
On the question of what value he was adding to Burisma, one does not necessarily need to take the word of the prosecutor whose firing was demanded by Joe Biden. A separate New York Times report in May reported that Hunter Biden's sometime business partner Christopher Heinz, the stepson of John Kerry, didn't like the Ukraine work—or an investment deal involving Hunter Biden in China—because such deals created the appearance that political influence was being sold.
They sure did. And while the sums collected by Hunter Biden were not fully Clintonian, the former vice president's son seems to have benefited from doing business outside the United States. Given the different legal systems, Burisma probably had more leeway to hire a Biden than a U.S. company would have if it wanted to hire the son of a high-ranking official in a foreign government.
One question the former vice president needs to answer is why such offers were ever accepted.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump will use his address before the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday to "affirm America's leadership role," while pressing for a "collective response" to challenges on the world stage, said a senior administration official, offering a broad preview of the president's remarks.
Trump will return to New York on Sunday night, and kick off three days of diplomatic events starting Monday, when he is scheduled to headline a forum on religious freedom, according to the White House.
On Tuesday, the president is slated to address the annual summit of world leaders, where he is also expected to hold a series of one-on-one discussions on Tuesday and Wednesday with his counterparts from Egypt, India, Pakistan, South Korea, Poland, New Zealand, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.
The gathering comes as Trump continues to navigate a number of foreign policy challenges, including escalating tensions with Iran, failed peace talks with the Taliban, and stalled denuclearization discussions with North Korea.
Asked what message he planned to deliver at the upcoming summit, Trump told reporters on Friday: "We have a big message for UNGA. We have a big message."
Some issues that foreign policy experts say are likely to generate the most attention include the following:
Discussions on Iran
In the wake of an airstrike on Saudi oil fields that the United States has blamed on Iran, Trump administration officials and top-ranking U.N. officials alike have said the General Assembly gathering could provide the venue to cool down tensions in the Persian Gulf.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking to reporters at the UN's midtown Manhattan headquarters last Wednesday, said he was "absolutely sure" the Security Council, comprised of 15 member nations, would take up the issue of the attacks and the overall escalating tensions in the region.
"I don't think there is a more serious threat to peace and security in the world today than what's happening in the Gulf. This clearly is an area where I am absolutely sure the Security Council has a key role to play," Guterres said.
Iran has denied playing a role in the attacks, pointing to Yemen's Houthi rebel group, which has claimed responsibility for the strike. But Saudi officials and Trump administration officials contend the group, which is backed by Iran, could not execute such a high-level attack without assistance from Iran.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who met with Saudi leaders in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, days after the airstrike, told reporters he was "confident" that both the United States and Saudi Arabia would raise the issue of the strikes to the Security Council.
"We'd like a peaceful resolution, indeed, I think we've demonstrated that," Pompeo said.
Trump himself had floated the prospect of meeting one-on-one with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani in New York, but in the days leading up to the General Assembly, both sides backed away from the idea.
Officials in Tehran stated Iran would only engage in talks with nations that still belong to the Obama-era Iran Nuclear Deal, from which Trump withdrew last year, while Trump told reporters on Tuesday he would "prefer not" to meet with Rouhani on the sidelines of the UN summit.
Trump, who on Friday announced another wave of economic sanctions on Iran, told reporters he supported the idea of building a coalition with other allied nations to address Iran's latest provocations, before going on to tout the United States' nuclear capabilities.
"Well, I always like a coalition," Trump said. "So, we'll see what happens. Look, the United States is in a class by itself. We have the most powerful military in the world, by far. There's nobody close. As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully ... we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear."
A senior administration official, speaking to reporters on Friday, emphasized the administration's push for a "collective response."
"We welcome this opportunity to consult with a broad range of partners and allies on our collective response," the official said. "It's important to remember the attack on the Saudi infrastructure is really an attack on everyone who consumes their energy."
Trump's 'bilat' with Ukraine
White House officials on Friday said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be among the handful of world leaders with whom Trump will hold bilateral talks while at the UN.
Trump's one-on-one talk with Zelensky comes as the president's discussions with the recently elected Ukrainian leader have come under scrutiny, amid news reports that the discussions were the source of a whistleblower complaint filed by a U.S. intelligence official last month who was reportedly concerned by the nature of the discussions.
The official who filed the complaint was alarmed by a "promise" Trump allegedly made to a foreign leader, according to a recent Washington Post report, citing officials familiar with the complaint. The Post and the New York Times have reported that the complaint involved Ukraine, but little else is known about the complaint, which the acting Director of National Intelligence has refused to release to Congress as required by law.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the complaint involved an alleged request by Trump for Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, with a Ukrainian gas company. The former vice president is the frontrunner among Democrats looking to challenge Trump in next year's election.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has threatened to sue to force the release of the documents, and has argued the Trump administration's decision not to release the complaint to lawmakers is "unprecedented."
Asked about Trump's agenda for the meeting with Zelensky, a senior administration official said Friday that the president "is going to focus on again congratulating President Zelensky on his election victory and the incredible energy and success that Zelensky has put forward in implementing reform and anti-corruption efforts."
Trump's new hires
Trump's arrival at the UN summit comes days after his newly appointed UN Ambassador Kelly Knight Craft officially assumed her role, and days after Trump named former hostage negotiator Robert C. O'Brien his new national security adviser.
Craft, who previously served as Trump's ambassador to Canada, was tapped to replace former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, who stepped down last fall. Foreign policy experts note that Craft will likely not enjoy the same level of influence on U.S. foreign policy as Haley, who held the ambassador's post as a Cabinet-level position. Trump has since restructured the position so it no longer belongs to his Cabinet.
Senate Democrats previously raised concerns about Craft's lack of diplomatic experience during her Senate confirmation hearings, but the former Kentucky businesswoman and deep-pocketed Republican campaign donor repeatedly defended her credentials, saying her business acumen would prove an asset in the position.
Speaking to reporters at the UN on Wednesday, Craft said: "In a world marked by humanitarian crises and geopolitical challenges, strong American leadership is absolutely critical, and I intend to provide it."
Mary Ellen O'Connell, an international law professor at the University of Notre Dame, said O'Brien, a seasoned diplomat who once was tapped to be a part of the U.S. delegation to the General Assembly in 2005, would bring a level of experience that could help Trump hold "a more constructive attitude toward the UN."
Since taking office, the president has pulled the United States out of the UN's human rights council and withdrew the United States from the UN's arms treaty.
"There are so many significant issues on the UN agenda this year ... predicting what the Trump administration will do, however, is impossible given the president's leadership style and a new ambassador with little experience," O'Connell said.

Texto completo: A candid conversation between Karen Wickre and
Tess Vigeland about finding your own way to bypass the glass ceiling.
Karen Wickre
Karen Wickre has been called "the best-connected Silicon Valley figure you've never heard of." She has worked for 30 years in technology as a writer, editor, and communications pro. In addition to working at many startups and tech publications, she both thrived in and survived long stints at Google, which she joined at age 51, and Twitter, which she joined 10 years later (find her @kvox). Apart from her day jobs, Karen's life-long avocation is connecting people, and enjoying the fruits of her own lively and large web of friends and allies. She wrote "Taking the Work Out of Networking" in 2018 to help others with the persistent challenge of making connections that count. Karen has also written for Wired and Medium, and has been a guest on many podcasts. The opposite of someone who "works the room," don't look for Karen at late-night parties or at showy conferences; she's more likely to be connecting with friends and strangers from the comfort of her laptop. She lives in San Francisco, where she collects art, takes power walks and has too many books.
Tess Vigeland
Tess Vigeland is a veteran journalist and a well-known voice to millions of American radio listeners. Vigeland spent 11 years as an anchor and reporter for public radio's "Marketplace." She also anchored NPR's "Weekend All Things Considered." She is the recipient of multiple national journalism awards, including the 2019 Gracie Award for Best Host/Anchor, and the 2019 Edward R. Murrow Award for Continuing Coverage, both earned for her work reporting on the aftermath of the Camp Fire that destroyed the city of Paradise, California. Vigeland has been a contributing writer to the New York Times, the Guardian, among other national and international publications. She is a public speaker and emcee, and the author of "LEAP: Leaving a Job With No Plan B to Find the Career and Life You Really Want," published by Penguin Random House. In August 2018, Vigeland repatriated to the United States after nearly three years living abroad and traveling solo to 20 countries throughout Asia and the Middle East.

Springsteen is still telling stories – but now he's exploring new creative formats

Texto completo: Bruce Springsteen has a story to tell.
That's one aspect of a young Springsteen that former manager Carl "Tinker" West noticed early on.
"He's a good storyteller," said West, who's also a giant in the surfing world thanks to his founding of Challenger Eastern Surfboards in Ocean Township. "Vini (Lopez of the future E Street Band) brought him over to the shop (in Ocean Township). He was a smart kid, sort of quiet and he wrote songs. I said, 'You just keep writing something, you guys rehearse — work here all day, make surfboards and rock 'n' roll.'"
That was the plan. It worked.
Springsteen has sold millions of records, plays to stadiums around the world, is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, all for his rock 'n' rolling.
Now as Springsteen turns 70 on Monday, he's in an era of new artistic pursuits, new creative formats. The latest is the movie "Western Stars," a filmed version of his latest album. He co-directed "Western Stars" with frequent collaborator Thom Zimny. The film features a performance of the folk-rock orchestral album, and vignettes starring a solo Springsteen.
The film follows the hit "Springsteen on Broadway," which featured the Boss baring his life story, set to song and remembrance. "Springsteen on Broadway" ran from October 2017 to December 2018.
The music play was based on his New York Times best-selling memoir "Born to Run," which was released in September 2016. Springsteen did a nine-city book tour, where he greeted thousands of fans in person for hours at a stretch in a feat of physical and mental stamina.
The Boss stood on a platform, under lights, while he met fans.
Cindy Marselis of Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, was in tears after meeting Springsteen at the Freehold Barnes and Noble signing on Sept. 27, 2016.
"I met the person I always wanted to meet," said Marselis, at the signing. "I got to kiss him. It was awesome."
Springsteen is still telling stories, and still on stage. But now he's exploring new formats for the stories, and the stories he's telling are largely his own these days.
"I think he's said this before, but he truly envisions himself as an artist and I feel that all of these projects are in service of him wanting to tap into all of the different facets of who he is," said Caroline Madden, 26, of Toms River.
Madden is set to release a book on Springsteen's music in films and TV, "Springsteen as Soundtrack: The Sound of the Boss in Film and Television," from McFarland & Co. "That's why he's so unique and has endured as an artist for so long – he doesn't settle. He's always looking to renew himself or try something new."
West saw that creative energy up close when Springsteen fronted the band Steel Mill, which West managed and did sound for.
"I liked Springsteen because those guys would go in the back of the shop and they would rehearse," West said. "Vini Lopez, Danny Federici, they would write lots of music and whenever we'd get a couple of songs together that were pretty good, we'd go and try it out at Pandemonium, right at the bottom of Sunset Avenue."
The club was less than a mile from West's surfboard factory.
"What changes his music is that he wants to write something different," West said. "He writes some great stories. Stories to me are what makes great music, especially the early stuff. The first two albums ('Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.' and 'The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle'), people are still asking for those songs. Even so, he's written a lot of stuff after that's pretty damn good."
West and Springsteen's enduring friendship is explored in the book "Born to Run" and, subsequently in "Springsteen on Broadway." A highlight of the play is West, Springsteen and West's dog driving out west in West's 1950 Chevy flat-bed truck to play a concert and meet music industry contacts.
Springsteen didn't know how to drive until he drove the Chevy truck with West in the passenger seat. West still owns the truck.
"He knew what he wanted to do, I'm pretty sure," said West of Springsteen's artistic drive. "He wanted to wow an audience and he did. He had a great band. Federici was great. Lopez was great. Little Vinnie Roslin was great."
West used his connections and hustle to get a deal with Paramount Records.
"I finally found a deal that wouldn't screw him over," West said. "Then he said 'I don't want to do Steel Mill anymore.' (I said) That's up to you."
"I introduced him to Mike Appel. He introduced him to John Hammond and the rest is history," said West of Springsteen's subsequent manager and the of the famed Columbia Records talent scout. .
The stories Springsteen has been telling in recent years are stark, revealing and confessional.
"For a long time, if I loved you or if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could," says Springsteen in "Western Stars."
He talked without censor of his troubled relationship with his father in "Springsteen on Broadway" and has been candid about his struggles with mental illness.
"I have come close enough to (mental illness) where I know I am not completely well myself," Springsteen previously told Esquire. "I've had to deal with a lot of it over the years, and I'm on a variety of medications that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically and ... just ... the wheels can come off a little bit. So we have to watch, in our family. I have to watch my kids, and I've been lucky there. It ran in my family going way before my dad."
Springsteen is married to Patti Scialfa and they have three children, Evan, 29; Jessica, 27; and Sam, 25.
Springsteen's non-rock 'n' roll work of the past few years has also framed the aging process for fans. He's showing the way to baby boomers about what to do, how to do it, and what's important in life when you get to a certain age.
The fans of his generation might have looked to John Lennon for the answers, but he didn't get to grow old like Springsteen. Lennon would have been 78 if he were still alive.
"Aging is scary but fascinating, and great talent morphs in strange and often enlightening ways," said Springsteen in "Born to Run."
There no official events planned to recognize Springsteen's 70th birthday, but area venues do have Boss-themed shows, including the Brian Kirk and the Jirk's-led "Born: Celebrating the Boss' 70th" at the Count Basie Center in Red Bank on Wednesday, Sept. 25, and Thursday, Sept. 26. Visit thebasie.org for more info and tickets.
"Springsteen: His Hometown," an exhibit presented by the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, opens Sunday, Sept. 29, at the historical association in Freehold.
Ticket information is at www.SpringsteenHisHometown.com.
Preview showings of "Western Stars" are scheduled for Oct. 19 and 23 in area movie theaters. Visit www.fathomevents.com for more info and tickets.
As for the E Street Band, Springsteen ain't done yet, despite the success he's had with his new avenues of artistic expression.
"We want the band to get back together," said Springsteen to applause on Sept. 12 at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I've got some songs written for the band and I'd like to make a really good rock band record with the E Street Band.
"We'll be seeing you."
Chris Jordan, a Jersey Shore native, covers entertainment and features for the USA Today Network New Jersey. His multiple awards include recognition for stories on both Bruce Springsteen and Snooki. Contact him at @chrisfhjordan; cjordan@app.com.
"(Bruce Springsteen) writes some great stories. Stories to me are what makes great music," says former Boss manager Carl "Tinker" West.

Texto completo: I'VE BEEN IN Old Crow for a week, and one of the first things people ask each other about is the caribou. Have you seen any upriver? Where? Bulls or cows? Moving in what direction?
Old Crow is 80 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Canada's Yukon, in the homelands of the Vuntut Gwitchin, one of a string of Indigenous Gwich'in villages stretching from the Northwest Territories to Alaska. People here have made their lives alongside migrating caribou since the end of the last ice age. In late August, we're waiting for the herd of some 170,000 animals to leave their summer birthing grounds in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and head southeast, where they spend each winter.
In 2017, the Trump Administration announced plans to sell oil leases in ANWR. Exploration and drilling is widely accepted by environmental groups and by the Gwich'in as a threat to the Porcupine caribou herd and the ecosystem upon which they depend. But the income from the sales, which the White House estimated at $1.8 billion over a decade, was supposed to be a revenue generator in the wake of the 2017 Republican tax bill. Caribou lives would, indirectly, pay for a plan unusually beneficial to the wealthiest Americans.
But on Aug. 21, the New York Times reported that Trump's estimates of ANWR revenue were wildly inflated: the Times analysis estimated the number at just $45 million over a decade. A day later, this too was part of the news we shared in Old Crow.
Few people I've talked to here are surprised. Outside the Arctic, jiggering numbers and suppressing scientific reports to promote drilling in ANWR is completely in line with an administration rarely encumbered by empirical fact when fiction is more politically expedient. But in the Arctic, it's resonant with a much longer history, one in which misrepresenting the true profits — and costs — of resource use is terribly familiar.
Take the first Arctic oil boom. In the middle of the nineteenth century, this rush was not for petroleum, but whale oil. Commercial hunters from New England killed bowhead whales along the Bering Strait and east into the Beaufort Sea, just a hundred miles or so north of Old Crow. Each ship was financed by investors in New Bedford and Nantucket, rich men who took the largest share of any profit. Industry boosters buoyed investment with reports of new whaling “grounds," despite voyages that grew longer and more hazardous year by year, as whales were hunted to scarcity. For this dangerous work, sailors earned only a small portion of the profit.
The costs of whaling, meanwhile, remained hidden to whale-oil investors and consumers alike, but were very clear in the Arctic. Yupik and Iñupiaq villages along the Alaska coast, where people were as dependent on bowheads as the Gwich'in are on caribou, saw no revenue from commercial whaling. None of the money made from the whales that supported their societies stayed in the north. Instead, their communities were left, after 50 years and the deaths of nearly 20,000 bowheads, with empty seas and starvation. This was the price for mansions in New Bedford.
Or there is the gold rush. Newspapers across the world ran breathless reports of men becoming millionaires in a lucky afternoon a few hundred miles south of Old Crow, at the confluence of the Yukon and Klondike Rivers, alongside ads for mining equipment and transport companies headed north. Tens of thousands of men — and they were mostly men — bought those companies' tickets on the promise of making a fortune by panning gold.
For most, the rush was a bust, the profits flowing not to individuals but to corporations able to finance heavy equipment, companies who, like whaling investors, took their profits far from the Yukon. And money went to men like Donald Trump's grandfather Frederick, who made part of his North American fortune operating a brothel and saloon in the Yukon goldfields. Soothing the dashed hopes of miners was, for most, more profitable than mining itself.
And the cost? Besides ruined finances and deaths of prospectors, gold mining left the area around Dawson City scarred with toxic mine tailings, rerouted streams, and hillsides stripped of trees and weeping soil into rivers. These rivers, already disrupted to their beds by pans and dredges, became less a shelter to salmon and the other fish critical to the Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in, the Indigenous people of the Klondike valley, displaced and dispossessed of their land by the influx of prospectors. Rivers and the people who lived on them were, indirectly, paying for wealth accumulated far away.
Gwich'in communities in Canada and the United States have spent decades trying to keep this history from repeating, to stop siphoning away the wealth in Alaskan oil and leaving the scarred earth and pollution that comes with industrial development. Gwich'in delegates regularly visit Congress to explain the importance of caribou in their lives and of ANWR to the global environment. On Sept. 12, their efforts yielded the passage of a House bill that would prohibit drilling on the coastal plain, an area “so special, so wild, so spectacular," Representative Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, stated, it has “to be off limits to being spoiled by oil and gas development." But now, the issue goes to the Senate, where a bill seems unlikely to garner the necessary support. Meanwhile, the Trump administration moves forward, releasing a report on the envionmental impact of the oil leases.
I have lived in and visited Old Crow for 20 years now. It is both unthinkable and terribly possible that there might be a late August when I visit and there are no caribou to ask after. Unthinkable, because caribou are central to so much in Old Crow. Terribly possible, because Trump's inflated claims about ANWR are of a piece with the history of resource extraction in the Arctic, one replete with lies about potential profits and blindness to real costs. At the core of this history is theft: of land from the Arctic's Indigenous peoples, and wealth from its ecosystems, in the form of whales or clear rivers. But as the Senate prepares to vote on opening leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we still have the option to see the real cost — and the option to not be thieves.

'NO-DEAL' BREXIT A CATASTROPHE FOR TRAVELERS, EXPERTS WARN

Texto completo: Food shortages. Inadequate medical supplies. Civil unrest and road blockades. Lack of fuel. Delays at the border.
That's the potential aftermath of a "no-deal" Brexit, as detailed by the U.K. government in an official document released Sept. 11.
It's a scenario that travelers from around the world could be flying into if current plans to crash out of the European Union are followed through.
That's enough to scare off Stephen Pickett, of Toronto.
"Why would I put myself out to go and get caught up in something?" he said. "This isn't something I want to put myself through."
Mr. Pickett, 47, brought forward a planned November visit to October to avoid potential disruption. And he has put plans for further visits, as well as a move to London in December, on hold.
The U.K. is, for now, set to leave the E.U. at 11 p.m. Oct. 31.
And while British nationals are concerned about how it'll affect their travel plans, travelers scheduled to fly into the U.K. have more pressing concerns.
Across six pages, the government document, nicknamed Operation Yellowhammer, details the potential on-the-ground outcome of a no-deal Brexit.
The U.K. government - which was forced by Parliament to release the document after it was leaked - insists Yellowhammer is a "reasonable worst-case" scenario. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, however, has said that the Scottish government was told the document was a "base scenario."
What's more, an industry expert has said that in terms of travel, Yellowhammer looks "surprisingly optimistic" - and that in the event of a no-deal, people could be waiting in border queues between the U.K. and the E.U. for days on end.
'Significant disruption'
Yellowhammer predicts "significant disruption lasting up to six months" for Channel crossings affecting food and medical supplies.
"Certain types of fresh food supply will decrease," it warns. Veterinary supplies may be interrupted, threatening outbreaks of disease among livestock, which could also affect the food chain.
Fuel supplies in London and southeast England would be disrupted, and that could domino into shortages across the country.
It also warns of a "rise in public disorder," "protests and counter-protests," and road blockages.
"There's a lot more stability in Canada, so as much as London is great, why dip my toe into something when I don't know what'll happen?" Mr. Pickett said.
Although he married a British woman in August and was looking to move to London at the end of the year, that's now on hold.
He and his wife, Elizabeth, are looking into whether it's easier for her to move to Canada, while he brought his trip forward by a month.
Mr. Pickett isn't alone. Grania O'Hare, who works for a tech company in Dublin and travels regularly to the U.K., is due to fly to Yorkshire in November - a trip booked before the Brexit date was set.
"There's definitely some slight trepidation, but we're flying into a regional airport," Ms. O'Hare said. "If we were flying into Heathrow, I'd be terrified."
The bright side for Ms. O'Hare? If Operation Yellowhammer becomes reality, the pound will likely plummet in value.
"I'll probably be hitting the duty free at the airport," she said. The U.K.'s finance minister recently announced that duty-free purchases like alcohol and cigarettes would be re-introduced post-Brexit for travelers heading to Europe.
Border queues 'could last days'
Travelers should be less worried about riots and food shortages, but they should have serious concerns about crossing between the U.K. and E.U. countries, says Tom Jenkins, CEO of ETOA, a trade association for tour operators in European destinations.
Mr. Jenkins thinks a no-deal is unlikely - lawmakers have voted to make it illegal, so leaving without a deal would require Prime Minister Boris Johnson to break the law.
But if it does go ahead, he reckons the border chaos outlined in Yellowhammer would be "surprisingly optimistic."
Guidance issued by the European Commission last November says Brits entering Europe's 26-nation Schengen Area will be treated as "third country nationals" - the same as those from other continents.
"If you're arriving at Berlin Tegel [airport] on a flight from the U.K., there might be two immigration lanes per aircraft: one for E.U. citizens, one for non-E.U. citizens," Mr. Jenkins said.
"After a no-deal Brexit, the non-E.U. citizen line could be 200 strong. That's a wait of three hours," he added. "If you have five planes arriving at the same time, you've got huge problems.
"In Spain, where you have U.K. flights full of Brits landing every five minutes, it'll be something spectacular."
And while the delays won't affect E.U. nationals, who can still use the fast-track lanes, citizens of other countries will be caught in the chaos.
"We're talking hours and hours in each airport for non-E.U. citizens," he said. "That isn't a worst-case scenario - it's a plausible worst case. ... The real worst-case scenario is 24 hours of delay building up in the first 24 hours."
From there, he says it could spiral to "days-long" waits at the border.
Not everyone is so concerned. Tom Marchant, co-founder of luxury travel company Black Tomato, says the tanking pound is proving popular with overseas clients this year.
Jack Ezon is founder of Embark Beyond Travel, a member of global travel agency network Virtuoso. His clients will carry on visiting London, Brexit or not, because, he says, it's a business destination.
With just one exception.
"If there are riots in the streets, I'm sure you'll see an immediate drop-off."
Figures released by Visit Britain show that flight bookings to the U.K. from September to November are up 5% overall year on year.
But Tom Jenkins, who works with tour operators from around the world, says global markets frighten easier than Americans.
And although he thinks that shortages of food, medicine and fuel will affect visitors far less than residents, he says it's bad optics.
"Food shortages and delays at the border don't make the U.K. seem a good place to go.
"No-deal would be a straightforward catastrophe."

For Older Patients, Long-term Care Hospitals Offer Continuing Care

Texto completo: The Hospital for Special Care in New Britain, Connecticut, had 10 patients in its close observation unit on a recent afternoon. Visitors could hear the steady ping of pulse monitors and the hum of ventilators.
The hospital carefully designed these curtained cubicles to include windows, so that patients can distinguish day from night. It also placed soothing artwork - ocean scenes and landscapes - on the ceilings for those who can’t turn over and look outside.
All these patients had undergone a tracheostomy - a surgical opening in the windpipe to accommodate a breathing tube attached to a ventilator - when they arrived from a standard acute-care hospital. Some had since been weaned from the ventilators, at least for part of the day.
The facility is called an LTCH, a long-term care hospital (also known as a long-term acute care hospital). It’s where patients often land when an ordinary hospital is ready to discharge them, often after a stay in intensive care. But these patients are still too sick to go home, too sick even for most nursing homes.
“It’s truly a hidden segment, even to most people in health care,” said Dr. Anil Makam, a hospitalist and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.
Take the man in his 60s slowly making his way down the hallway, supported by a large wheeled apparatus that had also lifted him out of bed. Two physical therapists and two aides accompanied him. He had been in the nonprofit Hospital for Special Care for about a month, on top of 30 days in a standard hospital, trying to recover from a brain hemorrhage and spinal cord injuries after a fall down the stairs in his home.
He had finally come off the ventilator the week before, although he might need it again. “Setbacks are very common,” said Dr. John Votto, a pulmonologist and former chief executive of the hospital, watching the patient’s progress.
In one cubicle lay a woman with severe emphysema who had endured six hospitalizations in five months. “She’s off the vent, but she’s very tenuous, in and out, in and out,” Votto said. She hadn’t been home since January.
Close to 400 such hospitals operate around the country, some free-standing, others within other hospitals, most for-profit. They provide daily physician visits, high nurse-to-patient ratios and intensive therapy.
In 2017, they accounted for about 174,000 hospital stays. Medicare covered about two-thirds of them, at a staggering cost of $4.5 billion, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission has reported.
Dismal odds
Yet the odds look dismal for older adults who enter an LTCH, Makam and his colleagues reported in a recent study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.
Sampling 5% of Medicare data, they identified more than 14,000 patients who had been transferred to such hospitals and tracked them for five years, from 2009 through 2013. Most had not needed mechanical ventilation. Only 45% of Medicare patients were alive a year after admission, the study found; fewer than 1 in 5 survived for five years.
The researchers defined “recovery” as logging 60 consecutive days without entering a hospital or nursing home - “a pretty low bar,” Makam said. But over five years, more than half of Medicare patients in an LTCH never reached it.
Moreover, “true recovery rates - getting back to thinking clearly and functioning well - may be lower,” Makam said.
In fact, despite the prevalence of aggressive, life-prolonging procedures like feeding tubes, ventilators and dialysis, LTCH patients spent two-thirds of their remaining lives (the median survival period was 8.3 months) in institutions, including hospitals, skilled nursing homes and rehab facilities.
“A little over a third of people never make it home,” Makam said. “They go back and forth between the LTCH and hospitals and nursing facilities, and they die in one of them.”
Younger patients in their 60s and those admitted with musculoskeletal diagnoses, like complications from a hip fracture or joint replacement, fared better. But 41% of this population was 80 or older, and “the older old do exceptionally poorly,” Makam said.
‘Afterworld’ of care
A few years back, Dr. Daniela Lamas, a critical care specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, found herself wondering about what she calls “this afterworld,” one she knew little about.
At an LTCH, she interviewed 50 patients, with an average age of 63, who had undergone tracheostomies, or family surrogates (when patients couldn’t communicate), asking not-very-medical questions about goals, fears and understandings.
Patients described their quality of life as poor, complaining of hunger, thirst, difficulty communicating. “People were bored,” Lamas said. “They couldn’t move. There was a deeper sense of being alone, feeling trapped.” Their families felt anxious and stressed.
Most patients expressed optimism about returning to their former lives, and hadn’t talked with their LTCH doctors about what would happen if they encountered setbacks.
But when discharged, only 20% went home; most moved to nursing homes or returned to acute-care hospitals. Just 38% were at home after a year; 30% had died.
“When we put people through things with a goal that’s not achievable, that allows people to suffer without a purpose,” Lamas said. “There are ways to allow people to keep their hopes but also face reality.”
Once a growing sector
Once, the LTCH was among the fastest-growing sectors of the health care industry. Their numbers jumped from 97 hospitals in 1992 to 388 in 2005, “a period of explosive growth spurred by overpayment and inappropriate admissions,” the advisory commission said.
Medicare responded with moratoriums on new facilities and stricter patient criteria for reimbursement. The growth of Medicare Advantage plans, less likely to reimburse for LTCH care, has also hurt revenues.
As a result, more of these hospitals have shut down than opened in recent years, and the National Association of Long Term Hospitals expects further closings.
“Some people may change directions and choose hospice care instead,” Makam said. But compared with patients in the general Medicare population, far fewer LTCH patients enroll in hospice, although many would qualify as terminally ill.
“It’s easy for this move to be like a train you get on until it stops,” Lamas said of LTCH stays. “But the doors can open at any point.”
She urged patients and families to arrange for periodic re-evaluations: “At four weeks or eight weeks, where do we hope we are? We can reassess.”
Votto, also chief medical officer of the industry association, endorsed that idea. “You’re at a level of illness where there’s not a lot of good outcomes, no matter what,” he said.
But, he added: “Most people don’t look at the percentages. They say, ‘Maybe I’ll be one of the 20%’ ” who leave an LTCH and go home.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa — Former Vice President Joe Biden said Saturday he hasn't spoken to his son Hunter Biden about his overseas businesses while forcefully calling again for an investigation into President Donald Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president.
“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Biden said. “Here’s what I know. Trump should be investigated. ”
“You should be looking at Trump," Biden told reporters in Des Moines shortly after arriving at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual Democratic fundraiser. “He’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum. And he’s using an abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to smear me . . . Ask the right questions. ”
Previously: Joe Biden: Trump's reported effort to get Ukraine president to investigate him 'abhorrent'
The comments by the former vice president are the latest in a back-and-forth between Biden and Trump related to Trump's reported discussions with the Ukrainian president, a whistleblower complaint involving Trump and Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.
Multiple news outlets reported this week that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the inspector general overseeing that community concerning a phone call Trump made with a foreign leader.
Lawmakers are separately investigating whether Trump pushed for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country.
Hunter Biden, however, told the New Yorker in an interview for an article published in July that he discussed Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas producer, with his father in December 2015. At the time, Hunter Biden sat on Burisma‘s board of directors.
Around the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue with the Vice President, according to the article. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker he and his father spoke about Burisma just once.
“‘Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you’re doing,” and I said, ‘I do,’ ” the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article.
The Biden campaign declined to comment on the reported December 2015 conversation.
Before Biden's comments, Trump fired off several tweets Saturday morning, defending himself and his phone call with Zelensky as a "fine and routine conversation. "
"Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster," Trump tweeted.
Biden briefly addressed supporters at a pre-steak fry rally Saturday and warned that Trump would try to murky the waters as the election cycle heats up.
“Be prepared for every lousy thing coming from him,” Biden said.
What has happened already
The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions that Biden, as vice president, pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma.
But Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
“Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws — at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,” Lutsenko told Bloomberg. “A company can pay however much it wants to its board. ”
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and work with his personal attorney, Giuliani, on the matter.
Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn’t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president in March 2016 called on Ukraine’s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times. Shokin was voted out by parliament, but no evidence showing Biden intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced.
Still, Trump in a May interview on Fox News suggested Biden engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine's government.
“Look at Joe Biden … he calls them [Ukrainian government leaders] and says, 'Don’t you dare prosecute,'" Trump said in the interview. "'If you don’t fire this prosecutor’ — the prosecutor was after his son — then he said, ‘If you fire the prosecutor, you’ll be OK. And if you don’t fire the prosecutor, we’re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,’ or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?"

Texto completo: The account was one of thousands with ties to governments in the Middle East that were taken down by the social media company.
Twitter said on Friday that it had removed or suspended thousands of accounts with ties to governments in the Middle East, including the account of Saud el-Qahtani, a former close adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.
Twitter said it suspended Mr. Qahtani's account because of "violations of our platform manipulation policies." The company declined to provide more details, but said in a blog post that it took down 5,000 other accounts for what it described as inauthentic behavior or spamming.
Mr. Qahtani has been linked to the murder of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. He had been described as a close friend and adviser of Prince Mohammed, but Saudi state media reported several weeks after Mr. Khashoggi's death that he had been dismissed from his post.
Before it was suspended, Mr. Qahtani's Twitter account had 1.3 million followers. But the account had largely gone silent after Mr. Khashoggi's death last year.
Mr. Qahtani's suspension may have meant Twitter found evidence that the former Saudi adviser was directing an operation aimed at critics of the kingdom's leaders, said Alex Stamos, director of Stanford University's Internet Observatory and the former chief security officer for Facebook.
The New York Times reported in October that hundreds of people worked at a so-called troll farm in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Mr. Qahtani was the strategist behind the operation, according to United States and Saudi officials, as well as activist organizations.
A spokesman for the Saudi Arabian embassy in the United States did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Friday, Facebook also announced that it took down 65 Facebook accounts and 35 Instagram accounts that were part of a network involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior in Spain.
"We will continue reviewing activity on our platforms and if we find any violating coordinated inauthentic behavior we will take action and share it publicly," said Rita Zolotova, a Facebook spokeswoman.
Facebook said its investigation benefited from information shared by Twitter.
"What we've seen is coordinated takedowns from Facebook and Twitter because of sharing information with each other," Mr. Stamos said.
Twitter said it was also suspending six accounts with connections to Saudi state media that "presented themselves as independent journalistic outlets while tweeting narratives favorable to the Saudi government."
In addition, Twitter suspended a separate network of 267 accounts connected to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The accounts were operated by a private company called DotDev, and the information operation focused on Qatar and Iran, according to Twitter.
The social media company said it suspended 4,258 inauthentic accounts operating from the U.A.E. that tweeted about subjects like the Yemeni civil war, 259 accounts connected to a political party in Spain and that falsely bolstered public sentiment and 1,019 accounts in Ecuador with links to a local political party that amplified tweets and hashtags about President Lenín Moreno's administration.
Last month, Twitter revealed details about a state-sponsored coordinated disinformation campaign from China. It also suspended 200,000 other accounts that it said were connected to the Chinese operation but not yet very active. Facebook and YouTube quickly followed suit. All three platforms are blocked in mainland China but not in Hong Kong.
Twitter has released detailed, archived information about the accounts it has been taking down. It is the only company among major tech outfits "sharing this kind of data," said Nick Monaco, a researcher who studies disinformation at the Digital Intelligence Lab at the Institute for the Future. "This disclosure helps the public to gain a better understanding of how online disinformation is evolving."

DETAILS EMERGE ABOUT LATE ABORTION DOCTOR WHO HOARDED FETAL REMAINS: The abortion doctor who stashed more than 2,245 fetal remains in his garage also hoarded personal property throughout his home in Crete, Illinois, leading to a weeklong investigation by police who remain bewildered about his motives.
Officials from Will County, Illinois, are transferring the investigation into Dr. Ulrich "George" Klopfer to Indiana, where Klopfer used to perform abortions before he lost his medical license roughly three years before his death. Klopfer died Sept. 3 at age 75, and the coroner, Patrick O'Neil, would say only that he appears to have died of natural causes.
One of the Indiana clinics where Klopfer practiced for decades was in South Bend. Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend since 2012 and a 2020 Democratic candidate said Wednesday: "There’s no question that what happened is disturbing. It’s unacceptable." Vice President Mike Pence, who used to be Indiana's governor, tweeted that Klopfer's “actions should be fully and thoroughly investigated."
Kevin Bolger, the attorney representing Klopfer's wife, Sherry, told the Washington Examiner that the garage where the remains were discovered was so full of personal belongings that people couldn't open the door to walk into it. The rest of the house was similar.
"He was a hoarder and the house was floor to ceiling piled with garbage and boxes, old TVs, typewriters, and computers, you name it ... You can barely walk down the hallways in the home," Bolger said.
Police confirmed Thursday at a press conference that they had not found fetal remains elsewhere in the house or on the property. They also did not find evidence that Klopfer performed abortions at his home.
The findings in Illinois have bolstered abortion foes nationwide who call for tighter restrictions and oversight on the procedure. It has also edged into the 2020 presidential election because one of Klopfer's clinics that was shut down by authorities was in Buttigieg's hometown.
When Pence was Indiana's governor he signed a bill into law that mandated abortion clinics bury or cremate fetal remains. The law wasn't in effect when Klopfer practiced because it was being contested in court, but the Supreme Court upheld the law earlier this year and the latest discovery at Klopfer's home could strengthen the push for similar legislation in other states.

TRUMP GIVES SHOUT-OUT TO PELOSI DRUG PRICE BILL: The president tweeted Thursday that it was "great to see" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveil a bill to lower drug prices, but that he liked another bill that had advanced in the Senate "very much."
Screen Shot 2019-09-20 at 10.55.12 AM.png
Sen. Chuck Grassley tweeted Thursday afternoon that he met with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar about the bill, but it's not yet clear whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will bring it to the full floor for a vote.
FDA SETS RULES FOR E-CIGARETTES TO GET APPROVED: The Food and Drug Administration on Friday released guidance about what e-cigarette manufacturers would need to demonstrate when they apply for review with the agency. They will need to provide all of their ingredients, to show that people who aren’t current vapers, including kids, wouldn’t take it up, and to show that former smokers would stop using combustible cigarettes. In the weeks ahead the FDA is going to release its plan to take flavored e-cigarettes off the market.
VAPING-RELATED LUNG INJURIES RISE: The number of cases of lung injuries confirmed as or deemed probably associated with vaping both nicotine and THC have risen from 380 to 530 as of Sept. 17. Dr. Jennifer Layden, chief medical officer and state epidemiologist of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said the number of cases in Illinois alone have risen to 69 this week from 54 in previous weeks.
“Not one product or one substance seen in all cases,” said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. “We need to see what common threads emerge during product analysis.”
FDA laboratories are looking at 150 samples from different patients, an increase from 120 samples. Researchers have recently found vitamin E acetate in samples. Zeller declined to add what else researchers have found that could be poisonous.
“This is an ongoing outbreak, not something we can consider completed,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Principal deputy director Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters. “There continue to be people with new symptoms onset.”
MAJOR MEDIA CONGLOMERATES PULL ADS FROM E-CIGARETTE MAKERS: CBS, WarnerMedia, and Viacom have all decided to drop the ads from Juul and other companies in the e-cigarette industry. WarnerMedia, the parent company of CNN, is removing the ad spots from their entire portfolio of networks, including TNT and TBS, because of recent warnings from the Centers for Disease Control, the American Medical Association, and the American Lung Association. CNN said last week it would end advertisements from Juul and other e-cigarette companies.
A spokesperson for Viacom, which owns MTV, CMT, BET, and Nickelodeon, said the media company decided to cease airing e-cigarette ads immediately “after reviewing the recent reports regarding the potentially serious health threats posed” by the products.
BUTTIGIEG CALLS WARREN ‘EVASIVE’ ON MEDICARE FOR ALL: Buttigieg went after fellow contender Elizabeth Warren for being “extremely evasive” about how she’d finance her “Medicare for all” plan.
On the Late Night with Stephen Colbert Wednesday, Warren explained her plan and claimed it would provide savings for families, but stopped short of answering Colbert’s question of whether taxes on the middle class would increase.
"Why you wouldn't just say so and then explain why you think that's the better way forward?" Buttigieg asked, noting that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has acknowledged that his Medicare for All Act would raise taxes across the board. "Look, people are used to Washington politicians not giving straight answers to simple questions."
ALABAMA GOVERNOR REVEALS SHE HAS LUNG CANCER: Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a 74-year-old Republican, announced Thursday that her doctor found a “tiny, isolated malignancy” on her lung. Ivey said her doctors have assured her that treatment will most likely be successful. Outpatient treatment begins Friday. Ivey said: “None of this will prevent me from continuing to serve as your governor and doing the work you elected me to do.”
COSMETIC SURGEONS SAY THERE’S NO QUESTION BIDEN GOT A FACE LIFT: Cosmetics surgeons say Joe Biden definitely underwent a face lift. Large vertical scars beginning at the top of the outside of Biden's ear canal to roughly a half inch below the lobe can be seen on both sides of his face, indicative of a facelift carried out before he launched his 2020 presidential campaign, according to leading cosmetic surgeons. "Oh he's had a facelift, there's no question," said leading New York-based cosmetic surgeon Dr. Arthur Perry, who is also an associate adjunct professor at Columbia Medical School. Perry described the size of Biden's incisions as "incredible" and "fairly recent."
LISTERIA IS RAVAGING SPAIN WITH 222 CONFIRMED CASES: The bacterial infection listeria has hit Spain hard, primarily in the southern region of Andalucía. Of the 222 confirmed cases, three elderly Spaniards have died and six women have endured miscarriages related to the illness. The outbreak is blamed on a brand of carne mechada, shredded beef marketed and sold in Spain.

Marc Thiessen: The smearing of Brett Kavanaugh continues

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — A Columbia Journalism Review poll released this year found that half of all Americans have “hardly any confidence at all” in the media, which beat out even Congress as the institution for which the public has the lowest confidence. It’s not hard to see why. Last week, CNN reported that the CIA was forced to pull a highly placed source inside the Kremlin because of concerns that President Trump might burn him — when it turns out the decision to extract the source was made before Trump took office because of leaks from senior Obama administration officials.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" />
Now, The New York Times has published an adapted excerpt from a new book by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly in which they breathlessly describe a “previously unreported story” about how Max Stier, a male college classmate of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, notified senators and the FBI that he saw Kavanaugh expose himself to a girl at a Yale party and that “friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.”
One small problem: In the book, Pogrebin and Kelly write that the female student in question “refused to discuss the incident” and that “several of her friends said she does not recall it.” That calls the entire allegation into question. Yet the Times did not include this vital information in the excerpt it published.
Pogrebin and Kelly conveniently blamed their editors for the omission. Why didn’t they insist it be included when they reviewed the story before publication? And how then do they explain the fact that they also failed to mention it in an interview with NPR? When asked by Terry Gross the specific question “Are there other women who have come forward?” (emphasis added), they repeat their uncorroborated accusation without mentioning that this “other woman” not only did not come forward but also does not recall the incident.
The Times was later shamed into appending an editors’ note to the story saying “the book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.” Too little, too late. This is simply journalistic malpractice. Indeed, if prosecutors in a court of law were to do what the Times did — fail to disclose evidence that goes toward negating a defendant’s guilt — they could have their case thrown out and face potential disbarment for prosecutorial misconduct. But apparently in the court of public opinion, anything goes.
That’s not all. In their article, the reporters innocuously describe Stier as someone “who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington.” They fail to share with readers in the story the fact that Stier was a member of Bill Clinton’s legal team at the same time that Kavanaugh was working for independent counsel Kenneth Starr on the other side of the Monica Lewinsky investigation. That seems relevant information that could call his motives into question.
Amazingly, the Times story leaves out the one truly newsworthy revelation in the book. During the Kavanaugh hearings, Leland Keyser — whom Christine Blasey Ford named as a witness to her alleged assault — never testified, but her lawyer wrote the Senate Judiciary Committee that while she “has no recollection of the incident in question … she believes Dr. Ford’s account.” In their excellent book, “Justice on Trial,” Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino first broke the news that Keyser told friends she did not in fact believe Ford. But Pogrebin and Kelly got Keyser to speak on the record for the first time. “It would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she’s getting home” she told them, adding “I just really didn’t have confidence in the story.” She also said she was pressured by many who “wanted me to remember something different” and threatened “behind the scenes that certain things could be spread about me if I didn’t comply.”
For some reason, the Times did not find this news fit to print — perhaps because it strengthens the case that Kavanaugh was smeared. The only thing more shameful than the Times’ irresponsible reporting was news of all the Democratic presidential candidates who seized on the Times story to call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. In light of Keyser’s comments, they should be apologizing to Kavanaugh instead. And if the media wants to understand why it has surpassed Congress as the least-trusted institution in the country, here is a textbook example.

Texto completo: Rosie's Place hosts its annual “Funny Women … Serious Business" fund-raising luncheon on Wednesday, Oct. 16, at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. This year's featured speaker is Glennon Doyle, creator of the wildly popular Momastery.com blog and author of New York Times bestsellers “Love Warrior" and “Carry On, Warrior."
Rosie's Place was founded in 1974 as the first women's shelter in the United States; Doyle founded Together Rising, a nonprofit organization that has raised more than $11 million for women, families, and children in crisis.

Texto completo: President Trump dismissed as "fake news" an explosive claim by an intelligence whistleblower who says Trump made a disturbing "promise" to an unspecified foreign leader.
"Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially (monitored) call," Trump asked in a tweet. "I would only do what is right anyway."
Congress got a bare-bones closed-doors briefing Thursday morning on the "handling of the complaint" from Inspector General Michael Atkinson. That eased a dramatic standoff between the executive and legislative branches of government a bit, but Congress still remains in the dark about what the whistleblower actually said.
"We don't know exactly what is in the substance of this complaint," said Jim Himes (D-Conn.) after the hearing. "It could be nothing. It could be something very, very serious."
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said the Department of Justice and the White House both blocked the whistleblower report from being divulged to Congress. He threatened to sue to force its disclosure.
Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will also testify publicly before the panel next week.
The anonymous whistleblower, described only as a member of the intelligence community, filed the complaint in August claiming "serious misconduct."
The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, is reporting that the complaint involved a phone call in which Trump made a promise to a foreign leader. The Wall Street Journal and NBC News confirmed the report with their own sources.
Atkinson told lawmakers the complaint concerned more than any single incident, The New York Times reported.
Among the heads of state whom Trump spoke with around that time include the Emir of Qatar, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and Russian strongman Vladimir Putin.
Trump supposedly called Putin to offer American help fighting raging forest fires in the Siberian hinterland around that time. He also later called for Russia to be readmitted into the G-8 group of world economic powers.
Prominent legal critics of Trump suggested the whistleblower complaint could be a major embarrassment to Trump that will be difficult to keep under wraps.
Federal law provides extensive protection to government workers who make such complaints and mandate congressional scrutiny of them, potentially offering an inside glimpse at Trump's seat-of-his-pants style of dealing with foreign leaders.
Former solicitor general Neal Katyal predicted there would be transcripts of the conversation in question "documenting a gross abuse of power by Trump."
McGuire is on the hot seat after just a couple of weeks on the job. Trump chose Maguire to become the acting director of national intelligence when Dan Coats stepped down last month and his deputy, who would have succeeded him at least temporarily, also abruptly quit.
That sequence of events has raised eyebrows among insiders who question whether the musical chairs is somehow related to the whistleblower complaint.
In an extensive Twitter thread, Fordham Law professor Jed Shugerman suggested that the timeline offers tantalizing hints of a botched Trump cover-up of the improper promise to a foreign leader, most likely Putin.
The general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, said the allegation does not meet the definition of "urgent concern" and therefore does not need to be disclosed to Congress.

‘Times’ story goes from bad to worse to bizarre

Texto completo: For Tribune News Service
This just in: In a disheartening development, the newspaper many consider the world’s greatest — The New York Times — has been caught in the act of braking news instead of breaking it. And breaking some of journalism’s basic rules in the process.
All the above happened Sunday, when the Times was giving its readers the latest look-back at the controversial 2018 Senate confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. On Sunday, the Times buried not just not its lead, but buried what seems to have been a real front-page-worthy news story: the discovery of an FBI failure to investigate new information about Kavanaugh’s past.
The article, by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, appeared inside the “Sunday Review” section and was based on their new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation. But the Times went to great lengths to convince readers this piece wasn’t a newsy investigation at all. A note with the piece called it an “essay” adapted from their book. A label atop their bylines called it a “News Analysis.” The headline was featuresque: “Brett Kavanaugh Fit In. She Did Not.”
The top paragraphs were all about Deborah Ramirez, who got into Yale in 1983, had a sheltered, Catholic upbringing, babysat and dished ice cream at Carvel. The fourth paragraph reported she wound up at a “drunken dormitory party” where she said freshman Kavanaugh had dropped his pants and “thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it.”
The ninth paragraph reported that at his Senate confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh denied the incident ever occurred, saying if it had, it would have been “the talk of the campus.” But then came the first hint of the news that would follow: “Our reporting suggests that it was.”
“At least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez’s mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge,” the reporters wrote. Two classmates heard about it “just days after the party.”
Yet at the Senate hearing, no one publicly verified Ramirez’s account. Confirmation of Ramirez’s account could have helped establish a pattern of youthful sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh. (Whether that is reason to reject the apparently law-abiding adult Kavanaugh became for seat on the Supreme Court is another matter, of course.) But without that, senators found it easy to reject the claim of abuse during high school by the only witness who spoke out, Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford — and Kavanaugh got his lifetime appointment as a justice.
Eventually, the authors backed into their real breaking news: The FBI failed to fully investigate Ramirez’s account, failed to interview confirming witnesses discovered by these two non-investigative journalists who cover culture and business news. Ramirez’s legal team gave the FBI at least 25 names, the authors wrote, but the FBI “interviewed none of them.”
A big front-page Times story would have spurred Congress to demand answers: Why did the FBI fail to investigate? Who ordered the FBI not to interview those witnesses who the culture and business reporters discovered?
But the Times reporters’ article not only missed its breaking news, it went too far in a wrong direction — and their Times editors compounded their error. “We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez’s allegation,” the reporters wrote. It was about another Yale freshman party and allegedly involved another woman, Kavanaugh and penis-waving. But the one alleged witness wouldn’t talk to the reporters and neither would the woman; indeed the piece originally reported she told others she didn’t recall the incident. Then the Times editors made it infinitely worse: When they deleted the woman’s name they also deleted the fact that she didn’t remember it happened! The whole example should have been deleted. As it ran, it was unfair to Kavanaugh.
Then the matter gets downright bizarre. The Times tried to promote itself via tweet — and only made itself look tabloidy: “Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn’t belong at Yale in the first place.”
“Harmless fun?”
I’m tempted to type here: “There are no words.” But no. There are lots of them — and none other than our president used them all in his tweetstorm of attacks against the Times. Worse yet, reporter Pogrebin admitted on TV that she’s the one who wrote that pathetically misguided PR tweet. Where were the editors who are supposed to protect the paper and save reporters from their worse instincts?
Many days, The New York Times may indeed be the world’s greatest newspaper. But some days it isn’t even a good one.

Exhibition's photos speak volumes

Texto completo: The concept of the National Portrait Gallery exhibition "In Mid-Sentence" is right there in the title. The show features 26 photographs that depict people caught in the act of speaking, whether to an acquaintance or to the nation. But the pictures, all from the museum's holdings, are linked by a lot more than that.
All the photos are in black and white, and although their dates range from 1936 to 1987, nearly all are from the 1950s or '60s. Most are news photos of famous people, including politicians, activists, artists, athletes and astronauts. Each of the featured subjects is an American, and only one photo - of Margaret Mead in Bali - was made outside the United States.
The pictures are candids, shot on the fly, but they look rather formal by today's standards. They illustrate a broad consensus, since dismantled, of how to dress and behave before the camera. Even the most intimate and spontaneous pictures, such as a 1957 shot in which painter Elaine de Kooning and poet Frank O'Hara chat in a New York bar, were clearly made before the rise of selfie-consciousness. There's no mugging or incongruous gesturing, no flaunting of the subject's presence.
The pictures, selected by Leslie Ureña, the museum's associate curator of photographs, are divided among four themes: "In the Public Eye," "Teaching and Learning," "Public/Private" and "Just Between Us." But none of the photographically frozen moments were - nor would they stay - truly private, and the subjects knew it.
Case in point: President John F. Kennedy and his predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, were aware that a photographer was following them when they walked a path at Camp David, conferring after the failed Bay of Pigs operation. The two men were in the process of making history, even if evidence of their meeting wouldn't go public until later. (The picture is one of six in the show by George Tames, who photographed Washington for the New York Times for 40 years.)
Kennedy appears twice in the show, which is appropriate. The charismatic young war hero with the glamorous wife and attractive children was a new sort of president, ideal for an age in which a politician and his family could become the country's imaginary friends. This was largely because of the intimacy, both actual and simulated, brought on by television.
"In Mid-Sentence" acknowledges this with the photo that's been enlarged into the exhibition's most emblematic image. Made by Garry Winogrand, the most prominent photographer represented here, the picture captures Kennedy at the 1960 Democratic National Convention. The future president is addressing the crowd with his back to the camera, but a TV screen below him (yet visible to Winogrand's camera) displays the face that home audiences were seeing.
Winogrand captures Kennedy - both the actual and the virtual version - at the same instant. His photo also hints at the coming age of media saturation in which multiple, simultaneous images would become commonplace and expected. There's always another perspective.
That's explicitly true of a few of the show's pictures, which the museum supplements with short film clips available on a video kiosk. These include snippets of such famous events as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech at the Lincoln Memorial and attorney Joseph Welch's "Have you no sense of decency?" rebuke to Sen. Joseph McCarthy at the 1954 Senate hearing on McCarthy's investigation of the U.S. Army.
Less well known, but more enlightening, is a clip of San Francisco State University President S.I. Hayakawa, a frequent antagonist of student protesters in the 1960s. In the photo of Hayakawa, he looks a little smug. The film shows why: He had just ripped out the wires of a public address system, hindering the message of a group of demonstrators.
These video footnotes are intriguing but actually contrary to the spirit of "In Mid-Sentence." This is a show about disconnected moments and unfinished stories. The photographs suggest powerful emotions, but they leave it to you to fill in the unheard words.

NYT reporters haven't kept their story straight about Brett Kavanaugh asking them to lie

Texto completo: Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh supposedly asked New York Times reporters to lie to their readers. At least, that is the story certain journalists have repeated, following Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly’s appearance Wednesday evening at the National Press Club.
As with all things Kavanaugh-related, you would be wise to take this new allegation with a very, very large grain of salt.
The National Press Club event, which was hosted for the benefit of promoting Pogrebin and Kelly’s new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, included a moment where the moderator asked specifically of the Times reporters' efforts to collect information on the conservative justice: “Did you speak to Justice Kavanaugh?”
“We were on our way to Washington to speak to him,” said Pogrebin. “We had finally arranged for an interview. Ultimately, we could not agree on terms that we felt comfortable with. So, we didn’t do it, regrettably. We didn’t feel like we could.”
She continued, explaining, “We have debated whether to talk about this, but it is what it is, which is: He wanted us to say we hadn’t spoken to him.”
Their audience reacted with an audible gasp.
“We even went to negotiate the phrasing of that. We even were willing to say nothing, not to talk about who we spoke to,” Pogrebin added. “Not to talk about our sources. But he wanted a line in there, uh, saying we ‘did not,’ and we felt that to mislead our readers in a book about — that very much deals with issues of truth would probably not be a good foot forward.”
This sounds an awful lot like a horribly misleading characterization of the sort of back-and-forth haggling that regularly takes place between journalists and sources who want to remain either off-the-record or "on background."
Pogrebin repeated herself, saying again for the audience: “He said that we had to have a line in there saying we didn’t speak to him.”
The moderator, National Public Radio’s Alison Fitzgerald Kodjak, interjected to clarify for the Times reporter, “[Kavanaugh] declined to be interviewed … as a condition for being interviewed.”
That brief interaction Wednesday evening produced multiple headlines: “Supreme Court justice asks journalists to lie to readers,” tweeted Los Angeles Times White House reporter Chris Megerian.
The reliably credulous Huffington Post published a headline that read, “NYT Reporters Say Kavanaugh Asked Them To Lie In Exchange For An Interview.”
"Ok so he tried to get reporters to lie for him. So what, it's not like he lied under oath about big and small things in front of millions of peop--," quipped the Huffington Post's equally credulous senior politics reporter Jennifer Bendery.
Kodjak herself said in a widely shared tweet, “Brett Kavanaugh agreed to talk to @katekelly and @rpogrebin for their book — If they wrote that they didn’t talk with him. The authors — who told the story tonight @PressClubDC — refused and walked away from the interview.”TweetOn Thursday, in a subsequent interview with the Hill’s Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti, Pogrebin and Kelly retold the tale of trying to wrangle an interview out of Kavanaugh. They told mostly the same version of events. But not quite.
"I think you suggested in a recent interview that Brett Kavanaugh said he would talk to you but only if you wrote that he didn’t talk to you. Did he just say he would talk to you off-the-record or did he actually say that?” asked Enjeti.
“You know,” responded Pogrebin, “we had back-and-forth negotiations with him and a representative where we were kinda’ trying to come to terms on this.”
She added, “Unfortunately, they wanted a line in that actually said he declined to comment and we felt that would have misled the readers.”
Kelly said in agreement, “They asked us to affirmatively say Justice Kavanaugh declined to be interviewed for the book even if we had an off-the-record discussion with him.”
Did you notice that? It is a small thing, but it is still there. Over the course of mere hours, Pogrebin and Kelly went from talking about only Kavanaugh to alleging the request came from Kavanaugh and his representatives. Or maybe just his representatives?
Who actually demanded the reporters include the line in their book — if the line was indeed demanded at all?
None of what Pogrebin and Kelly alleged this week appears in their book. They claim the tricky nature of their discussions with the Supreme Court justice, coupled with the fact that talks fell apart so close to the time of publication, that they opted ultimately to omit the entire story from their book.
Is this story just complete bunkum? Pogrebin and Kelly have already badly oversold parts of their book, while also authoring an essay for the Times' Sunday Review section that omitted key exculpatory details regarding one of the allegations against Kavanaugh. Only a fool would continue to accept their explosive claims at face value.
Finally, it's a bit hard to swallow the idea that a man who has served as both White House staff secretary and a U.S. Circuit Judge, and then later became the target of intense and often unethical media scrutiny, would personally request that Times reporters lie on his behalf, trusting them to keep it under their hat. It requires an act of such unbelievable stupidity that it can be believed only if the people alleging it can produce receipts. Until then, handle with caution.

Texto completo: In December 2017, two videos emerged that showed Navy pilots encountering mysterious spherical objects that appeared, at first glance, to move through the air in ways that baffled experts. A third, released in March 2018, depicted a similar encounter.
Everyone who watched - including the pilots who filmed them - had the same question: What, exactly, are these things?
Last week, a Navy official publicly called these mysterious objects "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP)," giving name to the inscrutable little dots and reigniting scrutiny around the unidentified flying objects (a term the Navy does not want to use even though the objects that are flying cannot be identified.).
"The Navy designates the objects contained in these videos as unidentified aerial phenomena," Joseph Gradisher, spokesman for the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare, told the Black Vault blog, a massive civilian repository of government documents mostly obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests.
Gradisher further explained that "The 'Unidentified Aerial Phenomena' terminology is used because it provides the basic descriptor for the sightings/observations of unauthorized/unidentified aircraft/objects that have been observed entering/operating in the airspace of various military-controlled training ranges."
Black Vault's founder, John Greenewald Jr., told the Washington Post he believed the remarks were significant because, for the first time, the Navy acknowledged the existence of the objects in the videos on the record and admitted the department cannot identify them. Greenewald also reported the videos were not originally intended for public release.
Because of this revelation, Gradisher's comments to Black Vault have ricocheted across the internet this week, getting picked up everywhere from Popular Mechanics ("The Navy Says Those UFO Videos Are Real") to the front page of the Drudge Report ("UPDATE: Navy says It's Tracking UFOs...").
"The most powerful military doesn't know what these objects are," Greenewald said. "That doesn't mean aliens, or that they don't have some plausible logical explanation. But ... admitting that they see things in the sky and they can't identify them, that to me is the most amazing part of this."
In a subsequent interview with the Washington Post, Gradisher downplayed the significance of the moniker, saying "unidentified aerial phenomena" was not a new term and the Navy preferred it to the more popular "UFO" because the latter comes with cultural stigma that might discourage pilots from reporting such incidents for fear of being labeled, well, kooky.
This year, the Navy overhauled its guidelines for reporting these UAPs to encourage pilots to flag disturbances, which have been occurring regularly since 2014. Gradisher said one possible explanation could be the rise of unmanned aerial systems such as quadrocopters, a kind of drone easily available to the public.
"All of this is about incursions into our training ranges by what we're calling UAPs," he said. "These incursions cause a hazard to the safety of our aviators and the security of our operators, and that's what the Navy's investigating, these range incursions."
"These three videos that are out there ... reflect three reports of incursions into our training ranges" that occurred in 2004 and 2015, he said.
The three videos, titled "FLIR1," "Gimbal" and "GoFast," were initially released by the New York Times and an organization called To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science, which "engages with global citizens to investigate the outer edges of science and unconventional thinking" and was founded by a former member of Blink 182.
That the eerie footage had emerged along with revelations about a secret and since-shelved Pentagon division known as the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program did not exactly staunch speculation that a less-earthly culprit was to blame for these "incursions." On YouTube, the footage has been watched millions of times.

>> Manoa Valley Theatre presents comedy ‘Sylvia’
We all know people who treat their pets like people. The pet industry is booming because of such people.
If you note a tone of annoyed condescension here, then welcome to “Sylvia,” a romantic, anthropomorphic comedy opening at Manoa Valley Theatre today.
The plays tells the story of two empty-nesters, Greg, a bored financier in New York, and his wife, Kate, who’s finding a new lease (or leash?) on life as a teacher. An oddball love triangle is brewing at the beginning of the play when Greg comes home with Sylvia, who seductively tells him that he’s “God” and cuddles with him.
But Sylvia is not your usual “other woman.” She’s a dog — a clingy, endearing stray — that Greg found in the park. Sylvia is able to dialogue with Greg and Kate (although is it really Sylvia they’re talking to or their own inner voices?) She becomes a wedge between the couple, as she becomes the topic of discussion, argument and eventually therapy.
Playwright A.R. Gurney originally had some trouble getting the work staged. “(Theaters) refused it on the grounds that it equated a dog with a woman, and to ask a woman to play a dog was not just misogynist, but blatantly sexist,” he told Playbill.com.
But once “Sylvia” opened off-Broadway in 1995, with none other than Sarah Jessica Parker of “Sex in the City” in the title role, critics went bow-wow for it. Vincent Canby of the New York Times said the production “is so full of theatrical intelligence and writerly skill that it consistently pleases, even when, like a dog, it makes a slight mess.”
Manoa Valley Theatre’s production has Christine Lamborn as Sylvia, Peter Togawa as Greg and Cindy Shea as Kate. Stu Hirayama plays three characters: Tom, Phyllis and Leslie. Guest director is Stephanie Conching.

FRIDAY-SUNDAY
>> Skateboarding films coast into museum
Outlaws are welcome as HI Sk8, a film festival of locally made skateboarding films, returns to the Doris Duke Theatre for two nights this weekend.
Started eight years ago, the event was an immediate hit for the local skating community, attracting both great skaters and talented filmmakers. Friday’s opening night, which begins with a reception, features a film “Winward Heelflip” by Jason Park, who can do backward “wheelies” — riding on the front wheels only, rather than the rear wheelies — while going down stairs. Taylor Oishi, an animator and filmmaker who has made music videos, contributes “Super Fast.” Other filmmakers include Alexander Dushenko, Mackenzie Yoshida, Darin Lee and Travis Ota.
The festival continues at 7 p.m. Sunday with a screening of “Ye Olde Destruction,” pictured above, by artist and filmmaker Thomas Campbell. The film features almost 50 skateboarders as they travel the world skating in pools, skate parks and their own DIY skate venues. Two cars, a Cadillac and a Ford station wagon, figure prominently in their bag of tricks, as they vault from one to the other or use them as ramps for jumping and stunts.

>> VegFest O‘ahu offers music and food for thought
“Eat your veggies!” That will be more of a cheer than a demand this Saturday at VegFest O‘ahu festival, a celebration of “plant-based, sustainable living” at the Frank Fasi Civic Grounds.
The free festival will offer plenty of food, entertainment and education about vegetarian living, including demonstrations of plant-based favorites foods. Can’t imagine a loco moco without the beef and eggs? There’s a healthy version made with brown rice and tofu, to be cooked up by Paul Onishi of Down to Earth at 1:45 p.m. There will be plenty of other wellness activities, like yoga, sound baths and dance classes, along with a series of speakers talking about subjects such as “How to Get Plastic Out of Your Diet” (1 p.m.) and “How You Can Solve Climate Change Today” (2:15 p.m.).
Organizers say you’ll only be getting on the bandwagon of sustainable living. Plant-based food sales has grown five times more than total grocery sales this year, while restaurant offerings of meat alternatives has risen by a whopping 268%.
Enjoy some music with your healthy vittles, too: Acoustic R&B artists Hook + Line takes the stage at 11:45 a.m., followed by versatile rock and blues performer Tavana at 1 p.m. Paul Izak will blow your mind with harmonica and guitar playing at 2:15 p.m., and Taimane, pictured inset, and her phenomenal ukulele mastery close out the day at 3:45 p.m.

>> Get a grip with WWE wrestlers
The high-flying, slam-banging, bone-crashing heroes of World Wrestling Entertainment comes to Blaisdell Arena on Sunday.
The evening features a half dozen of the organization’s biggest stars, including Kofi Kingston, at right, who won his first WWE Championship earlier this year at Wrestlemania 35 in New Jersey. He’s a good teammate as well, joining fellow wrestlers Big E and Xavier Woods to form the tag team New Day, which held the tag team title for a record 483 days.
Fans of female wrestling can look forward to a match between two competitors who have helped popularize women wrestling. Charlotte Flair, the daughter of former world champion Ric Flair, will take on the single-monickered Bayley, aka Pamela Rose Martinez, pictured at left, who likes to hug her fans as she enters the ring. Both have numerous titles to their credit in WWE’s complicated universe of competitions, tournaments and championships.
Other wrestlers of local interest might be Shinsuke Nakamura, a former mixed martial arts and pro wrestler from Japan who is the reigning Intercontinental Champion and is known as the “King of Strong Style,” and Nuufolau Joel Seanoa, who is from southern California and wrestles under the name Samoa Joe.

'American Buffalo' Returning to Broadway

Texto completo: David Mamet's play about three low-level crooks conjuring up a get-rich-quick scheme is returning to Broadway next year.
A revival of "American Buffalo," starring Laurence Fishburne and Sam Rockwell, is set to begin previews in March 2020, with an official opening on April 14, the producers announced on Tuesday. A theater has yet to be named.
The original run of the play debuted on Broadway in 1977 and centered on the half-baked heist of three hustlers who conspire in a Chicago junk shop to steal a man's rare coin collection. (In his review for that production, the New York Times critic Clive Barnes called it "one of the foulestmouthed plays ever staged.") The play has been revived a handful of times since then, both on Broadway and on London's West End, and was adapted into a 1996 film starring Dennis Franz and Dustin Hoffman.
In this iteration, Mr. Fishburne will play Donny, the owner of the shop who has taken Bobby, a young neighborhood kid, under his wing. This will be Mr. Fishburne's first return to Broadway since his portrayal of the former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in the 2008 one-man show "Thurgood."
"I'm just really looking forward to this play and working with Mamet," Mr. Fishburne said in a phone interview. "He's somebody who's been an inspiration to me both as an actor and as a writer."
"The way he uses language is like music to me," he continued.
Mr. Rockwell will play Walter Cole (known as Teach), the group's volatile and conniving third member who weasels his way into Donny's scheme and who has been portrayed in previous productions by Robert Duvall and Al Pacino. Mr. Rockwell is returning to Broadway following critically acclaimed film performances, including his Oscar-winning role in "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri." His last Broadway performance was in the 2014 revival of Sam Shepard's "Fool for Love." Before that, he acted alongside Christopher Walken in Martin McDonagh's "A Behanding in Spokane."
Neil Pepe is onboard to direct the production. The Broadway director is no stranger to Mr. Mamet's work, having previously directed revivals of "A Life in the Theatre" and "Speed-the-Plow." He's also the artistic director of the Atlantic Theater Company, the Off Broadway theater Mr. Mamet founded in 1985.
The play is being produced by Jeffrey Richards, Steve Traxler and Stephanie P. McClelland. Last August, it was announced that Mr. Richards and Mr. Traxler were part of the producing team for an all female-revival of a different Mamet play, "Glengarry Glen Ross," that was scheduled to begin performances in May of 2019. In a statement to The Times, the "Glengarry" producing team (which also includes Rebecca Gold) said, "We have deferred the production to the 2020-2021 season" in order to "secure the right theater."
The exact dates, full casting, design team and the theater for "American Buffalo" will be announced at a later date.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Celebrating — and sustaining — Lancaster city's forward momentum

Texto completo: This month and next, Lancaster city is welcoming 315 more employees to downtown as Woodstream and Cargas settle into their new headquarters in the center of the city.
Lancaster City Alliance, the merchant community and partner organizations are thrilled to welcome both companies. Their arrivals get Lancaster city closer to many of the aspirations set out in the alliance’s “Building On Strength” 15-year economic development plan, unveiled in 2015.
Plan aspirations include attracting and retaining talent to the city, creating jobs that provide a livable wage, cultivating existing Lancaster businesses to grow with continued success and serving as a national model for urban economic development.
We applaud Cargas and Woodstream for recognizing Lancaster city as a premier place to do business and attract talent.
Other employers with ties to the city are also growing.
Trout, Ebersole & Groff has announced that it’s returning to the city after 47 years to East King Street. Select Security is nearing completion of its expansion at the former John Best & Sons steam engine and boiler works on North Plum Street near East Walnut Street. And Rhoads Energy recently celebrated the beginning of its expansion on Hazel Street in southern Lancaster city.
We welcome this exciting growth and encourage employees to take advantage of all that Lancaster city has to offer, including our dining scene recently recognized by The New York Times, public art to inspire you, locally-owned shops and the opportunity to bike and walk just about anywhere you want to go.
Lancaster city is an exciting place to be right now. We salute the city for obtaining the designation of Lancaster as a welcoming city.
However, city stakeholders continue to work together to solve several important issues including housing for all, continued decrease in poverty and access to jobs.
Even as major businesses are relocating and expanding across the city there is still a critical need for good paying jobs and transportation resources to place individuals in open positions across the county.
We applaud the Lancaster Chamber, High Concrete, Four Seasons Produce and South Central Transit Authority for their initiative to transport city workers to new jobs in northern Lancaster County. It is these types of creative partnerships and coordination of resources that will address our community’s great needs.
We believe Lancaster city is ready for the challenge and we look forward to guiding the community through the next 10 years of the “Building On Strength” economic development plan. When the plan comes to a close we aspire for all of Lancaster city to flourish and for everyone to share in its success.
Marshall W. Snively is president of the Lancaster City Alliance.

Texto completo: For centuries, school children in America have been lied to and taught that July 4, 1776, is the most important day in this country's history. What the education system in America has failed to do was teach students the truth about August 20, 1619 - the day 20 to 30 enslaved Africans first arrived at a port in the British colony of Jamestown, Virginia.
New York Times writer Nikole Hannah-Jones is the lead author of the 1619 Project, a collection of essays and literary works observing the 400th anniversary of the beginning of the country's biggest sin - American slavery. The prevailing narrative taught in schools is that black Americans' history begins with enslavement and they had contributed little to the founding of this nation, which is far from the truth.
In collaboration with the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, Hannah-Jones, along with NBA player and Benton Harbor native Wilson Chandler, brought the 1619 Project to Detroit to examine the story of slavery and the many ways its legacy continues to define our nation. The panel speakers on the topic included Hannah-Jones, New York Times music critic Wesley Morris, genealogist and 1619 Project contributor, Kenyatta D. Berry, Detroit native, and Rochelle Riley, director of arts and culture for the City of Detroit.
"Black Americans came here under unique circumstances," Hannah-Jones said to hundreds of people in the Wright, including Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist. "We are the only people who were forced to come here. We are the only people who did not choose to come across the ocean seeking a better life, but who were stolen from their native land and forced into the bowels of ships."
The 1619 Project took eight months to produce and was published online August 14. A commemorative print edition was included with the August 18 issue of The New York Times Magazine. The 100-page magazine contains more than 80 pages of historical essays, 17 original literary works by contemporary black writers that bring to life key moments in African-American history, and original artwork by leading black artists. Everyone that attended the event at The Wright went home with a copy.
"This project is, above all, an attempt to set the record straight. To finally, in this 400th year, tell the truth about who we are as a people and who we are as a nation," added Hannah-Jones. "It is time to stop hiding from our sins and confront them. And then in confronting them, it is time to make them right."
The project earned praise from academics, journalists, activists, celebrities, and politicians alike, including Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris, who labeled it a "powerful and necessary reckoning of our history" and John Legend, who praised the project's writers and creators.
It also had a few critics, including former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, calling the 1619 Project "a lie" and "propaganda."
Hannah-Jones addressed Gingrich's comments at the 1619 Project in Detroit. "I'm very proud that he called it racist propaganda," she said.
To bring the groundbreaking 1619 Project into the classroom, the Pulitzer Center created a curriculum for teachers of all grade levels. The curriculum asks students to examine the history and the legacy of slavery in the United States, as well as in our national memory.
The Pulitzer Center has put out a call for educators to share their own lessons developed from the 1619 Project and will highlight select lessons and student work in the coming months. It also uploaded the full print edition of the 1619 Project as a PDF. The Wright has physical copies of the project available for free in its bookstore.
"Until teachers do a better job of educating their students about the harsh realities and racial injustice of slavery, as well as the humanity and creativity of those who were enslaved, they will never be able to help students understand today's disparities in wealth, education and incarceration," said Brandy Thomas, an educator in Detroit. "It will be impossible for us as a society to eliminate the racial inequities that continue to divide us. The 1619 Project needs to be in our school systems, especially those servicing black students."

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris, a contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, called for an investigation into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. But the letter she sent to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler muddled basic facts and left out key information.
Harris suggested the creation of a special anti-Kavanaugh House task force and called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment based upon a hotly disputed weekend essay in the New York Times by reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly previewing their book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.

One line from Harris' Tuesday letter incorrectly states that “it was also reported that one of Ms. Ramirez’s former classmates alleged that he saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into Ms. Ramirez’s hand.” The newly reported claim in the book does indeed come from a Yale classmate, but it relates to a different woman, allegedly a friend of Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez’s.
Kavanaugh faced two main allegations during his Supreme Court confirmation process. California professor Christine Blasey Ford claimed Kavanaugh and a classmate of his attempted to sexually assault her at a home in suburban Maryland in high school. Kavanaugh denies the incident occurred, and the attendees of the the party named by Ford deny any recollection of the event, including Ford’s friend Leland Keyser, who says she doubts the incident ever happened. Martinez alleged Kavanaugh put his penis in her face at a freshman year party at Yale, causing her to inadvertently touch it as she swatted it away. Kavanaugh denies that too, and none of the alleged witnesses to the event named by Ramirez support her claim.
The new claim about Kavanaugh comes from Clinton impeachment defense lawyer and former GOP aide Max Stier.
“We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez’s allegation,” Pogrebin and Kelly wrote on Sunday. “A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.”
That article led to almost immediate calls for impeachment from Harris and other other Democratic presidential candidates. But the New York Times, under pressure online from conservatives, was forced to add an editor's note Sunday evening stating “the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.”
The passage from the book states that Stier “had seen a drunk Kavanaugh with his pants down at another freshman-year party where his friends brought Ramirez's drunk friend Tracy Harmon over and put Kavanaugh's penis in her hand.” Harris’ letter describes this allegation as Kavanaugh acting inappropriately toward Ramirez, rather than as a separate, uncorroborated allegation. Harris’ letter also omitted that the alleged victim does not appear to remember this event.
“Harmon, whose surname is now Harmon Joyce, has also refused to discuss the incident, though several of her friends said she does not recall it,” Pogrebin and Kelly said in the book.
Harris’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment when the Washington Examiner reached out about the letter.
When confronted earlier this week about the new alleged victim not remembering the incident, Harris persisted.
"Well, I would say that the fact that someone doesn’t remember the details of the incident doesn’t mean there’s lack of evidence if there are other witnesses who can establish that the fact occurred," Harris told NPR on Monday. "And so I wouldn’t say there’s no evidence. And I must say, it’s very normal for someone, especially someone who has been subject to this kind of behavior, to not be clear on the details. That’s not abnormal."

The Democrats' Ritualistic Stoning of Brett Kavanaugh; If Joe Biden wins, the left will use the same tactics against his presidency.

Texto completo: For years, an enduring story line of American politics was that "the far right" was taking over the Grand Old Party of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and the Bush family. Then Donald Trump, a political idiosyncrasy running as a Republican, blew up the right-wing takeover.
Today we have a more relevant story line: The Democratic Party of Woodrow Wilson, FDR, JFK, Bill Clinton—even Barack Obama—is being taken over by the far left.
Unlike the presumed capture of the Republicans by a mishmash of disorganized groups and intellectuals, the Democrats today are making the public's perception of their party easier by defining themselves from now until Election Day with their treatment of one person—Brett Kavanaugh.​​
Within hours of publication of the New York Times's tissue-thin piece on Justice Kavanaugh's years at Yale, a succession of Democratic presidential candidates posted denunciations on social media.
Elizabeth Warren: "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."
Kamala Harris: "He must be impeached."
Beto O'Rourke: "He should be impeached."
Julián Castro: "He should be impeached."
Bernie Sanders: "I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable."
Impeachment, until now, has been a grave step in the American political process. But impeachment has become like popcorn for Democrats. They can't get enough of it.
This extraordinary exercise in instantaneous groupthink by so many of the party's presidential candidates is disturbing. There are several ways to interpret it, and the first requires diving to untouched depths of cynicism.
By midevening Sunday, the Times had issued a clarification of the original piece by two of the paper's staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In what now appears to be an editing fiasco of historic proportions (almost on a scale with the Washington Post's epic and must-read correction of a recent piece about racism in the paper's food section), the Times acknowledged that the woman involved in the purported Kavanuagh episode "declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident."
But Democrats seem to live in a political world now whose standard of proof for judicial confirmations or any public- policy proposal is "whatever." On Monday morning, well after the Times's clarification of the original piece, the Harris campaign sent out an email grinding through "Brett Kavanaugh's illegitimate nomination." Then it asked for money: "Can you add a contribution of any amount to Kamala's campaign?" The short distance from moral high horse to money grovel is breathtaking.
About 3 p.m., Mr. Castro asked the people on his email distribution list to sign a self-promoting "emergency petition calling for Brett Kavanaugh's removal."
Still, something more serious than back-alley political cynicism is reflected in the statements from these Democratic presidential candidates. An issue raised by the entire Kavanaugh process is whether the Democratic Party as defined by its current generation of party activists is willing to conduct politics outside any conceivable definition of acceptable behavior.
Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed by a Senate vote nearly a year ago after a hearing process of unprecedented political bitterness. This New York Times article and the piling on by five Democratic presidential candidates amount to a ritualistic stoning of Brett Kavanaugh. If the established system doesn't go their way, they'll conduct politics outside the system. Whatever it takes.
The day after Donald Trump's victory in 2016, left-wing activists took over streets throughout Manhattan and shut down commuter traffic. It always struck me as a telling event, insofar as most of the New York workers these activists were shafting voted for Hillary Clinton. But their point was clear: We'll disrupt and even smash the system when we want to. This is becoming the ethos—a politics without norms or boundaries—that now defines the Democratic Party.
An argument against such a dire interpretation is that the activists' anything-goes politics is precisely what is at stake in the struggle between the party's left and "moderates" such as Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar. I'm not sure I believe that now, and the reason is Minnesota's Sen. Klobuchar.
After the Times piece appeared Saturday and her fellow candidates outputted their serial impeachment demands, Ms. Klobuchar somehow felt compelled to say the Kavanaugh confirmation "process was a sham." This from a candidate who has tried, like Mr. Biden, to present herself as the adult in the room. That Ms. Klobuchar caved says a lot about the requirements of party membership now.
It raises the question of how real the whole "moderate" Democratic phenomenon is, or whether Ms. Warren has accurately identified the party's near-term future—progressivism without nuance or quarter.
If Mr. Biden somehow got elected, the pressure from the far left to conform his administration's policy to its agenda would be overwhelming and relentless. That's the lesson of the Kavanaugh stoning. Today Brett Kavanaugh, tomorrow whoever gets in the way, including a moderate Democratic president.

Public divide still evident when it comes to Kavanaugh

Texto completo: Vicki Schmidt and Suzanne Lindberg remember the day Brett Kavanaugh became a Supreme Court Justice like it was yesterday.
But how the Wisconsin women remember the events leading to his confirmation a year ago are starkly different.
As President Donald Trump's nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh's confirmation was cruising for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee only to be rocked by allegations of sexual assault made by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford.
Outrage blew up across the political spectrum in the heightened climate of the #MeToo movement, protests flooded outside of the hearings and emotional testimonies were given by Ford followed by Kavanaugh, who forcefully denied any wrongdoing.
The events surrounding Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court manifested an already divided nation with protests lasting for weeks after the Senate narrowly voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh, who was sworn in as the court's 114th Justice on Oct. 6, 2018.
Schmidt of Oshkosh remembers the time as a low point for women's credibility.
"I am still unhappy with the results and feel that Kavanaugh's confirmation only reinforced the idea that women are not to be believed," Schmidt said. "It really horrifies me to a certain degree that we would be willing to treat women like that who are coming forward with those kind of stories."
Lindberg of De Pere had a vastly different viewpoint, saying it was a political smear campaign against an innocent man.
"I have never witnessed such a totally corrupt group that would have no limits on the lack of morals and decency that I observed during the hearings," Lindberg said. "Watching the needless suffering of his family (is) forever cemented in my mind."
Earlier this week, the New York Times published new information about sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh reigniting the feud about him. Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have called for his impeachment from the Supreme Court. Trump and several prominent Republicans came to Kavanaugh's defense.
The newspaper later ran an update to the story saying the accuser in the story said she did not recall the events described and refused to be interviewed.
The Women's March plans to hold a protest against Kavanaugh on the one year anniversary of his confirmation.
In the aftermath of Kavanaugh's confirmation, studies show public opinion of the Supreme Court dropped. The Pew Research Center found partisan views of the court have reached its widest gap in more than two decades.
An unscientific survey by The Post-Crescent and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin asked people how they feel about Kavanaugh's confirmation process a year out. It generated more than 400 responses from across the country.
The survey showed an even split between those who support Kavanaugh and those who oppose him.
Yet a majority shared concerns about the Supreme Court becoming too politicized in a heightened climate of partisan politics.
"Kavanaugh may or may not vote the way I would like him to, but that is beside the point," said Steve Hermes of Kimberly. "His confirmation destroyed forever the integrity of the process and thus, the integrity of an unbiased, honorable Supreme Court."
Battle heightened worries about high court's independence Ed Skerke of Neenah said the hearings made him change his personal political views and he's lost faith in the Republican Party for sticking by Kavanaugh.
"I would consider myself an independent with conservative leaning up until the Kavanaugh hearing," Skerke said. "I was so disgusted by what I saw during the hearing. The Republican Party will have to work very hard to get my vote."
Roger Vander Logt of Manitowoc County said despite being a Democrat, he was offended by the way Kavanaugh and his family were treated in the midst of the allegations.
"I will never, ever support people that do that to another human being and his or her family," Vander Logt said. "I'll never vote for another Democrat ever."
Ryan Owens, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said putting the court on party lines threatens its legitimacy.
"These hyper-partisan confirmation battles we have these days certainly are not good for the court (and) for peoples' perceptions of the court," Owens said.
Unlike other political institutions, the Supreme Court functions as an independent branch of government. With nine justices on the court appointed for life, it acts as the final arbiter of the law through interpretation of the Constitution.
Owens said when members of Congress and the president attack the court, it undermines its independence and that it's dangerous for presidential candidates to promise to appoint certain types of judges.
"Judging is supremely different than regular politicking and I think when our politicians dumb it down to us vs. them dynamic, that does the court a disservice and frankly, it does the rule of law in this country a disservice," Owens said.
Many women struck by Kavanaugh's confirmation In the wake of the allegations against Kavanaugh, women across the country took to social media platforms, revisiting their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, and using hashtags like #WhyIdidntreport to support Ford. Following Ford's allegations claiming the judge had sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school, two other women accused Kavanaugh of misconduct.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed nine people and found "no corroboration of the allegations" of sexual misconduct against him.
Jane Hayes of Oshkosh said she wished an investigation into Kavanaugh's past went further than it had and called his confirmation an "insult to women everywhere."
"An appointment to the Supreme Court is for life, and should be treated more seriously than this," Hayes said.
Schmidt said she felt Ford was treated unfairly in her testimony and her own personal experiences helped her empathize with her.
"Anybody that has been a victim of sexual assault at any point at their lives and I can tell you this from my personal experience as well, it never goes away. It's there with you forever," Schmidt said. "For her to be willing to come to Washington and speak in front of the Judiciary Committee, I thought she was very brave to do so and just thought she was very poorly received."
Many women also stood by Kavanaugh and worried about what the #MeToo climate could mean for their sons and husbands.
A letter in defense of Kavanaugh's character rejecting the allegations was signed by 65 women who knew him and sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee almost immediately after the first accusation came to light.
Janice Huguet of Green Bay said the debacle reminded her of Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation who was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill in 1991.
"Disgraceful on many levels," Huguet said. "The Democrats had a mob mentality to persecute for political partisanship that any parent that has a son should be frightened of."
Cynthia Koffman of Eden, who supports Kavanaugh, noted that the justice has made hiring women on his staff a priority.
"I'm even happier that he is on the court especially since he is the first ever to have an all-female staff," Koffman said.
Where the Supreme Court stands today Alongside Kavanaugh and Thomas, members of the Supreme Court include Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. It has a 5-4 conservative majority.
This year, the court struck down the Trump administration's plan to ask a citizenship question in the 2020 census and ruled that partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts can't be limited by federal courts, both of which fell along ideological lines.
Owens said Roberts acts as the median justice in the current court, but as a 5-4 conservative court, he doesn't expect it to function very differently than it did with Kennedy. Kavanaugh has also been more moderate than expected in his first year on the court.
"He's joined with the liberals in some cases, he's joined with the conservatives in others, but he hasn't pushed doctrine far to the right or anything at this point," Owens said. "A lot of folks, they get on the court their first year, they're a little bit quieter."
The structure of the court has also been talked about on the 2020 campaign trail with some Democratic candidates saying they would be open to expanding the number of justices on the court or proposing term limits on judges.
Whether the future of the court will play a role for voters in 2020, Owens thinks the election will more likely act as a referendum on Trump's presidency than on the makeup of the court.
"I'd say it's probably not going to be the key factor but we'll see what happens," he said.

Texto completo: There are no roving carts loaded with bamboo steamer baskets at the new Chinese restaurant Hutong, no menu cards to be stamped each time you take a dish of har gow or turnip cake. In fact, dim sum is only a small portion of what the menu offers at Hutong, which opened in Midtown in July. But you would do well to make it a large portion of what you order, because only one or two other restaurants in town can plausibly claim to make dim sum that rivals Hutong's.
Where else will you find cooks who have the dexterity to make Wagyu-beef mille-feuilles whose flaky layers of pastry overlap each other by only a few millimeters, like the feathers on a songbird's wing? Who can craft steamed buns that look just like shiitake mushrooms, which happen to be the chief ingredient in their filling? Or who knows the secret that allows the crunchy, chewy, charcoal-black mini-footballs stuffed with pork (in what is known in Sichuan as "fish-fragrant" seasoning) to sparkle as if diamond chips had been kneaded into the dough?
There is real skill in the kitchen at Hutong. You see it most clearly in the dim sum, but much of the other cooking evinces the kind of discipline, precision and technical mastery that has rarely been seen in this city over the past few decades, to the dismay of eaters who know what Chinese food is capable of.
"While expensive French restaurants in New York can hold their own against many places in Paris, if you want to move beyond steamed dumplings and stir-fries to experience the complexity of Chinese banquet cuisine, the possibilities grow dimmer each year," Ruth Reichl wrote in The New York Times in 1998.
She gave reasons for the poor showing, including talented chefs being paid more in Hong Kong and China. That is as true as it was 21 years ago, but what has changed is the rise of global Chinese restaurant groups, from the disappointing duck specialist DaDong to the surprisingly solid Hao Noodle outposts and, now, to Hutong.
The original Hutong opened in 2003 on the 28th floor of a glass tower overlooking the Hong Kong harbor, but the dining room tries to conjure the atmosphere of Beijing's vanishing premodern alleys, or hutongs, by means of red paper lanterns, carved wooden doors and birdcages.
The Manhattan branch makes a different impression. The entrance is on the east side of the circular driveway below the Bloomberg Building between East 58th and 59th Streets. Turn right and you are in a narrow hallway between two soaring glass stacks of wine bottles, every one of them for decorative purposes only. Turn left and you are in a glittering, soaring, hard-edge dining room. The inspiration seems to be Art Deco with a pinch of cocaine; the blue leather banquettes, beveled mirrors and chandeliers of mirror-polished steel could come from the set of a nightclub in some cross between "Scarface" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."
A guest who has lived in China allowed his eyes to adjust to the glinting light as he looked toward the ceiling, which seemed to be far away. "It's very ... yin," he said.
Hutong is ostensibly a Northern Chinese restaurant. This is more apparent in Hong Kong than in Manhattan, where the menu has been pruned to about half the size. Lamb, a mainstay in the northern provinces, was represented in August by a single dish, cumin-speckled ribs roasted languorously to a mind-altering tenderness. By the time of my last visit, lamb had ambled off the menu entirely.
The most famous preparation from northern China, Peking duck, arrived at my table worse for wear and tear, carved haphazardly, with blobs of unmelted fat clinging to limp skin. The second course, a dark-meat stir-fry to be folded in iceberg lettuce, was more skillfully done, but the sting of paying $ 84 for a whole duck with uncrisp skin lingered.
Much of what hasn't been trimmed from the Hong Kong menu comes from Sichuan. So does Fei Wang, the executive chef of the New York branch, and a native of Chengdu. Most recently seen running the kitchen of the Hutong in London, Mr. Wang weaves chiles -- fresh, dried, roasted, pickled, name it -- into nearly everything.
In the dish known as Red Lantern, the whole dried peppers the size of cherries are mostly decorative; fried soft-shell crabs are buried under the chiles in a pan with an arcing bamboo handle, like jelly beans in the plastic grass of an Easter basket. The ground spices on the crabs' shatteringly brittle crust -- lightly sweet and more aromatic than searingly hot -- may remind you of a Chinese rice-cracker snack you grew up on, or it may make you think of Old Bay.
Fermented chiles provide an electric buzz, and a modicum of heat, to the steamed halibut that arrives boxed up inside a red bell pepper and sitting on a nest of rice noodles. (The pepper opens into a six-pointed star that gives the dish its name, halibut red star noodles.)
Kou shui chicken is nearly submerged in an orange lake of excellent chile oil, although the adroit way the oil is balanced by rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and other flavors is what gives Hutong one of the city's most impressive versions of this traditional cold dish.
If Hutong has another appetizer that equals it, I haven't found it yet. I did, however, have a cryptic encounter with a log-cabin stack of okra doused in a sweet wasabi sauce, and an inconclusive rendezvous with some steamed asparagus stalks whose tips were enrobed in white sesame sauce; it was as if somebody had tried to replicate strawberries dipped in white chocolate without access to strawberries or white chocolate.
You could attempt to unknot these mysteries. Then again, you could simply begin your meal with dim sum. And then, after picking your way through the chile-besotted main courses, you could end it that way, too. There is a dessert that mimics the shape of a steamed bun, pleated and twisted into a pucker at the top. It is made of white chocolate, the wrapper on this trompe l'oeil bao, and filled with white sesame cream and a core of bittersweet salted caramel.
Alongside it is a single scoop of ice cream made from lightly sweetened soy milk. The soy milk is extremely fresh. I don't mean that the carton won't expire for another three weeks; I mean that somebody in the kitchen was squeezing the soybeans shortly before the ice cream was frozen. This is a snack from a Chinese childhood, bread and a glass of milk, and it would be hard, after several courses of spice, to think of anything more welcome.

Acting spy chief defies subpoena from Adam Schiff for whistleblower complaint

Texto completo: President Trump's acting spy chief defied a subpoena from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to hand over a whistleblower's complaint, which was deemed by a government watchdog to be "credible and urgent."
A letter sent to the California Democrat said the complaint, which had been submitted to the Intelligence Community inspector general, involves someone "outside the intelligence community" and does not relate to intelligence activity under acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's supervision.
"The complaint here involves confidential and potentially privileged matters relating to the interests of other stake holders within the Executive Branch," said the letter from Jason Klitenic, the general counsel for Maguire.
Schiff abruptly announced the subpoena late Friday and demanded Maguire testify on Thursday if he missed the deadline for whistleblower material on Tuesday. The chairman said he still expects Maguire to show in two days, even if it means being compelled by subpoena.
"The Committee's position is clear – the acting DNI can either provide the complaint as required under the law, or he will be required to come before the committee to tell the public why he is not following the clear letter of the law, including whether the White House or the attorney general are directing him to do so," Schiff said, according to Politico.
"He has yet to provide the complaint in response to the committee's subpoena, so I expect him to appear on Thursday, under subpoena if necessary,” Schiff added.
In his letter, Klitenic said it would be “premature” for Maguire to appear at a congressional hearing on Thursday.
The original complaint was submitted on August 12, according to the New York Times, four days after Trump picked Maguire, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, to be acting director of national intelligence with the departure of Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and his deputy Sue Gordon.
Schiff said the Intelligence Community inspector general sent a letter to the Intelligence Committee on Sept. 9 to notify them of the complaint that it determined to be credible and of "urgent concern." The next day, Schiff said he requested the full and unredacted whistleblower complaint, the IC inspector general's determination related to the complaint, and all records pertaining to the ODNI’s involvement in this matter, "including any and all correspondence with other Executive Branch actors including the White House."
The committee got a response on Friday in which the ODNI declined the chairman's request. According to Schiff, the ODNI said it was withholding the complaint, in part, because "it involves confidentially and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community."
This prompted Schiff to issue the subpoena, citing an "unambiguous" statute that the ODNI is supposed to share the complaint and the inspector general's analysis to the intelligence committees within a matter of days.
In interviews discussing his subpoena, Schiff has alluded to the possibility of a high-level cover-up that could go all the way to Trump. He told CBS News on Sunday that this "involved a higher authority, someone above the DNI."
Much remains a mystery surrounding the complaint. Schiff acknowledged to CNN on Monday that he did not know the identity of the whistleblower and declined to get into "particulars" regarding any legal representation that might have reached out to the committee.
Klitenic pledged the whistleblower will be protected. "We will not permit the complainant to be subject to any retaliation or adverse consequence based upon his or her communication the complaint to the" inspector general, he wrote Tuesday.
Schiff recently shared a phone call with Maguire to discuss the situation, describing it as "not very encouraging."
"I asked the director, 'Does this involve something that our committee is investigating?' And initially, the answer was, 'No.' And then his legal counsel had to correct him and say, 'Actually, we can’t say that,'" Schiff told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday.
According to Schiff, this provided a "strong implication" that the whistleblower's complaint was relevant to one of his committee's investigations.

Texto completo: Las páginas en español del New York Times llegaron a su fin este martes.
El periódico anunció que cerró el proyecto lanzado de manera autónoma en 2016. La imposibilidad de monetizarlo obligó a la medida.
“ Lanzamos NYT en Español como parte de un experimento que expandió nuestra cobertura a diferentes idiomas, en un intento de alcanzar y atraer más lectores internacionales”, dijo el periódico en una nota editorial. “Si bien el sitio Español atrajo a una considerable nueva audiencia hacia nuestro periodismo, y produjo regularmente artículos de los cuales estamos orgullosos, no demostró ser financieramente exitoso”.
El medio publicaba artículos en español tanto originales como traducciones de los grandes reportajes de su edición principal. Entre los colaboradores estaban reconocidos autores como Martín Caparrós y Jorge Carrión .
El New York Times en Español tenía una redacción en Ciudad de México. El diario aclaró que se seguirán traduciendo artículos y que se mantendrá activa la dirección www.nytimes.com/es.
Los periodistas de la redacción lamentaron el fin del proyecto.
“Ha sido un camino de mucho aprendizaje y, como bien lo dijo Patricia Nieto, no podría estar mejor acompañada en este periplo. Sigo creyendo que escribir en español siempre es un buen negocio… y el tiempo lo dirá”, escribió Paulina Chavira en Twitter.

Ever since Comcast’s NBCUniversal announced it was launching its own direct-to-consumer streaming platform, we’ve been left in a vacuum of speculation. What kind of content would it feature and how would it be packaged? What are the pros and cons and how does it differ from Netflix? It will be “free” to existing pay-TV subscribers thanks to its ad-supported model and cost a reported $12 for those that don’t already subscribe to NBC, though that number is not yet official. While some questions have been answered, others remain frustratingly open-ended. But today, NBCU provided a bit more information.
The company officially announced Peacock as the name of its streaming service in a nod to NBC’s iconic logo. It also unveiled its initial content lineup, which will feature library programming from NBC as well as big screen offerings from Universal Pictures, Focus Features, DreamWorks Animation, Illumination and Hollywood’s biggest studios. Peacock will launch in April 2020 with more than 15,000 hours of content.
“The name Peacock pays homage to the quality content that audiences have come to expect from NBCUniversal – whether it’s culture-defining dramas from innovative creators like Sam Esmail, laugh-out-loud comedies from legends like Lorne Michaels and Mike Schur, blockbusters from Universal Pictures, or buzzy unscripted programming from the people who do it best at Bravo and E!,” said Bonnie Hammer, Chairman of Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises. “Peacock will be the go-to place for both the timely and timeless – from can’t-miss Olympic moments and the 2020 election, to classic fan favorites like ‘The Office’.”
Original dramas include a Battlestar Galactica reboot from Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail. Dr. Death , based on the true-crime podcast, will feature Alec Baldwin, Jamie Dornan and Christian Slater. Demi Moore and Alden Ehrenreich will headline an adaptation of Brave New World , Aldous Huxley’s seminal dystopian novel. Limited series Angelyne will star Emmy Rossum and One of Us is Lying , based on the New York Times best-selling young adult mystery thriller, rounds out the original drama department.
One the comedy side, The Good Place creator Mike Schur teamed up with Ed Helms and Sierra Teller to bring audiences Rutherford Falls . Rashida Jones and Jada Pinkett Smith are bringing Straight Talk to Peacock which will also feature a third-season of the recently revived NBC sitcom A.P. Bio as well as Saved By the Bell and Punky Brewster reboots. The beloved Psych will also be getting a second spinoff movie on the platform.
Peacock will also include programming from the No. 1 Spanish-language network, Telemundo. More than 3,000 hours of Telemundo content will be available at launch, including original dramedy Armas de Mujer from the creators of La Reina del Sur and popular legacy series such as 100 Dias Para Volver , Betty in NY , El Barón and Preso No. 1 .
In addition to the exclusive streaming rights to the beloved NBC sitcoms The Office and Parks and Recreation , some of the most popular NBC and classic TV series of all time will be available on Peacock, including 30 Rock , Bates Motel , Battlestar Gallactica , Brooklyn Nine-Nine , Cheers , Chrisley Knows Best , Covert Affairs , Downton Abbey , Everyone Loves Raymond , Frasier , Friday Night Lights , House , Keeping Up with the Kardashians , King Of Queens , Married…With Children , Monk , Parenthood , Psych , Royal Pains , Saturday Night Live , Superstore , The Real Housewives , T op Chef , and Will & Grace .
Peacock is also aiming for Disney’s coveted family-friendly audiences with premium original films and animated series from Universal Pictures, DreamWorks Animation and Illumination. In terms of cinematic back catalogs, the platform will house a range of films such as American Pie , Bridesmaids , Knocked Up , Meet the Parents , Meet the Fockers , A Beautiful Mind , Back to the Future , Brokeback Mountain , Casino , Dallas Buyers Club , Do the Right Thing , Erin Brockovich , E.T. The Extra Terrestrial , Field of Dreams , Jaws , Mamma Mia! , Shrek , and The Breakfast Club . Peacock will also feature films from the franchises: Bourne , Despicable Me , and Fast & Furious .

Texto completo: The painful controversies of Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing are back amid new details about alleged sexual assault and misconduct by the now Supreme Court justice during his college years, and specifically whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation was impeded in its investigation of these allegations by the White House or others.
The new information, reported by The New York Times, raises fresh questions about whether Kavanaugh lied in his confirmation hearings about the sexual assault allegations and other matters (very possibly), whether his testimony rises to the level of criminal perjury (maybe) and whether he is fit to continue to be seated on the Supreme Court.
These are hugely important and consequential questions that should be pursued with vigor. But, like the confirmation hearings themselves, the new information about a short-circuited investigation of victims’ claims isn't only about one Supreme Court justice. It’s about how women and sexual assault survivors are fed up with feeling silenced and by men who control the levers of power — whether it's in the criminal justice system or in Congress.
Sham hearings, sham investigation
At the time of Kavanaugh’s confirmation, I and several other female legal experts urged a thorough investigation into the allegations of sexual assault and sexual misconduct made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, among other women. As we said at the time, there was simply no legitimate reason to rush a confirmation vote.
Don't be a 'slacktivist': If things are so bad under President Trump, why aren't we seeing larger protest movement?
Confirming Kavanaugh under a cloud of accusations, without a thorough investigation, would undermine both his legitimacy and the integrity of the Supreme Court. And confirming Kavanaugh without a full and fair process would outrage many women who felt once again that they weren't being heard. Allowing the FBI to conduct an investigation that was fair to his accusers and to him would serve to discover the truth, allow the public to have confidence in the result and show women people were listening.
Instead of taking that opportunity, the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee ensured that sham hearings and a sham investigation followed. Neither was about finding the truth. Both were an exercise in giving the appearance of being truth-seeking while really aiming to get Kavanaugh’s nomination through by any means necessary. And, so, here we are.
Lopsided process that silenced women
At the time of the confirmation, NBC News reported that the Kavanaugh investigation of the core sexual assault allegations by Dr. Ford was going to be cursory and significantly limited in scope, with agents restricted from interviewing many, if any, additional witnesses. Now we know for a fact that that was true — credible witnesses tried to reach the FBI in hopes of providing relevant information that likely would have corroborated the claim of a second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, and perhaps led to investigation of a third incident. And they were ignored.
The Times added an editor’s note to its weekend report to say a female student in the third alleged incident “declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. ” The disclosure underscores how vital it was for the FBI to do a full investigation, and the emptiness of Trump’s initial promise to the country that the FBI would have "free rein" to investigate as allegations about Kavanaugh came to light.
Yale classmate: FBI investigation was a joke. I tried to help and was ignored.
Of course, Trump’s pledge didn’t stand up for long. Then and now, the faux claims about “due process” for Kavanaugh (which only applies when someone is charged with a crime) ignore the lopsided and unfair process accorded his accusers and the millions of women who feel silenced once again.
It is crucially important to the integrity of our judicial system, not only that all of the allegations against Kavanaugh be thoroughly investigated but also that the public understands who limited the investigation and how. This was never just about Kavanaugh or a seat on the Supreme Court. This is a lens for whether our elected officials are capable of listening to women and sexual assault survivors.

Texto completo: Last week my friend and Post-Gazette colleague Mike White was reading the news about the 2018 Triple Crown winning racehorse Justify, now freshly accused of doping, when the peerless high school sports oracle suddenly remembered that back in the '80s, I'd had some good luck interviewing the participants when I covered the Kentucky Derby.
I could not remember that, but then, I can barely remember Friday.
Still, I thought, what could it hurt to waste a call to Justify, who is apparently in Australia, getting on with his life's work.
Ring: Hellooooo ...
Me: Uh, yes hello, I'm trying to reach Justify, the 2018 Triple Crown winner?
Justify: Yeah this is he.
Me: Oh great. Hey I'm calling from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette today.
Justify: Pittsburgh? You want my reaction to Roethlisberger? Mad bummer, right? A true thoroughbred that guy; I feel terrible for him because I know myself when you're not out there running with the boys you just want to compete so bad, man. Out for the season! Terrible.
Me: True, true, but I was actually calling about a story in the New York Times.
Justify: Oh Kavanaugh. Not touching that one, bro. Nolo commentooooo ...
Me: Well no, not Kavanaugh. It was actually a story that says, in some detail, how you failed a drug test prior to the Santa Anita Derby in April of 2018, a race you won and, of course, qualified you for the Kentucky Derby, and a shot at the Triple Crown.
Justify: Of course.
Me: Of course, what?
Justify: Of course, it qualified me, that's all. Of course. Of course.
Me: A horse is a hor . . .
Justify: Stop.
Me: Sorry, well look, unfortunately, I have to ask if you took scopolamine prior to the Santa Anita Derby, because according to the Times, the California Horse Racing Board says you did and, of course, Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert says you didn't, so do you have a few minutes to talk about this?
Justify: Of course.
Me: Oh, c'mon.
Justify: I've got a couple of minutes; you caught me between sessions.
Me: Sessions?
Justify: Stud man.
Me: Steadman?
Justify: Stud. S-T-U-D.
Me: Oh, stud. Right. So there are multiple sessions in the same day?
Justify: Three a day.
Me: Whoa.
Justify: I know, right?
Me: What's that like?
Justify: It beats workin' (snort!).
Me: Did you just snort?
Justify: Just get to your questions; I've got like 20 minutes.
Me: Well, as I indicated, the main question is whether you did or did not ingest scopolamine prior to the Santa Anita Derby.
Justify: I've never taken anything man. Scopolamine? What is it? Never heard of it.
Me: Apparently, it's an environmental contaminant that grows wildly near piles of horse dung and can accidentally get into a horse's feed or stable bedding. Metabolically, it can act as a bronchodilator, clearing your airways, making the heart more efficient, in other words, a performance enhancer.
Justify: Did you say horse dung?
Me: Yes.
Justify: Oh ... the dung weed. That's scopolamine? The dung weed?! Me and the boys, oh, God.
Me: Oh, God?
And then there was a silence that seemed to last longer than the Belmont Stakes.
Me: Are you there?
Justify: Yeah I'm here. We smoked it man! We smoked the dung weed! Oh my freakin' God. This is so stupid because you know, usually horses hate the dung weed because it stinks so bad; we used to dare guys to do it, but nobody would. But that spring in California - I mean the climate's changing man - it was so warm the dung weed was almost fragrant man. One night me and a coupla other racers found some out behind the far stables. No one was around. You know these horse people are morning people. No one's around at night.
So yeah, we did it. Got wasted. So I guess they take back the Triple Crown. That's great. Just great. Anything else I can do for the freaking Pittsburgh Post-Gazette?
Me: Well, there was this other story I was wondering if you might comment on. It seems that Vice President Mike Pence ...
Justify: Oh cripes.
Me: Yeah Pence was at some Republican function in Baltimore when he told a story about how he visited the farm where American Pharoah ...
Justify: My man! What about him?
Me: Pence says Pharoah bit him.
Justify: Say that again.
Me: Vice President Mike Pence says he was bitten on the arm by 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah, and, here, I'll read you the exact quote, the bite was "so hard I nearly collapsed."
Justify: Oh my God that is the biggest load of horse ... Let me tell you something about American Pharoah OK? I never met the dude, OK? But everybody I know and everybody in the industry knows that that horse is as gentle as a Kentucky breeze. I know trainers who say they've seen complete strangers walk up to American Pharoah's stall and put their faces right against the dude's nose, nuzzling him, and all he does is purr like a kitten.
Sweet, they say. Some said that's why he'd never be a big winner. Too sweet. And boy did he show you people. And now I'm answering questions about American Pharoah biting Mike Pence. Geezus Mike freaking Pence. What's wrong with people?
Me: Well Justify I really appreciate . . .
Justify: No I'm asking you sincerely what is wrong with people? Horses don't act like this! What the hell is wrong with you people?
Me: I don't know. Look I gotta go; it was nice . . .
Justify: Oh, you gotta go. You're busy?
Me: Well, I got this Roethlisberger thing.
Justify: Yeah, don't call me again.

Texto completo: The Washington Post said they had the same allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that the New York Times ran with Saturday but did not run the article because they could not confirm key details of the story.
"The Washington Post last year confirmed that two intermediaries had relayed such a claim to lawmakers and the FBI," the paper said in a Sunday night story. "The Post did not publish a story in part because the intermediaries declined to identify the alleged witness and because the woman who was said to be involved declined to comment."
On Saturday, the New York Times ran an article about Kavanaugh and one of his sexual assault accusers, Deborah Ramirez, based on a book the writers are releasing this month. Buried 11 paragraphs in was a new allegation of sexual misconduct based on two officials who had talked to a witness of the alleged incident.
The witness, Max Stier, allegedly saw Kavanaugh's friends pushing "his penis into the hand of a female student" according to the officials who talked to Stier. He declined to talk about the allegation with either the Times or the Post. The woman in the allegation also denies the event ever took place according to friends.
Stier, 52, faced off with Kavanaugh during Bill Clinton's presidency as Stier was one of the lawyers representing the president and Kavanaugh joined Ken Starr's team investigating Clinton.
The New York Times was forced to issue a lengthy correction Sunday after conservative critics pointed out the original story did not include that the alleged victim said the event never happened.

Senate cool to the idea of impeaching Kavanaugh as allegations fizzle

Texto completo: Impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is heating up the Democratic campaign trail, but that trail runs cold in the Senate.
Lawmakers had little enthusiasm for trying to oust a sitting Supreme Court justice, despite a new book claiming to provide evidence of decades-old sexual misconduct.
“I think we do need to clear this up,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the Washington Examiner when asked about the allegations put forth in the The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, which claims to add new evidence and a new allegation of sexual misconduct from Kavanaugh’s teenage years.
None of the Democrats or Republicans who arrived in the U.S. Senate Monday night to vote on a nomination said they believed Kavanaugh deserved impeachment, despite calls from Senate Democrats running for president that Congress remove him from the high court.
Republicans scoffed at the new allegations against Kavanaugh, which were outlined in a New York Times opinion piece that later required an editor's note to state the alleged victim of a second sexual misconduct claim does not remember it happening.
“The latest allegation was blasted out by a major newspaper despite the apparent lack of any corroborating evidence whatsoever,” Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday. “The reporting was so thin, the story ran not in the news section, but on the opinion page. In fact, they’ve already had to issue an enormous correction. The writers conveniently failed to note that the supposed victim herself declined to be interviewed. And several of her friends say she has no memory of any such thing happening.”
The allegations and the book were further discredited Monday when reporters began dissecting it for themselves and found no new evidence aside from a claim by former Clinton lawyer and one-time GOP aide - could not confirm, checking with Susan /aegMax Stier that a drunk Kavanaugh dropped his pants during a party at Yale and some friends shoved his genitals into the hands of a woman who does not remember the incident.
Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for Sen. Susan Collins whose support helped confirm Kavanaugh, called the Stier claim “an accusation that lacks an accuser.”
A similar incident alleged by another Yale classmate, Deborah Ramirez, wasn’t backed up either, other than by a a male student who said an unidentified female student nobody has interviewed told him she witnessed it.
“It seems like they’ve gone from a full-throated call for impeachment to impeachment light,” Sen. Thom Tillis, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told the Washington Examiner. “A lot of that stems from the fact that their members are concerned with it.”
Tillis said he believes the furor over Kavanaugh on the Left will die down.
“I think it’s probably just another political exercise. I doubt seriously they draw up [impeachment] articles," he said.
But it is the House that initiates impeachment, and liberal Democrats are clamoring for Kavanaugh’s removal.
Rep. Ayanna Pressley said she plans to introduce a resolution Tuesday calling on the Judiciary Committee to conduct an impeachment inquiry regarding Kavanaugh.
“We saw right through you then, we see right through you now. #ImpeachKavanaugh,” Pressley said on Twitter.
That panel has already announced plans to investigate Kavanaugh, so it’s more likely Chairman Jerry Nadler will add the book allegations to the list.
"We have our hands full with impeaching the president right now, and that's going to take up our limited resources and time for a while," Nadler said during an interview Monday on WNYC.
Democrats in the House and Senate are likely to demand scrutiny of the FBI background investigation conducted into Kavanaugh’s past, in particular a second FBI probe that occurred during Kavanaugh’s second round of hearings involving California professor Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual misconduct while the two were in high school.
Rep. Chris Coons told reporters Monday he sent FBI Director Christopher Wray a letter alerting him to Stier’s allegations and that they did not contact him.
Feinstein said she wants to find out why.
“I think the FBI did not do the investigation we’d hoped they would do,” she said.
Democratic primary candidates aren’t backing down.
“The fact that something has not been proven, it doesn’t mean it didn’t occur, right?” Sen. Kamala Harris, a presidential contender, said on NPR when told about the lack of witnesses to the allegations. “But if you don’t investigate it, if it hasn’t been investigated, then there’s not been a full airing of the issue.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As a government lawyer a generation ago, Brett Kavanaugh sought to impeach a sitting president. As a federal judge writing in a law review a decade later, he staunchly defended the impeachment process.
And last year, during a Senate confirmation hearing that focused on allegations of sexual assault against him from the early 1980s, Kavanaugh warned senators that "what goes around comes around. "
Now the subject of impeachment has come around again, not with President Donald Trump in the crosshairs but with Kavanaugh. Democratic presidential candidates are calling for him to be impeached after The New York Times published an essay containing new allegations of sexual misconduct from his time as a Yale undergraduate.
The battered copy of the Constitution that Kavanaugh carried to his confirmation hearings makes clear that federal judges, like other officials, can be impeached.
More: Brett Kavanaugh begins Supreme Court tenure cautiously as fellow conservatives push for change
Article II, Section 4 says the president and other civil officers can be impeached and convicted for "treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. " The first section of Article III says judges "shall hold their offices during good behavior. "
Even before Kavanaugh's confirmation last October, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N. Y. , warned about future investigations if Democrats were to take over the House. They did just that the following month and Nadler now chairs the Judiciary Committee that could draw up articles of impeachment.
"If he is on the Supreme Court and the Senate hasn't investigated, then the House will have to," Nadler said then about the sexual misconduct allegations Kavanaugh denied. "We would have to investigate any credible allegations, certainly of perjury and other things that haven't been properly looked into before. "
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R. I. , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee whose recent friend-of-the-court brief challenging the Supreme Court's legitimacy was anything but friendly, sounded a similar warning at the time: "As soon as Democrats get gavels, we're going to want to get to the bottom of this. "
The problem for Democrats is that they hold gavels only in the House, where a simple majority vote was enough to impeach President Bill Clinton 20 years ago. Conviction in the Senate would take a two-thirds vote, and Democrats lack even a majority.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday called impeachment a "laughable suggestion. " Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham vowed that Kavanaugh will not be impeached "over these scurrilous accusations. "
The process for impeaching a federal judge or Supreme Court justice works much as it would for a president, with one key difference: The vice president, as president of the Senate, would preside – not the chief justice of the United States.
A House investigative panel would have the power to compel the testimony of witnesses and gather documents. That probe could be broader than the sexual harassment allegations, and the constitutional threshold for impeachment – "high crimes and misdemeanors" – isn't limited to criminal wrongdoing.
There is no indication from Congress that an effort to formally start the process will happen, though several Democrats have voiced support for impeachment.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California called for Kavanaugh's impeachment on Sunday. Both Democrats are currently running for president.
GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas, said on ABC's "This Week," "I think that follows up with the rather shameful circus we saw during the confirmation hearing," adding that calls for Kavanaugh's impeachment were "another sign of how nasty and divided the time is. "
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has made increasing the number of conservative justices a major political goal, pledged his support to Kavanaugh.
U. S. District Judge Thomas Porteous, a Clinton appointee from Louisiana, was the last federal judge to be impeached. He was convicted in the Senate of four counts, including a charge that he misled the FBI and the Senate during his confirmation process. Porteous was the 16th federal judge to be impeached and the eighth to be convicted.
Only once has a Supreme Court justice been impeached. Samuel Chase, a Federalist justice appointed by President George Washington, was impeached by a Democratic-Republican House in 1804 for "arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust" decisions on the court.
The Senate declined to remove him from office, setting a precedent that exists to this day. As former Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted in a 1992 book about the case, "it assured the independence of federal judges from congressional oversight of the decisions they made in the cases that came before them. "
Kavanaugh, in his Minnesota Law Review article from 2009, noted that federal judges' life tenure "justifies a more searching inquiry by the Senate into their fitness and qualifications for office. "
That inquiry, he wrote, should come during the confirmation process.

Resumen: Catchup on weekend news: Iran blamed for epic attack on Saudi oil facilities. A big auto workers strike hits G.M. Why Dems want to impeach Kavanaugh.

Texto completo: An Islamic rivalry escalates, and costs rise.
Two Middle Eastern Muslim nations, one Sunni, one Shiite, are teetering on the brink of direct war. Saudi Arabia lost half its oil output after drones and cruise missiles attacked its facilities Saturday. Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility. But U.S. and Saudi officials say the attack came from Iran or southern Iraq, where Iran backs Shiite militias. Iran denies involvement. In any case, oil prices rose Monday. Higher oil and gas prices can be a drag on the global economy. The Saudis produce about 10 percent of the world's oil and tend to act as a counterweight on volatile price swings. Some analysts forecast $100 per barrel prices if Saudi repairs take more than a month. Iran, under debilitating U.S. sanctions over its foray into nuclear weapons, is also suspected of attacking ships in the Persian Gulf, another tactic that pushes up oil prices (which benefits Iran's economy). 
Among the questions we're considering: How will Saudi Arabia respond to this provocation? What's the U.S. role? Is this attack about the Iranians trying to strengthen their hand ahead of a potential meeting between President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in New York next week? 
2. Rebalancing process : Some 49,000 union workers at 55 General Motors plants in the U.S. went on strike at midnight Sunday, shutting down its auto production in the U.S., and likely Canada and Mexico. For car buyers, that means fewer vehicles for consumers to choose from on dealer lots, and no new orders - or delivery of - specially ordered cars and trucks. 
The United Auto Workers union seeks better wages, profit sharing, and health care benefits. GM is balking at wage hikes, but says it's willing to share profits. GM says it needs to narrow a competitive pay gap with foreign automakers. GM pays $63 per hour in wages and benefits compared with $50 at foreign-owned U.S. factories. 
3. Justice for the justice? Several Democratic candidates running for president called for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The Sunday calls came after The New York Times reported a sexual misconduct accusation from another former Yale classmate of Mr. Kavanaugh's, a man, who tried to tip off the FBI last year, but was ignored. An impeachment process could start in the House, which Democrats control. But the Senate, where Republicans hold the majority, would unlikely remove the justice from office. President Trump tweeted Sunday that Kavanaugh "should start suing people for libel."
Look ahead Tuesday, Sept. 17
Israeli elections, a Do Over : Voters return to the polls for the second time in six months. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister won in April but failed to form a coalition government. This time it's a close race with centrist Benny Gantz. Mr. Netanyahu is galvanizing his right-wing base and, controversially, promised to annex parts of the West Bank, if he wins.
A democracy with integrity:  Facebook, Google, and Twitter execs are expected to attend a Federal Election Commission meeting in Washington, D.C. to "identify effective policy approaches and practical tools that can minimize the disruption and confusion sown by fraudulent news and propaganda in the 2020 campaign," reports Politico. 
Wednesday, Sept. 18
Lower interest rates:  To keep the U.S. economy from stalling, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank is expected to lower interest rates Wednesday. 
Managing free speech:  Google, Facebook, and Twitter execs are scheduled to appear at a US Senate panel hearing on political extremism and mass shootings.

Swedish Miss mass movement:  Sixteen-year-old Greta Thunberg says the U.S. has "a moral responsibility" to address climate change and has inspired students worldwide to hold Friday strikes to raise awareness of the issue. This Friday, an intergenerational event is planned in Washington to kick off a week of climate "strikes" by workers worldwide.  
Generosity watch Giving doesn’t subtract. It multiplies. Six-year-old Jermaine Bell of Jacksonville, Florida. learned that lesson while visiting his grandmother in South Carolina. For about a year, he’d been saving money for a trip to Walt Disney World. But Jermaine decided those fleeing Hurricane Dorian needed help. He gave away free hot dogs, chips, and water to about 100 evacuees who passed by on Highway 125 in Allendale, S.C. "I wanted them to have some food to eat, so they can enjoy the ride to the place that they’re going to stay at, Jermaine told WJBF-TV in Augusta, Ga.. "I wanted to be generous and live to give." His generosity didn’t go unnoticed. A few days later, Disney characters showed up at his seventh birthday party. Jermaine and his family got a free pass to Disney and Delta Airlines donated the flight

Restoring Black cowboys to the range

Texto completo: A pack of red cattle dogs bayed with excitement as Larry Callies drove his pickup truck down a Rosenberg, Texas, ranch road one morning. He pulled up to the barn and stepped a booted foot from the cab to the dirt, and the dogs keened even more wildly, eager to get out on the range: The dogs knew a cowboy when they saw one.
But not everyone sees a cowboy when they look at Callies. Though he is inevitably dressed in Wranglers, a 10-gallon Stetson and cowboy boots, driving a pickup with a bed full of lassos around this small city about 35 miles southwest of Houston where he lives, racism and history's omissions have meant that for many he's miscast: Callies is Black.
And for most of his adult life, some part of Callies wondered what part people who looked like him had played in the American West; he was unaware of its rich legacy of Black cowboys. Until one rainy day about two decades ago, cleaning out a barn at a guest ranch where he worked, he came across an antique photo from 1880s. In it eight cowboys sit astride eight horses.
Seven are Black cowboys.
That photo is now the centerpiece of The Black Cowboy Museum, a gallery wedged between storefronts in a little mall a few blocks off Rosenberg's main drag. I arrived on a damp morning after touching down in Houston about an hour earlier, piloting my rental car through the historic downtown, a few blocks of which preserve a frontier-town past.
Vintage pinafores fluttered in antiques shop windows; on a corner, servers shook up milkshakes at a soda fountain called Another Time. About a block past Bob's Taco Station, a joint made famous by an appearance on Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives," I found Callies waiting in the doorway of his museum.
Callies opened his museum in 2017 with his life savings, in this town of about 40,000 where about 75% of residents are white. "I couldn't believe it," Callies said of the photo that inspired him, as he stood inside the museum on Third Street between displays of old saddles and rusty six-shooters. "Cowboys who looked just like me. And I never knew they existed. That they were part of America."
Callies, a former mail deliverer and a rodeo rider, has become the self-styled curator and docent of his personal three-room museum. It began as a shrine to the unsung Black cowboys in his life, like his cousin Tex Williams, who he believes in 1967 was the first Black boy to win the Texas High School Rodeo Championship, shortly after high school rodeos were officially desegregated. A light-skinned teenager, Tex passed as white as he bareback rode, but family lore has it, the crowd booed when his cowboy hat was bucked off revealing his nappy hair. Williams' championship buckles and embroidered chaps festoon the gallery walls.
Shepherding the museum has transformed Callies from a family cowboy archivist into something of an evangelist, dedicated to reinserting Blacks into the historic American landscape where they rode and roped - and were erased.
"No picture of American history has been painted more white than the pioneer picture, the story of the frontier," William Loren Katz, a historian and author of "The Black West," said in an interview. In fact, 1 in 4 cowboys during what is known as the pioneer era, which began after the Civil War in 1865 and ended around 1895, were Black, according to Katz and other historians. They were town marshals keeping the peace; they were outlaws as famous in their day as Billy the Kid and barrier-busting rodeo stars as popular in their time as Roy Rogers.
They were cowboys.
And yet, the archetypal cowboy imprinted in the American psyche is a white Marlboro man. It is John Wayne, swaggering through Hollywood's vision of a frontier town, a fictional place where no Black cowboys ever rode the range, where no Black faces peered over poker decks behind the swinging saloon doors.
"The West was part of the mythology of America; the cowboys, the narrative of the pioneer spirit represented the best of us," said Katz, 92. Before emancipation in 1865, Black cowboys were enslaved people or those who had escaped. The men who would become free Black cowboys would have entered into the American story "at the end of a whip and in chains," he added. "And that's not the American tradition people wanted to remember."
The Rosenberg gallery is not the only one tackling the subject. In Denver, there is the Black American West Museum and Heritage Center, opened in 1971 by Paul Stewart, a local barber who died in 2015. In 2017, the Studio Museum in New York City exhibited "Black Cowboy," featuring contemporary photographs of cowboys, including the smattering of those who currently ride the urban range. They are in places like Compton, California, and Philadelphia.
"It's like the old saying that history is written by the victors. In this case the 'victors' were those in the society who enslaved and subjected Blacks," said Ron Tarver, a photographer whose pictures of Philadelphia's urban cowboys were included in the Studio Museum show and who hails from a long line of Oklahoma's Black cowboys.
Interest in correcting the record stands to grow, Tarver added. "I think younger African Americans are looking for a broader definition of what it is to be Black in this country." In recent years, young Black people have embraced a boots-and-Stetsons fashion movement called the Yeehaw Agenda. "Old Town Road," a country song by a Black musician, Lil Nas X, vaunting the cowboy lifestyle, has been atop the Billboard 100 this year.
Callies hopes that will draw people - and resources - to his little Rosenberg museum.
The exhibits are mostly a display of ephemera owned by Black cowboys Callies knew, with a smattering of weapons and history texts. Callies hosts visitors personally at almost any hour they choose. Entry is $7 for adults, $5 for children. To see the collection, the best bet is to ring first - all calls go straight to Callies' cellphone, which he answers with a voice that creaks like an old barn door. He was beset in the early '90s with a mysterious ailment of his vocal cords, leaving him with a permanent rasp that derailed a career as a country-western musician. It is a fate about which Callies is relentlessly upbeat, smiling his wide newscaster smile as he explains that if he had ended up a country music star, he would have had less time for his true passion: rodeo.
Callies hails from a long line of Texas cowboys, but as a young man born in the town of El Campo, Texas, he too absorbed the whitewashed mythology - and the prejudice that rained down on his youthful attempts to become a rodeo star.
"I used to go to school, and people would kick me if I had a pair of cowboy boots on," he said. "I had to quit wearing them because they would beat me up. Whites would beat me, told me the boots were not my own. Blacks would beat me, told me I was a Black guy who wants to be white," he said.
His voice grew thick with emotion. "But this is who I am. I was always going to be a cowboy. If God made me white, I was going to be a cowboy. But God made me Black," he said. "And I am a Black cowboy."

Can he save the news industry?

Información de publicación: Tampa Bay Times ; Tampa Bay [Tampa Bay]. 15 Sep 2019: 1.

Texto completo: Mike Blinder has loved newspapers for as long as he can remember.

For the past 20 years, the media consultant has helped news organizations around the world stay afloat.

The work filled him with pride, but the travel wore him out. By his estimate, hes flown more than 5 million miles.

I was the quintessential road warrior, he said. And it sucked.

Now hes trying to save the industry in a different way.

Last month, he and his business partners bought Editor & Publisher, the self-described bible of the newspaper industry, which dates back 135 years. He would not reveal how much they paid Duncan McIntosh Co., which publishes Boating World and Sea Magazine.

The monthly magazine  with a paid circulation of about 10,500  has long catered to newspaper executives and insiders. Blinder wants to expand the audience to include the entire news publishing industry, including television and online-only organizations.

The editorial operation will remain in California, but Blinder will run the business from his home in Lutz, where he lives with his wife, Robin, and their 16-year-old daughter.

Blinder, 63, recently spoke to the Tampa Bay Times. Here are excerpts from the interview, edited for length and clarity.

Why buy a magazine?

I was originally looking at buying Greenland, but apparently its not for sale. So I figured, what the hell, Ill buy a magazine. Seriously, though, the news industry has been good to me. Ive built a reputation as a money guy in the industry, someone who can help an organization grow its sales. Im in my 60s, and I figure Im still good for 10 more years before the wheels fall off the wagon.

Why Editor & Publisher in particular?

I want to do something for the industry I so love. I believe in the news industry in a myriad of ways. Among other things, I have respect for the fact that its the last bastion of the separation of church and state. There also remains a high level of editorial integrity in most markets.

Were you nervous starting your own business years ago?

A little. But I was ready for a change. I was at the Portland (Maine) Press Herald in 1999. I told them I was quitting to start my own media consulting business.

They said, You cant quit.

Um, why not? I asked.

They told me they were selling the newspaper, that no one knew, but that all the managers had to stay in place. They gave me a $25,000 bonus to stick around for a few more weeks.

I left the day the sale was finished and quickly landed some clients.

How did you end up in the Tampa Bay area?

The short answer: the airport, but its a funny story. Im in Alaska helping a client one winter. I call and tell my wife that she wont believe that its a balmy 70 degrees. Shes back home in Maine, which just got hit with the worst snowstorm in years. Shes fed up. She demands that we move when I get back. I said, were going to Tampa.

I picked it because the Tampa airport is the best airport in the world. If Im going to be flying for a living, Im flying out of Tampa. Im halfway home to Lutz before the last guy gets off the plane. Thats pushing it, but you get the point. I would slit my wrists if I was coming home to the airports in Philly, New York City, Atlanta or Chicago.

What has been the reaction to you taking over Editor & Publisher?

I was really scared how people would react. The brand goes back more than 100 years. I dont want to mess that up. The truth is everybody has been amazingly unbelievable.

You arent revealing the purchase price. Can you characterize how much money you plan to spend going forward?

Not really, but its a lot. I have the means to do it. Right now, Im putting some cash into making sure we can advance quickly into some of the places we need to be.

What changes will readers notice in the magazine and on the website?

We will be adding podcasts and launching a brand-new website in about a month. I also want to be more than just a print publication, a website and email newsletters. I want to get more voices out there representing our brand. Well start next month by adding recorded five-minute industry updates that anyone can get using voice assistants like Siri, Alexa and Google.

Anything else?

Ive also changed the tagline. It now reads: Since 1884, THE authoritative voice of #NewsPublishing.

Newspapers are our heritage. But news publishing as a whole, including newspapers, is our future.

Is the web becoming a bigger piece of the magazines financial pie?

Were making more money on the digital side than the print side. If I shut down the print side Id be saving a whole mess of money. That said, Im never shutting this magazine down. Theres a legacy. Its too important.

How much control do you intend to have over the editorial content?

I have an amazing editor and managing editor. I will be making suggestions, but I made it very clear to my editorial team that they have complete autonomy. They are allowed to tell me to get bent. They have great respect for our brand, and I expect them to fight me if they dont like my input. I just want to polish it up and move it forward. Content first, audience second, revenue third. Thats news publishing.

Do you plan on making any other purchases?

I have some partners, and were looking. Were not done. One of my favorite expressions from Warren Buffett was when people are greedy, be fearful. When people are fearful, be greedy. I think nows a good time to buy.

Where do you see the news industry a few years from now?

I think theres going to be some rough roads ahead, but when all the dust settles, local journalism will still be there. Its essential to our society.

Texto completo: A Times editorial

Vaping and e-cigarettes once had a reputation as healthier alternatives to cigarettes, but the overwhelming evidence indicates that rosy sales pitch was inaccurate. As a rising number of e-cigarette users are hospitalized with severe respiratory illnesses, the consequences of vaping are clear and potentially fatal. The Trump administration took a prudent step by proposing a ban on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. In Florida, State Rep. Jackie Toledo, R-Tampa, has filed legislation to raise the legal age to 21 to purchase vaping and tobacco products. Getting e-cigarettes off the market for teenagers and young adults is the right move, and a broader public education campaign is needed to spread the word about the health risks of vaping.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has called vaping an epidemic among young peopleand its an epidemic with real health consequences. At least 380 possible cases of severe pulmonary disease have been reported in 36 states, including Florida, all from patients who said they used e-cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Six deaths have also occurred in six different states. Warnings of the dangers of vaping have spread to social media, with one Facebook post shared 500,000 times from a mother whose 18-year-old was hospitalized in the intensive care unit after vaping.

What makes e-cigarettes so dangerous is that their ingredients can be hard to pin down. They typically contain nicotine, but they also can include lead and cancer-causing chemicals, said the CDC. The e-cigarette cartridges intended for single use are sometimes refilled with substances unknown to the user, according to the CDC, and oils that are used to deliver the drugs can harm patients lungs, reported The New York Times.

Another problem with vaping is it disproportionately appeals to teenagers. A remarkable one in four Florida high school students are using e-cigarettes, says Tobacco Free Florida, but only about 4 percent of Florida adults are vaping, according to the CDC. Teens under the age of 18 are not legally allowed to possess any nicotine products or nicotine-dispensing devices in Florida yet they are still able to get their hands on e-cigarettes, based on the rising numbers. Thats worrisome and indicates that something in the regulation of e-cigarettes and the public information about the risks of using them is not working.

Tampa Bay has experienced the effects of vaping. A community survey showed that about 41 percent of Pinellas County high school students self-reported vaping at one point. The number of tobacco incidents in Hillsborough County Schools has increased from 178 in the 2016-2017 school year to nearly four times that last school year. To combat the increasing phenomenon, Hillsborough superintendent Jeff Eakins and Sheriff Chad Chronister created a PSA video urging students not to vape. The district also sent a message to families warning them of the possible consequences of vaping at school. These are both steps in the right direction and show that school districts have had to step up to discourage students from using e-cigarettes.

Florida and the nation need to better reckon with the problem that vaping marketing has created by suggesting to teenagers that e-cigarettes are a healthy substitute to cigarettes. They are not. In 2014, Florida made the sale of e-cigarettes illegal to those under 18 years of age, but the numbers of teen e-cigarette users in Florida have risen since then. The question is what can we do to stop teenagers from using these dangerous and now life-threatening drugs? The answer must come in the form of stricter regulations, be it banning the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, raising the age to 21 or both.

Texto completo: A photo circulating on social media shows former President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office meeting with a group of men in turbans and, in a Twitter post that includes the photo, the caption reads: "NeverTrumpers, a president meeting with the Taliban, this is horrific!" A Facebook post of the photo falsely claims, "Ronald Reagan meets with the Taliban. ‘These gentlemen are the moral equivalents of America’s Founding Fathers’ — Ronald Reagan, 1985."
The item is untrue on many levels, said PolitiFact.com.
The Taliban didn’t form until the mid 1990s, years after Reagan was out of office. The photo wasn’t taken in 1985, and Reagan never compared the group to the Founding Fathers. The photo is from a Feb. 2, 1983, meeting between the president and Afghan freedom fighters to discuss Soviet atrocities in Afghanistan, PolitiFact said. The quote was likely taken from a Reagan speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 1985, PolitiFact said. Reagan was talking about Nicaraguan rebels when he said, "I’ve spoken recently of the freedom fighters of Nicaragua. You know the truth about them. You know who they’re fighting and why. They are the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance."
The Twitter post, which showed up after President Donald Trump recently announced he had called off a meeting with the Taliban, has been shared more than 1,700 times, PolitiFact said.
Harris didn’t sue Exxon as California AG Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, during a recent climate town hall broadcast on CNN, told viewers she would fight big oil companies that "profit off of harmful behaviors."
Moderator Erin Burnett asked the California senator how she would fight.
"Would you sue them? Sue Exxon Mobil?" Burnett said.
Harris claimed, "I have sued Exxon Mobil."
That statement falls short of the truth, according to PolitiFact.com.
In 2016, when Harris was California’s attorney general, her office investigated Exxon over allegations the organization lied about the risk to its business from climate change, PolitiFact said. But there is no public record and nothing her campaign could provide to show she filed a lawsuit.
"(Harris) launched an investigation into Exxon," campaign spokesman Ian Sams told PolitiFact.
In fact checks other media did on the subject, The New York Times said, "An investigation, yes. A lawsuit, no." CNN said, "Though Harris has sued other big oil companies, she has not sued ExxonMobil."
Cinderella’s Castle not dismantled for hurricane A photo showing the spires being removed from the Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, in preparation for Hurricane Dorian, has been shared hundreds of times on social media.
A caption with the photo reads, "BREAKING: Workers have begun removing spires of Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom ahead of Hurricane Dorian."
The image has been flagged by Facebook as part of its effort to combat false news and misinformation, according to PolitiFact.com.
"It’s just another iteration of a long-running hoax about Florida hurricanes," PolitiFact said.
In the false photo, a crane appears to be lifting a spire off its base and another spire is completely gone. However, in the original photo, the crane is in the same position while it was reportedly being used to remove holiday lights, PolitiFact said. Both spires are intact. In the altered photo, it appears someone cloned the blue sky and placed it over part of one spire and completely removed the other spire from the picture.
Disney World told PolitiFact on Sept. 4 that the theme park would not dismantle the castle in preparation of Hurricane Dorian.
According to PolitiFact, Snopes.com debunked this story in October 2017, but it can be traced back as far as 1997 to a Chicago Tribune story headlined "25 secrets of the Magic Kingdom," which aimed to dispel a rumor that the castle could be taken apart and said the castle is built to withstand hurricane winds.

Texto completo: La vida como agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza (CBP) es insoportable desde que Donald Trump es presidente de Estados Unidos.
Un reporte del New York Times, recoge testimonios sobre lo poco llevadero que ha sido el trabajo de cientos de agentes desde que las políticas antiinmigrantes de Trump se aplican.
Varios reconocieron que están cansados de ser llamados “asesinos de niños” o “vendidos” por los ciudadanos. Algunos solamente comen su almuerzo en restaurantes “amigables con la Patrulla Fronteriza “.
El reportaje, el principal de la edición dominical del diario neoyorquino, también revela que la agencia tiene que lidiar con decenas de renuncias.
“Enjaular personas por actividades que no eran violentas me comía vivo”, dijo un hombre de Arizona que renunció hace un año.
El exagente Chris Harris, que estuvo 21 años en la CBP dijo que lo más difícil para ellos ha sido pasar de ser un grupo al que nadie le daba importancia a uno odiado por la población.
“La moral era pobre en el pasado, pero ahora está en un abismo. Conozco a muchos que quieren irse “, dijo Harris al Times.
La naturaleza del trabajo ha pasado de vigilar la frontera en puntos específicos a atender emergencias médicas y proveer alimentos a bebés, entre otros ejemplos.
La CBP además sufre con problemas de reclutamiento. El artículo dice que tiene 1,800 agentes menos de lo esperado. Agentes se quejan de la falta de infraestructura o dinero para operar lo que ellos asocian como una crisis humanitaria en la frontera.
Un gran número de agentes lamenta la separación de menores o la detención en jaulas de personas enfermas.

Texto completo: 2020 candidates call for Kavanaugh's impeachment amid new allegation
A new sexual misconduct allegation has sparked calls for impeachment by Democratic presidential candidates against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. A New York Times essay published Saturday, adapted from the upcoming book "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation," featured new information corroborating a prior claim of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. The essay also details a previously unreported incident of sexual misconduct, in which another one of Kavanaugh's classmates "saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. " The classmate flagged the report to the FBI, but the agency declined to investigate the incident, according to The New York Times.
In a Sunday morning tweet, President Donald Trump accused the "LameStream Media" and Democrats of colluding to scare Kavanaugh "into turning Liberal. "
And on the left, Democratic presidential candidates former HUD Secretary Julián Castro, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California called for Kavanaugh's impeachment.
Iran denies attacking Saudi Arabian oil facilities, crude oil prices surge
Tensions in the Middle East rose to new heights Sunday as Iran denied involvement in high-stakes drone strikes on key Saudi Arabian oil facilities, warned of its military might and derided "maximum deceit" by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for strikes on the world's largest oil processing facility and a major oil field Saturday. " Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply," Pompeo said. Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's aerospace force, warned Sunday U. S. military assets in the Middle East were within striking distance of Iran's military. “We have been constantly preparing ourselves for a full-fledged war,” Hajizadeh told the Tehran Times. Late Sunday, President Donald Trump said he approved the release of U. S. strategic petroleum reserves “if needed” to stabilize energy markets after the attacks. In a later tweet, he added: "Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!"
How will the drone strikes in Saudi Arabia impact gas prices? Experts say:
Brent crude oil reopened for trading on Saturday at $70. 98 per barrel, almost 20% higher than Friday close on oil futures markets.
Gradual increases may be seen at U. S. gas stations before next weekend depending on how fast Saudi Aramco can revive lost output.
By some estimates, the price per barrel could rise $5 to $10, which translates into 10- to 24-cent increases for gas, diesel and jet fuel.
Countries that receive a bulk of their supply from Saudi Arabia could seek to purchase oil from the U. S. if the Saudi's facilities are offline for an extended period.
UAW plans national strike against General Motors
The United Auto Workers, which represents about 46,000 General Motors workers, has called a nationwide strike against GM that is set to start at midnight on Monday. UAW National Bargaining Committee Chairman Ted Krumm said, "This strike is about us, about standing up for fair wages, for affordable quality health care and for job security. We’re standing up for our temporary employee brothers and sisters who do the same work but for less pay. " GM said its offer to the UAW included more than $7 billion in U. S. investments over the four-year life of a new deal, more than 5,400 jobs, higher pay and what the company said would be improved benefits. The union let the GM contract expire at midnight Saturday, but told autoworkers with Sunday shifts to still report. This marks the first national UAW strike since 2007, when GM workers were out for two days.

Tropical Storm Humberto steers clear of Bahamas, moves north at 7 mph
Residents, rescue teams and aid workers across the storm-battered northern Bahamas could breathe a sigh of relief Sunday when Tropical Storm Humberto steered wide of the beleaguered island nation. The National Hurricane Center said Humberto was located well north of Great Abaco Island and was moving toward the north-northwest at about 7 mph. The Florida coast also won an apparent reprieve, with forecasters predicting Humberto will turn sharply to the northeast early this week and well off the U. S. coast. Still, swells generated by Humberto will affect the U. S. coast from central Florida to North Carolina during the next few day with "life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the Hurricane Center warned. Humberto could threaten Bermuda on Wednesday or Thursday, according to AccuWeather.
College football: Top teams cruise through weekend
College football's elite cruised through the weekend, but a few ranked teams weren't so lucky. Then-No. 19 Michigan State's ugly 10-7 loss at home to Arizona State was made even uglier by a too-many-men penalty that took a game-tying field goal off the board. Occupying the final two spots in the top 25 heading into Saturday, USC and Maryland kept their appearances in the Amway Coaches Poll brief, posting disappointing losses to BYU and Temple, respectively. It was an uneventful weekend at the top – eight of the top nine teams won by double-digits, with the only outlier being No. 9 Florida's 29-21 win over Kentucky.

New Report on Brett Kavanaugh Reopens Debate About Supreme Court Justice; Account of sexual-misconduct allegations spurs Democratic calls for his removal, and a defense from Trump

Texto completo: Political sparring over Justice Brett Kavanaugh's October 2018 confirmation to the Supreme Court flared up Sunday following a fresh news report, with some Democratic presidential candidates calling for his removal from the bench and President Trump defending his court pick.
The New York Times on Sunday published an article about Deborah Ramirez, who had accused Justice Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her during a party at Yale University in the early 1980s. The piece, based on a book planned for publication this week, asserts that others including fellow classmates recalled hearing contemporary accounts of the incident and alleges there might have been another similar episode.
The Wall Street Journal hasn't independently confirmed the reporting. Justice Kavanaugh has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct.
Justice Kavanaugh declined to comment.
The report reopened a fierce and emotional debate in Washington and on the 2020 campaign trail. During the confirmation process last year, the Ramirez allegation surfaced just ahead of a closely watched Senate hearing featuring a woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when they were in high school. That accusation led to a one-week delay in Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation vote while the FBI investigated ; he ultimately was confirmed by the Senate, 50-48.
In tweets Sunday, Mr. Trump called the latest report about Justice Kavanaugh "made up" and said the "lies being told about him are unbelievable." He added: "False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!"d
Meanwhile, a number of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates pointed to the new report to argue Justice Kavanaugh should be removed from office.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.), who drew national attention for her questioning of Justice Kavanaugh during the hearings, tweeted Sunday that Justice Kavanaugh "lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people." She asserted that Justice Kavanaugh "was put on the Court through a sham process," declaring that "he must be impeached."
In her own tweet, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who also backs impeachment of Mr. Trump, said the Kavanaugh nomination "was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him" and called the new report disturbing. "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached," she said.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said in a tweet about Justice Kavanaugh that he supports "any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable."
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said the Democrats had tried to deny Justice Kavanaugh due process and the presumption of innocence. "The far left's willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year's confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate," he tweeted. He added: "I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh."
Removing a justice from the Supreme Court would require impeachment by the Democratic-run House, followed by a conviction, by a supermajority vote, in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell have made judicial nominations a top issue in this administration, seeing the courts as central to conservative priorities such as gun rights and issues such as religious freedom and abortion.

Texto completo: Get ready, couch potatoes. This fall's TV season is more "cross your fingers and hope for the best" than viewers would like -- but the highs have a chance to soar.
Several anthologies, including Ryan Murphy's Netflix debut, may be the standouts of the season. But the schedule, packed with big names, is also littered with flimsy plots. Still, the beauty of TV is the surprises, not the predictable successes.
We're here to help and have weeded through the lineup to help you figure out what's worth your time.Here are the new shows you should watch, give a try and avoid.
What to watch ¦ "Unbelievable" (streaming
now on Netflix): If it's not too traumatizing to watch, and for some it may be, this could be a defining story of the #MeToo movement. "Unbelievable" is a miniseries based on the ProPublica article about a teen (Kaitlyn Dever) accused of lying about her rape and the two female detectives (Merritt Wever and Toni Collette) who believe her.
| "A Little Late with Lilly Singh" (premieres Monday at 1:35 a.m. on NBC): Though the small screen is saturated with talk shows, Lilly Singh is doing something special. The Indian-Canadian YouTube star with almost 15 million subscribers will become the only woman to host a late-night talk show on one of the four major networks when she takes over for Carson Daly.
| "Prodigal Son" (premieres Sept. 23 at 9 p.m. on Fox): In 2019 alone, Michael Sheen has played, to delightful results, a lawyer inspired by Roy Cohn on "The Good Fight" and a literal angel on "Good Omens," so the logical next step, of course, is a serial killer nicknamed The Surgeon. Everything about it is absurd: the serial killer's son (Tom Payne)who hunts serial killers and the ex-wife (Bellamy Young)who drowns her past in pills. Not to mention a truly bizarre and remarkable cast of surrounding characters.
| "The Politician"(premieres Sept. 27 on Netflix): Ryan Murphy, the co-creator behind "Glee," "American Horror Story" and much more, pulled out all the stops for his first show at Netflix, and that's saying a lot. In true Murphy fashion, he's compiled a who's who of Hollywood stars -- including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Lange, Zoey Deutch, Lucy Boynton, Bette Midler, Judith Light, Dylan McDermott and January Jones -- for a show about an entitled California high school student (Ben Platt) and his rise in politics. Murphy might be the busiest man on the West Coast these days, but he hasn't gotten it wrong in a long time.
| "Modern Love" (premieres Oct. 18 on Amazon Video): Anthologies are having a wildly successful run, thanks in large part to the aforementioned Murphy, which brings us to "Modern Love,"based on The New York Times' weekly column about, well, modern love. As is often the case with anthologies,

Former Black Bears celebrate the late UMaine Sports Hall of Fame member whose brain injuries helped spark a major lawsuit against the NFL

Texto completo: Justin Strzelczyk defied the odds.
He didn't play football until he reached West Seneca West high school in New York, a suburb of Buffalo. Yet he developed into an All-American at the University of Maine, was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers and played eight seasons in the National Football League.
On Friday night at Jeff's Catering in Brewer, Strzelczyk was inducted posthumously into the UMaine Sports Hall of Fame.
His sister Melissa, son Justin Jr., daughter Sabrina and several teammates from the Black Bears' 1989 Yankee Conference championship team were on hand to celebrate his induction along with six other individuals and the 1965 Tangerine Bowl football team.
"He loved football and he loved competing," former UMaine teammate Chris Turgeon said. ''He played three times longer than the average NFL player. To be an 11th-round pick and make it in the NFL is incredible."
Strzelczyk died at age 36 on Sept. 30, 2004, in a high-speed crash in New York. He allegedly had been involved in a hit-and-run accident and was trying to elude state troopers when he slammed his pickup into a tanker truck. He was killed instantly.
Former Black Bear Erik Sauter remembered receiving news of Strzelczyk's death.
"It was tragic. It still stings a little bit," Sauter said. "But it's good we can celebrate [his life] with his family here."
Melissa Strzelczyk said her brother's behavior was erratic in the months leading up to his death. He wasn't himself.
"We thought he might be schizophrenic or manic depressive," Melissa said.
It was later discovered that Strzelczyk had been suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease believed to be caused by concussions or other repeated head trauma.
CTE can cause memory loss, depression and dementia. According to a 2007 story in The New York Times, Strzelczyk was the fourth former NFL player initially found to have CTE which, for practical purposes, can only be determined after death.
The diagnosis was made by Dr. Bennet Omalu, a clinical instructor of neuropathy at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. His work was the subject of the 2015 movie "Concussion," which dramatized Omalu's findings and his fight with the NFL, which tried to suppress his discovery.
Strzelczyk's CTE diagnosis helped lead to a class action lawsuit against the league by many former players. The suit alleged the NFL knew about the risks of repetitive head trauma but ignored, minimized or suppressed information making the link between that trauma and cognitive damage.
In 2015, a federal judge gave final approval to a settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players. According to CNN, the agreement provides up to $5 million per player for serious medical conditions associated with head trauma.
A 2017 CNN story reported that 110 of 111 deceased NFL players whose brains were donated for scientific research pertaining to brain trauma exhibited CTE.

Justin Strzelczyk Jr. was 9 when his father died.
"The thing I'll remember most is his big personality," said the younger Strzelczyk, who lives and works in Pittsburgh. "He was funny. He was humble. He didn't like the spotlight."
Justin Strzelczyk enjoyed an outstanding high school career as a basketball, hockey and football player. He didn't play football until high school after his father Conrad, a former Montana State basketball star, encouraged him to do so.
"Our father had a big influence on him," Melissa Strzelczyk said.
He arrived at UMaine as a tight end but was switched to the defensive line, where he achieved All-America status. The relentless Strzelczyk notched 10 sacks in two seasons on defense and helped lead the Black Bears to conference titles and NCAA playoff appearances in 1987 and 1989.
"Our '89 team was a great team and to be able to have someone from that team inducted into the hall of fame makes us feel like we're all being inducted," Turgeon said.
Strzelczyk was selected by Pittsburgh in the 11th round of the 1990 draft. He was discovered by Steelers director of player personnel Tom Donahoe, who nominated him for the hall of fame.
"When we made our head coach Chuck Noll aware of Justin and asked him to watch the tape, he quickly came back and said we need to get this player," Donahoe said.
The 6-foot-6, 305-pound Strzelczyk played 133 NFL games as an offensive lineman from 1990-1998. He started in Super Bowl XXX in 1996, when Dallas beat Pittsburgh 27-17.
He didn't miss a game for seven full NFL seasons, before a series of injuries eventually ended his career.
"During my 16 years with the Steelers, I don't know if we had any players who worked harder than Justin," Donahoe said.
"Justin was a unique character who loved life, his family, Maine and his teammates. There was nothing phony about Justin Stzelczyk," he added.
His former teammates remember him fondly for his approachability, unselfishness and loyalty.
"It was never about him. He celebrated the team," teammate John Pranckevicius said.
Sauter described his teammate as being bigger than life.
"He had a great personality. He never had a bad word to say about anybody," he said.
Strzelczyk's time at UMaine was special to him, according to his sister.
"He made a lot of great friends, lifelong friends," Melissa Strzelczyk said.
The formality of a large hall of fame gathering such as Friday's event may not have been Strzelczyk's cup of tea.
"He probably would have preferred something smaller, maybe a cookout with beers and hot dogs," Mike Smith, another former teammate, said.
"He would have shown up because we're here," Turgeon said.

Texto completo: A Michigan police officer who had Ku Klux Klan memorabilia in his home has been fired.
Charles Anderson, of the Muskegon Police Department, was terminated from his position during a Thursday morning meeting among police officials, Muskegon's city attorney and the human resources department, WOOD-TV reported.
“The City of Muskegon has concluded its internal investigation and the disposition is that Charles Anderson has been terminated,” a news release from the city said.
Frank Peterson, Muskegon's city manager of Muskegon, confirmed Friday to The New York Times that Anderson, who had been on administrative leave since Aug. 8, had been terminated. Peterson said the Muskegon Police Department's report would be released next week, the newspaper reported.
The documents were discovered in early August, when Rob Mathis, seeking to buy a house, toured Anderson's home, which was for sale, WOOD reported.
Mathis posted a photo of the KKK application, which was blank, on Facebook.
On Aug. 8, Anderson's wife, Rachael Anderson, told WOOD her husband, who is white, is not a member of the KKK.
“He can’t say anything right now,” Rachael Anderson said. “I wish we could because it would probably set a lot of things straight.”
Mathis, who is black, said he had a "moral obligation" to post on social media.
"It’s unfortunate that he’s in our community, because he might have put people in jail on false charges, especially minorities," Mathis told the Times. "Because he was a police officer, it was my moral obligation to say something about it.”

Texto completo: Democrats will hold their next presidential debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, a suburb northeast of Columbus.
The Democratic National Committee announced the Oct. 15 debate will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times. A second night could be added if more candidates meet the qualifying criteria.
Donald Trump won Ohio by 8 points in 2016,raising questions about Ohio's battleground state status. The DNC's decision to hold a debate in the Buckeye State was seen as a sign Democrats won't give up Ohio easily.
Friday's announcement ends weeks of speculation the DNC might choose Dayton, where a mass shooter killed nine in August, or Lordstown in Ohio's Mahoning Valley, where General Motors has left thousands of assembly plant employees out of work.
To Ohio Democrats, Westerville and suburban Columbus represent voter demographics changing in their favor. A 2018 national "blue wave" didn't change much in Ohio on the congressional and statewide level. But Democrats picked up six Ohio House seats in suburban districts.
In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in Westerville precincts by about 1,000 votes. President Barack Obama lost in those same precincts by about the same margin.
"What we've seen in the suburbs of Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland and other cities mirrors what has happened in places like Harris County, Texas, and Orange County, California — suburban voters, particularly women, are backing Democratic candidates in response to the broken promises and toxic agenda of Donald Trump," Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said.
Candidates must reach 2% in four DNC-approved polls and record contributions from at least 130,000 unique donors by Oct. 1.
The following candidates have already qualified:
Former Vice President Joe Biden
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro
Sen. Kamala Harris of California
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota
Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont
Tom Steyer, businessman
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts
Andrew Yang, businessman
The debate will be moderated by CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett as well as The Times's national editor, Marc Lacey.

Villain steals show in the Rep's production of 'Tuck Everlasting'

Texto completo: New York critics were mostly unforgiving of "Tuck Everlasting" when it had a very brief run on Broadway in 2016. One notable exception: The New York Times named it a critic's pick. But that wasn't enough to save the musical, which closed after only 39 performances.
One thing that united critics was praise for a dance sequence, late in the show, that beautifully and wordlessly summarizes the circle of life, the changing of seasons, the path of humanity. At Orlando Repertory Theatre, choreographed by Lindsey D. Smith, the segment remains an impressively potent source of emotion.
The Rep's slightly condensed theater-for-young-audiences production of "Tuck Everlasting," directed by Steve MacKinnon, has plenty of other lovely moments, augmented by George Jackson's lush lighting of Vandy Wood's woodsy set. The vibrant greens and blues make you feel the life force in the story's Treegap woods.
Based on Natalie Babbitt's award-winning 1975 novel, the musical "Tuck Everlasting" tells the story of 11-year-old Winnie Foster, who meets Ma and Pa Tuck, along with their sons Miles and Jesse. They seem to be young men - Jesse says he is 17 - but in reality they are more than 100 year old. The family has drunk from a magical spring that has made them immortal.
The villain of the story, a carnival barker known as The Man In the Yellow Suit, is hot on their trail - hoping to find the magical spring himself and profit from its water.
There are deep themes at work here: What does it mean to truly live, chief among them, as the Tucks find out immortality isn't as great as you might think.
In this version, for young audiences, the dark side of living forever - and watching those you love die - is glossed over somewhat. That's understandable. But what's more puzzling is how the climactic moment of the show - will Winnie join the Tucks in immortality? - is both underwritten and underplayed. The whole show, as written, feels at times like it's merely moving from point A to point B, but MacKinnon does good work at adding energy wherever he can.
Victoria Salisbury makes a plucky and appealing Winnie. Noel-Marie Watson and Pat Clark nicely ground the fanciful concept as the plainspoken and practical Tuck parents. Jared Warren conveys Jesse's general mischievousness without making him obnoxious. In a smaller role, Bobbie Bell adds a dash of fun as a police inspector.
But Ralph Prentice Daniel, as the villainous Man in the Yellow Suit, is the scene-stealer here. With the perfect mix of comedy and menace, he struts and slinks across the stage. If he had a handlebar mustache, you just know he'd be twirling it.
Daniel also sings perhaps the most memorable song in the rather wan score - "Everything's Golden," a tribute to longed-for riches. It's a variant on the show's underlying message that pursuing anything shouldn't stop us from living for each day.

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?

Rub a clove of garlic on thick baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with shredded Manchego, Parmesan, or leave plain.
Run under broiler.
Late summer gazpacho aka best gazpacho Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.

Abortion, the economy and more: What wasn't asked at the 3rd Dem debate

Texto completo: The third Democratic presidential debate was nearly three hours long, and featured 10 primary candidates who battled it out over how far left the party should go.
On the whole, candidates spent the most time talking about health care (over 20 minutes, according to The New York Times' tracker). They also spoke at length on gun control, civil rights and education (all at about 12 minutes of speaking time).
But there were a few important policy topics that ABC and Univision moderators did not ask about during the marathon affair, and some critics argue that we heard talking points that were only repeats of previous debates. Others took issue with some questions they felt should not have been asked at all.
Could that time have been better spent? Here are some key issues not asked about at the debate:
Abortion
Pro-abortion rights activists, including some candidates, noticed the absence of discussion on reproductive rights despite a heavy focus on health care.
The word "abortion" was not uttered once in Thursday's debate, by either moderator or candidate.
California Sen. Kamala Harris and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, tweeted their disapproval within minutes of the debate's close.
"Three hours, not one question on abortion—with women's rights under attack across our country," O'Rourke said.
In the last several months, conservative-leaning states have passed sweeping anti-abortion legislation. Attempts at bans after certain points in a pregnancy in Missouri, Georgia, Arkansas and Ohio have been tied up in court battles.
President Donald Trump's administration also enacted a rule that bars federal Title X funding from going to organizations that provide abortions or referrals for abortions, a move that led to Planned Parenthood's exit from the funding program.
Harris has stated that she would reverse the Title X "gag rule" on her first day in office as president.
At the first round of Democratic debates in June, candidates tried to prove their commitment to reproductive rights issues.
“I don’t believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice,” former Obama cabinet official Julián Castro said at the time.
The candidates broadly have similar goals when it comes to abortion. They all want it to be legal, but have varying ideas on late-term restrictions.
Voters might have benefited from hearing Vice President Joe Biden further clarify what has been an evolving stance on abortion. And Castro could have followed up on his June flub when he mistakenly said that transgender women would benefit from access to abortion (He later clarified that he meant trans men and gender-nonconforming people).
More on the economy
The economy is a subject that is interwoven with other policy issues, like health care and climate change, topics that candidates spoke about at length last night. But moderators did not choose the economy as a specific focus.
Yet the economy is perhaps Trump's strongest re-election platform. He's touted what he sees as the "greatest economy in the history of our Country" with low unemployment rates.
As Democrats spoke on the debate stage, Trump was speaking to House Republicans at a retreat, where he said he was working on plan to cut middle-income taxes.
Americans have said they anticipate the oncoming of another economic recession. A recent ABC News/Washington Post survey found that 60% of Americans had this fear.
Some candidates invoked talk of job creation, a living wage and taxes in their opening statements, but did not find much of an opportunity to expand on those and more topics related to the economy.
In a larger back-and-forth on health care, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were questioned about how their universal health insurance plans would affect taxes on the middle class in order to see lower health care costs.
And job creation was touched upon briefly in relation to clean energy and climate change measures. Candidates were asked about Trump's tariffs and trade war with China.
"We've got a guy in the White House who has been erratic on trade policy. He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly born out of his fragile ego," Harris said of Trump's actions on trade with China.
No mention was made of plans for affordable housing, the gender wage gap, the national debt, unemployment rates and other election issues.
LGBT issues
Though some candidates will participate in a town hall discussion on LGBT issues hosted by CNN in October, the topic did not come up in the debate forum where candidates had the opportunity to address one another.
Notably, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the only openly LGBT person in the race, shared a story about the adversity he has faced as a gay man.
And the candidates have all come out strongly against Trump administration actions on LGBT policy issues.
Many have pledged to reverse Trump's ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. They all strongly support the Equality Act, which would prohibit workplace discrimination against gender identity and sexual orientation. And they have been outspoken against Trump rollbacks on certain Obama-era protections against discrimination.
The debate stage would have been a good forum to flesh out those policies, advocates said.
"The Trump Administration has spent the last three years rolling back rights for LGBTQ and other marginalized communities, and it’s imperative that LGBTQ people and the issues affecting our lives and our families not be overlooked in this Presidential election," said the president of LGBT advocacy group GLAAD, Sarah Kate Ellis, in a statement. "Next week's LGBTQ Forum in Iowa will correct the pattern we have seen in the first round of debates that have left LGBTQ people largely out of the conversation. "
GLAAD will be co-sponsoring another presidential forum on LGBT issues on Sept. 20.
What was asked instead?
Debate watchers were quick to point out what they saw as frivolous questions by the debate moderators last night.
Univision anchor Jorge Ramos asked Sen. Cory Booker about veganism.
"You are a vegan since 2014," Ramos asked, in a question about how eating less meat might affect the environment. "So should more Americans, including those here in Texas and in Iowa follow your diet?"
"You know, first of all, I want to say no. Actually, I want to translate that into Spanish: No," Booker responded to laughter from the audience.
The debate's closing question by ABC's George Stephanopoulos sounded more like a job interview question than a policy question: "What's the most significant professional setback you've had to face? How did you recover from it? And what did you learn from it?"

Bolt d'Oro trainer: Suit possible over scandal

Texto completo: Owner and trainer of 2018 Santa Anita Derby runner-up Bolt d'Oro, Mick Ruis has a vested interest in Wednesday's report that Justify tested positive for a banned substance after winning that race by 3 lengths and going on to win the Triple Crown.
Reached by telephone Thursday afternoon, Ruis said he is considering a lawsuit over the Santa Anita Derby result. Justify earned $600,000 as the winner of the Santa Anita Derby. Bolt d'Oro earned $200,000 as the runner-up.
Ruis accused the California Horse Racing Board of protecting Justify trainer Bob Baffert, a two-time Triple Crown winner and Hall of Famer.
"I think it warrants (a lawsuit)," Ruis said. "The rule was if there was any of that (drug) found, you were disqualified and you had to give up the purse money. Then they never tell anybody that they found out about it. ...
"It's just real disappointing how we have different sets of rules for different people there in Santa Anita. The horse tested positive. Why didn't anybody know about it until now?"
According to the New York Times report, Justify tested positive for the banned substance scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby on April 7, 2018. Had Justify not finished among the top two finishers in the Santa Anita Derby, he would not have qualified for the Kentucky Derby. A failed drug test would have meant disqualification from the Santa Anita Derby and no entry into the Kentucky Derby.
"Instead of the failed drug test causing a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results," the New York Times reported.
Baffert defended himself and Justify on Thursday, saying he never intentionally administered scopolamine to any of his horses.
"I am proud to stand by (Justify's) record and my own," Baffert said.
Bolt d'Oro went on to run in the Kentucky Derby, finishing 12th. He raced just once more after that, finishing 11th in the Grade 1 Runhappy Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont.
Ruis said as a sign of protest he will scratch a horse of his, C Falls, from a $40,000 maiden special weight race Saturday at Los Alamitos. Baffert also has a horse, Fay Dan, entered in the race.
'It's like, 'Why do I want to run against someone who runs against different rules?'" Ruis said.
The incident is likely to increase the outcry from some factions for a national governing body.
"We have more than 30 governing bodies in our sport," said Pat Cummings of the Thoroughbred Idea Foundation, a privately-funded industry think tank. "That on its own is problematic. ... There are elements of our sport that are all very different, where our states don't agree on the fundamentals of how the sport is adjudicated. If anyone wants to suggest that we would be better off with one governing body, as opposed to 30, I'd say yes, absolutely."
Ruis said he would "100 percent" support a national governing body to handle situations such as this one.
"It's got to stop," Ruis said. "People like to say this isn't good for horse racing right now. I think it's the best thing for horse racing right now. We all know things have been going on. We train next to people every day. Some people are afraid to say stuff. ...
"We have our California Horse Racing Board, and a couple of them have Bob training for them? What is that? Is that not a conflict of interest or what?"

Texto completo: President Donald Trump crossed into literal old-man-yells-at-clouds territory with his one-man crusade to retroactively change the weather. For a while, it was amusing, in a baffling sort of way. But nobody's laughing now.
Inaccurate weather information can endanger lives. And new reports suggest that Trump was not only wrong, he and members of his administration pressured scientists to back him and undercut the front-line forecasters at the National Weather Service.
"Sharpiegate" began with Trump's outdated Sept.1 tweet that Alabama was in the path of Hurricane Dorian. "In addition to Florida -- South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!"
Within 20 minutes, the National Weather Service in Birmingham, desperate not to cause unnecessary panic, sent out a tweet correcting the president's error: "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east."
Mistakes like this can happen, especially when you are trying to get a handle on events in real time. The important thing is that those mistakes are corrected, as happened here. Anyone else would have shrugged their shoulders and moved on. Not Trump.
A few days later, in a bizarre effort to convince America that Alabama really had been at risk from Dorian, Trump appeared in the Oval Office with an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map that had been altered with a felt tip pen. He spent the week insisting he was correct. All this culminated Friday with an unsigned statement from NOAA that said Trump had been right on Sept. 1 and the National Weather Service was wrong.
Just the start of bending truth
The statement pointed to models showing that, when Trump sent his tweet, there was a less than 10% probability of a tiny sliver of eastern Alabama seeing winds of at least 39 miles per hour. National Weather Service forecasters were correct to publicly contradict Trump's freelance hurricane warning. It was shameful for NOAA to throw them under the bus. There's a reason the statement wasn't signed.
You would have hoped that predicting the weather would be one area of government activity immune to improper presidential influence, but no. In fact, The Washington Post and The New York Times, citing unnamed senior administration officials and people familiar with the events, reported that Trump himself pressured his staff to contradict the Birmingham forecasters.
All of this is cause for grave concern.
First, it's a public display of Trump's flagrant disregard for expertise and his refusal to admit error. It's one thing to see him show an old weather map hand-corrected with a Sharpie. But will he do the same thing with intelligence data on North Korea's missile program? That wouldn't be quite so hilarious.
Second, Trump's apparent willingness to force federal agencies like NOAA to publicly bend the truth in support of his favorite version of reality is unlikely to be limited to weather maps. Does anyone really think that he won't apply the same pressures to the Bureau of Labor Statistics if the unemployment figures start to "contradict" him, or the Bureau of Economic Analysis if growth starts to slow?
Finally, it has become increasingly obvious that there's something wrong with the president, and it's getting worse. His obsession --there's no other word for it -- with convincing people he was correct about Alabama being in Dorian's path is deeply unsettling.
Expose improper influence
Perhaps most disturbing of all is Trump's belief that his hand-corrected weather map would somehow prove something. This is delusional and evidence of an inability to think critically. His claim that he had never heard of an actual Category 5 hurricane even though there have been three others during his presidency is further evidence of serious cognitive dysfunction. Last October, Hurricane Michael was a Category5 when it made landfall in Florida. This isn't the sort of thing a person forgets, especially a person in charge of disaster response.
In an email to his staff that was later made public, Craig McLean, NOAA's assistant administrator for research, said he is investigating the "very concerning" episode. Beyond that, Sharpiegate gives Congress a perfect opportunity to pry the lid off the problem of improper presidential influence. There's no classified data involved, and even Trump can't claim executive privilege over weather reports.
Trump's willingness to politicize everything from the Justice Department to the National Weather Service is going to be an increasingly serious problem as we head into the 2020 election. Exposing the details of his efforts to influence NOAA to some congressional sunshine will send a message: There will be accountability, so mind what you do. Congress may not be able to stop Trump from lying. But maybe it can help ordinary federal employees stand up for the truth.

Texto completo: FDA oversight of
vaping is overdue
How did vaping escape the scrutiny of the FDA before marketing was allowed?
The crucial statement in the Sentinel editorial ("Treat vaping like the crisis it is," Sept. 12) is: "Lungs were not designed to inhale liquids."
I've been using this fact to discourage young relatives from vaping.
Using a chemically laden vapor as a nicotine delivery system is about the same as living in the smog of many larger cities in the recent past. That condition was addressed as an impending disaster. The difference is that with vaping, the users carry their own personal smog around with them, annoying others, and under the delusion they can have their health and nicotine too.

Rubio should step
up on red-flag laws
In a recent New York Times op-ed, Sen. Marco Rubio made a good case for broadening federal red-flag laws. But without action, his words are meaningless.
If Marco Rubio really believes that bipartisan legislation could address our country's gun violence epidemic, he should publicly demand that his colleague Mitch McConnell hold a vote on it.
In Florida, we've seen two of the worst mass shootings in history happen in the last three years, not to mention the hundreds who are victims of gun violence every single day. Sen. Rubio owes it to his constituents to be a leader in this cause - and not just on paper. Here's hoping he's up to the challenge for once.

To protect cats,
keep them inside
My heart breaks for Michelle Conklin and the loss of her cat, Thomas, to a coyote ("Neighbors on alert as coyotes kill cats," Sept. 11). The honest truth is that cats who are left outside are not safe.
We have so many predators in Florida. Large hawks, eagles, stray dogs, gators and now we have the coyotes to contend with. If you truly love your cat, you will keep them inside or make sure you are with them every minute outside. They will adjust to being inside if they have been outdoor cats. If they have been spayed and neutered they will find your home a "safe haven."
I read, almost every day how someone's cat has disappeared. They are generally outside cats. It makes me sad but even more so it makes me angry. If people truly cared about their cats they would not leave them outside to face the dangers.

Raise voting age to 21?
Why stop there?
Rob Petersen suggests raising the voting age for Americans to 21 years ("Shouldn't voting age be 21, too?" Sept. 8). There may be merit to that. We might also want to consider cutting off voting rights when one reaches 70 years of age. Having gone past that marker myself, I realize how less agile my brain is now than when I was 18. Oh, just to remember what I went into the next room to fetch.

Texto completo: Cabinet members to lend prestige to paying customers of Trump business
Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were scheduled to speak this week at President Trump's hotel in Washington - lending their names to events put on by a paying customer of Trump's private business.
The planned speeches suggest that Trump and his Cabinet are not shying away from events that drive revenue to the president's company, even after multiple stories have brought new scrutiny to the blurring of lines between Trump's business and presidency.
Pence spoke Thursday night at the hotel, during a gala put on by the Concerned Women for America, a 40-year-old conservative nonprofit organization that says it promotes "Biblical values and Constitutional principles." Tickets to that event cost at least $99, according to the group's website.
Pompeo will speak at a separate event at the Trump hotel on Friday, a "celebration luncheon" held by the same conservative group, his staff said.
Neither the conservative group nor the Trump Organization answered questions about how much these events cost. But similar events in the hotel's ballrooms have cost in the tens of thousands of dollars, according to hotel documents reviewed by The Washington Post.
Spokespeople for Pence and Pompeo defended the speeches, saying the appearances did not steer this business to the president's hotel, as the nonprofit had already chosen the venue before inviting the two officials. They said the appearances had been vetted for ethical or legal concerns and approved by others in the White House and the State Department.
The spokespeople for Pence and Pompeo spoke on the condition that they not be named to describe internal discussions.
The chief of staff for the Concerned Women of America, Toni DeLancey, declined to answer detailed questions about the event. She issued a brief statement that praised the Trump hotel's "outstanding service."
"This is a historic milestone for us, and we wanted our activists to feel valued and to experience the best accommodations Washington, D.C. has to offer," DeLancey said in the statement.
The planned appearances by Pompeo and Pence were previously reported by the New York Times and journalist Zach Everson.
Pompeo and Pence visit the hotel at a time when Trump and his administration seem to be giving up on a bedrock promise of his presidency: that he would never use his public power to boost his private business.
"I will be leaving my great business in total," Trump said before he took office. He kept ownership of the business but said he would follow self-imposed guidelines to avoid even the appearance that he was intermingling the presidency and his business.
But in the past few weeks, Trump and top aides have made repeated moves that brought publicity, revenue or both to Trump properties.
In the past month alone, Trump proposed holding the massive Group of Seven summit of world leaders at his struggling golf resort in Doral, Fla.
In addition, The Post reported that Attorney General William P. Barr has booked a ballroom at Trump's Washington hotel for a large holiday party, which will cost in excess of $30,000.
And Pence built a major detour into an official, taxpayer-funded trip to Ireland that allowed him to stay at a Trump-owned golf resort, 140 miles from his meetings.
Afterward, the Democratic-led House Oversight Committee said it was launching an investigation into whether Pence had acted improperly to enrich the president.
This week's speeches by Pence and Pompeo follow a slightly different pattern: Instead of boosting Trump's business directly, they will lend their prestige to one of Trump's customers.
Walter Shaub, who previously led the Office of Government Ethics, said that sends a signal to other potential customers - which could bring Trump more money. The signal, Shaub said, is: "The administration is sweetening the pot for outside groups to rent space in Trump's properties by offering up the vice president or the secretary of state. Or, in this case, both."
Shaub, who left office early in Trump's term, now works at the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). He has been a frequent Trump critic.
In this case, he said, there are no conflict-of-interest laws that would bar Pence or Pompeo from doing this. But, he said, their actions undermine the honor system that was supposed to stop presidents from enriching themselves in office. He said that honor system could be in total disrepair by the time Trump leaves office.
Even before Thursday's speech, Pence was a frequent guest at Trump's properties.
CREW, the watchdog group, has counted at least 11 previous instances where Pence spoke to a gathering put on by a paying customer at Trump's hotel.
In some cases, the customer was Pence's PAC, called Great America Committee. Pence's PAC has spent more than $200,000 on three events at the Trump hotel in Washington since the start of 2018.
For Pompeo, however, Friday's speech appears to be something unusual.
Neither CREW nor Everson - the journalist who has tracked appearances by 24 current or former Cabinet members at Trump's Washington hotel - could identify a past instance where Pompeo headlined an event at the hotel. Pompeo's spokesperson declined to comment on that question.

Texto completo: The death last week of 91-year-old T. Boone Pickens, the southwest oilman, corporate raider, hedge funder, and philanthropist, reminds us that business tycoons in America used to be more interesting characters than they are now.

The late 20th century was full of them: 1950s whiz-kid technocrats, conglomerate kings of the 1960s, and corporate raiders and junk bond warriors of the 1980s — that's where Pickens comes in — were very different people from the current crop of dot-com moguls and programmers who camp at the heights of American capitalism. Earnest, reclusive, tight-lipped, and dressed for weekends, equally devoted to amassing more billions while saving the world, the princes of Silicon Valley would scarcely be recognized in public without their phalanx of bodyguards and press agents.

That could hardly be said of Pickens. The handsome, not-especially-tall Texan was affable, approachable, and possessed that rarest of celebrity features: a self-deprecating sense of humor. Married and divorced five times, the recent decline in his health, he explained, was accelerated by a "Texas-sized fall."

He seemed to enjoy making money for the sake of making money, and he didn't appear overly concerned about his legacy. His philanthropies were equally institutional and political. Having helped to finance the Swift Vote Veterans for Truth campaign against Sen. John Kerry’s presidential candidacy in 2004, he offered to work with Kerry six years later in support of alternative energy sources. "That's a long time ago," he told the New York Times. "When you're old, you can't remember that far back."

Like many architects of wealth, Pickens seems to have been propelled by boredom as much as restlessness. The son of a lawyer for Phillips Petroleum, he earned a degree in geology at Oklahoma State and went to work in search of resources for his father's old employer. It didn’t take the young Pickens too long to grasp that it was more profitable to search for oil on his own than as a corporate employee. With a $2,500 stake, he founded his own oil and natural gas wildcatting firm in 1956, which was quickly successful and went public eight years later as the Mesa Petroleum Company.

By the 1970s and early ’80s, thwarted in his efforts to broaden his business by purchasing larger energy companies, he settled on a novel, and distinctly unfriendly, tactic. Persuaded that the big oil concerns were poorly run by self-protective management and complacent boards, he deployed the resources of Mesa to purchase large blocs of stock to gain control of, or at least earn a voice in, corporate governance. This, in turn, prompted his takeover targets, including Gulf Oil, Unocal, Cities Service, and Phillips, to buy back his shares at premium prices to fend off Pickens’ takeover bids.

This strategy of "greenmail" failed in the sense that he never acquired any of his targets, although Gulf was forced to defend itself by merging with Chevron Corporation. But Pickens made billions in the process and became something of a folk hero with his populist notion that corporate boardrooms were dedicated largely to preserving their power at the expense of investors and consumers.

Whether he intended to or not, Pickens revolutionized corporate behavior to this day, forcing boards and executives alike to treat "shareholder value" as their prime responsibility. As with many reforms, of course, Pickens' sword was double-edged: Companies tend to concentrate on short-term goals pleasing to shareholders at the expense of long-range planning and investment. But corporate culture has benefited as well. Managers and boards take their duties seriously, owners of stock are seriously enriched, and the country's economy keeps growing.

For his part, after shaking up corporate America, Pickens himself was shaken by irony. Having overextended his own company in expanding its natural gas production, he lost control of Mesa in 1996 but then recouped his fortunes by founding a profitable hedge fund and devoting his old age to a suitably brash campaign (the "Pickens Plan") for American energy self-sufficiency. Wall Street's verdict on that one remains unclear.

New York Times buries details about Houston activist facing deportation

Texto completo: It is a tearjerker of a story — until you get four paragraphs deep.
The New York Times reported this week that a well-liked Houston activist who has worked tirelessly for the local Guatemalan community faces deportation after he invited officials from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to attend a public meeting on deportation proceedings.
The first three paragraphs of the Times article, titled “A Houston Activist Invited ICE to a Community Meeting. Now, He Faces Deportation,” prime the reader specifically to sympathize with businessman Roland Gramajo.
The article begins like this:
In August, Roland Gramajo, a Houston businessman and celebrated advocate in the local Guatemalan community, helped organize a town-hall meeting to quell fears about recent federal immigration raids. He invited community activists from across the country. He also invited members of Congress. He even invited officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to talk about what rights people had and didn’t have if they were confronted by the authorities. But three weeks after the meeting, it is Mr. Gramajo who faces deportation. He was arrested near his home last Thursday, a move that has stunned his family and rekindled concerns that the Trump administration is targeting advocates as part of its crackdown on illegal immigration.
The Times has its audience captive. It is nearly impossible not to be on this man’s side. But then, the paper hits its readers with this paragraph:
Mr. Gramajo had been staying in the country illegally — raising his five children, running a business in Houston and helping fellow immigrants with translations — without contact from ICE for about 15 years. Last year, the Houston City Council formally commended Mr. Gramajo for being an “outstanding leader." Now, many are wondering if it wasn’t Mr. Gramajo’s entreaty to ICE that drew the agency’s scrutiny.
What did Gramajo and the Times expect? The man has been in the United States illegally (operating a business no less!) for more than a decade. He then very boldly invited ICE to a public meeting on immigration enforcement. As a result of his own bravado, Gramajo now faces deportation. Yet the Times frames the story as one where Trump administration officials are guilty of “targeting activists” who are “helping” illegal immigrants?
Contra the Times' misleading framing, it doesn't sound to me like the administration ever went out looking for this guy at all. He practically turned himself in.
This is how Hot Air’s Jazz Shaw sums up Gramajo's story as told by the Times: “Illegal Immigrant Invites ICE To Town Hall. Is Shocked To Find He’s Being Deported.”
I have to say I agree. You can’t dare ICE officials to do something and then act surprised when they take you up on it.

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump on Wednesday urged that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero or even usher in negative rates, suggesting a last-ditch monetary policy tactic tested abroad but never in America.
His comments came just one day before European policymakers are widely expected to cut a key rate further into negative territory.
In a series of tweets, Trump said that “The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt,” adding that “the USA should always be paying the the lowest rate.”
Trump continued to criticize his handpicked Fed chair, Jerome Powell, saying “it is only the naïveté of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn’t allow us to do what other countries are already doing.”
He concluded by calling Powell, whom he nominated to head the central bank in 2017, and his Fed colleagues “Boneheads.”
The president’s call for negative rates is a significant escalation from what the White House was demanding from the Fed even six months ago. Trump and his colleagues have quickly gone from calling for a moderate rate cut to urging negative borrowing costs.
Trump’s economic advisers met Wednesday to continue discussing ways to push through more tax cuts, such as a payroll tax cut, along with the legality of using executive authority to index capital gains to inflation, according to an administration official.
The president has said repeatedly that the economy is doing “great” and has accused the news media and Democrats of trying to sow economic uncertainty. Trump’s optimistic economic diagnosis makes his demand for negative rates all the more striking.
But Trump increasingly sees the global economy as a winner-take-all game, one in which countries compete on exchange and interest rates. The president has repeatedly criticized other governments for trying to protect their economies by lowering rates or providing more stimulus, viewing those actions as working against America’s growth.
Negative rates, which have been used in economies including Japan, Switzerland and the eurozone, mean that savers are penalized and borrowers rewarded: Their goal is to reduce borrowing costs for households and companies to encourage spending. But they come at a cost, curbing bank profitability.

Texto completo: OK, concerned citizens, it’s debate time. Come back here and sit down! This is important. Let’s see if you’re prepared.
First, name the 10 Democratic presidential candidates who will be sharing the stage Thursday night. Give yourself a big pat on the back if you got them all. Light tap on the shoulder if you got six or seven.
If you failed to remember Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, just leave the room. Admit it. You’re not going to watch this thing at all, are you?
Those of you who have demonstrated your commitment should now recall the debate goes on for three hours.
But there’s lots to look forward to! Will Beto O’Rourke obey the Democratic National Committee ban on “foul language”? He’s been using it a lot, particularly since the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, when he laced into Donald Trump: “He’s been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. I don’t know, like, members of the press, what the (expletive)?”
Now this was totally understandable, given the terrible tragedy and Trump’s appalling history of racism. However, it’s one thing to blurt out a four-letter word at a moment of great stress. It’s another to have your campaign sell T-shirts that say repeatedly “THIS IS F*CKED UP.”
And what about Joe Biden? Everybody’s waiting to see if Biden will do something … strange. Maybe refer to one of the questioners as “Mom.” Or start telling stories about his adventures in a M*A*S*H unit in the Korean War, forgetting that was a TV series.
So, we’ll be watching to see if Biden bloops or Beto bleeps. Two deeply different matters, since so far in this campaign, swearing is pretty much the only area where O’Rourke is leading the pack. And nobody really cares that Biden accidentally called the president “Donald Hump.” Admit it — you chortled.
At the debate, our former vice president will be squished in between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. That in itself should make it worth tuning in. If things go well, Biden could market T-shirts bragging “It’s Cool To Be In The Middle.”
There’s a popular presumption that Biden needs to perform at least decently in these events if he wants to win the nomination. But having trouble handling Warren in verbal combat is way different from being able to hold your own against Donald Trump. Particularly when the subject gets to whether a president should make up his own weather maps.
How much of the audience will be thinking about age? Biden, as the whole world knows, will soon turn 77. And Sanders is 78. Warren is 70, but she campaigns like a maniac — her record for posing for selfies with her fans has probably passed 45,000 by now.
Biden is taking things fairly easy, in a world where hitting 13 events in three weeks is sort of like goofing off. Still, if he can stand up on the stage for three hours trying to look both genial and hard-charging, that’s a pretty good sign that his age doesn’t matter.
Or at least doesn’t matter above all else. There are a few troubling precedents. One of the presidents who was oldest at the time of his inauguration, William Henry Harrison, died after a month in office. And the very oldest, Donald Trump, has been known to forget which country his father was born in.
Meanwhile, I’m betting Kamala Harris, 54, will try to vie with Pete Buttigieg, 37, in an appeal to the youth vote. Only saying that because she just sent out an anti-Trump fundraising email with the subject line “This dude’s gotta go.”
It’s sometimes a little hard to keep track of the actual issues when everybody’s vying to be youthful/likable/powerful/memorable/not-disaster-prone. Warren and Biden’s history of fighting over financial law will surely surface. They tangled in 2005 when credit companies wanted to make it harder for average Americans to declare bankruptcy. She sided with average Americans and he sided with, um, the banks. Which of them do you think will try to bring that up?
Happy to report there will no longer be any questions in which everybody has to raise a hand. (“Do you think a mass murderer who once assaulted a beloved guard who was the sole support of 14 grandchildren should be allowed to vote? Yes or no?”)
This is, of course, only one step in the long road toward … next year. Another debate is coming in October, which will probably have even more people. Remember the other candidates? How many can you name? Five? Fantastic. Eight? You’re beginning to get me a little worried.
One of them, Tom Steyer, has already qualified for the next round. He’s the billionaire who keeps running ads saying that he’s a better businessman than Donald Trump.
What do you think about that?
A) My cousin Fred who runs a pickle stand is a better businessman than Donald Trump.
B) Is Steyer’s slogan going to be “What this country needs is a hedge fund manager in the White House”?
C) Just promise me I won’t ever have to listen to Bill de Blasio.
Have a great debate night. Probably a good idea to skip the drinking games. There have been some suggestions you should take a shot every time somebody says “existential threat,” but remember, we’re talking about three hours here.

Texto completo: “Everybody talks about the weather,” a well-known writer once said, “but nobody does anything about it.”  
This adage is being put to the test after the Trump administration apparently pressured the National Weather Service to alter its forecast for Hurricane Dorian.
It all began on the morning of Sunday, Sept. 1, when President Donald Trump tweeted that Alabama lay in the path of Hurricane Dorian. Twenty minutes later the National Weather Service’s Birmingham, Alabama, office tweeted that the storm posed no threat to Alabamans. The president dug in his heels, appearing on television Wednesday with a map that was apparently altered to include a corner of Alabama in Dorian’s cone of uncertainty. 
All of this would have little more than fodder for late-night comedians (and it was), except that it spilled over into the actual operations of a federal bureau tasked with ensuring public safety. On Sept. 6, the National Weather Service’s parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, took the unusual step of issuing an unsigned statement repudiating the Birmingham tweet.
And this week, the Democrat-controlled House Science Committee began investigating the matter, including what chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas called an “alleged threat” by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross “to fire NOAA political officials if they did not fall in line with the White House’s misleading statements.” According to a New York Times report, Mr. Trump personally asked his chief of staff to pressure the weather service to “clarify” its forecast.
How much, really, should we care about this? Some observers say that, while in one sense it was all literally about a passing storm, the incident is becoming a parable for the importance of scientific integrity – and one which has resonance because the subject matter spans partisan divides.  
“The weight of it could be measured in the potential harm that it’s going to do the public,” says Joe Friday, a lifelong Republican and a professor emeritus at the University of Oklahoma School of Meteorology. “One of the most conservative things you can do is try to insist that American lives and property are protected, and that is the mission of the National Weather Service.” 
Public safety at stake Professor Friday knows firsthand about the politicization of science and its effects. He served as director of the National Weather Service from 1988 to 1997, before being pushed out by the Clinton administration over what sources inside the agency at the time said was his candor over the severity of budget cuts.
“I am very, very much familiar with the deep devotion and integrity that the men and women of the weather service have in carrying out their jobs,” he says. “I have witnessed them watching a tornado go over their own housing area and still maintain the type of support they need for the emergency managers and first responders, all while they were unsure of what was happening to their own families.”
Professor Friday argues that this recent controversy is less about political ideology and more about the dynamics of the president’s psyche.
“The only thing that was at stake here was one individual’s ego,” he says. “And he valued that ego more than he valued the population of Alabama.”
Some emergency-response experts note that, just as public safety can be hampered by official failures to warn, it can also be affected if inaccurate warnings are given. (Not least because false alarms can erode an agency’s credibility.)
Still, what’s being dubbed “Sharpiegate” – after the brand of marker apparently used in altering a map the president pointed to – is just one in a string of instances of the Trump administration politicizing science. Alleged suppression of science on climate change, for example, may have much larger and longer-lasting effects on the nation and its policies.
Yet in some ways “Sharpiegate” has become the most flagrant case, and the public’s attention to it may spark change, says Michael Halpern, the deputy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Center for Science & Democracy.
“This is tangible. Everybody knows their local weather person, and they trust weather forecasters,” he says. “It’s been very encouraging to see the meteorology community come together to support their peers and to demand that this kind of thing never happen again.”
A “war on institutions”? Mr. Halpern, an expert on political interference in science, says members of both political parties have attempted to politicize the work of government scientists, but says Mr. Trump has been taking it to a more extreme level. 
“The Obama administration was not great when it came to allowing people to access experts,” Mr. Halpern says. “Many journalists argued that they were actually worse [than the George W. Bush administration]. ... But clearly the Trump administration is worse in both scope and severity when it comes to sidelining science from policymaking and public information.”
The Union of Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy nonprofit, says it has documented more than 100 attacks on science from the Trump administration, more than what the George W. Bush administration accumulated over its two terms. Mr. Halpern sees it as part of a larger attack by the Trump administration on groups that aim to provide objective information, including the media, the judiciary, and government-funded research institutes.
“I don’t think science is being singled out in any particular way,” says Mr. Halpern. “I think it’s war on institutions. It’s trying to bring down any kind of institution that is there to provide information that could speak truth to power.”
Science bill in Congress In July, Mr. Halpern testified before Congress to promote the Scientific Integrity Act, a bill that would protect government scientists from political interference and give them the right to share their findings with the public. The bill, which has 192 House co-sponsors, would create a uniform code of scientific ethics for all federal agencies, one that would supersede the patchwork of codes and statements created under a mandate from the Obama administration.
During the hearing, he said witnesses took aim at both the Obama and Trump administrations. 
“I think that made people think, ‘Oh, actually we do have some common ground here, and there are some steps we can take to reduce corruption and improve the use of science in making policy,’” he says.
Professor Friday agrees that “Sharpiegate” should be viewed not as a dispute between liberals and conservatives, but as a matter of protecting the often challenging work of scientists. 
“What scientific independence means to me,” he says, “is the ability to look at facts objectively, come to a conclusion, and to try to apply that conclusion to actions.”

Through Mark Sanford’s looking glass

Resumen: The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons.

Texto completo: CHARLESTON, S.C. — Once upon a time, Mark Sanford might have been a contender, but there’s too much water under the bridges that stretch from this city of steeples to his erstwhile home on Sullivan’s Island.
The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The third challenger to toss his hat into the wishing well of magical thinking, Sanford says he plans to talk about the skyrocketing debt, tariffs, trade and tone. Perfect. That’ll ignite the crowds and knock the grand poobah of pomp and propaganda off his game.
You can just see it: The boyish Sanford — an itinerant stranger in his own strange land — going toe to toe with the swamp-menacing Trump. It would be worth the price of a ticket. Trump’s other two GOP opponents, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, may as well grab one while they last.
Nevertheless, the buzz does what buzz does. In the days following Sanford’s announcement and a series of cable-TV appearances, you’d have thought the former governor were the deus ex machina of the GOP. Recent commentary from conservatives has been dripping with so much honey you don’t know whether to build a hive or kill the drones.
The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Also, BIG HEADLINE, he believes in climate change and legal immigration because, what life form other than Trump’s most fervent supporters doesn’t?
Further to Sanford’s coronation as GOP savior, according to Republican strategist Liz Mair writing Monday in The New York Times, he’s a bigger threat to Trump than his co-challengers because he was never a "Never Trumper." Unlike Walsh and Weld — a strong law firm name if things go awry, as surely they will — Sanford appears to be uninterested in making the race all about Trump, even though Trump’s anti-endorsement in 2018 led to Sanford’s congressional primary defeat.
Plus, wrote Mair, Sanford is more "nuanced." Perhaps she was thinking of the subtle differences between Argentina and the Appalachian Trail, where in 2009 the then-governor Sanford told everyone through a spokesperson that he’d be hiking for a few days but instead found himself in South America with his mistress?
Mair insists that the tryst that ended Sanford’s governorship, as well as his marriage, was "the least-scandalous scandal in modern political history" because, after all, he only had an "extramarital affair because he fell in love and got engaged to the woman."
This confection would be news to South Carolinians who were appalled by his deceit and repulsed by his weepy news conference to confess his sins. Such a cavalier dismissal of a family betrayal would also be news to ex-wife Jenny Sanford, who wrote a book, "Staying True" about it. While you’re browsing, by all means pick up "The Speechwriter," by Barton Swaim, Sanford’s speechwriter for the latter part of his administration. It’s hilariously funny and a poignant memoir of a tenure of absurdity.
It is absolutely true that Sanford, 59, is a time-tested conservative on budgetary matters, as my Washington Post colleague Jennifer Rubin argued under the banner headline "Mark Sanford might be the Republicans’ last chance." No one can accuse him of being a fake conservative, she wrote.
Indeed, not. As governor, Sanford was such a budget cruncher that he brought two baby pigs, one under each arm, to the statehouse to make his point about — get it? — pork.
It is quite possible that most or many Americans don’t care what Sanford did in his personal life, but the nicknamed "Luv Guv’s" philandering meanderings were public matters by virtue of two facts: The highest-ranking official of the state lied about his whereabouts and was unreachable. He simply slipped the reins of government and followed his passion, which was concerned with "issues" having nothing to do with matters of state.
It’s not the economy, it’s character. Only someone as despicable as Donald Trump could make a man like Mark Sanford palatable. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons. But that time has passed.

Texto completo: Justify won the 2018 Triple Crown after a failed postrace drug test at a California track that could have kept the horse out of the Kentucky Derby, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
The Bob Baffert-trained Justify tested positive for the drug scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby, one of the final prep races for the Kentucky Derby. Justify went on to win the Kentucky Derby and took the Preakness and Belmont stakes to complete the Triple Crown.
The Times said instead of a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results. The newspaper also reported that instead of filing a public complaint, the board made decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case and lighten the penalty for horses found to have scopolamine in their systems.
The newspaper said test results, emails and internal memorandums show how California regulators waited nearly three weeks, until the Kentucky Derby was only nine days away, to notify Baffert of the positive test. Then, two months after the Belmont victory, the board disposed of the inquiry altogether during a closed-door executive session.
"We take seriously the integrity of horse racing in California and are committed to implementing the highest standards of safety and accountability for all horses, jockeys and participants," the California Horse Racing Board said in a statement.
The organization said it would have a further statement Thursday.

Texto completo: Justify failed a drug test one month before the 2018 Kentucky Derby, and the California Horse Racing Board decided to dismiss the case after the colt went on to win the Triple Crown, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
Justify tested positive for scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby in April '18, and qualifying for the Kentucky Derby in the process.
Scopolamine is a banned substance that can enhance performance. Such a result should have resulted in a disqualification, purse forfeiture and the removal of his Kentucky Derby entry. Instead, California regulators waited until April 26, nine days before the Kentucky Derby, to inform Bob Baffert, Justify's Hall of Fame trainer.
Baffert had a second sample tested by an independent lab, and it confirmed the results three days after Justify won the Kentucky Derby.
The board decided that the test results could have come from contaminated food. However, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission's former drug lab chief, Rick Sams, said the amount of scopolamine in Justify's system suggested it "has to come from intentional intervention."
Two months after dismissing the Justify case, the California board changed the penalty for a failed scopolamine test from a DQ to a fine and a possible suspension

College football: Tennessee sophomore CB Bryce Thompson was reinstated and will be allowed to practice. Thompson had been suspended indefinitely after an Aug. 24 arrest on a misdemeanor domestic assault charge.

Texto completo: A company sued by almost every state for its alleged involvement in the opioid crisis has reached a settlement, but Iowa's attorney general doesn't think the agreement is good enough.
OxyContin creator Purdue Pharma and its owners, members of the Sackler family, reached a tentative settlement involving almost 2,300 lawsuits filed by attorneys representing government entities across the county, the New York Times reported Wednesday.
The state of Iowa, however, is not a part of that proposed settlement in which the Sacklers agreed to pay $3 billion in cash over seven years.
Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said he's concerned the Sacklers aren't paying out enough.
"I believe they have the ability and responsibility to pay more than the $3 billion they guaranteed to pay under the agreement," Miller said Wednesday. "I will continue to evaluate the situation and (Purdue's expected) bankruptcy proceeding as it progresses."
The Iowa lawsuit seeks to provide restitution for all Iowans who paid for OxyContin since it was first made available to the public more than two decades ago, Miller said, though, when asked in May, he didn't have an estimate for what the amount would be.
"Our goal remains the same: Holding Purdue Pharma accountable for helping create a public health crisis and securing funding to assist the many Iowa victims of this tragedy," he added Wednesday.
Iowa in May joined 43 other states in suing Purdue Pharma, a pharmaceutical company accused of fueling America's deadly opioid epidemic.

Make gazpacho to use late-summer veggies

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?
Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.
Serve alongside the gazpacho.
Rub a clove of garlic on thick baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with shredded Manchego, Parmesan, or leave plain.
Run under broiler.

CALLS FOR SHARPER VAPING REGULATIONS PROLIFERATE AMID ILLNESS OUTBREAK: The spread of a mysterious, deadly lung illness linked to vaping is reinvigorating critics of e-cigarettes who want the government to take a much tougher stance on the devices, including by enacting an outright ban or limiting flavors.
Public health groups and lawmakers are pressuring the Food and Drug Administration to take e-cigarettes off shelves following the outbreak, which has killed six people and infected as many as 450 others.
Democratic Minority Whip Dick Durbin called on Dr. Ned Sharpless, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration, to resign if he does not ban e-cigarettes until they undergo a rigorous safety review. "Get rid of them!" said Democratic representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, who wants the Trump administration to immediately take all vaping devices off the market.
Even though authorities haven't confirmed the cause of the illness, public health groups are renewing calls for the FDA to ban flavored e-cigarettes, which range from mint to mango and cotton candy, and which critics charge entice children into vaping.
Michigan is already moving to ban flavors, and other states could follow suit. Bloomberg Philanthropies is contributing $160 million to initiatives to get stiffer regulations at the federal, state, and local levels. House Democrats have called in health officials for a hearing on Sept. 25.
Defenders of the products say regulators shouldn't be so quick to go after e-cigarette flavors and that Congress should instead zone in on dealing with THC, which is largely unregulated and which the FDA has warned the public to avoid amid the outbreak. With the Centers for Disease Control issuing a broad warning on e-cigarettes, and with calls to block access to the devices, vaping proponents worry people will turn to regular cigarettes if they don't have the option of using a device that tastes nothing like tobacco.
"We have been stating for weeks now that it is absolutely essential our public health officials speak with clarity on the issue and speak about the facts, and not provide blanket warnings that are wrongly designed to scare people," said Tony Abboud, executive director of the Vapor Technology Association.
E-cigarette makers are facing a May 2020 deadline to submit their products for FDA review, but are fighting the deadline in court. Lawmakers believe the FDA has been dragging its feet on the matter, and want the products in for approval even sooner.
The Trump administration is considering a proposal that would obligate retailers to sell flavored e-cigarettes in parts of their stores that are off-limits to minors. The idea would effectively ban the products in some places given that not all stores will be able to meet the building requirements. Even as the FDA has signalled it is open to manufacturers eventually showing that their devices could help people quit smoking, it has also warned repeatedly that it will get much tougher if it doesn’t see fewer teens using them.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS ADVANCE ‘RED FLAG’ LAWS: Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee approved a “red flag” law Tuesday to send to the House floor for a vote. The bill would establish a grant program to incentivize states to authorize law enforcement to confiscate firearms from people who pose a threat to others or to themselves. The package of laws approved by the committee also includes bills to outlaw high-capacity magazines and to ban those convicted of carrying out hate crimes from buying a gun.
The odds of McConnell taking up the bills are slim: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this month that he would not allow Senate floor votes on gun control legislation unless President Trump pledges to sign it. “That will not stop this committee,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said Tuesday about Senate opposition. “Today, we will consider three more measures that would help prevent the tragic gun violence that has engulfed this nation in recent years.”
SCHUMER BLAMES REPUBLICAN ‘SABOTAGE’ FOR HIGHER UNINSURED RATE: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blamed a 0.5 percentage point increase in uninsured Americans since 2017 on “the relentless effort by Republicans to sabotage our healthcare system.” He said in a statement Tuesday that McConnell has stymied bipartisan House bills to bolster the healthcare system, including the Protecting Americans with Pre-Existing Conditions Act. Schumer vowed: “Senate Democrats will continue our fight against the Trump administration’s healthcare sabotage by forcing a vote this fall, under the Congressional Review Act, to save pre-existing condition protections from this harmful rule.”
Health coverage losses among children: Census data showed 5.5% of children were uninsured in 2018, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points since 2017. Joan Alker, Executive Director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families said Latino and white children are most negatively affected by “the Trump Administration’s actions that have made health coverage harder to access,” and have deterred families from enrolling in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Alker added that prior to Trump taking office, reducing the rate of uninsured children was “a success story.”
PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS SAYS PELOSI’S DRUG PLAN LEAVES PLENTY OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS: Congressional Progressive Caucus members said Tuesday that an earlier draft of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s drug plan left some questions unanswered, including whether the 75% excise tax on drugs would be imposed once or annually until the companies agree to negotiate, and whether a cap on the number of drugs to be considered for price negotiations was warranted. Members said that while they are pleased that Pelosi’s plan would allow the government to negotiate certain drug prices, they have not seen the actual legislation and they “have serious concerns.”
JUDGE ISSUES INJUNCTION ON NORTH DAKOTA ABORTION LAW: A federal judge temporarily blocked a North Dakota law Tuesday that requires doctors to say that a medication abortion can be reversed. U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Hovland said in his order: "Legislation which forces physicians to tell their patients, as part of informed consent, that 'it may be possible' to reverse or cure an ailment, disease, illness, surgical procedure, or the effects of any medication — in the absence of any medical or scientific evidence to support such a message — is unsound, misplaced, and would not survive a constitutional challenge under any level of scrutiny.” Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association, applauded Hovland’s decision, saying that "open, honest conversations between patients and physicians are the cornerstone of medicine."

Texto completo: In person, Molly Ivins wasn't quite larger than life, even if she was 6 feet tall. “It really does make a difference if you tower over your editor," we hear her say in Janice Engel's lively documentary, “Raise Hell: The Life & Times of Molly Ivins." Her persona, though, sure was larger than life: brash, funny, smart, colorful. Newspaper columnists tend not to get documentaries made about them, but newspaper columnists tend not to be anything like Ivins. At the height of her popularity, in the late '80s and '90s, her column ran in upward of 400 newspapers; and she cut an even wider swathe, thanks to frequent television appearances and best-selling books like “Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She?" (1993) and “You Got to Dance With Them What Brung You" (1998).
There's no breed quite like the Texas liberal, and Ivins was the species at its most spectacular. Knowing you're doomed to defeat, as any sensible Texas liberal does, can be wonderfully liberating. “Have a good time when you're fighting for freedom," Ivins once said. “We don't always win, and it might be the only good time you have." In that advice, shrewdness meets sad experience, with the wisdom it bespeaks is anything but sad.
“Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose," or so Kris Kristofferson (of the Brownsville, Texas, Kristoffersons) would have us believe. Those words were most famously sung by Janis Joplin (of the Port Arthur, Texas, Joplins). Ivins was something like a cross between Kristofferson and Joplin: part good old boy (distaff division); part full-throated, tangle-haired star. Giving no quarter, she expected none in return.
More important, she clearly had so much fun doing it. Ivins was three parts comedian to two parts avenging angel. As ratios go, that one's hard to beat. What's the classic gunslinger line, “Smile when you say that, pardner"? When Ivins said something — when she wrote something, too — she didn't just smile, she grinned.
The documentary would seem to labor under a severe handicap: its subject's absence. Ivins died in 2007, of cancer. Only 62, she had packed an awful lot of living into those six decades. That presumed disadvantage turns out not to be an issue. When Ivins was alive, she was really, really alive; and there's so much footage of her being interviewed and giving speeches that she is very much a living presence in the film. She lights it up, not unlike how she lit up the printed page.
Along with the many film clips of Ivins, we hear from family, friends, colleagues. There's also the occasional here-for-name-value celebrity. Fellow Texan Dan Rather has something to add. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow doesn't.
Engel efficiently takes us along the path of Ivins's life and career: growing up in pre-civil rights Houston, starting at The Houston Chronicle after college, moving on to The Minneapolis Tribune, then co-editing The Texas Observer (where she found her voice and hit her stride). The New York Times, Ivins's next employer, did its best to quiet that voice — no one could silence it. Back in Texas, she found her true calling, as a columnist, first at The Dallas Times Herald, then The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
So much of Ivins's impact in the documentary has to do with her voice. It's an aural marvel, the product of Texas drawl, years of smoking, and the self-awareness of a born performer. You might describe the specific timbre as honeyed jalapeno with whiskey notes (in life, her preferred beverages were beer and wine). Ivins wrote the way she spoke, and even the various Texas malefactors and nincompoops she pilloried found themselves liking her — or most of them did, anyway.
Among the many interesting things to be learned from “Raise Hell" is what a peculiar sort of Texan Ivins was. In that peculiarity, she was, perhaps, not unlike her great nemesis George W. Bush, whom she famously dubbed “Shrub." Dubya was the son of a president and went to Phillips Andover and Yale. Ivins was the daughter of the president of Tenneco and went to Smith (as had her mother and grandmother) and studied for a year in Paris at the Institute of Political Science.
At odd moments, Ivins's person peeks out from behind the persona: her unhappy childhood and adolescence, a fundamental loneliness and apartness made all the more acute by her gregariousness, a capacity for self-destructiveness of which the most obvious sign was her alcoholism (she did stop drinking several years before her death). What's stimulating and fun about “Raise Hell" is quite stimulating and fun. But the more smitten you become with its subject — and it's hard not to be — the more you feel there's something missing or that what isn't missing is yet too thin. “I didn't fit in at Smith," she says at one point, “but I didn't fit in anywhere, so that wasn't such an unusual experience." There's a sense in which Ivins doesn't quite fit in the documentary either — or rather what fits in is great, but what doesn't fit in (emotionally, personally) — gets left out, and that matters a lot.

Texto completo: Conservative reaction to The New York Times’ "1619 Project" — an attempt to tell the story of slavery and its lasting effect on American political, economic and social structures — has been both disappointing and instructive.
I am not referring here to thinkers (the term is employed loosely) who consciously embrace a philosophy of white supremacy. Though resurgent and repellent, they do not constitute the mainstream of conservative thinking on race.
I am thinking instead of conservative writers who argue that the 1619 Project is a prime example of leftist ideological overreach — that its (mainly African American) authors see the country entirely through the prism of its sins and intend to "delegitimize" the American experiment. In making this case, some conservatives have offered excuses — or at least mitigations — for the moral failures of the founders on matters of race.
The institution of slavery, we are assured, was historically ubiquitous. The global slave trade, we are reminded, involved not just Americans but Arabs and black Africans. Other countries, we are told, took more slaves than America, treated them worse and liberated them later. The attempt here is to defend the honor of the American experiment by denying the uniqueness of its hypocrisy on slavery. In one way or another, all these arguments ask us to consider the inadequacies of the founders within the context of their times.
But to deny the uniqueness of American guilt on slavery is also to deny the uniqueness of its aspirations. Americans are required to have ambiguous feelings about many of the country’s founders precisely because of the moral ideals the founders engraved in American life. The height of their ambitions is also the measure of their hypocrisy. It should unsettle us that the author of the Declaration of Independence built a way of life entirely dependent on human bondage.
This leads to an unavoidably complex form of patriotism. We properly venerate not the founders, but the standards they raised and often failed to meet. This is their primary achievement: They put into place an ideological structure that harshly judged their own practice and drove American democracy to achievements beyond the limits of their vision.
In the mid to late 18th century, there was plenty of compelling moral thinking on the issue of slavery.
In 1759, Quaker Anthony Benezet wrote "Observations on the Enslaving, Importing and Purchasing of Negroes," which presented eyewitness accounts of the cruelties of the slave trade. Benezet called slavery "inconsistent with the gospel of Christ, contrary to natural justice and the common feelings of humanity, and productive of infinite calamities to many thousand families, nay to many nations, and consequently offensive to God the father of all mankind."
In 1776, the year independence was declared, Presbyterian pastor Samuel Hopkins wrote "A Dialogue Concerning the Slavery of the Africans," which he dedicated to the Continental Congress. Hopkins urged his readers to "behold the sons of liberty oppressing and tyrannizing over many thousands of poor blacks who have as good a claim to liberty as themselves."
In 1778, another minister, Jacob Green, pointed out the discrediting inconsistency of a country that was dedicated to liberty and yet tolerant of slavery: "What foreign nation can believe that we who so loudly complain of Britain’s attempts to oppress and enslave us, are, at the same time, voluntarily holding multitudes of fellow creatures in abject slavery…?"
America’s founders stand accused by the best, most humane standards of their own time. When Jefferson wrote about natural rights on his mountaintop prison for black people, many of his contemporaries knew he was, on this issue, a total hypocrite.
America’s story is not one of initial purity and eventual decay. It is the story of a radical principle — the principle of human equality — introduced into a deeply unjust society. That principle was carried forward by oppressed people who understood it better than many of the nation’s founders. Denied the blessings of liberty, African Americans became the instruments by which the promise of liberty was broadly achieved. The victims of America’s moral blindness became carriers of the American ideal.
This story is not simple to tell. But it is miraculous in its own way. And it is good reason to be proud of America.

Trump politicizing hurricane forecasts a big worry for Floridians another viewpoint

Texto completo: Imagine this scenario in 2020:
Florida watches a major hurricane meander from the Caribbean to the Gulf of Mexico. Gov. Ron DeSantis, as he did during Hurricane Dorian a year earlier, waits as long as possible before advising Floridians on preparations and mobilizing state agencies. He doesn't want to cause needless panic and mass evacuation.
Finally, all forecast models show the storm tracking toward the Gulf coast between Louisiana and Alabama. Steering currents are in place. DeSantis cautions that the extreme western Panhandle should remain alert. Otherwise, however, the state stands down.
Two days later, however, President Trump tweets that Florida "would most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!"
Suddenly, emergency management directors throughout Florida start calling the governor's office. Trump Twitter followers start buying gas and hoarding water. Local officials and residents wonder what Trump knows that the forecasters don't know. Panic starts.
It should be way past time for discussion of Trump's mistaken Sept. 1 tweet that Dorian would bash Alabama. Trump, however, won't let us stop talking about it.
Against all evidence, the president keeps insisting that he was right. He forced the acting Homeland Security Department secretary to show a map that Trump had doctored with a Sharpie, extending that early forecast cone to Alabama.
Outside the White House, however, no one was buying it. So last Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued an unsigned two-paragraph statement contradicting the NOAA employees in Alabama who - correctly - contradicted Trump's tweet. In other words, Trump appointees reprimanded career National Weather Service forecasters for doing their jobs.
According to the statement, Dorian advisories issued from Aug. 28 through Sept. 2 "demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama." Well, yeah. At one point, the National Hurricane Center track showed that tropical storm winds might affect a small portion of Alabama.
When Trump tweeted that Sunday morning, however, Dorian was pounding Great Abaco in The Bahamas and the forecast track took the storm over or near Florida and the Southeast coast. Alabama residents were enjoying the Labor Day weekend. As he does so often, Trump got the facts wrong and won't admit it.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department includes NOAA, reportedly threatened to fire forecasters who disputed Trump. According to The New York Times, Ross' Friday phone call from overseas led to the statement.
Despite Ross' subservience, other federal employees are serving the country, not the president. Their pushback should hearten Floridians. We depend on reliable weather reports more than most Americans.
Craig McLean is NOAA's assistant administrator. In a Sunday night letter to staff members, McLean wrote that the Friday statement "was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political."
Then on Monday, National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini spoke at a meeting of forecasters in - appropriately - Huntsville, Ala. "Let me be clear," Uccellini said. "The Birmingham office did this to stop public panic, to ensure public safety ..."
In addition, NOAA's inspector general wants documents related to the statement. The National Weather Service, Peggy Gustafson wrote to agency employers, "must maintain standards of scientific integrity." The statement risks damaging the National Weather Service's "ability to communicate accurate and timely weather warnings and data to the nation in times of national emergency."
Sharpie-gate got laughs because it was so clumsily contrived, but it represents another attack by Trump and his sycophants on truth and facts. This campaign began on Trump's first day in office and concerned the size of his inaugural crowd. From there, it's gone deep into policy.
Here are just two of many examples: The Trump administration has purged scientists who wrote about the effect of climate change on crops. Trump has claimed that Americans aren't paying higher prices because of his tariffs on Chinese goods. In fact, they are.
Trump tossed that Dorian tweet into the tinder-dry world of social media. Unchecked, it could have spread too fast for local officials to control. Imagine something like that happening here.
As I wrote last week, Trump wants to win Florida next year despite policies that go against the interests of Floridians. His attempt to politicize weather forecasts is just the latest example.

Texto completo: Robert Frank, whose 1958 book, “The Americans," changed the face of 20th-century photography, died Monday in Nova Scotia. He was 94. The cause of death was not immediately known.
As the novelist Jack Kerouac wrote in his introduction to “The Americans," “Robert Frank, Swiss, unobtrusive, nice, with that little camera that he raises and snaps with one hand . . . sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film, taking rank among the tragic poets of the world."
What Mr. Frank did in that book was to take the leading tradition of American photography — the documentary tradition, with its reverence for the particular, of Timothy O'Sullivan, Lewis Hine, and Walker Evans — and enlarge it: to emblematize the particular and make it mythic.
As Mr. Frank wrote in his application for the Guggenheim Fellowship that underwrote the photographic travels that resulted in “The Americans," “ 'The photographing of America' is a large order — read at all literally, the phrase would be an absurdity. What I have in mind, then, is observation and record of what one naturalized American finds to see in the United States that signifies the kind of civilization born here and spreading elsewhere."
In the end, the book's 83 images are about nothing so much as American immensity, a span of distance both inner and outer. So many of the people pictured in the book stare off elsewhere. Rarely do they look at one another, and almost never into the camera. For all that the book's title suggests otherwise, “The Americans" is not about people. It's about the space that holds them.
“In this picture," Evans wrote of an image of an empty highway, "US 285, New Mexico," "you instantly find the continent. The whole page is haunted with American scale and space, which the mind fills in quite automatically . . ."
Five days after Mr. Frank arrived in the United States, in 1947, he wrote home, “Nothing is impossible here. They have electric toothbrushes and nail clippers. . . . In 10 minutes you have eaten and there are three men standing behind you, waiting for you to leave . . . I can only tell you this; you have to see for yourself." That sense of discovery informs every image in “The Americans," as Mr. Frank's camera reveals a land of highways and jukeboxes, unwatched televisions and waving flags, mink stoles and movie premieres.
With his cool, disarmingly hungry eye, Mr. Frank gathered up America in a casual embrace. Affecting neither advocacy nor scorn, he offered no judgments on the continent-sized country he was capturing with his camera, no judgments other than a kind of narrow-eyed wonder.
At the time of the book's publication, many did not see Mr. Frank's work that way. A Popular Photography reviewer agreed with Kerouac on the poetic quality of “The Americans"; but, put off by its often-scruffy subject matter and seemingly artless style, he denounced “this sad poem for sick people." Six decades later, the book looks vastly different: Yesterday's subversion has become today's unkempt appreciation.
In addition, “The Americans" profoundly influenced the work of two generations of photographers. The critic Janet Malcolm likened its creator to the painter who ushered in Impressionism. Mr. Frank, she wrote, was “the Manet of the new photography." What was once a revolutionary document now looks like a manual of late-20th-century photographic style. In redefining an art form, Mr. Frank had an impact on photography comparable to Marlon Brando's on acting, a few years earlier, and Bob Dylan's on popular music, a few years later.
"Never before," the photographer Joel Meyerowitz has written of "The Americans," "was there a book of photographs with the wholeness of literature and the clarity of a poem. Many photographers of my generation succumbed to his vision and through it saw the difficulties and potential of photography and the adventure in store for us were we to misread that work in our own inevitable ways."
The impact of Mr. Frank's work extended beyond photography and film. “I've always wished I could write songs the way he takes pictures," Bruce Springsteen once said.
Robert Frank was born in Zurich on Nov. 9, 1924, the son of Hermann and Regina Frank. His father was a German businessman who'd moved to Switzerland after World War I. Mr. Frank's interest in the United States and photography came early. As a boy, he clipped a photo of Franklin D. Roosevelt and placed it over his bed. As a teenager, he apprenticed himself to a local photographer and got his first photographic job, taking stills on a movie set, when he was 17.
Mr. Frank immigrated to the United States in 1947 and was almost immediately hired to work as a photographer for the fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar. “I could feel the possibilities," he said nearly half a century later of his first years in New York. “You could do anything, go anywhere; nobody really cared."
In 1950, he married the sculptor Mary (Lockspeiser) Frank. She and their two children accompanied Mr. Frank on parts of the 1955-56 cross-country travels in a 1950 Ford that produced “The Americans." It was a journey both mundane (Mr. Frank went to the American Automobile Association to plan his route) and exotic (suspicious of his accent, the Arkansas State Police sent his fingerprints to the FBI).
In its combining the commonplace and extraordinary, the journey was like something out of Kerouac's novel “On the Road." In fact, Mr. Frank collaborated with such Beat writers as Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. The best known of these collaborations is the film “Pull My Daisy," made in 1959, and Mr. Frank spent much of his time in subsequent years making experimental films. “When you make a film, you have a conversation," he said in a 1994 New York Times interview. “You have more contact with people. When you photograph, often you walk away."
Film also had the advantage of letting Mr. Frank get away from his old style. The astonishing influence “The Americans" had on other photographers dismayed him. As the '60s wore on, more and more “people would come by or send me photographs, and they looked like my photographs. Then I realized there was no more point. I wanted to move on."
Mr. Frank turned to more haphazard techniques of photography: marking up negatives, assembling collages, and emphasizing spontaneity at the expense of composition. An example of his later style is the album cover of the Rolling Stones album “Exile on Main Street," for which Mr. Frank provided the art. Mr. Frank also made a documentary film about the group's 1972 tour, “CS Blues," which the Stones banned for many years because of its graphic representations of backstage drug use and sexual situations.
In 1969, Mr. Frank built a house in Mabou, Nova Scotia, and started to divide his time between there and New York. Also in that year, he and Mary Frank divorced.
In 1972, Mr. Frank published a photographic autobiography, “The Lines of My Hand." An expanded edition appeared in 1989. A year later, he donated an archive of some 5,500 negatives, contact sheets, and prints to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the first time that institution had collected the work of a living photographer. The gallery organized a major retrospective of Mr. Frank's work in 1995. Other museums that organized exhibitions of Mr. Frank's work include New York's Museum of Modern Art; the George Eastman Museum, in Rochester, N.Y.; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; New York's Whitney Museum of Art; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.
The many exhibitions devoted to Mr. Frank notwithstanding, the touchstone of his career remained “The Americans." The National Gallery organized a major show in observance of its 50th anniversary, "Looking In: Robert Frank's 'The Americans.' "
“I think that trip was almost pure intuition — I just kept on photographing," he wrote upon concluding his journey in 1956. “I kept on looking. . . . That made me work so hard until I knew I had something, but I didn't even know I had America."
He leaves his wife, June Leaf. A son, Pablo, died in 1994. A daughter, Andrea, died in a plane crash in 1974.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
THE SPY Stream on Netflix. Sacha Baron Cohen, the actor best known for assuming false identities as the title characters of the satires "Borat" and "Bruno," plays a man who himself is assuming a false identity in this six-part mini-series. That man would be Eli Cohen, the real-life Mossad spy who in the 1960s went undercover in Syria and gathered intelligence that is credited with being crucial to Israel's victory in the Six-Day War. The series, directed by the Israeli filmmaker Gideon Raff, follows Eli Cohen (who is not related to the actor who portrays him) in the early 1960s as he poses as a Syrian shipping magnate. "I saw Eli Cohen, as he was written in the show, as an extreme version of myself," Baron Cohen said in a recent interview with The New York Times. "The stakes were higher for him, because the price of failure is imprisonment and execution. Eli Cohen was, in that sense, the greatest method actor of the last century."
GAMEFACE Stream on Hulu. "I'm not codependent," the English comic Roisin Conaty says in the second season of this sitcom. "I'm old-fashioned needy." The series stars Conaty as Marcella, a struggling actor who spent the first season searching for parts, taking advice from her life coach and recovering from a breakup. The second season, which aired in Britain earlier this year, sees Marcella continuing to pursue both her career and a potential romance with her driving instructor, Jon (Damien Molony).
25TH HOUR (2002) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. About a decade before he helped bring George R.R. Martin's fantasy novels to the screen as a creator of "Game of Thrones," David Benioff adapted his own debut novel, "The 25th Hour," into the screenplay for this film, which was directed by Spike Lee. The plot follows Monty, a drug dealer played by Edward Norton, during the day and night before he is to begin a prison sentence. Filmed in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the movie also acts as a kind of historical document of early 2000s New York. "If '25th Hour' does not quite work as a plausible and coherent story, it produces a wrenching, dazzling succession of moods," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. The ending, he added, "is as bittersweet and sincere an evocation of the American dream as I have seen on film in quite some time, acknowledging both the futility of the collective national fantasy and its consoling, resilient power."
What's on TV
IN THE SHADOW OF THE TOWERS: STUYVESANT HIGH ON 9/11 (2019) 9 p.m. on HBO. This half-hour documentary revisits the events of Sept. 11, 2001, through interviews with some of the alumni of Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan who witnessed the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers. For younger audiences, WHAT HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER 11, a documentary meant to introduce the events to audiences who hadn't yet been born when they occurred, is airing on HBO Family at 6 p.m.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Tuesday announced the departure of John R. Bolton as his national security adviser, the third person to hold the job since the beginning of the Trump administration. Though the White House has said Mr. Bolton's current deputy, Charles M. Kupperman, will take over in the interim, Mr. Trump has said he will announce a successor next week.
A guessing game immediately began among the president's formal and informal advisers about who still left in the president's orbit might get the job.
The expanding list of possibilities, generated by those hoping to promote their allies or harm their enemies, included Fred Fleitz, Mr. Bolton's former chief of staff; Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general and a former acting national security adviser; Jack Keane, a retired Army vice chairman currently advising the vice president on national security; Robert Blair, an adviser to Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff; and Robert C. O'Brien, the administration's hostage envoy who called Mr. Trump the greatest hostage negotiator in American history.
As the administration begins to resemble a game of reverse musical chairs -- too many open slots without enough loyalists to fill them -- a short list of plausible replacements emerged.
The acting Adviser
Charles M. Kupperman
Mr. Kupperman, a former Reagan administration official and defense contracting executive, is a longtime Bolton associate. Known by many national security officials by his nickname, "Kupperware," for his blandness, Mr. Kupperman, 68, was appointed in January as deputy national security adviser under Mr. Bolton.
Shortly after Mr. Bolton left the White House on Tuesday, Hogan Gidley, a deputy White House spokesman, told reporters that Mr. Kupperman would serve as Mr. Bolton's acting successor. Acting officials have a way of sticking around in this administration for indefinite lengths of time, but Mr. Kupperman's track record as someone ensconced in Mr. Bolton's inner circle could shorten his tenure.
Still, the president appreciated Mr. Kupperman's just-the-facts style compared with Mr. Bolton's often ideologically charged delivery: If Mr. Trump had to have a national security brief concerning long-term planning, he preferred it from Mr. Kupperman as opposed to Mr. Bolton, according to a person with knowledge of that process.
The representative to North Korea
Stephen E. Biegun
Mr. Biegun, the United States' special representative for North Korea, had a firsthand window into the clashes between Mr. Bolton, who never wavered from a hawkish, hard-line stance on North Korea, and the president, who has tried to use a charm offensive to persuade Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, down a path to denuclearization.
Mr. Biegun is considered a capable technocrat rather than a big-ideas person, unlike Mr. Bolton, who had firm ideological views that shaped his policy positions. Recently Mr. Biegun has been in closer alignment with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr. Trump than with the hard-line, anti-North Korea views of Mr. Bolton.
In a speech at the University of Michigan last week, Mr. Biegun, 56, said that he did not question Mr. Trump's choice to play down evidence that Mr. Kim was building an advancing arsenal.
"The challenge is to find a way through diplomacy to resolve it," Mr. Biegun said. "The president has made it clear that short-range missiles don't make him happy, but it's not going to disrupt our efforts in order to engage diplomatically to resolve the very issues that we are referring to."
This summer, Mr. Biegun was initially floated internally as a possibility to succeed Jon Huntsman Jr., who resigned in August as the administration's ambassador to Russia. That job ultimately went to John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state under Mr. Pompeo.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment about whether Mr. Biegun had recently interviewed with the president for the job of national security adviser.
Mr. Biegun also served as an executive secretary of the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. In August 2001, Mr. Biegun was with the president, then on vacation at his ranch in Texas, when Mr. Bush received a daily brief containing an article with the title "Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S."
The administration's Iran representative
Brian H. Hook
Mr. Hook, 51, is also said to be in contention to succeed Mr. Bolton. He is the administration's special representative for Iran and a senior adviser to Mr. Pompeo.
Mr. Hook, a lawyer brought into the State Department under Rex W. Tillerson, is one of the remaining survivors from that era. An administration official familiar with Mr. Hook's relationship with Mr. Trump said that the two "interact on Iran" and that "the president is happy with how the strategy is going there."
He would also probably have the support of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, who has tried to push his allies into high-profile administration positions before. But Mr. Hook could already be engaged. He has stepped up to take on Mr. Kushner's Middle East portfolio as Jason Greenblatt, the co-architect of the administration's peace plan for that region, prepares to leave.
Another Fox News fixture
Douglas Macgregor
Mr. Trump is almost certainly familiar with Mr. Macgregor, a retired Army colonel who has written several books on reorganizing the military. But more important to Mr. Trump, he also appears frequently on one of the president's favorite Fox programs, "Tucker Carlson Tonight."
In June, when Mr. Trump decided at the last minute to call off a round of strikes against Iran, he had listened to Mr. Carlson's assertion that a strike could prove politically fatal. A frequent guest on the show that week was Mr. Macgregor, who backed up that rationale.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Reached by telephone on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Macgregor seemed to expect the call. "It's no comment, no comment, no comment," he said, declining to say whether he had talked to the White House about Mr. Bolton's job.
Either way, solid television performances may not be the safest route to Mr. Trump's good graces. The president had also liked the look of Mr. Bolton's fiery Fox News performances before he hired him for the national security adviser post.
The wild card
Richard Grenell
Mr. Grenell, the American ambassador to Germany, is personally liked by the president. At times, he has emulated Mr. Trump's brash diplomatic style. Shortly after beginning his post in Germany, he elicited the annoyance of politicians there by admonishing any German companies doing business with Iran.
Mr. Grenell, 52, who is gay, is perhaps best known for enthusiastically defending the president's position on gay rights, even as the Trump administration has taken steps to roll back civil rights for gay and transgender people. He has also led an effort to decriminalize homosexuality around the globe.
Throughout his tenure, Mr. Grenell has told his allies that he has been considered for several high-ranking positions -- this year, his name was floated as a prospective nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, a position that Kelly Knight Craft, the ambassador to Canada at the time, ultimately filled. He expects to be interviewed for Mr. Bolton's job, according to a person with knowledge of the planning process.
The really wild card
Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster
General McMaster, who was ousted last year weeks after a furious tweetstorm from Mr. Trump over his comment that there was "incontrovertible" evidence of Russian election interference, has received at least one phone call from the president on matters of national security, according to a report from NBC News and confirmed by The New York Times.
The chances he is offered the job? "Less than zero," according to a person familiar with his historically fraught relationship with Mr. Trump.
In any other administration, that would mean he wouldn't have a chance.
Another possibility from the McMaster era could be Ricky Waddell, a former deputy national security adviser who left the White House last year. In an interview on Tuesday with Fox News, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said that Mr. Trump had mentioned Mr. Waddell by name, along with Mr. Hook and Mr. Kellogg.

Europe, Rwanda plan migrant deal

Texto completo: BRUSSELS - For three years, the European Union has been paying other countries to keep asylum-seekers away from a Europe replete with populist and anti-migrant parties.
It has paid Turkey billions to keep refugees from crossing to Greece. It has funded the Libyan Coast Guard to catch and return migrant boats to North Africa. It has set up centers in distant Niger to process asylum-seekers, if they ever make it that far. Most don't.
Even as that arm's-length network comes under criticism on humanitarian grounds, it is so overwhelmed that the European Union is seeking to expand it, as the bloc aims to buttress an approach that has drastically cut the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean.
It is now preparing to finish a deal, this time in Rwanda, to create yet another node that it hopes will help alleviate some of the mounting strains on its outsourcing network.
Critics say the Rwanda deal will deepen a morally perilous policy, even as it underscores how precarious the European Union's teetering system for handling the migrant crisis has become.
Tens of thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers remain trapped in Libya, where a patchwork of militias control detention centers and migrants are sold as slaves or into prostitution, and kept in places so packed that there is not ever enough floor space to sleep on.
A bombing of a migrant detention center in July left 40 dead, and it has continued to operate in the months since, despite part of it having been reduced to rubble.
Even as the system falters, few in the West seem to be paying much attention and critics say that is also part of the aim - to keep a problem that has roiled European politics on the other side of Mediterranean waters, out of sight and out of mind.
Screening asylum-seekers in safe, remote locations - where they can qualify as refugees without undertaking perilous journeys to Europe - has long been promoted in Brussels as a way to dismantle smuggler networks while giving vulnerable people a fair chance at a new life.
But the application by the European Union has high-lighted its fundamental flaws: The offshore centers are too small and the pledges of refugee resettlement too few.
European populists continue to flog the narrative that migrants are invading, even though the European Union's migration policy has starkly reduced the number of new arrivals. In 2016, 181,376 people crossed the Mediterranean from North Africa to reach Italian shores. Last year, the number plummeted to 23,485.
But the bloc's approach has been sharply criticized by humanitarian and refugee-rights groups, not only for the often deplorable conditions of the detention centers, but also because few consigned to them have any real chance of gaining asylum.
"It starts to smell as offshore processing and a backdoor way for European countries to keep people away from Europe, in a way that's only vaguely different to how Australia manages it," said Judith Sunderland, an expert with Human Rights Watch, referring to that country's policy of detaining asylum-seekers on distant Pacific islands.
Such criticism first surfaced in Europe in 2016, when the European Union agreed to pay Turkey roughly $6 billion to keep asylum-seekers from crossing to Greece, and to take back some of those who reached Greece.
On the Africa front, in particular in the central Mediterranean, the agreements have come at a lower financial cost, but arguably at a higher moral one.
Brussels' funding of the Libyan Coast Guard to intercept migrant boats before they reach international waters has been extremely effective, but has left apprehended migrants vulnerable to abuses in a North African country with scant central governance and at the mercy of an anarchic, at-war state of militia rule.
Under the agreement with Rwanda, which is expected to be signed in the coming weeks, the east African country will take in about 500 migrants evacuated from Libya and host them until they are resettled to new homes or sent back to their countries of origin.
It will offer a way out for a lucky few, but ultimately the Rwandan center is likely to run into the same delays and problems as the one in Niger.
"The Niger program has suffered from a lot of setbacks, hesitation, very slow processing by European and other countries, very low numbers of actual resettlements," said Sunderland of Human Rights Watch. "There's not much hope then that the exact same process in Rwanda would lead to dramatically different outcomes."

NRA sues San Francisco after leaders brand it a 'terrorist' outfit

Texto completo: The National Rifle Association alleges the city of San Francisco defamed it when local leaders branded the gun rights group a "domestic terrorist organization" in a resolution earlier this month.
The city is violating the NRA's First Amendment speech rights and has effectively moved to “blacklist anyone linked to the N.R.A," it said in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, according to the New York Times.
Supervisor Catherine Stefani of the San Francisco board told the Times the suit is likely to be thrown out because the resolution is "nonbinding."
“It’s a resolution, it’s not an ordinance," she said. "This is a desperate move by a desperate organization."
Earlier this month, Stefani introduced a measure calling the NRA a dangerous domestic terrorist organization and a threat to public safety.
“The National Rifle Association spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence,” she wrote. “The NRA exists to spread disinformation, and knowingly puts guns into the hands of those who would harm and terrorize us.”iFrame ObjectThe resolution, which passed, was in response to a pair of mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas this summer.
Both attacks have sparked new calls from gun control advocates and Democratic lawmakers for Republicans and President Trump to "stand up" to the NRA and the gun lobby in Washington, D.C.
The NRA has long held the belief that "grabbing" guns from law-abiding citizens who legally own firearms will not prevent such attacks.
“This ludicrous stunt by the Board of Supervisors is an effort to distract from the real problems facing San Francisco, such as rampant homelessness, drug abuse and skyrocketing petty crime, to name a few," it said in a response. "The NRA will continue working to protect the constitutional rights of all freedom-loving Americans,” it said in a statement following the city's resolution.
The resolution, which gained national attention, has threatened the NRA's bottom line, it says.
“In the face of recent, similar blacklisting schemes,” the lawsuit says, “financial institutions have expressed reluctance to provide bank accounts for disfavored political groups, and city contractors fear losing their livelihoods if they support or even work with the N.R.A.”

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. "The Testaments"
by Margaret Atwood (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, fiction, on sale Sept. 10)
What it's about: The feminist dystopian classic "The Handmaid's Tale" (1985) gets a sequel at long last. Atwood says of the book, "Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book ***1/2 in a review, saying, "'The Testaments' is worthy of the literary classic it continues."
2. "The Institute"
by Stephen King (Scribner, fiction, on sale Sept. 10)
What it's about: Twelve-year-old genius Luke Ellis is whisked away in the middle of the night and taken to the Institute, where psychic kids are being held captive to save the world.
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book *** in a review, saying, "King leans into the theme of 'great events' happening with the smallest of decisions as well as the world-changing power of togetherness. And in that case, it's a frequent lesson he extols that never gets old."
3. "Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America"
by James Poniewozik (Liveright, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10)
What it's about: The New York Times TV critic examines the history of television and American media to explain how Trump mastered the medium to win his base and become our 45th president.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "This intelligent eye-opener belongs on the small shelf of valuable books that help explain how Trump created his base."
4. "The Education of an Idealist"
by Samantha Power (Dey Street, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10)
What it's about: The Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish-American diplomat and human rights advocate traces her journey from immigrant to war correspondent to presidential Cabinet official in a revealing memoir.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "Power's vibrant prose, exuberant storytelling, and deep insights into human nature make for a page-turning memoir."
5. "After the Flood"
by Kassandra Montag (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Sept. 10)
What it's about: In this dystopian adventure novel set in a water-logged world altered by climate change, a mother embarks on a perilous voyage to rescue her kidnapped daughter.
The buzz: "Anchored by a complicated, compelling heroine, this gripping, speculative, high-seas adventure is impossible to put down," says Booklist.

Texto completo: The Kelleys were considering moving out of state before tragedy hit Thousand Oaks. What kept them here was the support they saw after the Borderline Bar & Grill mass shooting and the Woolsey fire.
“The support, immediate, massive and ongoing support,” said Mike Kelley on Monday. “This is home.”
“Home” is getting a “Healing Garden” at Conejo Creek North Park in Thousand Oaks to honor 12 innocent lives lost.
The Garden began its march toward completion Monday as crews began construction on the Thousand Oaks memorial, with a goal of finishing it by Nov. 7, the one-year anniversary of the Borderline mass shooting.
A skip loader moved dirt just south of an existing pond, home to turtles and koi. And soon, the sounds of loaders and crews will give way to a place of reflection.
The Healing Garden will be built at Conejo Creek North Park, the city’s most popular park.
It will honor:
* RON HELUS : The Ventura County Sheriff sergeant was shot running into the Borderline Bar to help.
* CODY COFFMAN : The 22-year-old had been meeting with recruiters and planned to enlist in the Army.
* JUSTIN MEEK: He worked as a promoter at Borderline Bar. The 23-year-old was a former student at Cal Lutheran.
* NOEL SPARKS: She was a Moorpark College student who liked horseback riding.
* ALAINA HOUSLEY: The 18-year-old was a Pepperdine University freshman who aimed to study law.
* TELEMACHUS ORFANOS: He had the misfortune of being at the Las Vegas mass shooting and the one in Thousand Oaks.
* SEAN ADLER: He was a security guard at the bar, but he has just opened his dream business: a coffeehouse.
* DANIEL MANRIQUE: He was an ex-Marine sergeant who dedicated his life to helping emotionally scarred veterans get back on their feet.
* BLAKE DINGMAN: This 21-year-old Newbury Park resident played high school baseball at Hillcrest Christian School in Thousand Oaks.
* JAKE DUNHAM: He always answers his phone, his father said, but it just keeps ringing.
* KRISTINA MORISETTE : She graduated from Simi Valley High School and reportedly worked as a cashier at the bar.
* MARKY MEZA JR .: He worked as a busboy and food runner at the bar and would have turned 21 in less than two weeks.
READ THEIR STORIES here
A group comprised of city and park officials, Ventura County sheriff’s officials and Cal Lutheran staff recommended building the memorial at the park by the one-year anniversary of the shooting.
Thousand Oaks Mayor Rob McCoy said officials were unwilling to let the building of a memorial languish for years, as it has for the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
“We wanted to have that in place (in Thousand Oaks) because we’ll never forget that day,” McCoy told the Daily News in June, when the garden’s design was unveiled. “While it’s a place for the families to come, it’s a place for the entire city to come. Every resident, over 160,000 residents were affected.”
And so, officials are on a fast track to having it completed by that November anniversary date.
When it’s done, the “Borderline 12” will be represented by a fountain feature with 12 vertical jets in the center of a pond, according to the city’s plan.
The scene will symbolize the broader community. There will be a contemplation area, where a shoreline will include seating and landscaping. A large Oak will be planted bordering the garden area. A boulder will introduce visitors to the Healing Garden at its entryway.
There will be 12 large natural stone-slab benches along the plaza — granite to illustrate the strength of the community. A unique color will designate 248 pavers in a scene that will represent the number of survivors from that night. And at the site’s north end, the existing Lakeside Pavilion will offer space for community events and other gatherings.
On June 25, the city of Thousand Oaks approved a grant agreement with Conejo Recreation and Park District for $250,000 to provide funding for the construction.
Since November, Borderline has itself become a place of reflection.
Kelley touched one of twelve crosses at the makeshift memorial outside the closed club. It was there for Jake Dunham, one of the 12 victims and Kelley’s Newbury Park neighbor. Kelley and his wife watched Dunham grow up.
“He was a force,” Kelley said of the young man who rode motorcycles and worked on his truck with friends in the family garage.
“Watching his mother light his lantern (one of 12) and set it free was the single most emotional event I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kelley said.
The question is where will all the photos, bibles, cowboy boots, rocks, hearts and the ceramic “Love” and “Peace” sculpture end up after the formal memorial is built.
Since the Borderline massacre, 2019 has continued to be a year in which gun violence in the United States is taking a deadly toll.
According to Mass Shooting Tracker, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot (but not necessarily killed), there have been 352 such incidents in the United States this year.
And of those, according to the New York Times, which compiled MST’s and other data for a report, there were 38 shootings by the end of August in which three or more people were killed (the Department of Justice defines a mass killing as an episode in which three or more are killed). That number — 38 — includes the shooting in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 3, in which 22 were killed.

Texto completo: Nancy Maass Kinnally, author of today’s Accent cover story, grew up in Palm Beach and now lives in Orlando with her husband, Will, and children, Liam and Devin. She is CEO of Relatable Communications Group, and familiar to many Palm Beach Post readers because of her friendship with longtime Post courts reporter Susan Spencer-Wendel, who died of Lou Gehrig’s disease in 2014.
Susan’s book about filling her last years of life with life, “Until I Say Goodbye,” hit The New York Times best-seller list.
Susan and Nancy took several meaningful trips together in Susan’s final years, which are chronicled in Susan’s book. They both loved vacationing in the Bahamas.
Here’s how to help in the Hope Town and Elbow Cay recovery effort:
Hope Town Volunteer Fire & Rescue reported this week on its Facebook page that a survey of damage using video footage showed 30 percent of Elbow Cay’s structures were demolished and 70 percent damaged to severely damaged in Hurricane Dorian. Most docks are destroyed, and 99 percent of boats are sunk. They reported similar conditions on neighboring cays. And yet, they say morale is up on the island and that residents are implementing their own rescue, relief and recovery efforts in highly organized shifts at various stations around the island.
Matt Winslow and his wife Courtney Sands Winslow are from Rochester, N.Y. They and their three children are building a home on Elbow Cay and have been visiting the island for more than a decade. Courtney's family, the Sands, are founders and controlling shareholders of Constellation Brands, the largest multi-category beverage alcohol company in the world. The Winslow family and the Sands Family Foundation have matched, dollar for dollar, the first $100,000 in donations.
If you want to contribute to Hope Town’s recovery, the Winslow family and the Sands Family Foundation have established a GoFundMe campaign approved by Hope Town Volunteer Fire & Rescue.
There are two ways to donate:

Matt Winslow’s group has 15,000 pounds of medical supplies and a 14,000-square-foot warehouse in South Florida, and it’s working to secure planes to deliver aid. They intend to shift their focus in the coming weeks to buying temporary housing for those working on the front lines of the recovery efforts.

Nicholas Kristof: Newborns crying for drugs, not milk

Texto completo: Charleston, W. Va . — His body dependent on opioids, he writhes, trembles and cries. He is exhausted but cannot sleep. He vomits, barely eats and has lost weight.
He is also a baby. Just 1 month old, he wails in the nursery of the CAMC Women and Children’s Hospital here. A volunteer “cuddler” holds him while walking around, murmuring sweetly, hour after hour, but he is inconsolable. What his body craves is heroin.
Every 15 minutes in America, a child is born after a prenatal exposure to opioids. Here in West Virginia, 14% of babies are born exposed to drugs, and perhaps 5% more to alcohol, totaling nearly 1 out of 5 newborns. Some get by without symptoms, but for many, their very first experience after birth is the torment of withdrawal.
These babies reflect the catastrophic implosion of drug policy in America, from the war on drugs that filled prisons to the continuing failure even in 2019 to provide enough treatment for drug users. By government figures, only 3.7 million Americans received treatment for substance use disorders last year, out of 21.2 million who needed it — just 17%.
How is it acceptable that we treat only 17% of those with a life-threatening disorder?
Pharmaceutical executives are battling lawsuits by blaming drug users. I wish those executives had to cuddle these infants who, partly because of their reckless greed, suffer so much.
Executives in three-piece suits were drug lords as guilty as any from Medellín. The Washington Post reported that pharma companies shipped 76 billion opioid pain pills from 2006 through 2012. A single pharmacy in Kermit sold more than 13 million over those seven years — and Kermit has a population of just over 400 people.
So today, hospitals in West Virginia and across America struggle to calm babies who sometimes begin to go through withdrawal as soon as the umbilical cord is cut.
“He’s frantic,” Dr. Stefan Maxwell, a neonatologist at CAMC Women and Children’s Hospital, said of the infant going through withdrawal. “Baby isn’t sleeping, isn’t eating, isn’t growing. It’s a disaster.”
“Nurses are in tears at the end of a shift,” said Maxwell, an expert on prenatal drug exposures.
When babies are going through severe withdrawal, hospitals give them medication to ease the symptoms — here it’s methadone, elsewhere it’s sometimes morphine — and then try to wean them off it over two or three weeks.
There’s plenty of blame to go around, encompassing opioid-abusing moms and opioid-prescribing doctors. But it’s appropriate to feel special loathing for executives at pharma companies whose corporate strategy was to profit by getting people hooked. Some of the companies funded a movement claiming that pain was the “fifth vital sign” and urged doctors to prescribe more painkillers, and then paid them kickbacks to do so.
Almost 80% of heroin users began with prescription pain pills, though not necessarily prescribed to them.
In contrast to the executives, some moms acknowledge their failings. They are already suffering terribly from their own addictions, and many will lose custody of their babies.
“Lots of these moms are very well meaning,” said Dr. Cody Smith, a neonatologist at the J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, 150 miles northeast of Charleston. “The vast majority of these moms love their babies, and they feel a tremendous amount of guilt.”
Smith notes that many of the mothers have mental health problems and their own traumas that they are wrestling with, and he estimates that 85% of the pregnancies involving drug exposure are unplanned. Yet the Trump administration is curbing access to Title X family planning funding in ways that may lead to the closing of the only Planned Parenthood clinic in West Virginia.
Better prenatal care for these moms can reduce the suffering of their babies. Overcoming addiction is so difficult — and so unlikely to be successful — that these hospitals do not ask pregnant women to try. Rather, they steer them from street drugs like heroin and fentanyl to alternatives like methadone to stabilize them.
Newborn babies struggling through withdrawal are only one dimension of America’s opioid crisis. Every seven minutes another American dies of an overdose; 2.1 million children live with a parent with a drug dependency.
McKinsey and Co., the global consulting company, issued a sober report last fall warning that “the opioid crisis will worsen over the next three to five years.” What McKinsey didn’t say was that it had previously advised Johnson & Johnson to be more aggressive in peddling opioids for back pain and to encourage doctors to prescribe stronger, more addictive pills.
These drug-addicted newborns are suffering partly because of Johnson & Johnson, McKinsey, Purdue Pharma, McKesson and many other companies; these babies are a reminder of why corporate regulation is essential.
We need accountability, as well as deterrence. That means sending executives to prison along with other big drug dealers, and ensuring that shareholders in these companies suffer as well.
Anyone doubting the need for tougher accountability, and for a far more robust public health approach to address drug use, should visit one of these nurseries and see babies suffering withdrawal.

Four decades of dramatic CEO income growth

Texto completo: A recent Economic Policy Institute Study titled "CEO Compensation Has Grown 940 percent since 1978" was a Labor Day lament for American workers whose wages during the same period have only increased a meager 12 percent.
EPI's analysis found that this exorbitant, unconscionable earnings differential is the major income inequality contributor, and has persisted through equally indifferent Democrat and Republican administrations.
In its analysis, EPI emphasizes that CEOs earn more not because of demand skills, extraordinary productivity or other tangibles, but rather because of their absolute power to set and increase their pay scales. As a result of soaring CEO incomes, and more generally, higher executive compensation, the top 0.1 percent and 1.0 percent income brackets have exploded, while workers in the lower 90 percent of the earnings' bracket have been left in the cold for more than four decades.
EPI also noted that the economy wouldn't suffer if CEOs were paid less or taxed more, or if profits were distributed more fairly among all employees.
CEOs have unquestionably taken full advantage of their power to enrich themselves, and suppress lower-echelon employee wages. But another variable that contributes to 40 years of flat wages for hourly workers is the executive suite's addiction to cheap, foreign labor.
With what has been an unbroken inflow of illegal immigrant and legal guest workers, between 750,000 and 1 million annually, corporations have no incentive to increase domestic workers' salaries — and they haven't.
Unwittingly, a New York Times story provided an excellent example of how the immigration variable depresses the domestic salary scale. In "Is Immigration at its Limit? Not according to Employers," so many immigrants have come to the South Florida area that not enough labor is available to fill all the restaurant, nursing home and retail store jobs.
The story was a typical immigration cheerleading piece that offered the well-worn and misleading talking points. From Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former Congressional Budget Office director and now the immigration advocacy group American Action Forum's leader: "Without immigration, we shrink as a nation." Holtz-Eakin added that two ingredients drive GDP growth — the size of the workforce and how efficiently those workers produce goods and services.
That immigration grows the economy is the age-old, half-truth argument. Sure, more people and more workers create a bigger economy. But immigration does not help the per capita income. Immigration's benefits accrue to the immigrants and to their employers, and not the general public. The traditional solution to filling job openings is to offer higher wages, not import more cheap labor. With more than 6.1 million people unemployed, that pool should be tapped first.
For Congress, as it has been for too many legislative sessions, creating a fairer immigration system that protects instead of harms American workers isn't on the agenda.

Texto completo: "I like working with tiny little boxes, and it's almost like a puzzle when it fits exactly into that space."
Marie Kondo
Our series "How I became a ..." digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
From becoming fascinated with the art of tidying at the age of 5 to starting her own organizing business as a university student in Japan, Marie Kondo and her approach to tidying has sparked joy in people all across the globe. Her New York Times bestseller "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" helped Kondo share her lessons with the world, and her Netflix original series "Tidying Up With Marie Kondo" is up for two Emmy Awards.
USA TODAY caught up with Kondo to talk about everything from the happiness she gets from organizing items into tiny boxes to producing her own television show for Netflix.
Question: How did you get your start?
Marie Kondo: When it comes to tidying, I was interested in tidying ever since I was 5 years old, and by the time I entered middle school, I dove into researching tidying. I was 19 years old when I became a professional organizing consultant. One of my hobbies when I was in college was to go tidy my friends' homes, and the word-of-mouth quickly spread that when Marie comes to visit your home, your home becomes incredibly tidy.
When I began my organizing consulting business, the wait list became half a year long, so I received a request from one of my clients that they wanted to read my lessons in book form, (and) that was how the book came to be.
Q: How has your career changed since?
Kondo: What I do to impart what I know about tidying hasn't changed at all. But I've always mainly worked in Japan before – now, I have a lot of TV appearances, and the scale of my lectures and presentations I give certainly have changed. I also work predominantly in the U.S. now, so it's changed quite a bit.
Q: What does a typical workday look like for you?
Kondo: For today, for instance, I'm writing a new book, so sometimes I do that. I also create videos related to my tidying lessons, and for Japan I have a Japan exclusive online service, so I have to write content for that. Very full days.
Q: What is your favorite thing about your job?
Kondo: I love creating storage. I like working with tiny little boxes, and it's almost like a puzzle when it fits exactly into that space – my client's space – that we're working with. It feels so great.
Q: To what do you credit your success?
Kondo: I think I credit that to my home is tidy, but my decision-making skills are very tidy. I always feel like I'm attuned to what I need to be doing at that particular moment.
Q: How do you balance work, life and such a busy schedule?
Kondo: I wonder (laughs). In terms of balance, I always try to carve out a time that sparks joy for me, whether that is a time for reflection or relaxing and playing with my children. I make sure that I save that time so that I can always maintain myself to be at 100%, and then I try to think how to conduct my schedule in a most effective way.
Q: What have been some of your career highlights?
Kondo: Producing my own TV show for Netflix – it's been amazing.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Kondo: To put it succinctly, I would to say to trust in what sparks joy for you. Trust in your own sense of what sparks joy for you.

ACCUSERS PUSH FOR ANSWERS; THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW BADGERS PLAYER WAS ALLOWED BACK AT UW; CEPHUS REINSTATEMENT | TITLE IX SPECIALIST HIRED

Texto completo: Basketball star Kobe Bryant, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and professional baseball player Johan Santana all faced accusations of sexual misconduct from women who shared the same attorney: John Clune.
Now Clune joins a team of local lawyers pressing UW-Madison for answers on its decision to readmit Wisconsin Badgers wide receiver Quintez Cephus to the university.
After two female UW-Madison students accused Cephus of sexual assault in 2018, the university expelled Cephus last semester through the university's Title IX process, finding he "more likely than not" violated the nonacademic misconduct code. Cephus was acquitted last month of sexual assault charges by a Dane County criminal jury.
Chancellor Rebecca Blank said "new information" not available to the university during its investigation formed the basis of her decision to readmit Cephus back on campus. Her statement did not describe the new information and university spokesman John Lucas declined to specify.
Clune said the women were not involved in the university's process in determining whether to readmit Cephus. He said that denied them their due process rights under Title IX, the federal law requiring colleges to swiftly respond to student and staff who report sexual harassment and violence, and also violated the Clery Act, another federal law that requires colleges to report campus crime statistics.
"They've done either a horrible job at explaining their decision- making or they did something illegal," he told the Wisconsin State Journal in an interview. "Right now it looks like both, but that's what we've been hired to find out." In reinstating Cephus, UW- Madison appears to have avoided a lawsuit threatened by his team of lawyers. But the university could face potential civil action from the women under Clune.
"Any option is on the table," Clune said. "I hope it doesn't go down that road. These students don't want to be in litigation. They want to be in classes. Their families are frustrated and they're trying to figure out whether this is a safe place for their kids given everything that's gone down."
Clune called Blank's decision to readmit Cephus "unprecedented."
Of the three expelled students who requested readmission to UW-Madison between 2014 and 2018 two for academic misconduct and one for non-academic misconduct none was readmitted, Lucas said.
?Unprecedented' readmission
Clune said the prospect of litigation hinges on how cooperative the university will be in explaining its decision to readmit Cephus. His clients were shut out of the reinstatement process when they received notification of Blank's decision just moments before the public did, he said.
That violates both Title IX and the Clery Act, he said, because those processes require transparency to both the accuser and accused throughout the process.
UW-Madison said it communicated with the women about the readmission decision, and Lucas said the university also kept in contact with them "during the separate Title IX process."
S. Daniel Carter president of Safe Campuses, a campus security consulting firm, and a Clery Act expert said a fairly new amendment to the Clery Act requires colleges to notify both the accuser and the accused of all results and changes to decisions in disciplinary matters. The results must also include an explanation, which he said many universities are not aware is a requirement under Clery.
Clune said that a "vague" letter sent to his clients from the university fails to fully explain the "new information" Blank cited as the basis for Cephus' readmission. He declined to provide the State Journal with a copy of the letter.
An attorney for Cephus, Stephen Meyer, did not respond to calls and emails Thursday and Friday.
National reputation
Clune specializes in Title IX litigation for Hutchinson Black and Cook, a law firm based in Boulder, Colorado. He is a well-known advocate for victims of sexual assault, particularly on college campuses.
He represented a 19-year-old woman in 2004 who said Kobe Bryant sexually assaulted her. The criminal charges were dropped, but Bryant later settled a civil suit for an undisclosed amount, The Denver Post reported.
Clune and the firm took on Florida State University in 2015 for what he saw as an institutional failure to protect a former student who alleged she was raped by football player Jameis Winston. The school settled for $950,000, according to The New York Times.
Clune also filed suit in 2017 against Baylor University, which faced a wave of accusations from women claiming that at least 31 Baylor football players committed more than 50 acts of rape in a four-year span. The Texas university settled the suit for an undisclosed amount, The Waco Herald Tribune reported.
Most recently, Clune represented Deborah Ramirez, who last year accused U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his nomination process of exposing himself to her when the two were students at Yale University in the 1980s.
"Any time you see a class of people who are being mistreated and discriminated against once that light's kind of turned on for you, it's hard to look away from it," Clune told the Washington Post in 2015. CREDIT: KELLY MEYERHOFER kmeyerhofer@madison.com

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump dijo el sábado que canceló las reuniones secretas con los líderes talibanes y el presidente de Afganistán Ashraf Ghani, que se realizarían el domingo en Camp David y suspendió las negociaciones de paz en curso, después de que los talibanes admitieran la responsabilidad de un reciente ataque en el que murió un soldado estadounidense.
Trump dijo enojado que “para construir una influencia falsa”, los talibanes habían admitido un ataque suicida con coche bomba que había matado a un soldado estadounidense y a otras 11 personas en la capital de Kabul.
En una serie de tuits, Trump dijo que tenía previsto reunirse con líderes talibanes en Camp David este domingo.
Sin embargo , canceló la reunión y suspendió las negociaciones. El negociador estadounidense Zalmay Khalilzad había anunciado un acuerdo de paz “en principio” con los talibanes el lunes.
“Sin que lo supieran casi todos, los principales líderes talibanes y, por separado, el presidente de Afganistán, se reunirían conmigo en secreto en Camp David el domingo. Iban a estar en Estados Unidos esta noche”, tuiteó Trump.
“Desafortunadamente, para construir una influencia falsa, admitieron un ataque en Kabul que mató a uno de nuestros grandes grandes soldados y a otras 11 personas. Inmediatamente cancelé la reunión y suspendí las negociaciones de paz. ¿Qué tipo de gente mataría a tantos con el fin de fortalecer aparentemente su posición de negociación?”
Trump continuó: “¡No lo hicieron, solo lo empeoraron! Si no pueden aceptar un alto el fuego durante estas conversaciones de paz muy importantes, e incluso matarían a 12 personas inocentes, entonces probablemente no tengan el poder de negociar un acuerdo significativo de todos modos. ¿Cuántas décadas más están dispuestos a luchar?”
Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to..
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019
….only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don’t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019
Un ataque con coche bomba en Kabul el jueves mató al sargento de Primera Clase Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, de 34 años, de Puerto Rico.
Un miembro del servicio rumano también murió en el ataque, al igual que al menos 10 ciudadanos afganos. Fue el segundo ataque talibán en Kabul en menos de una semana. Los talibanes lanzaron delitos militares en tres provincias la semana pasada.
Los talibanes afirmaron que el aumento en los ataques está justificado para darles una posición más fuerte en las negociaciones , informó el viernes Charlie D’Agata de CBS News.
Al menos 16 miembros del ejército de EEUU han muerto en Afganistán este año, según el Departamento de Defensa.
Estados Unidos espera que su acuerdo con los talibanes lleve al grupo militante a la mesa para que comiencen las conversaciones dentro de Afganistán, antes de las elecciones presidenciales del 28 de septiembre, una reunión que el presidente Ghani insistió en que debe celebrarse a tiempo, y no ser modificada después por un gobierno interino.
Un alto funcionario de la administración dijo a The New York Times que la reunión se había planeado para el lunes, solo dos días antes del aniversario de los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001, que fueron planeados desde Afganistán y condujeron a la invasión de Estados Unidos al país.
Pocos detalles han surgido de las nueve rondas de conversaciones entre Estados Unidos y los talibanes durante casi un año.
Zalmay Khalilzad, el enviado de Trump a Afganistán, dijo que los primeros 5,000 soldados estadounidenses se retirarían de cinco bases en Afganistán dentro de los primeros 135 días de un acuerdo final. Entre 14,000 y 13,000 tropas están actualmente en el país.

Texto completo: Seeking clarification on anti-Semitism
A letter published Aug. 28 and headlined "Adding content on anti-Semitism" points out that Israel is a nation and states that the Jewish people are an ethnic group, both fair statements. Having established the distinctness of each of those identities, the letter addresses a columnist's "confusion because he equates anti-Semitism with any criticism of Israel." "Disapproval of Israel," the letter writer asserts, "is not the same as anti-Semitism."
Disapproval of a country's national identity is a denial of its legitimacy. Extreme examples would be anti-Zionism's objection to Israel's statehood in its historic homeland, as well as the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement. If successful, this movement, bolstered by growing support in universities, in one of our major political parties, and even in the House of Representatives, could leave Israel vulnerable to an attempted final solution to both the nation and a Jewish presence. After Roman expulsion of ancestors, followed by thousands of years of fervent attachment to the land through liturgy, daily prayers, and tangible connections, the Jewish citizens of the sole Jewish state have had to fight costly defensive wars with hostile actors determined upon denying the right to exist. And then there's an Iranian nuclear project.
Disapproval of the government is a different position. Regardless of political spectrum, we are each free to criticize the U. S. administration without being disloyal. Regardless of position, we are each free to criticize the Israeli administration without being anti-Semitic.
The letter writer's innocent question, "What if Jews disagree with the Israeli government?" requires only the reading of editorials by Jewish writers in the New York Times and other liberal media. Similarly, there is no holding-back of vitriol by Israeli Jews against their government in that country's media.

NRA succeeding at limiting gun reforms
Another mass shooting. What will it take for our elected officials to take meaningful actions to address this epidemic? Mass shootings, which involve four or more victims, are occurring in the United States every two weeks. Although a majority of Americans want reasonable gun controls, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has a powerful influence on the administration and Congress.
The NRA, which was founded for the purpose of promoting gun safety, has now morphed into full-time lobbyist for gun manufacturers. It has pushed out Oliver North as president, allowed itself to be infiltrated at the highest level by a female Russian operative, made questionable expenditures and appears to welcome conflict between religions, races and even nations if that will sell more guns. Congress should do what it can to improve mental health, background checks, etc., but if it is really serious it will do something about assault rifles and high-capacity magazines.
Let's see who prevails, the American majority public or the NRA.

Georgia no place for offshore drilling
The twin threats of offshore drilling and seismic testing loom high over Georgia's coast. Currently there are two bills in the U.S. House that would enact permanent moratoriums on offshore drilling on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the eastern section of the Gulf, as well as make future seismic testing unlikely.
I respectively request Congressman Buddy Carter to stand up for our coastal economy and national parks and vote in favor of this legislation. If both bills are passed, at least 50 national park sites nationwide, including those along the Georgia coast, will be safe from oil spills and their disastrous consequences.
For our wildlife ecosystems and the many families whose livelihood depend on them, the potential negative impacts of offshore drilling in Georgia are not mere speculation. Tourism and fishing - both commercial and recreational - are the economic backbone of many Georgia communities.
In 2018, visitors to Cumberland Island National Seashore, Fort Frederica and Fort Pulaski spent over $40.5 million in our state. The family run hotels, restaurants and other businesses rely on healthy parks for a sizable percentage of their profits. Our tourism industry generates over $300 million in wages each year.
Savannah alone welcomes over 14 million visitors each year, and for many, our coastal beaches and parks are their primary reason for traveling to Georgia. An oil spill polluting our air and waters will discourage tourism and would hurt our economy immeasurably.
More than 200 coastal communities including Savannah, Tybee and Brunswick oppose offshore drilling. Oil and gas development is not a tourist attraction, and it does not vote. The citizens of our coast do. My vote is for clean water, clear skies and tourism dollars. I hope Rep. Carter's vote is, too.
Audrey Platt, Savannah
Retiree feeling unwelcome, unappreciated
I am a proud 23-year veteran civil service employee who three years ago retired after 23 years of loyal and diligent service to the 165th Airlift Wing. I am discouraged by the fact that I cannot visit my former co-workers unless I am escorted by an MP or someone else employed there. Have times changed that much?
I was there building, landscaping, plumbing, ordering supplies, hanging ceiling fans, televisions and any other job that needed to be done. Can they at least do me the courtesy of not treating me like a common criminal when I go back to visit? The leadership should give some recognition to those who have changed the scenery, buildings and repaired the base. It would make at least one former employee feel better.

Texto completo: When it comes to freedom of the press in the United States, I truly believe we are at a crisis point. Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump gone after journalists and publications he doesn’t like (at times even boycotting them). Journalists are being targeted and are part of his stump speeches on the campaign trail. He even encourages violence and aggression toward them.
Now the president and his allies are taking his war with the media a step further with a new tactic of digging up dirt on specific reporters. As described in a memo viewed and quoted by Axios, the group says it will circulate the damaging information to Trump-friendly media outlets and others as well.
The top "fake news" targets named in the tactical memo are CNN and MSNBC, "all broadcast networks," the New York Times, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, and their reporters and editors. Axios has also reported, based on unnamed participants, that pro-Trump groups are preparing to attack alleged bias by social media platforms as part of Trump’s 2020 re-election strategy.
Press freedom and trust are at risk
While these tactics are unconventional, it’s more important to focus on the real issue at hand: Freedom of the press and how this will erode trust in the fourth estate. It is critical that the press be allowed to do its job, which means fact-checking and reporting. While today's news cycle has become hyper-partisan, it is still important for journalists to be held accountable — and for them to hold our government accountable. As Thomas Jefferson said, "Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost. "
It's no secret that during the Obama administration there were frequent complaints about right-of-center media outlets for pandering to a specific viewpoint, and they were sent to the back of the line or criticized for what was deemed unfair coverage. But it is hypocritical for the Trump administration to do the same thing (and to a much greater and more dangerous extent). So far we have seen the Trump administration single out journalists and outlets for what he believes to be “fake news,” and even try to revoke White House passes from two reporters. But all outlets deserve the right to report on the happenings at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, because, after all, it is the people's house.
This rhetoric against the media has also become dangerous. In October, there was a series of scary moments when suspicious packages containing faulty pipe bombs were found on or near the properties of many Trump targets, from Barack Obama and the Clintons to CNN's studios. I would hate to jump to conclusions as to why explosive devices were sent to these places, and a judge did not accept the defense argument that Trump's rhetoric contributed to these crimes. Yet it is important to note the language that has consistently come from the White House about journalists and the media as well as Democrats.
Trump ramping up, not calming down
Has this become the new normal? If you are a public official or a member of the press, should you constantly be on edge and fear for your safety or even your life?
What’s more, in the wake of the targeted attacks Trump has only ramped up the attacks on the media by calling the press “truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE” in an April tweet. It is important to remember that leadership comes from the top and America currently has a president who advocates for “body slamming” reporters, mocks and ridicules mainstream media networks and their anchors, calls the media the “enemy of the American people” refers to Democrats as “extremists” and an “angry, ruthless, unhinged mob,” joked about punching protesters in the face, and casts significant blame and name calls Democratic leadership. Trump must stop his own fear-mongering rhetoric against the news media and call for an end to this type of rhetoric overall.
While White House officials are trying to punish various networks for what they deem unfair coverage, they are missing opportunities to correct the record that they feel misrepresents their agenda, and to reach a broader audience. The administration needs to accept that President Trump represents all Americans, not just the ones who voted for him. And with that should come the understanding that not all Americans watch the same news programs.
Agree to disagree. It's free speech.
Throughout the eight years of the Obama administration, conservatives voiced their dissatisfaction with Obama's progressive policies; now it is crucial for conservatives to respect the right of those who disagree with the current president to voice their concerns. Free speech is a foundation of our society and vital to a healthy, vibrant democracy.
Trump consistently belittles reporters he disagrees with and will shut them out from asking questions, but it’s important that they keep asking and don’t stand down. The First Amendment isn't selective; it applies to everyone. Trump would be smart to recognize that the First Amendment he so ardently defended during the campaign also applies to his adversaries and those whose political opinions are different from his.
As the 2020 presidential campaign moves forward, journalists should not fear digging for the truth and should always strive for accuracy in their reporting. They are the guardians of a pillar of our democracy.

Texto completo: [Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's on TV
MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. A year after Saoirse Ronan played a pink-haired, rebellious teenager in the indie drama "Lady Bird," she returned to the big screen as the title character of this period drama, Mary Stuart. Adapted from a biography by John Guy, the film reimagines the decades-long tug of war between Mary and another queen, her Protestant cousin Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). When a young Mary returns to Scotland from France in 1561 and claims the throne, she asserts she also has the right to Elizabeth's crown. That sets off a deadly rivalry between the monarchs, which is heightened by dubious men who manipulate their rulers only to inch closer to royalty. The movie opened to mixed reviews; some critics argued the performances were uneven and that Ronan dominates the picture. And while historians may find faults in the plot, the visuals place you right in 16th-century Britain. (The film received Oscar nominations for costume design and makeup and hairstyling.) THE FAVOURITE (2018), another historical drama about women scheming for royalty, leads in at 5:55 p.m.
WOW -- WOMEN OF WRESTLING 8 p.m. on AXS TV. Fans of Netflix's "GLOW" who prefer watching the ladies go at it in the ring instead of in the locker room may want to tune in to this wrestling show. "WOW" is created by David McLane, the founder of the 1980s Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling league and TV franchise, which "GLOW" is based on. The series has had a few short-lived iterations in the past, but it returned to television in January with a long lineup of formidable "superheroes" (i.e. wrestlers). Season 2 introduces a new wrestler, Teal Piper, and opens with a three-way match that will determine who will fight Tessa Blanchard, the WOW World Champion.
GARY OWEN: #DOINWHATIDO (2019) 10:30 p.m. on Showtime. The fast-talking comedian Gary Owen revisits his early days as a military police officer and riffs on race in this new special, his fourth for Showtime. He also opens up about his friendship with Kevin Hart and says he's glad to be a comedian whose reputation hasn't been tarnished by a high-profile scandal -- referring to the downfalls of Bill Cosby and Roseanne Barr.
What's Streaming
HAPPY-GO LUCKY (2008) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Consider this dramedy your go-to pick-me-up. Directed by Mike Leigh, the movie stars Sally Hawkins (in her breakthrough role) as Poppy, a bubbly 30-year-old schoolteacher in London who only sees the good in the world. We watch her take up driving lessons with a crabby instructor, go out on the town with her friends and get scolded by her sister for not taking life too seriously. Manohla Dargis named the film a Critic's Pick in her review for The New York Times, calling Poppy one of Leigh's "most persuasive optimists."

Tax law helped wealthy Americans

Texto completo: Congressman Rodney Davis does not maintain the urban and rural populations of District 13 informed of what is really happening in Washington, nor defend our interests. He refuses to tell us the truth.

Fortunately, investigative journalists expose on a daily basis the scandalous actions of the temporary tenant in the White House.

Davis claimed that the tax bill (2017) would benefit primarily middle-class families.

Lie No. 1: This law actually gave an annual tax benefit of $1,500,000,000 to the top 0.1 percent of the population. This tax bracket only had 141,205 families in 2015, and each earned at least $2.2 million annually. How many 0.1 percent families exist in District 13? Can The New-Gazette give us this answer?

Lie No. 2: Davis said that tax declarations would be "postcard-size" documents. Tax declarations are now more complicated for most.

Lie No. 3: A recent New York Times expose on how a six-page section of the tax law, which was sold as a way to attract investments in low-income rural and urban areas, called "Opportunity Zones," is simply another scam that reduces the tax bill of billionaires like the Trump organization and the Kushner family.

The article outlined how the OZ provisions encourage building projects for the wealthiest Americans by granting investors tax-deferrals for up to seven years on capital gain taxes and allowing them to cash out after 10 years without owing any taxes on their profits. These investments do not require that the projects provide jobs or housing for rural or urban working and low-income families.

Organize for November 2020.

Next Brexit brawl: Date for elections

Texto completo: LONDON - As a law to prevent a no-deal Brexit hurtled toward passage Thursday, British lawmakers began drawing the battle lines for their next fight: when to hold a general election that is now inevitable.
Opposition lawmakers have so far blocked Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan for a mid-October election, but the government said Thursday that it would hold another parliamentary vote on an early election Monday.
That set up a significant clash over when British voters will get to decide who should handle Britain's departure from the European Union, with opposition Labour lawmakers haggling over what stage of the Brexit process gives them the best chance of wrenching control from Johnson's enfeebled government.
Johnson sees an election as the only way to create a stable majority for his Conservative Party in Parliament and secure a mandate for pulling Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31, with or without a deal governing future relations.
"I don't want an election at all, but frankly I cannot see any other way," he said Thursday during a speech in northern England promoting a plan to hire more police officers. "The only way to get this thing moving is to make that decision."
To keep alive the possibility of pulling Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31, Johnson wants to hold the election as quickly as possible. But opposition lawmakers are reluctant to let him schedule the election on his terms.
Some of them reason that postponing a vote until November would force Johnson to abide by a law blocking a no-deal Brexit and to ask Brussels for a delay, thereby breaking the central promise of his tenure.
Johnson said Thursday that he "would rather be dead in a ditch" than ask for that delay.
The prime minister, fresh off purging his party of 21 of its most senior lawmakers for defying his government, received an even more personal blow to his authority Thursday when his younger brother, Jo Johnson, resigned from Parliament, suggesting that working in the prime minister's Cabinet was no longer in "the national interest."
He was also fending off calls from senior ministers in his own Cabinet to restore those 21 lawmakers to the party.
Despite his battering from all sides this week, Johnson appeared committed to putting his vaunted campaigning skills to the test.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, sitting notably upright after a furor over his slouch this week, said that Parliament would hold another vote for an early election Monday. That is the same day the bill stopping a no-deal Brexit is expected to receive royal assent and become law.
The early-election vote, requiring two-thirds of law-makers to pass, will once again depend on the support of opposition lawmakers, and Thursday it remained unclear what side they would take.

The 10 best new shows coming to TV this fall

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

Texto completo: I am a sick man. I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased.
I am one of those fanatics on the alt-right and the alt-left, the ones who make online forums so vicious, the ones who cancel and call out, the minority of online posters who fill the air with hate. I’m one of those radicals whose rage is intertwined with psychological fragility, whose anger at real wrongs is corrupted by my existential panic about myself.
To know anything about me you have to understand the chaos at the core of my innermost being. I was raised without coherent moral frameworks. I was raised amid social fragmentation and division, the permanent flux of liquid modernity.
Adults in my life have not been trustworthy. Friends have not been trustworthy. Women reject me. I passed through school unseen. You have no idea how ill equipped I am to deal with my pain. I was raised in that coddling way that protects you from every risk except real life.
When I was younger my eyes pleaded: Tell me what adulthood and manhood are supposed to look like! All you said was, “You can be anything you want to be!” How does that help? You told me I was special, but the world goes on as if I don’t exist.
I yearn for order. Blunt simplicities. Politics provides the Manichaean binaries I can’t find anywhere else, and so I make everything political. Own the libs! Smash the racist right! A war of pure good and pure evil.
I crave the single narrative that will make everything clear: Everything is race. Everything is class. Everything is moral rot caused by godlessness. They say that fundamentalism is rigid and authoritarian. I say to them: Yes! I want fundamentalism. Please wrap me in that rigidity. Otherwise, I have no coherent self.
Catastrophizing is my mindset. Catastrophizing is pure: Society is totally corrupt. The “system” is totally rotten. I am terrified by ambiguity and ambivalence, the idea that the glass might be only half full. I seize on the extreme example of anything and take it to be the typical case. In this way I create my truth. An immigrant committed murders, so immigrants are murderers.
People are not defined by individual traits but by group ones. Individual persons are too complicated, but groups are abstract and easy to stereotype. Every human being gets reduced to some category, preferably the cunning ones I despise: the libs, white males.
I need leaders and spokesmen who will never show uncertainty. I want leaders who tell simple blame stories. It’s the bankers! It’s the immigrants! I want intellectual put-down artists who will crush the other side and let me vicariously enjoy their triumphs on YouTube again and again.
My moral system is simple, too. Up is evil, and down is good. People above me on the status hierarchy are venal, while those of us in my group are victims of their corruption. The existence of any hierarchy itself is prima facie proof of injustice.
From the abstract vantage point of my computer screen, I see a world in which my opponents are elite oppressors and my kind are oppressed. They have their exclusive cliques, and I am disdained. And here we get to the ultimate injustice: Why are they recognized while I am not? This is the molten core from which my indignation flows. The status quo does not respect me, and therefore I despise it.
So my politics is not really about issues; it’s epic wars for recognition. I don’t deal with the complexities of economics or foreign affairs. I seize upon the minor missteps made by my opponents in order to discredit their kind. You stumbled? I delight in crushing you! Owning the libs spares me the terrifying ambiguity of actually getting to know one.
I’ve lost faith in reason. Communication is for condemnation and arousal. Forgiveness has become foreign to me. Sometimes you have to be vicious for justice. If I afflict the comfortable I have served justice. I don’t have to worry about comforting the afflicted. If I attack faraway wrongdoers I don’t have to worry about tutoring a child.
Online war is a force that gives life meaning. Hatred gives me that delicious simulacrum of power. Did you really think you could raise me on gourmet coffee and yoga pants and I wouldn’t find a way to rebel against your relativism and materialism? Didn’t you observe the eternal pattern — that if you try to flatten a man to the bourgeois he will rebel by becoming a fanatic?
And yet ... somehow it’s not working. Somehow politics doesn’t fill my soul, bring me peace or end my existential anxiety. I have helped create a harsh world in which vulnerability is impossible and without vulnerability there can be no relationship. Relationship is the thing that I long for the most and that I make impossible. I have cut myself off from the only thing that can save me.
I am indignant. I am superior. I read Dostoyevsky’s “Notes From The Underground.” I am alone.

Texto completo: YORK COUNTY – One of the two people killed in a York County crash Tuesday near Rock Hill was Grammy award winning songwriter LaShawn Daniels, officials and Daniels' family said.
The Herald reported Tuesday after the crash on S.C.5 east of Rock Hill that two people were killed, according to S.C. Highway Patrol. Two others were hurt, troopers said.
Daniels, 41, was identified Thursday morning in a written statement as one of Tuesday's crash fatality victims by York County Coroner Sabrina Gast.
Daniels' wife, April, released a statement Wednesday saying her husband had been killed in a car crash in South Carolina, the Associated Press and other outlets reported.
Daniels' residence was listed by Gast as Waxhaw, N.C., in Union County, east of Charlotte and northeast of York County.
The other man who died in the crash was Jackie Dean Moss, 32, from Kings Mountain, North Carolina, Gast said.
Gast said that Moss was driving a truck that struck a van driven by Daniels. Both vehicles caught fire, Gast said.
Gast said that positive identification is pending DNA confirmation.
The statement from Daniels' wife said:
"It is with deep and profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved husband, father, family member, and friend LaShawn Daniels, who was the victim of a fatal car accident in South Carolina," April Daniels said in the statement. "Daniels was a man of extraordinary faith and a pillar in our family."
Celebrities sent out condolences through Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and other social media sites. His death was reported in the New York Times, CNN, Billboard and other entertainment news outlets.
Daniels, 41, wrote "Say My Name" for Destiny's Child featuring Beyonce, the Associated Press reported. He also wrote songs for Toni Braxton, Tamar Braxton, and other popular entertainers including Whitney Houston. He also contributed on Beyoncé's "Telephone," Jennifer Lopez's "If You Had My Love" and Michael Jackson's "You Rock My World."
Daniels, nicknamed Big Shiz, was known by his Twitter handle @BigShiz.
The wreck involved three vehicles, troopers said.
Two people from Rock Hill were hurt in the collision on S.C. 5 east of Rock Hill near the Catawba River bridge that leads to Lancaster County, Trooper Joe Hovis of S.C. Highway Patrol said.

Texto completo: Trump, why target kids of military parents?
Why does the Trump administration hate the military? I thought our president "loved" the military. Sorry, Sergeant X, the child you just had at the base hospital in Germany isn't a U.S. citizen. Sorry, Ambassador X, the child you just had in X country isn't a U.S. citizen. Don't bring those kids back here unless you've got papers. Too many illegal immigrants here already; that's why I'm building a wall. Why join the military and risk children born while stationed overseas not being U.S. citizens without "applying"? This is no way to treat our military, diplomats and civil service employees working overseas. Disgraceful.

Columnist disingenuous to defend Biden's lies
To defend Joe Biden's lies, New York Times columnist David Brooks said Biden "might embellish stories to make them more dramatic, but he's mendacious. He's not irresponsible." Before defending Biden's lying, Brooks said Biden's statements shouldn't be compared to President Trump's. Mr. Brooks should know that America knows "embellish" is a euphemism, a kind way of saying Biden tells lies as he campaigns to defeat President Trump in 2020. Brooks' saying Biden's statements shouldn't be compared to President Trump's shows the liberal line of logic: It's OK for a liberal to lie but not a conservative. Lying is never an alternative to telling the truth, whether it's about former Vice President Joe Biden pinning a medal on a soldier or Sen. Elizabeth Warren falsely claiming Native American heritage. America should hear the truth, not lies, by candidates seeking any elected office, especially the presidency.

Motivating workers to stay in dead-end jobs

Texto completo: I usually read the New York Times to find out what I don't like about its elitist East Coast political opinions. A lot of people in the heartland do that, so nothing new there.
However, a recent business article in the Grey Lady piqued my interest for another reason. It reported on an individual who found happiness shedding a six-figure vice president job and a corner office suite to take a low-level retail job with little possibility of advancement.
Most people have a social clock that rings when life's big events should occur, such as educational attainment, marriage, children, first big job promotion, etc. and use it to keep pace with their contemporaries.
Others seem indifferent to such societal demands and have an internal life compass and march to their own drum beat. Many of these folks create a lifestyle that features work in a low-stress job for a decent wage that gives them the freedom to use their leisure time to find joy and satisfaction in hobbies and avocations of their choice. No all-consuming, pressure-filled, decades-long career climbs for these people.
What approach should an employer take toward an employee with little interest in advancement, when a career with the company is not what the employee seeks? How do you recruit or manage such a person?
Here are some informal observations I've made during my many years of hiring and supervising such employees.
If your company has an up-or-out policy regarding employee advancement, it is important to screen applicants carefully during the recruitment process by checking employment histories, diligently gathering references and reviewing the results of personal interviews. Such an approach helps eliminate potential non-strivers from your employment roster. The applicant's focus on pay and benefits to the exclusion of training and advancement opportunities often was a key indicator for me as a lack career aspirations with the company.
Organizations willing to hire employees content to fill dead-end or limited-growth jobs should identify motivators that will keep those employees working efficiently. Rewards for longevity and loyalty to the company should be adopted. Generous time-off policies will be attractive to this employee group. The availability of training programs designed to equip employees with the skills for lateral transfers to other entry level jobs also should be put in place. I have found that some low-level employees can be excellent trainers for new entry level workers performing similar duties. These long-term employees are ideal for passing on the company's culture and work norms.
The long term, one-job competent employee should be seen in the context of the company's entire workforce and viewed as part of a continuum of employees, each striving for advancement to different levels in the company. There will be those seeking the CEO chair, many others seeking mid-level management positions and others content to hang on to the bottom rung of the career ladder. Organizational chaos would occur if everyone in the workforce saw themselves as future CEOs or were satisfied to remain in low skilled positions.
There are good reasons for hiring and nurturing entry level employees. In addition to the valuable contributions they can make to the enterprise, in my experience they tend to have high job satisfaction levels that lead to reduced absentee and turnover rates and might lessen the use of the company's mental health benefits.

Progressives Keep Calm in the Trump Era; The unhinged hatred comes mostly from centrist Democrats.

Texto completo: Many presidents provoke personal animus beyond opposition to their policies. Ronald Reagan inspired angry punk songs. George W. Bush drove Democrats to distraction. (I still occasionally contribute to a Bush-era website called Smirking Chimp.) Bill Clinton and Barack Obama each evoked conspiracy theories on the far right.
Trump derangement syndrome is therefore familiar. But it's also different in an important respect: While it's epidemic among centrist Democrats, most progressives are immune.
"Re-electing Donald Trump would take us into a dangerous moral direction from which it will take a wrenching turn to get us back," insists MSNBC's Chris Matthews, who once worked for Speaker Tip O'Neill. "Instead of delivering us from evil, it will deliver us to evil." New York Times columnist Charles Blow issued this histrionic call for impeachment: "Trump has dragged this country into the gutter, and his targets have no choice but to get in the gutter with him and slug it out." If Mr. Blow isn't your idea of a centrist, consider that in 2016 he blithely dismissed Bernie Sanders's challenge to Hillary Clinton: "Sometimes you have to cut deals to reach ideals. That's politics."
Sure, progressives oppose Mr. Trump, but we're calm about it—enough so that many of us never got caught up in the phony scandal of Russian collusion. "It's Safe to Impeach Donald Trump," the Nation matter-of-factly proclaimed last month.
When moderate Democrats complain about Mr. Trump's "radicalism," progressives stop listening. That's partly because there's a bit of ideological overlap between the leftist antiglobalization movement and the president's economic nationalism and skepticism about military intervention. But for the most part our views are at odds with his: We want single-payer health care, more-powerful unions, higher wages and stronger regulation. Progressives don't think a moderate like Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg would be enough of an improvement.
Besides, from a progressive standpoint other presidents of both parties have been worse than Mr. Trump. George W. Bush and Barack Obama transferred trillions of dollars to Wall Street in 2008-09 while distressed homeowners and the unemployed twisted in the wind. Mr. Obama expanded Mr. Bush's program of political assassinations using unmanned drones. Mr. Bush effectively legalized torture and ginned up the invasion of Iraq. Bill Clinton refused to resign after he got caught having sex in the Oval Office with an intern. None of Mr. Trump's military actions, cronyism or scandals come close.
So why the overwrought reaction to him? What really separates Mr. Trump from predecessors is his style: the campaign-style rallies centered on his freewheeling, trash-talking monologues; his trolling of rivals on Twitter; his gleeful refusal to stop making inflammatory statements.
Moderates mistake tone for content. It goes with their identity-politics obsession, in which words matter more than substance. Mr. Trump's manner is over-the-top, masculine and hyperaggressive. He loves racially coded language. He's not all that conservative, but he sounds like a right-wing demagogue. That's what's freaking centrists out.
It still matters when the president says something, even on Twitter at 3 a.m. But progressives care too much about ideas to take it all that seriously.

Texto completo: A former Planned Parenthood Arizona employee was awarded $3 million last month after a jury found she was wrongfully terminated when she alerted her supervisors to ongoing, unsafe medical practices.
Protecting it's abortion business
By Denise Burke
For years, Planned Parenthood paraded the misleading claim that abortion made up only 3% of its services. And while the abortion giant has flown that flag a little lower since that statistic was thoroughly discredited, perhaps what Planned Parenthood meant to say all along was that abortion safety plays a minuscule role in its operation.
That’s what Mayra Rodriguez found when, after more than 15 years working for Planned Parenthood clinics across the state, she uncovered a disturbing trend of shoddy abortion patient care that was putting women’s lives at risk. While what she found shocked her, it will come as no surprise to those who are well-acquainted with the duplicity behind Planned Parenthood’s carefully crafted public façade.
What Mayra uncovered wasn’t just enough to get her fired from Planned Parenthood. It was enough to spur a jury to award her $3 million in a recently decided wrongful termination lawsuit in Maricopa County, Arizona.
Protect women: My rapist fought for custody of my daughter. States can't keep survivors tied to rapists.
It’s also enough to convince anyone with an open mind that Planned Parenthood prioritizes abortion above all else — even if that means voluntarily cutting itself off from Title X funding and charging poor women more money to make up the new shortfall in government funding.
Planned Parenthood’s commitment to abortion also overrides even the most basic standards of care for the women who enter its doors.
Lawsuit exposes disturbing practices
Named “employee of the year” in 2016, Mayra began noting serious health and safety violations at Planned Parenthood the following year. As her lawsuit describes, Mayra was summarily fired after raising multiple concerns.
Within days, her bosses had destroyed key documents that captured a series of dangerous and very likely illegal actions from the Planned Parenthood abortionists she oversaw as a clinic administrator.
As she dug deeper into a troubling uptick of patients Planned Parenthood was sending to the hospital with “substantial post-abortion surgery complications,” Mayra traced the trend to one Planned Parenthood abortionist in particular.
On one occasion, a medical assistant confirmed that this practitioner carried out an “incomplete abortion,” where one or more body parts from the aborted baby remained in the mother’s womb. Incomplete abortions can lead to serious infection, sepsis and even septic shock.
Whistleblower's story is not unique
That was no isolated incident. Mayra soon found out that, before the abortion was even performed, the same abortionist — who still works at Planned Parenthood — had his medical assistants prematurely complete medical forms affirming that they had ensured that all the body parts from the not-yet-aborted baby had been removed from the womb.
The law lets men off easy: Want to end abortion? Hold men — fathers of those unplanned children — accountable.
But that isn’t all Mayra saw before she was kicked to the curb. In September 2017, Mayra learned that, in violation of state law, a Planned Parenthood clinic she oversaw failed to report carrying out an abortion on an underage teen who had an adult sexual partner. Mayra reported this to a supervisor and, one month later, she was dismissed.
Mayra Rodriguez is not the first Planned Parenthood employee to speak out on the organization’s startling disregard for the health, safety and well-being of its patients — including allegedly minors. Abby Johnson is a former Planned Parenthood clinic director with a story similar to Rodriguez’s, and it is every bit as grim as Mayra’s.
The lesson is simple. Planned Parenthood will protect its abortion business at all costs. Even if that means it sends some women to the hospital — or worse.

What others are saying
Bryan Howard, Planned Parenthood Arizona statement: "For 85 years — since 1934 — Planned Parenthood Arizona has provided health care and health information to hundreds of thousands of Arizonans according to stringent quality and safety standards. Our patients' health and safety is our highest priority. . . . We support the role of our court system in ensuring workplaces are safe, fair, inclusive and comply with the law. We believe the outcome in this instance was not supported by the facts. While we disagree with the verdict and the damages award, we will not allow this event to distract from Planned Parenthood's 100% focus on protecting access to health care for those Arizonans who need it most. We will consider next steps with that priority in mind. "
Mayra Rodriguez, statement: "I hope my case is a lesson to other workers that shows them that the truth will prevail. I also hope my case is a lesson to employers who abuse their power: Sometimes the underdog wins, and justice will be done. . . . Planned Parenthood publicly states they want to help and stand up for immigrants, that they care about these women, but it’s not true. They shamed me for my immigration status. But here we are, the jury heard the truth. "
Leana S. Wen, The New York Times: "In my farewell message to (Planned Parenthood) colleagues, I cited philosophical differences over the best way to protect reproductive health. While the traditional approach has been through prioritizing advocating for abortion rights, I have long believed that the most effective way to advance reproductive health is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one. . . . There was immediate criticism that I did not prioritize abortion enough. While I am passionately committed to protecting abortion access, I do not view it as a stand-alone issue. . . . In the end, I was asked to leave for the same reason I was hired: I was changing the direction of Planned Parenthood. "
What our readers are saying
She made what appear to be valid complaints about procedures and personnel, and this ended up with (Planned Parenthood) using its system to get rid of her. That speaks to the arrogance of its leadership. . . . Good for Ms. Rodriguez. She fought a lonely battle.
— Jack Lavelle
Let this nation know the Trump administration is effectively backing abstinence. How funny is that coming from him. Should we follow his lead on how he does it?
— Jacqueline Blaszka Campbell
Good. I hope that this will be the beginning of the end for Planned Parenthood.
— Jason Martin
I can see why the 1 percenters and the poorly educated vote Republican, but why would women vote for them?
— Wayne Leslie

Texto completo: The book Bassey Ikpi first set out to write was far different from the one she eventually published.
Ikpi, a Nigerian-American who made her name as a slam poet who was a mainstay of HBO’s Def Poetry Jam, says the original intent was to write a motivational, self-help tome about how she had conquered mental illness and become a star.
She wrestled with the book until realizing she simply couldn’t write it.
“I was writing things I didn’t like, and I’ve always been of the mind that I never want to sell something I wouldn’t buy,” says Ikpi, who will talk about her book Thursday at the Ware Center in downtown Lancaster. “As it stood, I wouldn’t buy the book I was writing, and then I was struggling to figure out what to write, how to write ... It just felt inauthentic and false and didn’t speak to where I really was.
“It was all lies as opposed to telling the truth but lying.”
The book she wrote, titled “I’m Telling the Truth, But I’m Lying,” is an intimate, harrowing memoir that pulls the reader inside the author’s world as she struggles to function with a “broken brain.” The title is a nod to Ikpi’s determination to root out emotional truths, perhaps at the expense of mere facts.
The book is a collection of powerful essays that trace Ikpi’s journey from her childhood in Nigeria to her stay in a psychiatric unit after being diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder.
The essays, written over a period of 19 years, are stitched together in a way that makes the book read like a novel. The sharply written memoir, which was published last month and currently sits on the New York Times bestseller list for paperback nonfiction, gathers steam and suspense as it hurtles toward its conclusion.
Ikpi, 43, who lives in Maryland with her son, says she hopes the book serves as both a mirror and a window.
After being diagnosed with Bipolar II, Ikpi says she started researching it and didn’t find many articles or books that were relatable because they were not written by people of color.
She says much of the feedback she’s received are from people who have recently been diagnosed with Bipolar II and found something of themselves in her book.
Ikpi says she also wanted family and friends to understand her struggle.
“I wanted them to see how difficult it’s been for me to just wake up in the morning and get up and do the things that seem so natural and easy — eating and sleeping ... eating and sleeping are two of the easiest things we’re supposed to do — and showcase just how difficult these easy things are for somebody whose brain is constantly battling against them,” she says.
It’s also clear that Ikpi wrote the book for herself as she continues her struggle to overcome her illness.
“I’m doing great,” she says when asked the inevitable question. “I’m 100 percent the healthiest I’ve ever been in my life. This book was very helpful for that.”

Resumen: "The majority of the people on this trip appeared to have been from the Santa Cruz-San Jose-Bay Area region," Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said at a news conference Tuesday. The National Transportation Safety Board has joined the U.S. Coast Guard in investigating the cause of the fire, which broke out around 3 a.m. Monday, trapping sleeping passengers below deck. Three sisters, their father and their stepmother also were on the diving trip and were among those unaccounted for after the fire, according to a Facebook post Tuesday morning from their mother, Susana Solano Rosas, whose social media accounts identified her as a nurse for the Stockton Unified School District.

Texto completo: SANTA CRUZ >> Untold heartbreak and grief permeated communities across Santa Cruz and the Bay Area as authorities revealed that most of the victims of Monday's devastating diving boat fire off the Channel Islands were from Northern California.
Hope that anyone beyond five crew members had escaped the inferno was extinguished early Tuesday as the Coast Guard ended its search for survivors from the 75-foot vessel Conception, effectively affirming that 34 people out of the 39 total passengers and crew died in the disaster.
Among those victims were five members of a Stockton family, a Fremont physics teacher and two Santa Cruz high school students, according to accounts from family and friends that emerged as authorities worked to identify the dead.
"The majority of the people on this trip appeared to have been from the Santa Cruz-San Jose-Bay Area region," Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said at a news conference Tuesday.
The National Transportation Safety Board has joined the U.S. Coast Guard in investigating the cause of the fire, which broke out around 3 a.m. Monday, trapping sleeping passengers below deck.
There was "no indication at all" that any of those people were able to escape, Brown said, after the fire apparently blocked both of the exit points out of the quarters.
Search crews have recovered the bodies of 20 people, 11 female and nine male, Brown said. Divers spotted five bodies still inside the boat late Monday but were unable to immediately recover them. Nine people still had not been located as of Tuesday evening.
Brown said officials are still collecting information about the ages and hometowns of the victims, adding that they are now asking family members for DNA samples to confirm those victims' identities.
Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said crews suspended their search for survivors around 9:40 a.m. Tuesday after they did not see new signs of distress or debris. After seven rescue missions spread over 24 hours, scouring an area of about 160 square miles, Coast Guard crews now have shifted their efforts to finding remains and recovering the vessel.
"Our hearts, our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims," Rochester said.
'BLOCKED BY FIRE'
Only five crew members, whose quarters were above the boat's deck on the highest of its three levels, were able to escape, making their way to a nearby pleasure vessel, The Grape Escape, according to the Coast Guard. Two had minor injuries.
Bob and Shirley Hansen, who own The Grape Escape, told The New York Times they were asleep when they heard pounding on the side of their vessel about 3:30 a.m. That's when they said they saw Conception completely engulfed.
"I could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat," Bob Hansen said. There were these explosions every few beats. You can't prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous."
Brown said that some of the explosions that occurred on the vessel may have been exploding scuba or propane tanks.
Authorities still are investigating how the victims died, Brown said, adding that DNA testing was needed because some of the bodies were badly burned in what he described as an "extraordinarily hot fire."
"It is appearing as though the people who were below deck were trapped and unable to exit the vessel," he said. "There was a stairwell to get down the main entryway up and down and there was an escape hatch. And it would appear as though both of those were blocked by fire."
WELL-KNOWN DIVE BOAT
The Conception which was was based in Santa Barbara Harbor and owned by a local company, Truth Aquatics had departed Friday on a three-day excursion to Channel Islands National Park. A memorial outside Truth Aquatics in Santa Barbara Harbor grew Tuesday as mourners came to pay their respects.
Charles McKinven, manager of Sunnyvale-based Pacific Scuba Divers, said he had been aboard Conception in the past and noted the popular vessel was well-known among California divers.
"If you talk to any diver in the area who's dived the Channel Islands, they've been on that boat," McKinven said, adding that two of the boat fire victims were longtime patrons of the Sunnyvale dive shop.
McKinven said a tragedy on this scale is virtually unheard of in diving.
"I think everybody pretty much is in shock that something like this could happen to such a big group of divers, in general," he said. "I've been diving for 40-odd years, I've been teaching for 20 of those. I've never heard of an incident like this with a dive boat before."
LEARNING OF VICTIMS
As hope dwindled that any passengers would be found alive Tuesday, names of victims began to emerge on social media Tuesday, as hope dwindled that any of the missing passengers would be found alive.
Pacific Collegiate School in Santa Cruz confirmed that two students and the parents of one student were aboard the Conception.
"Our hearts and thoughts are with the families of the victims and those yet missing, particularly those of our students and parents on board," head of school Maria C. Reitano wrote in a statement. "Right now, our priority as a school community is to support our students, staff, and families in the wake of this tragedy."
In Fremont, the school district said that American High School physics teacher Scott Chan was among the victims.
Diving instructor Kristy Finstad, whose Santa Cruz-based company Worldwide Diving Adventures chartered the boat, was also on board the vessel, according to a Facebook post by her brother, Brett Harmeling.
Three sisters, their father and their stepmother also were on the diving trip and were among those unaccounted for after the fire, according to a Facebook post Tuesday morning from their mother, Susana Solano Rosas, whose social media accounts identified her as a nurse for the Stockton Unified School District. The family had been celebrating their father's birthday.
Rosas' husband, Chris Rosas, said Tuesday afternoon that he and his wife along with other relatives of the victims were still waiting for more information from authorities.
"We're in Santa Barbara with all the other people who lost someone in the accident," Chris Rosas said. "We're all talking to each other, just being together."

LOOK BEYOND THE TWEETS FOR TRUMP'S DEVASTATION OF AMERICAN POLICIES, TRADITIONS; PLAIN TALK

Texto completo: Here's yet another example of the devastation that the Trump admin-istration is causing the country while the nation's eyes are diverted by his tweets.
Every so often, in between his outlandish tweet bullying and know-nothingness, we get a glimpse of what's happening beneath the radar, but not often enough for Americans to realize how bad it is.
Columnist Tim Egan of the New York Times, long an advocate for the country's national parks and the importance of saving natural wilderness areas for future generations, recently likened Donald Trump's appointment of William Perry Pendley as the Interior Department's deputy director of land management to the American Cancer Society putting the head of Philip Morris in charge of its operations.
"This is another Onion headline that writes itself: Trump's pick for public lands doesn't believe in public lands," Egan wrote.
This has been a pattern especially with anything concerning the environment since Trump took the oath of office in January 2017. While he's been tweeting his latest outrage about anything that annoys him, his gallery of, as Egan puts it, "awful human beings, monumental incompetents, wife-beaters, frauds and outright criminals appointed to high positions is large and varied. As wanted posters, they would fill an entire post office wall."
Pendley is now in charge of the Bureau of Land Management that oversees 248 million acres of land that technically belongs to every American citizen. He is in charge of that land now after making a career of suing the government over regulations that protect fish and wildlife on those acres. And just a couple of years ago, he proclaimed that the country's Founding Fathers wanted all lands owned by the federal government put up for sale in the first place.
The BLM is separate from the National Park Service, another arm of the Interior Department.
But, national parks, too, aren't faring very well under this administration. You'll remember that shortly after taking office, Trump ordered the shrinking of four federal monuments that had been formed to protect and preserve Native American lands in the west, so they could be opened for grazing and other for-profit endeavors.
The national parks have been woefully under-funded for the past several years, predating Trump's ascension to power. But Trump's first budget sought to cut maintenance dollars even further and, lest it be forgotten, he diverted $2.5 million from the money earmarked for maintenance at parks like Yellowstone, the Grand Tetons and others so that he could pull off his 4th of July celebration on the National Mall this summer.
This is yet another example of Trump refusing to improve the country's infrastructure, something he promised to do if elected, at the expense of tax cuts for big corporations and wealthy individuals. Thanks to those cuts the only significant piece of legislation that Trump has achieved in his nearly three years in office the country is facing a trillion-dollar deficit in next year's budget. Consequently, while Wall Street lavishes in fewer taxes and bigger profits, many of the nation's urgent needs continue to go unanswered.
What didn't fly under the radar, fortunately, was Interior's plans to rollback the Endangered Species Act that is credited with saving among other birds, plants and animals, America's national symbol, the bald eagle. That announcement has created an uproar not only among environmentalists and conservationists, but anyone who has paid attention to recent reports that the world is facing the extinction of up to a million species because of the changing climate.
Hopefully, even the Trump-supporting Republicans in Congress will rally to stop that outrage in its tracks.
Pendley is just the most recent example of the people now in charge of America's hard-won policies and traditions that have served the people admirably for decades. There's the Department of Labor secretary who doesn't believe in labor and the Department of Energy secretary who opposes renewable energy, the acting chief of immigration who wants to change the words on the Statue of Liberty, the secretary of state who doesn't believe in diplomacy and, well, the list is virtually endless.
As the 2020 election approaches, it's critical for America to look beyond the tweets. CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Dave Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison.com, 608-252-6410 and on Twitter @DaveZweifel.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Former Obama White House counsel Gregory Craig was acquitted Wednesday of giving false information to federal authorities about his work on behalf of the Ukrainian government amid a new crackdown on illicit foreign influence.
The case against Craig, a high-powered Washington lawyer, was one of a handful of investigations that grew out of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Craig was acquitted after more than two weeks of testimony followed by less than five hours of deliberation. Craig faced trial in federal court for falsifying and concealing information about his work for the government of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Americans who work on behalf of foreign governments within the United States are required to register with the Justice Department.
"The jury reached the only verdict it could possibly reach," William Taylor, one of Craig's attorneys, told reporters, questioning why the Justice Department decided to prosecute Craig in the first place. "It's a tragedy. It's a disgrace. We're glad it's over. "
Prosecutors said Craig, with the prospect of million-dollar earnings, did work for Yanukovych's government and sought to conceal the extent of his dealings with Ukrainians to protect his reputation. Assistant U. S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez described Craig as a highly experienced attorney and a "man of precision" who very carefully crafted falsehoods to deceive the Justice Department.
Defense attorneys portrayed Craig as a man of integrity, ensnared in a web of dirty tricks spun by individuals who sought to lie on behalf of the Ukrainian government.
"We live in a cynical world," defense attorney William Murphy said, quoting Tom Cruise from the movie, "Jerry Maguire. " But in the cynical world that is Washington, Craig stood out as a principled man who tells his friends and colleagues only the "candid truth," Murphy told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday.
The charge against Craig stemmed from work he did in 2012 on behalf of a pro-Russian political faction in Ukraine, part of an illicit lobbying effort by Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman who's serving a combined seven-year prison sentence after he was convicted of fraud, conspiracy and other charges in Virginia and Washington.
Craig's law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, was hired to write a report about the prosecution of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was sentenced to seven years in prison for abusing her power. The country's pro-Russia government sought to portray the trial as fair and improve Ukraine's public image amid an international public relations crisis. Craig refused to report the work to the Justice Department, as required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors charged that Craig negotiated with the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice for a contract that falsely stated the work would not require reporting to the U. S. government. Registering would have required Craig's firm to disclose that a wealthy Ukrainian paid it more than $4 million for its services, prosecutors said. The funds were routed through a bank account in Cyprus that was controlled by Manafort.
Prosecutors said that Craig was heavily involved in the media strategy ahead of the report's release in late 2012. They said that the Justice Department's FARA unit would have required Craig to register had it known about his role in crafting the press roll out.
At the heart of his trial is his interactions with New York Times reporter David Sanger, to whom he gave an interview and personally delivered an advance copy of the report. Craig also spoke with a reporter from the United Kingdom. After the report was released, Manafort praised Craig for the "effective" roll out and told him that people in Kiev are "very happy" with the report's portrayal in the media, according to the indictment.
"You are the MAN," Manafort told Craig in an email.

Campoamor-Sanchez said during closing arguments that Craig's crime was not writing the report, or talking to a reporter about it.
"It is not even a crime to get paid $4 million from an account in Cyprus for writing the report," Campoamor-Sanchez told jurors. But, he added, "it is a crime to conceal. "
During the trial, which lasted three weeks, including multiple days of selecting jurors, Craig testified that his firm wrote a neutral report about Tymoshenko's prosecution, that he never lied to the Justice Department, that he did not believe his interactions with reporters — which he said were meant to ensure the report's findings were accurately portrayed in the media — required him to register.
Craig also unloaded on Jonathan Hawker, a British public relations expert hired by Ukraine, when asked about press messaging materials that asserted the report did not find evidence Tymoshenko was tried for political purposes. In fact, the report did not make a finding on that issue.
"That's a flat-out lie about our report. We never said that," said Craig, who was visibly flustered.
He added: "After I spent time explaining to him what our findings were and what we were not saying, he comes up with this . . . If you're asking me if I suspected Jonathan Hawker would lie about this report, I did. "
Murphy, the defense attorney, said Craig did not disclose to the Justice Department that he was part of the media strategy because "in fact, he wasn't. " Craig only sought to accurately portray the report's findings in the press, he said.
"He did not want to see his report distorted. He especially did not want to see it distorted in the New York Times, the paper of record," Murphy told jurors. "It was not his purpose to make statements on behalf of Ukraine when he talked to the New York Times. "
Craig faced an additional charge in connection to an October 2013 letter he gave the Justice Department's FARA unit. U. S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson dismissed it days before the trial began, saying the language of the FARA statute was too broad and vague.
Craig was indicted under a little-known law that was passed 80 years ago amid a rise of Nazi propaganda in the United States. But the law, which requires registration as a foreign agent, had been applied very rarely over the past 50 years, with the Justice Department using the statute only seven times in criminal cases, according to a 2016 report by the Office of the Inspector General.
The law was resurrected from obscurity by Mueller, whose team obtained guilty pleas from Manafort, his former associate Rick Gates, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn involving work they did for foreign governments. All were accused of and admitted to making false statements to federal investigators about their dealings with foreign agents.
The Justice Department under Attorney General William Barr has also stepped up efforts to enforce FARA, lifting the curtain on Washington's opaque lobbying industry. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said the Justice Department has refocused on FARA in light of the inspector general's report from 2016, as well as the Russian interference in the presidential election.
"Foreign individuals can speak and they can speak about issues that are important to Americans, but when they speak . . . the American public needs to be able to identify the speaker," Demers said during a panel discussion in April by the think-tank American Enterprise Institute. "The problem is when foreign governments or foreign individuals speak through intermediaries, and it's not apparent that the real speaker is not that intermediary who's often an American person, but rather a foreign government. "
But the ramped-up enforcement has attracted concerns that it could infringe on First Amendment rights and broadly target foreign media organizations and reporters in the United States.
Robert Kelner, of the international law firm Covington and Burling LLP, said registering as a foreign agent would have a "stigmatizing" effect on international news organizations operating as independent journalists and could cause credentialing problems. Kelner previously represented Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators, including about work he did on behalf of the Turkish government in 2016.
"It makes it difficult for them to collect information as reporters if they are known to be a foreign agent . . . That's highly chilling to the typical journalistic process," Kelner said during the panel discussion. "I actually think the major issue with news organizations is that by labeling them a foreign agent through registration, you really do make it extremely difficult for them to function. "
Craig was Obama's White House counsel from 2009 to 2010.

Texto completo: Who is Emily Doe?
It's what many wondered about the anonymous woman Brock Turner sexually assaulted in 2015 after her 7,000-word victim impact statement went viral, sparking outrage and declaring to a nation swollen with survivors that they were not alone.
Three years later, the woman who demanded we absorb the horrors of rape wants us to know something else: her name.
Early Wednesday morning, The New York Times reported the survivor who wrote the 12 pages of gut-wrenching eloquence is Chanel Miller.
Rape at college: Why back to school is so dangerous for women
In her memoir out this September, "Know My Name," Miller will "reclaim the story of her sexual assault," publisher Viking Books said in a press release in June.
"Emily Doe’s experience illuminates a culture built to protect perpetrators and a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable," said Viking editor-in-chief Andrea Schulz. "The book will introduce readers to the writer whose words have already changed their world and move them with its accounting of her courage and resilience. "
Turner, a former student at Stanford University, was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated/unconscious person, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person. He faced up to 14 years in prison but was sentenced to six months in county jail. He served just three for "good behavior. "
Aaron Persky, the judge who sentenced him, was recalled from office in June 2018 – becoming the first California jurist recalled from the bench in 86 years.
One in 5 U. S. women is raped at some point in their lives, and 1 in 3 is a victim of sexual violence involving physical contact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“It is one of the most important books that I’ve ever published,” Schulz told the Times, saying she hopes it will “change the culture that we live in and the assumptions we make about what survivors should be expected to go through to get justice. ”
If you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800. 656. HOPE (4673) or visit hotline. rainn. org and receive confidential support.

Texto completo: Joseph Hays was a Truro farmer, husband, father and a devout Catholic.
But for much of his life, he was known as the man who'd brought the pope to Iowa.
Hays died Saturday surrounded by family, according to his obituary. He was 78. He had received hospice care for several months after being diagnosed with cancer, the Catholic Mirror reported.
Passionate about land issues and conservation as a young farmer and dad, Hays wrote a letter to Pope John Paul II, inviting him to visit the heartland during the pope's scheduled tour of the United States 40 years ago next month. He brought the letter to his parish — Immaculate Conception Church in St. Marys, Iowa — where Hays' pastor was ready to help his cause.
"Our prayer here in the heartland of our United States is that more people ... develop true concern for our land and its use by mankind," he wrote in orderly cursive in a two-page letter dated July 19, 1979. "In this way, we can be a stepping stone in the proper use of our land for the betterment of mankind."
The pastor connected Hays to then-Des Moines Bishop Maurice Dingman days later, according to reports from the time. The bishop helped relay the letter to the Vatican, resulting in what would become one of the most iconic events in Iowa history.
Eleven weeks later, on Oct. 4, 1979, Urbandale's Living History Farms was host to an estimated 350,000 people — more than the current populations of Iowa's two largest cities combined, and 50,000 shy of the turnout for the 1969 Woodstock music festival. A group of 99 Iowans reportedly walked 150 miles to and from the outdoor mass.
"You are stewards of some of the most important resources God has given to the world," Pope John Paul II told the sea of people. "Therefore, conserve the land well, so that your children's children and generations after them will inherit an even richer land than was entrusted to you."
The pope fulfilled Hays' wish twice over. He also visited St. Patrick's, a tiny church in the countryside near Cumming. The front page of The New York Times anticipated the novel visit. As reported in the Register the following day, the pope read his sermon to 205 parishioners as a baby cried and a fly buzzed around his head.
A veteran and chaplain Hays was born Sept. 11, 1940, to Francis and Jenny (Bertoletti) Hays, according to his obituary. The family moved from Illinois to Iowa when Hays was just six. After graduating from high school in 1959, he married Ann Adams in 1961 at St. Bernard Catholic Church in Osceola. Together, they had four children.
Hays served 27 years in the U.S. Navy Reserve, earning the rank of chief petty officer, his obituary said. He also served AMVETS, a national veterans service organization, in local, statewide and national roles, including as a Department of Iowa commander. In the past year, he'd been the organization's statewide chaplain.
"He was an excellent chaplain," said Clark Leckington, executive director of AMVETS Department of Iowa. "He was very religious. He's the one that took the pope around."
Leckington said Hays was known for his deep "bullfrog voice" and being active in political causes he cared about, including caucusing for his favorite candidates.
Hays worked for John Deere for 36 years, his obituary said. He and his wife were also hobby farmers.
A funeral is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Friday at St. Joeseph's Catholic Church in Winterset. He will be buried with full military honors at Hopeville Cemetery.

'He hurt a lot of people': Democratic senator suggests prison time for Mark Zuckerberg

Texto completo: Sen. Ron Wyden said Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg should be punished with prison time over the social media giant’s privacy lapses.
“Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly lied to the American people about privacy. I think he ought to be held personally accountable, which is everything from financial fines to — and let me underline this — the possibility of a prison term. Because he hurt a lot of people,” the Oregon Democrat told Willamette Week.
“And, by the way, there is a precedent for this: In financial services, if the CEO and the executives lie about the financials, they can be held personally accountable,” he said.
Wyden published a draft bill late last year that proposed a penalty of 10 to 20 years of imprisonment for executives who mishandle consumer data.
In April, he sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking for the agency to hold Zuckerberg “individually accountable” for “repeated violations of Americans’ privacy.”
Zuckerberg has said he’s open to more government regulation as Facebook faced a slew of scandals involving user data in recent years. Zuckerberg testified to Congress in April 2018 that Facebook doesn’t “sell data to anyone” and that users have control over how their data is used.
The New York Times later reported that Facebook has agreements with companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and Microsoft that gave them access to users’ timelines, private messages, and friend lists.

Texto completo: The most important campaign news of the summer was Elizabeth Warren’s surge. Early in the year, her campaign was foundering. She was in fifth place, with a mere 6% support.
Now she is rising toward the top, with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders. She’s drawing huge crowds — 15,000 in Seattle recently. She has the highest favorability rating of any candidate. If you ask Democrats whom they would vote for if they didn’t have to worry about electability, her support rises even more.
She’s achieved all this not with some ephemeral debate moment gimmick, but by campaigning well and being relatable, substantive and, yes, likable. Domenico Montanaro of NPR reports that she has taken 45,000 selfies with voters. That’s dedication.
She has also done one more thing. She has made sure that her policy views conform to progressive orthodoxy. This is an important transformation for Warren. When she emerged on the public stage she was a completely heterodox thinker, who deviated from the liberal mainstream with abandon.
Warren’s breakthrough moment was a 2003 book called “The Two-Income Trap,” which she wrote with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi. That book centers on an astonishing statistic. In 1981, about 69,000 women filed for bankruptcy. By 1999 that figured had jumped to nearly 500,000. This was happening despite the fact that women’s wages were rising rapidly.
The conventional view at the time was that Americans went bankrupt because they spent too much on fancy cars, vacations and baubles. Warren and Tyagi exploded that myth. Instead they pointed to something more paradoxical. The surge of women into the workforce had made many women’s economic situation worse.
Many women entered the labor force to give their family more financial security. But an ironic thing happened. All the new dual-income families started bidding up the price of housing in neighborhoods with good schools. They started bidding up the price of day care and college tuition. Two-income families found they had less economic security, not more. “Even as millions of mothers marched into the workforce, savings declined,” Warren and Tyagi wrote. This is the two-income trap. And the results were especially devastating for single-income families and single mothers who had to compete in the hyped-up, dual-earner world.
Warren did not argue that women should leave the labor force. Instead, she favored helping parents by providing them with school vouchers and school choice. “Fully funded vouchers would relieve parents from the terrible choice of leaving their kids in lousy schools or bankrupting themselves to escape those schools,” Warren and Tyagi wrote.
“An all-voucher system would be a shock to the educational system, but the shakeout might be just what the system needs,” they continued. This is exactly the argument that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos uses to support school choice.
Professor Warren also supported proposals to help families afford day care, but she opposed the approach that candidate Warren now advocates. Back then, she called taxpayer-funded day care a liberal “sacred cow”: “Any subsidy that benefits working parents without providing a similar benefit to single-income families pushes the stay-at-home mother and her family further down the economic ladder.”
Professor Warren supported ways to help make universities more affordable, but she opposed the sort of government subsidy proposals that candidate Warren now supports. “Are state governments supposed to write a blank check for higher education, allowing universities to increase costs with abandon?” she asked. “The more-taxes approach suffers from the same problem the more-debt approach engenders. It gives colleges more money to spend without any attempt to control their spiraling costs.”
“The Two-Income Trap” is filled with interesting and heterodox proposals. Warren supported many progressive policy ideas and many conservative ones. She wanted to eliminate the tax on savings. She opposed more government regulations on housing, because such regulations reduce the incentive to build more housing.
In that book, she harshly criticized many Republicans. She also criticized the women’s movement for being naïve about economics, and she criticized Hillary Clinton for flip-flopping on important issues for the sake of political expediency.
There are two core tensions that make the book so fascinating. Warren and Tyagi are both working women and feminists. And yet they provide case after case in which stay-at-home moms provide an important safety net for their families. Warren and Tyagi want Americans to have children, but they provide case after case in which childbearing strains family finances and leads to bankruptcy and misery.
In 2016 Warren and Tyagi wrote a new introduction to their book. It’s hard to believe this introduction was written by the same people. The 2003 book is intellectually unpredictable and alive. The new introduction is paint-by-numbers progressive boilerplate. The original book described a complex world in which people navigate trade-offs and unintended consequences often happen. The new introduction describes a comic book world, in which everything bad can be blamed on greedy bankers.
This is the problem with politics in a dogmatic age. Everything conforms to rigid ideology. Independent, evidence-based thinking? That goes out the window.

Texto completo: A commercial dive boat with 39 passengers and crew members aboard was engulfed in flames early Monday and sunk hours later near the Santa Cruz Island shoreline off the Ventura County coast. By late Monday, authorities confirmed that 25 people died in the ordeal, with several others still unaccounted for, the Associated Press reported.
FIve of the boat’s six crew members were rescued.
By midday Monday, authorities had confirmed that four victims were found dead near the 75-foot vessel Conception, which departed Saturday from Santa Barbara Harbor for a Labor Day holiday weekend excursion. Later in the day, crews discovered four more bodies on the ocean floor near the wreckage of the vessel, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.
The AP reported that, by late Monday, the Coast Guard had confirmed that at least 25 people had died.
Torrance resident says ‘divine intervention’ kept him off deadly dive boat
What sparked the horrific fire, which was first reported to the Coast Guard via a frantic mayday call around 3:30 a.m., wasn’t immediately known.
“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Brown said at a somber news conference. “We understand the tremendous burden they are under right now as they wait to determine exactly what happened. We will be working diligently to get them as much information as possible as soon as possible.”
Authorities were continuing to search into the evening for more of the 33 passengers unaccounted for after flames tore through boat. The Conception also carried six crew members, five of whom were rescued after fleeing the burning craft, officials said.
“We will continue to search but we should be prepared for the worst outcome,” U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said.
Firefighters responded to the blaze shortly before 3:30 a.m., about 90 miles from Los Angeles. Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach overheard a mayday call about 15 minutes earlier of a commercial vessel with 39 people aboard.
By the time crews arrived shortly after the mayday call, the boat was fully engulfed in flames with little anyone could do to save it, said Mark Hartwig, Santa Barbara County’s fire chief.
Crews from the Coast Guard, Santa Barbara Fire Department, Ventura County Fire Department and Vessel Assist responded. The fire crews were fighting the blaze when the vessel sank 20 yards off shore in 64 feet of water, officials said.
Authorities said that initial four recovered bodies had injuries consistent with drowning, according to The Associated Press.
Five of the boat’s crew members were rescued by a nearby boat.
“The crew was actually already awake and on the bridge and they jumped off,” Rochester told reporters at a news conference at the Channel Islands Harbor.
They were evacuated on to a good Samaritan’s boat, Grape Escape, the Coast Guard said. Two of the crew members had minor injuries, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.
“When we looked out, the other boat was totally engulfed in flames, from stem to stern,” Grape Escape owner Bob Hansen told The New York Times. “I could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat. There were these explosions every few beats. You can’t prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.”
As the morning turned to afternoon, family members of the missing passengers trickled in to the Coast Guard station in Oxnard in search of answers.
Sheriff Brown told reporters that the passengers would have be identified through DNA, depending on the condition of their remains.
A woman who came to the harbor early Monday said, “My son was on that boat.” She was led away by a Ventura County firefighter.
At around 8:30 a.m. the vessel had a portion of the bow sticking out of the water, authorities said.
Rochester said that the missing passengers were sleeping below deck at the time of the fire. She said authorities were working with the owners of the boat which had been in “full compliance” prior to its trip departure.
Rochester said rescuers would continue searching through the night.
“This isn’t a day that we wanted to wake up to,” she said at the afternoon news conference.
Several photos on social media posted by the fire agencies showed the Santa Barbara Harbor-based vessel completely overtaken by flames.
According to the Worldwide Diving Adventures website, the boat was on its last day of a three-day diving excursion that started in Santa Barbara Harbor. The Labor Day weekend trip, which started Aug. 31, gave passengers the opportunity to see marine life and explore San Miguel Island, according to the website.
The Conception had departed at 4 a.m. Saturday with plans to return Monday.
The boat was launched in 1981 and had a 46-person capacity, according to its profile on the website of Truth Aquatics, the Santa Barbara company that owns the ship. It had rafts and life jackets for 110 passengers and a fixed CO2 engine room for fire suppression.
Divers sleep in a single room of bunk beds, according to a diagram of the Conception posted on the website.
Thomas Kruger, director of scuba operations at Dive N’ Surf in Redondo Beach, said the boat and the operator had a good reputation.
Dive N’ Surf has booked charters on the Conception and other dive boats operated by Truth Aquatics, but not for at least a year mainly because of the distance, he said.
“This has been way out of left field,” Kruger said in an interview Monday. “The boat has been a phenomenally good boat that was meticulously kept. There was nothing anytime they were diving that would have indicated an event like this.”
Dive boats of that size are typically inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard about once per year, Kruger said. Operators also generally perform regular checks of fire extinguishers and other safety devices whenever the boat goes out, he said.
“Having a boat of that caliber there is a lot that goes into maintaining those boats and the systems on them,” Kruger said.
The event had a major effect on the close-knit diving community. Calls have been coming in inquiring whether anyone local was on board, Kruger said. As of Monday afternoon, the identities of the victims had not been released and Kruger did not know if any local divers were on board.
“We are sending out our prayers and our hopes that we get some better news by the end of the day,” he said.
Dale Sheckler, a Torrance man who is an experienced diver, had planned on spending Labor Day weekend aboard the Conception, but a hip surgery sidelined those plans.
“I feel frightened and relieved at the same time,” Sheckler said. “I’m also sick about the lives that were lost. I’m upset about it. My heart goes out to them.”
Sheckler said he’s been on the Conception several times before, but hasn’t been on the vessel in well over a year.
“I think considering the fact that the crew lost one of their members, I think that people need to understand that the crew was probably unable to assist those in distress,” he said.
Members of the diving community also expressed their grief on social media. Many shared their thoughts on the Truth Aquatics Facebook page, some recounting their own diving experiences.

Others showed photos of the vessel’s sleeping area, pondering if passengers could have escaped.
Most, like Kruger, offered their condolences and prayers.
Sprinkled into the comments were those who questioned why members of the crew may have been the only ones to survive. That sentiment was addressed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who Monday afternoon called for an “immediate and robust” investigation.
“It’s inconceivable that with all the safety regulations we have in place today, a fire on a boat can lead to the loss of life we saw this morning near Santa Cruz Island,” Feinstein said in a statement.
“We must know what fire-suppression systems and other emergency equipment are in place on these boats and whether they were in working order on the Conception. And we need to understand exactly how the crew was trained and, if they were awake and above-deck, why they were unable to alert or help rescue passengers.”
The Channel Islands National Park Service said that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, Santa Barbara County Fire Department, United States Coast Guard are working with it as a unified command.
A one-mile safety zone was established around the perimeter of the incident while search-and-rescue efforts continue, officials said. A 3,000-foot flight restriction was also temporarily placed around the ship.
Authorities have established a Family Assistance Center at the Earl Warren Showgrounds, 3400 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, which is expected to remain open through Thursday. Information via phone is available from the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management at 833-688-5551.

Nicholas Kristof: In Hong Kong, playing tennis with tear-gas grenades

Texto completo: Hong Kong - President Donald Trump has called the pro-democracy protests here “riots,” and China has in effect denounced participants as terrorists.
Yet even when chaos reigns during clashes with the police, protesters clean up litter from the battlefield. Medics stand by to assist those injured. Crowds part like the Red Sea to let ambulances through. Tennis players bring their rackets: When the police fire tear-gas grenades, they lob them back.
Television footage may focus on angry young protesters hurling Molotov cocktails, and they are real; I believe the violence is a mistake that increases the risk of a crackdown. But the vast majority of protesters are nonviolent and simply yearn for this great city to enjoy freedom to match its modernity.
“If we didn’t protest, this might become just another Chinese city,” one young woman told me.
A 25-year-old university student told me: “We are like a frog in a beaker of water that is being boiled, and we’re trying to jump out. If we die, well, we were going to die anyway.”
The risks to protesters are increasing, for Hong Kong and China are orchestrating a crackdown — what some democracy figures are calling a “white terror.” The police have arrested more than 900 people so far, and just in the last few days leading figures were arrested while others were attacked by thugs, in one case with a cleaver and baseball bat.
One of the best-known democracy advocates is Denise Ho, a famous Cantonese pop singer. As we sat down in a coffee shop, the server encouraged her with a “ga yao,” the Cantonese equivalent of, “Keep it up!”
As a result of Ho’s activism, she is now a nonperson on the Chinese mainland. Not only is her music banned there, her name can’t even be written on social media.
“It’s never been like this before in Hong Kong,” she told me, noting that China seems to be pressuring companies to fire staff members who support the protests. Cathay Pacific airline is among those that have done so.
“Hong Kong people don’t like to fight on the streets,” she said. “But they’ve pushed us to the edge.”
China’s president, Xi Jinping, is confronted here by a challenge that he can’t easily steamroll, and there’s no obvious exit ramp for either side. And if Xi can’t manage to keep Hong Kong content, how can he dream of unifying with Taiwan?
So look out. Xi is intolerant and overconfident, thus one risk is that he will ultimately deploy the People’s Armed Police, a paramilitary force, to crush the protests. Alternatively, he can use Hong Kong’s triad gangsters — who have a long history of working for Beijing — to use cleavers and baseball bats to terrorize or eliminate democracy activists, even as the Hong Kong police step up their own arrests. We should be alert not only for troops pouring across the border, but also for thugs with cleavers.
One concern is that Xi may make decisions based on bad information relayed by sycophants. In my conversations here, I sense that pro-China officials actually believe that the protests were orchestrated by American and Taiwan officials, and it’s always dangerous when dictators become persuaded by their own propaganda.
In addition, Chinese news coverage of the protests has resulted in a wave of anti-Hong Kong nationalism on the mainland that may add to the pressure to suppress protesters. In fairness, mainlanders do make one valid point: If protesters in America were throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers, the United States might well have seen more than the single warning shot fired by the police so far in Hong Kong.
This great city may be at a turning point, and Trump and other world leaders should make clearer that Xi will pay a severe price if he uses force — whether by troops or by triads — to try to crush Hong Kong. Granted this must be done delicately, because publicly siding with protesters risks confirming Xi’s narrative that America is secretly steering the movement.
One helpful step would be for Congress to pass the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would sanction officials who suppress freedoms in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong is one of the great cities of the world, and I have been in love with it ever since I lived here in the mid-1980s as a foreign correspondent for The Times. This city is resilient, and no one has ever made money for long betting against Hong Kong. But today it is at risk.
It is at risk from Chinese encroachment and the slow erosion of the rule of law, and from the danger that Xi will eventually resort to force to crush the democracy movement. A military crackdown would be a catastrophe for freedom, for China and Hong Kong alike, and for the world economy.
Many Americans don’t even bother to vote, while Hong Kongers shame us by enduring tear gas and threats of job dismissals in hopes of attaining what we take for granted.
These huge throngs on the Hong Kong streets are composed not of terrorists but of people who deserve ballots but may yet end up with bullets. The outcome may depend partly on whether we stand with them.

What could the next recession feel like? Stories from past downturns are a guide

Resumen: Economists expect the next recession, whenever that is, to be less severe. But what could it be like? Stories from past downturns could be a guide.

Texto completo: The next recession – whenever that is – will be run-of-the-mill, economists expect. But for many people, their only or closest experience of a downturn was one for the record books: the Great Recession of 2007-09.
That one lasted 18 months, longer than any other since World War II, and massive job losses occurred years after the recession technically ended. It was characterized by foreclosures and long-term unemployment. Its aftermath is still felt today.
But that was atypical, and economists expect the next recession to be less severe and shorter because household debt is in better shape and banks are on solid footing.
While the economy is flashing some signs of trouble, we aren't known to be in a recession yet. We wouldn't know anyway because they are declared retroactively by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Some economists, though, think one could hit in 2020.
If so, what can you expect?
Based on news headlines and clippings from the four recessions before the downturn of 2007-09, here's what an average recession looks like on the ground.
Student debt victory dance: This woman paid off over $222K in student debt. This is how she did it.
Worried about stocks?With recession fears rising, here's how to find stability when Wall Street has you on edge
Say goodbye to jobs
Even in the mildest recessions, when job losses happen, it’s “devastating” to any individual affected, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
Others lose hours, raises and bonuses. Those not directly affected may know people who lost jobs, either family, friends or colleagues. There’s a ripple effect.
“It may not be devastating,” Zandi says, “but it’s terribly uncomfortable. ”
Take the 1991 recession and its impact in the Bronx, as chronicled by then-Newsday reporter Gail Collins, now an op-ed columnist for The New York Times. The downturn came in “like a flash flood. Everybody feels it,” she wrote.
In the article, Collins talked to a guy – Jeremy – who offered to pump gas at a self-service station in the New York City borough for tips. He once had a job, working at Roy Rogers, but he got laid off.
An owner of a nearby children’s clothing store thought about shuttering his store, according to the article.
"This is going to be my last year. I can't hold on," the store owner said then. "Nobody has any money," his clerk said.
Tightening belts
When a downturn hits, Americans also pinch their pennies. Spending on travel, entertainment and eating out are cut down.
A 1982 article from the United Press International noted that the recession then was hurting rock concerts and record sales at the time.
A Dallas promoter even blamed the break-up of The Doobie Brothers, who were then on their final national tour, on the recession. He noted that the group wouldn’t have separated “if the money was rolling in like it used to,” the article said.
Americans even abandoned doing their own car repairs to save money during the double-dip recession of the early 1980s, according to a 1982 UPI article.
''We're seeing a lot of people not doing anything,'' a spokesman with the Automotive Parts and Accessories Association said at the time. ''It's the drive it till it stops syndrome. ''
Family life during recessions
Even the kids aren’t spared.
A 1982 Associated Press article described how Jane Heim, who wrote letters to children from Santa Claus, had to choose her words carefully that year because of the recession.
"I have to tell them they may not get all the toys they are asking for," she said. "Because of unemployment and the poor economy as a whole, we expect many parents to enclose a note saying they won't be able to buy their children gifts they really want. This makes a very delicate situation, and it must be handled with kindness, tact and understanding. "
A Washington Post article from 1991 asked teenagers how the recession was affecting them: Lower allowances, a lack of summer jobs and fewer big-ticket Christmas gifts was what they said.
Silver linings
Many individuals turn their recession woes into opportunity.
In 2001, USA TODAY reported that Andrea Papa, a single mother who had been laid off from her job of 20 years, turned around and started her own media and marketing business. Another perk: She greeted her son when he got home from school.
"People have been telling me for years to do this, but as a single parent, I always said, 'No. ' Then the decision was made for me," Papa said then. "When I was laid off, one door was closed, but there is a myriad of other doors to choose from. "
Another 1991 article from The Advertiser in Australia found that the downturn there was boosting people’s sex lives.
“Sales of erotic lingerie and sex aids are booming, as couples spend time at home enjoying each other's company,” the article said.
Even in a recession, there’s always a silver lining.

Texto completo: In his sobering new book on the state of organized labor in America, author Steven Greenhouse offers enough examples of the plight of U.S. workers to make this Labor Day feel less like a celebration than a dirge.
Greenhouse, the former labor reporter for the New York Times, writes in "Beaten Down, Worked Up" (Knopf, 397 pages, $27.95) of the fast-food worker in Milwaukee who, after her hour-long bus commute, was told to go home even without her minimum-wage pay because her manager didn't need her for that shift, after all.
Or there are the Uber drivers who work 60 hours a week and can barely make ends meet. Or the chicken processing plants where "the poultry workers say they literally pee in their pants because they're not given time to go to the bathroom," as Greenhouse told me in a recent phone conversation.
Labor unions, which won higher pay and benefits for workers in the 1930s and '40s, were always the champion for working people to resist such oppressive conditions. At mid-20th century, leaders like the legendary Walter Reuther (profiled in an excellent chapter in Greenhouse's book) won historic gains for UAW workers in Detroit that were widely emulated throughout industry and helped create the nation's middle-class prosperity.
But beginning with the failed PATCO strike by air traffic controllers in 1981, when then-President Ronald Reagan broke the controllers' union and fired thousands of its members, conservative forces have waged a relentless and largely successful fight to weaken labor unions through legislation and in the courts.
As a result, not only has union membership in America plummeted from about 20% of of the U.S. workforce in the mid-1980s to barely 10% today, but unions continue to struggle in their fight for a higher minimum wage, equal pay for women, and even basic safety conditions in places like poultry plants.
On this Labor Day weekend, we're now at what may be a new pivot point in that history. As Greenhouse told me, there is a new militancy among workers in many fields, from classrooms to fast-food counters. But whether this translates into a new era of worker power remains very far from clear.
A labor awakening "If you asked me two or three years ago I'd say labor seems half asleep," Greenhouse said. But a number of militant actions, including the "D15" campaign for a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers and the strikes by low-paid teachers in West Virginia and elsewhere, organized labor seemed to be making some serious gains.
Unions "looked dead in the water and all of a sudden we had the biggest (teachers) strike in probably decades," he said. "Not only do we see 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 thousand teachers mobilized in various states but they had huge support from parents and kids. And that signaled a new energy and new wave of support for unions that we really haven't seen in many, many years."
He added, "Successful strikes beget more successful strikes. Successful militancy begets more successful militancy, just as the disaster of the PATCO strike discouraged more such strikes."
But this new militancy doesn't necessarily translate into a new day for unions.
"On one hand, we're seeing militancy in strikes, but we're not seeing huge successes in adding to labor's overall labor rolls," he said. "I don't think we're seeing nearly enough organizing among blue collar workers to say labor is back. But it's much more awake, more vigorous, than it was three or four years ago."
But to what end? Even with such militancy, Greenhouse said unions today don't play anywhere near the role they did at mid-20th century leading broad social change. In his book, Greenhouse includes a chapter on Reuther, who not only built up the UAW as a major force for workers but fought for broader social change.
"In the 1950s and '60s, the late '40s, the unions were the force in society pushing for progressive change, a strong social safety net," Greenhouse said during our talk. "Better health insurance, Social Security. They played a key role in (passing) Medicare. They played a key role in Medicaid and the civil rights legislation. And, more recently, I don't think Obamacare would have been enacted had they not put their all to get enough votes in Congress."
But with conservative Republicans in charge of Congress and the White House, organized labor has been forced onto the defensive.
"I think unions are better at playing defense to stop bad things from happening than they are in making good things happen," he said. "Whereas in the age of Reuther, they really helped make good things happen for workers and the public at large."
What the CEOs said Greenhouse takes a skeptical view of statements by business leaders that they acknowledge their duty to the community at large and not just to their bottom line. Such talk is cheap, he says.
The Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs from the nation's leading firms, issued a new "purpose of a corporation" philosophical statement in mid-August that recognized that all stakeholders, including employees and the community at large, are equally as valuable as the profit motive.
"Each of our stakeholders is essential," the statement from the Roundtable said. "We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country."
In his book, Greenhouse notes that in 1990 the Business Roundtable issued a very similar statement affirming that profits alone were not enough. Corporations also had to focus on the welfare of workers, customers, suppliers and the community, the Roundtable said then.
But just seven years later, after a wave of conservative backlash about the primacy of shareholder value, the Roundtable backtracked, saying in a 1997 statement, "The paramount duty of management and boards of directors is to the corporation's stockholders."
So, Greenhouse said, let's see if the CEOs stick with the latest version of their dogma and live it in practice. If it really means this latest version of its philosophy, Greenhouse quipped on Twitter, the Roundtable would lobby for Congress to repeal the massive recent tax cut for corporations that mostly went to stock buybacks.
"It would be better for the nation if we use that 1 trillion dollars to fight things like the homeless crisis or the affordable housing crisis," he told me.
Looking ahead Reuther used to say that unions had to be active politically or otherwise what they gained at the bargaining table they could lose at the ballot box. With that in mind, unions are focusing on both state and federal elections, including next year's contest where unions will join other progressives trying to oust President Donald Trump.
A victory in 2020 would make life a little easier for organized labor. If nothing else, a Democratic president would get to appoint the majority of members to the National Labor Relations Board. That's the government referee of union-management disputes.
But that won't be enough. The American workplace is more troubled than the top half of society would like to admit, especially for low-wage workers and those not represented by unions
And Greenhouse's disquieting look at the state of labor in "Beaten Down, Worked Up" makes that clear. It will take more than a political win or two to set things right.

Texto completo: Science fiction is largely concerned with the future, but the genre's past, dominated as it is by white men, is increasingly up for debate among a new generation of writers. The latest episode occurred this week, when the magazine Analog Science Fiction and Fact said it would drop John W. Campbell's name from its annual prize for best new writer because of racist sentiments he had expressed.
Campbell ran the magazine under its previous name, Astounding Science Fiction, from the late 1930s until his death in 1971, and was one of the genre's most influential editors, working with such writers as Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke and Robert A. Heinlein. He was the author of sci-fi under his own name and as Don A. Stuart.
He also wrote in support of segregation, called slavery "a useful educational system" and claimed black writers did not or could not "write in open competition," in addition to making derogatory comments about women and homosexuality. In a 1998 essay, "Racism and Science Fiction," the award-winning author Samuel R. Delany recalled Campbell rejecting a submission of his, saying the editor "didn't feel his readership would be able to relate to a black main character."
The decision to remove Campbell's name from the award came after this year's winner, Jeannette Ng, criticized him in her acceptance speech. "He is responsible for setting a tone for science fiction that haunts this genre to this very day," she said. "Stale, sterile, male, white, exalting in the ambitions of imperialists, colonialists, settlers and industrialists."
On Tuesday, Analog Science Fiction and Fact said it was changing the prize's name from the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer to the Astounding Award for Best New Writer. In a blog post explaining the decision, the magazine's editor, Trevor Quachri, wrote: "Campbell's provocative editorials and opinions on race, slavery, and other matters often reflected positions that went beyond just the mores of his time and are today at odds with modern values, including those held by the award's many nominees, winners and supporters."
Ng, who wrote the fantasy novel "Under the Pendulum Sun," said in an interview on Wednesday that she was delighted by the decision. "It's a good move away from honoring a completely obnoxious man who kept a lot of people out of the genre, who kept a lot of people from writing, who shaped the genre to his own image." Thanks to the change, she added, "we're now celebrating a little more neutrally a piece of history that's not attached to his name."
Alec Nevala-Lee, whose book "Astounding: John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard, and the Golden Age of Science Fiction" examines Campbell's contributions to science fiction, also supported the change. "It was clearly the right call," he said. "At this point, the contrast between Campbell's racism and the diversity of the writers who have recently received the award was really just too glaring to ignore."
Quachri credited Nevala-Lee's book and Ng's speech for pushing his publication, which is owned by Dell Magazines, to act. "Reading an early draft of Alec's book is when I realized that the name change would need to happen eventually," he said. Ng's speech, he added, "really gave me a wonderful opportunity."
For Nevala-Lee, it's unavoidable that, as a creator of science fiction, Campbell would be judged by how well he anticipated societal changes. "He asked to be judged by the highest possible standard, as a man of the future," Nevala-Lee said, "and I think he really fell short."

Texto completo: My husband and I landed on your front stoop mid-July. We’ve come from the Emerald City, otherwise known as Seattle, where we lived for 11 years.
Anyone who’s moved (about 11 times for the average American) knows what an ordeal it can be, from the boxes and the bubble wrap to the deliberating over what gets tossed and what sparks Marie Kondo-standard joy. But a cross-country move is a hellish layer cake of logistics topped with a frosting of emotional farewells and nostalgia. And that’s just on the front end.
For moving day, we agreed to divide and conquer. I would fly to Pennsylvania while he watched the contents of our lives being loaded onto a truck.
With the early sun’s glare in my eyes, I arrive at the gate at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (or Sea-Tac as I learned to call it), and the tears that I’ve been holding back for six weeks, they arrive too. I lean against a wall and slide down to the floor, a wet and crumpled heap. A frequent longhaul traveler, I am used to the routine of crossing time zones, but this time is different. I’ve got a one-way ticket, and I don’t know when I’m coming back.
Strangers offer tissues and a few “there, theres.”
The word “there” strikes a chord. I’m neither here nor there — at least not yet, a phenomenon known as liminal space. And the tears are less about saying goodbye to a city than about ending a personal chapter.
I wrote three cookbooks in Seattle and became a known authority on cooking vegetables. I learned to garden and preserve. I made lifelong friendships with women whom I consider sisters, and I taught some of their children how to cook.
And now I’m back in the state where I was born and raised. I grew up in Bala Cynwyd, a Welsh town just a few miles from Philly. As a girl, Lancaster was close yet so far away. There was a road trip in my grandfather’s maroon Buick to Dutch Wonderland, probably with a little funnel cake thrown in, but that was the extent of my Lancaster experience.
We’ve come for work — my husband has a new gig at WITF in Harrisburg. And we’ve come for family — my mom lives in nearby West Chester. Despite my Pennsylvania roots, I’m starting from scratch, scrambling to learn the street names (so many fruits!) and what can’t go into the recycling bin.
Whenever I land in a new place, I want to know where the food is, who’s making it and growing it. It’s my way of navigating and understanding a community.
In our short time here, we’re already impressed by the robust and varied food scene (and that was before The New York Times deemed it so!). Except for the humidity, we came without expectations.
We did not know that we were in store for stellar craft coffee and beer. We did not know that we could dine one night in a Trinidadian joint, then the next in a Puerto Rican or Vietnamese one, or at the global refugee pop-up on the Tellus360 rooftop.
And we did not know that, in doing so, we’d just be scratching the surface.
While we waited for the movers to arrive with our stuff, we camped out in our new place, sleeping on an air mattress and cooking in a wok. During the day, I got in the car and explored, usually in pursuit of provisions. When we started out in Seattle, I got to know the city (and the regional foodshed) through its many neighborhood farmers markets. And in Lancaster, I’m learning by way of farm stands. Although it may seem obvious, it bears repeating — a farm stand, by definition, is on farm land, which creates this indelible connection between the land and the food we eat. And if we believe that food is medicine, the land makes the food that heals us.
I grew up eating corn and cantaloupe and tomatoes in the summer, but never as close to the source as it is in Lancaster County. I’m not sure I ever truly understood how sweet and tender corn could be, until now. I never knew how just how heady and aromatic Lancaster-grown peaches and melons can be, and how much time I would spend slurping over the sink.
In the midst of all this edible discovery, I admit to having been in a funk. This liminal in between here-and-there space has been disorienting, I’m still without a job of my own, and most of all, I miss familiar faces.
A few weeks ago, I threw caution to the wind and drove to Red Lion, home to Blueberry Hill farm. It was the last day of picking blueberries for the season. I donned a sun hat, sunscreen and hiking shoes and grabbed two containers from the car. For two hours, I crouched down among the rows of highbush berries, collecting about 8 pounds. I sweated, I got scratched up, I listened to the bees in stereo. I looked up at the gloriously blue sky and out into the valley that seemed endless. And it was just 35 minutes from home. Yes, home. The next day, there would be blueberry-vanilla jam.
Maybe you know this, Lancaster, but this land of yours — it’s pretty darn special. I’m glad to be here and be your neighbor and I can’t wait to find out what else I didn’t know.

Leonard Pitts: Trump’s anti-journalism hit squad

Texto completo: "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers."
So says Dick the Butcher in Shakespeare's "Henry VI, Part 2." Though often regarded as a Renaissance-era lawyer joke, the line is actually a backhanded compliment to the legal profession. Dick, a follower of the rebel Jack Cade, knows that before their insurrection can succeed, they have to get rid of the defenders of law and order.
We are seeing a disturbingly similar strategy unfold in American politics. Except that this time, they want to kill all the journalists.
The 2018 massacre at a newsroom in Annapolis and ongoing violence and threats against reporters make the analogy a rather sensitive one, so let’s emphasize that it’s only that — analogy. The people we’re talking about aren’t actually out to kill journalists, just their credibility.
Tom Wright-Piersanti is the latest victim. According to a report in Sunday's New York Times, Wright-Piersanti, a Times editor, was targeted by "a loose network of conservative operatives allied with the White House." Their aim: Discredit news organizations they consider hostile to Donald Trump. Their strategy: posting damaging or embarrassing information about journalists.
So last week, after the Times ran two pieces unflattering to the Trump White House, this group unveiled on Breitbart some racist and anti-Semitic tweets Wright-Piersanti wrote 10 years ago. He has apologized and expressed “deep shame” for “lame attempts at edgy humor” — and also, in essence, for being a millennial.
"For my generation, the generation that came of age in the internet," he said, "all the youthful mistakes that you made get preserved in digital amber, and no matter how much you change and mature and grow up, it's always out there, waiting to be discovered." The Times said it was looking into what it dubbed "a clear violation of our standards."
One need not condone Wright-Piersanti's old tweets to note that whatever offensive thing he said, he said 10 years ago when he was in college. The last offensive thing Trump said was less than 10 days ago, and he is in the White House.
But there is far more at stake here than one man's career. A president who has branded journalists "enemies of the people" and news media "an evil propaganda machine" now has working on his behalf an anti-journalism hit squad. These people are nothing less than termites in the woodwork of freedom.
Beyond Wright-Piersanti, they're also said to have targeted reporters from The Washington Post, Business Insider and CNN. Like him, most were in their teens or early 20s when they penned the offensive posts. Arthur Schwartz, a conservative political consultant and friend of Donald Trump Jr., described by The Times as a central figure in the campaign, says it has only just begun. The group claims to have done deep dives into the digital histories of numerous journalists — and their family members.
"Lots more where that came from," he tweeted last week.
To which journalism as an institution must respond: Bring it.
Yes, some people may be embarrassed, some careers damaged. But bring it. Because truth itself is facing a hostile takeover. Because the machinery of authoritarianism is being assembled before our eyes. Because the people's right to know is sacred. And because without an informed electorate, democracy is not possible.
See, this group understands what Dick the Butcher did not. The first thing you do is "kill" not the lawyers, but the reporters.
Then you can do whatever you want to the lawyers, and no one will even know.

Texto completo: A dozen local doctors at The Queen’s Medical Center are out of jobs today after the hospital hired a mainland firm that has come under fire for its controversial billing practices.
The physicians are hospitalists — doctors who take care of patients only while in the hospital. They belong to Medical Specialists of Hawaii, which has held the contract to care for Queen’s surgical patients for the past decade. In a departure, Queen’s hired Envision Healthcare Corp., one of the nation’s largest physician -staffing companies owned by private equity firm KKR, to provide surgical hospitalists as of today.
Envision, based in Nashville, Tenn., has faced scrutiny nationally for allegedly charging insurers and patients higher rates than warranted and for not participating with certain health insurance which the patients did not know until they received huge bills from the contracted doctors.
Hospital employees say they were blindsided by the move and have concerns about the company’s reputation of surprising patients with high medical bills. A 2017 Yale University study concluded that emergency departments run by Envision’s emergency staffing division, EmCare Inc., had substantially higher charges after the company took over, as well as increased hospital admissions and imaging tests.
In 2017 EmCare agreed to a $ 29.8 million settlement to resolve claims that it was paid by hospital chain Health Management Associates to increase Medicare admissions from 2008 to 2012, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The same year, the New York Times reported that EmCare charged the “highest -level billing code” at Newport Hospital and Health Services, a small hospital in Washington state, for nearly 28% of patient visits, up from about 6% by the previous contractor, leaving patients on the hook for “surprisingly large bills.”
Envision has also faced a class-action lawsuit claiming it “habitually charged exorbitant fees,” according to Forbes. The company subsequently became participating providers with more health insurers.
Dr. Russell Wong, owner of Medical Specialists of Hawaii, said his group staffed Queen’s hospital 24-hours a day with eight physicians who took care of roughly 80 patients. The local doctors helped treat and admit surgical patients with other medical conditions.
Envision is planning to have a daily staff of four doctors and a nurse practitioner for the same workload, he said.
“The workload is going to be significantly higher than what we’re presently staffed for. Over time, patient safety can be compromised from the excessive workload,” Wong said.
Rick Bruno, Queen’s vice president for patient care, insists “patient care and physician coverage are not impacted by this change.”
He added, “Queen’s is committed to providing the highest quality patient care. While we do not comment on the terms of our physician agreements, we can confirm that The Queen’s Medical Center has entered into a contract with Envision, which already has been providing hospitalist services for The Queen’s Medical Center-West Oahu campus for the past five years. All of the affected physicians working under MSH were offered employment through Envision or the Queen’s Medical Group. All of them remain active members of our medical staff, which allows them to continue to see patients at Queen’s.”
While the 12 independent physicians still have privileges at Queen’s, they are no longer paid or contracted to take care of patients there.
Bruno did not respond to questions about how Envision got the contract, how many doctors it is bringing in or how it plans to staff the hospital. He also did not address concerns over the company’s billing practices. Representatives of Envision didn’t respond to requests for comment.
An email from an Envision Physician Services recruiter obtained by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser said the company is seeking 36 hours of coverage during the day, which equates to three doctors on 12-hour shifts, as well as an advanced practice nurse for a 10-hour shift and a 12-hour night shift physician.
The Star-Advertiser interviewed half a dozen people involved with Queen’s, most of whom asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue and fear of retribution.
In an Aug. 30 letter to the medical staff, Queen’s chief medical officer Leslie Chun said Envision hospitalists will be available 24 hours a day and that “referring physicians may continue to ask for the admitting service or physician with active privileges of their choice.”
Meanwhile, Envision has been staffing Queen’s-West Oahu for the past five years, but doctors say the facility has been chronically short of hospitalists.
“Envision has never been fully staffed at West in five years. MSH has been helping them fill the gaps when they can’t get people,” Wong said. “Historically we know that doctors from the mainland don’t stay.”
All 12 Queen’s doctors were offered positions with Envision, but none took jobs.
“What Queen’s is doing, Envision has done nationwide. My old group, they’re all panicking,” Wong said. “The problem is, if we don’t have a job, there are no jobs in Hawaii. Everybody’s scrambling. It’s unfortunate that physicians dedicated to practice in Hawaii will potentially have to move to the mainland to acquire jobs. That will be a loss for the state of Hawaii.”

CDC, FDA RAISE ALARM ABOUT VAPING AS NUMBERS OF ODD LUNG PROBLEMS RISE

Texto completo: So far this summer, doctors in 25 states have seen 215 cases of a severe lung illness associated with vaping, according to a report Friday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Also on Friday, the CDC and Food and Drug Association expressed concern about vaping as the two agencies investigate vaping-associated lung injuries. In response, the American Lung Association called for a clearer warning against the use of e-cigarettes.
A joint statement from the CDC and FDA recommended that while the investigation continues, people who are concerned about the health risk should consider not using e-cigarette products. They also recommended that people using vaping products should not buy products off the street, specifically those containing THC or other cannabinoids, or products modified from the original manufactured item.
In its statement, the Lung Association said, "We urge the federal government to send a clear message to the public that e-cigarettes are not safe and contain harmful chemicals that can cause severe and irreversible lung damage and disease."
The federal agencies also encouraged doctors and public health officials to provide the CDC with suspected injury reports and recommended that people who need help quitting tobacco products contact their doctor. The statement also said regardless of the current investigation, vaping products should not be used by children, teens, young adults and pregnant women.
In Pittsburgh, UPMC hospitals had seen 12 cases as of Wednesday. Four patients have been treated by Dr. John Kreit, pulmonary division chief at UPMC Mercy. Previously healthy young men ages 24 to 28 came in with conditions ranging from mild to life-threatening.
It starts with a shortness of breath that gets worse quickly. Then it's a trip to the doctor's office or the emergency room. After a chest X-ray or CT scan, the verdict comes in: a lung injury without an obvious cause.
Dr. Kreit saw the first patient through a video link, a telemedicine connection with UPMC Horizon, north of Pittsburgh, where no pulmonary specialist is available. He was short of breath but didn't need oxygen.
"It was a young man with diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates," he said, translating that as abnormal material in both lungs, possibly inflammatory cells. "It was likely something he inhaled. Later we determined he was vaping some type of cannabis product. It seemed likely that was the cause."
A week later Dr. Kreit saw another patient and learned that cases first recognized in Wisconsin and Illinois were showing up everywhere.
"Some patients aren't very sick at all and others almost die ... One death [in Illinois] has been attributed to this already."
His second patient, at UPMC Shadyside, came in critically ill, needing mechanical ventilation.
"He could've died, but he did get better and is now recovered," Dr. Kreit reported. He said he heard of one 16-year-old in critical condition who was treated at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
He predicted most young patients will recover completely and have no lasting effects.
The main symptom is rapidly worsening shortness of breath that can be accompanied by a high fever and pain in the center of the chest. Some patients have also had nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
The Aug. 23 CDC bulletin was extremely vague about the suspected cause of the lung injuries, Dr. Kreit said. The CDC said it is providing consultation to state health departments for these cases and the FDA is helping with information on vaping products or substances and providing technical and lab help.
Although the CDC said some patients had vaped products containing nicotine, Dr. Kreit said many of the cases around the country seem to be related to cannabis-related substances - such as e-liquid containing THC.
"In all four cases I've seen, they were vaping some sort of marijuana, cannabis," he said. "It's more likely related to that, not [a product] in general manufactured by reputable companies."
He suspects patients have used substances made in homes or sold over the internet. "They have no idea what is going into their lungs," he said.
For example, a large volume of online sites provide step-by-step instructions on how to reuse vaping pods made by Juul, the popular brand of e-cigarette among teens and young adults. Buying refilled or replacement pods from non-Juul sites is taking a chance, Dr. Kreit said.
"Some of the websites look very slick," he said. "People assume they're very reputable. But you don't know what you're getting."
Dr. Kreit said the type of lung injury is usually seen in patients who have an underlying illness, like autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma and lupus.
"It's not usually from something they've inhaled," he said. But the young healthy patients were not previously sick and weren't taking any medications, he said. "That led us to think it's something they have inhaled."
In vaping, a heating element turns the substance into a mist, which is inhaled. Harmful substances have already been identified in traditional nicotine vape liquid. In the unregulated process of preparing marijuana for vaping, Dr. Kreit said, unknown contaminants can remain in the vaporized material.
In addition to THC extracted from marijuana, he said, people are starting to vape other drugs, including methamphetamine and synthetic marijuana.
"Nobody really knows what the effects are; they're being vaped as well," Dr. Kreit said. "Whole groups of chemicals are being inhaled, and it's totally unregulated. That's what makes it so hard to see what's causing all of this."
The question is what was in the vaping materials, he said, predicting that the CDC will find the common thread. For now, Dr. Kreit said, patients seemed to have different vaping habits, in terms of both frequency and substances. Out of all the people who are vaping, it's still a small portion who get sick, he added.
"They are all young healthy people. You're 25 and almost die. That's something people need to take notice of."
People with concerns can contact the Pittsburgh Poison Center of UPMC (a 24-hour hotline) at 800-222-1222.

U.S. Veteran Held in Iran Is Given Grim Diagnosis

Texto completo: Iranian authorities unexpectedly granted Swiss diplomats permission this past week to visit an American Navy veteran held in a prison in the country's northeast, where they learned his cancer had recurred, his mother said Saturday.
The prisoner, Michael R. White, 47, one of at least four Americans known to be jailed in Iran, has had throat cancer. He was visiting an Iranian female friend in the northeastern city of Mashhad when he was seized more than a year ago, in July 2018.
Mr. White, of Imperial Beach, Calif., was tried and convicted on charges that included insulting Iran's supreme leader and posting private photographs on social media. He was sentenced in March to 10 years in prison, and Iranian prosecutors suggested he might be charged with espionage.
"I'm at my wits' end," said his mother, Joanne White, who has not been able to talk with Mr. White since his imprisonment and has been communicating through Swiss diplomatic intermediaries. "I am afraid he will die there if nothing is done to bring him back."
In a telephone interview, Mrs. White said she had been informed by State Department officials via email that the authorities had granted the Swiss a consular visit on Wednesday, the first in more than three months.
The Swiss were told that prison hospital doctors had removed a melanoma from his back three weeks earlier, according to portions of a State Department email that Mrs. White shared with The New York Times. The email also said the Swiss had been told that Mr. White "continues to have medical issues," including dental problems related to previous chemotherapy treatments.
It was unclear whether the Iranians' granting of a consular visit signaled that they might be laying the groundwork to release Mr. White, who has denied all the accusations against him. His conviction is under appeal.
The visit came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Iran and the United States since President Trump renounced the Iranian nuclear agreement last year, reimposed severe economic sanctions and threatened military action if the Iranians attacked American interests in the Middle East.
At the same time, Iranian leaders, who have staked their legitimacy on defiance of the United States, have dropped hints they would be willing to negotiate with Mr. Trump.
There was no immediate comment from Iranian officials on Mr. White. American and Swiss diplomatic officials, as a matter of policy, have declined to discuss the imprisonment of any Americans incarcerated in Iran.
The Swiss Embassy looks after American affairs in Iran. The United States and Iran broke diplomatic relations nearly 40 years ago after the Iranian revolution and the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran.
There is some precedent for the release on medical grounds of Americans held by the Iranians. In 2010, Iran freed Sarah E. Shourd, who was seized with two other Americans in 2009 while hiking along the Iran-Iraq border. Held in solitary confinement for more than a year and accused of espionage, Ms. Shourd complained of a lump in her breast, which Iranian doctors had deemed benign.
Iran's president at the time, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said she was being freed on medical grounds. (A payment of $ 500,000, which the Iranian authorities described as bail, also was made to secure her release.) Ms. Shourd's fellow prisoners -- her fiancé, Shane Bauer, and their friend Josh Fattal, were freed later.
Besides Mr. White, the other Americans known to be held in Iran include Xiyue Wang, a Princeton University graduate student, and at least two dual citizens -- Siamak Namazi, a business executive, and his father, Baquer Namazi, a former Unicef diplomat. Another American, Robert Levinson, a former F.B.I. agent, has been missing in Iran since 2007.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: By Ben Frumin
I've been using the same screwdriver and pliers for 25 years. They live inside a Victorinox multitool that I received as a bar mitzvah gift. I'm 38 now -- but I still use this multitool nearly every day.
For those unfamiliar with multitools: Mine is a roughly 4-inch by 1-inch bar of metal that ninja-expands and contorts to reveal various screwdrivers, bottle openers, knives, pliers and plenty of other helpful tools. Multitools are delightfully wonderful little gizmos. You can be a Mr. Fix-It without an unwieldy red toolbox and sagging tool belt. All you need is this one simple thing. And every time I use my multitool, it reminds me how much one really good thing can disproportionately affect your life -- and how something well-made can last through so many of life's phases.
My vintage 1994 Victorinox is likely to be near impossible to track down. But Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, and a site of which I'm the editor in chief, has plenty of good multitool recommendations.
As someone who runs a gear and gadgets site, I often get asked for product recommendations. What are the (relatively inexpensive) things I really love? In addition to my multitool, here are four more cheap(ish) things I just can't live without.
Amazon Echo Dot
"Alexa, what's the weather?" "Alexa, how's my commute?" "Alexa, play 'La Bamba."' This is the pitter-patter soundtrack in my kitchen, as we ask Alexa, well, everything. I was skeptical years ago when we received an Echo Dot as a gift, and to this day I still squirm when I imagine all the conversations Alexa eavesdrops on. But for better or worse, we've come to rely on Alexa for music-playing, news-reporting, fact-finding, number-crunching and much more. Alexa is such a key part of our lives that once, when my then-18-month-old daughter and I were taking my dog for a walk on a beautifully placid country road in rural New York, my daughter pierced the silence with the confident demand, "Alexa, play 'Run Baby Run'!" (That's a song about running babies by the appropriately named band Caspar Babypants.) Sadly, Alexa was stuck in my kitchen 50 miles away, and unable to fulfill Elle's request.
Wirecutter recommends the Amazon Echo -- an upgrade over the more bare-bones Echo Dot that I use, which Wirecutter still recommends as an affordable alternative.
(And if you're worried about how much Alexa is really listening to you, read this.)
A marriage-saving Bluetooth tracker
My wife is a brilliant, hilarious, kind, beautiful and accomplished woman. She also misplaces her phone several times a day, and it drives me crazy. We've torn our house apart many times before finally finding her phone in the cupholder of our Jeep, buried beneath blankets on our bed, and hidden in piles of my son's toys.
Enter the Tile Mate, a godsend for our marriage and sanity. We synced this little Bluetooth tracker to Aliyah's phone, and now -- instead of asking, "Have you seen my phone?" -- we simply grab the Tile Mate from the dish where I keep my keys, press a button and Aliyah's phone starts playing a delightful little tune (even if it's on vibrate or silent), luring us to wherever it is in our three-story house.
Wirecutter recommends the Tile Pro, a higher-end version of the Tile Mate we use.
Martini shaker
I don't drink during the week. But every Friday, after my kids go to sleep, I make myself a stiff gin martini (dirty, with olives) to help me leave my work behind and ease into the weekend. My wife accurately calls it my "martini medicine." Wirecutter advises the reverse James Bond approach -- that martinis be stirred, not shaken -- but I'm a fan of shakers. I use a cobbler shaker, which has a canister, a lid with a strainer and a cap. Wirecutter recommends the Usagi Cobbler Shaker (and loads of other great barware).
Toddler alarm clock
When my daughter was 2 and a half, we all agreed she was a "big girl," so we took one of the walls off her crib. This was a huge mistake. She rewarded us by wandering out of her room every five minutes for hours on end after bedtime each night. We feared none of us would ever sleep again.
Our salvation? A toddler alarm clock. Wirecutter recommends the OK to Wake Alarm Clock, though we use this mildly unnerving dog version from Big Red Rooster.
It's simple: At bedtime, we turn on the alarm's red night light. It turns green at 7 a.m. Our daughter knows she's not allowed to come out of her room when the red light is on (except to go potty), and she honors the stoplight color coding by staying in bed till she gets the green light.
Am I worried this is psychologically manipulative and could create long-term emotional issues surrounding freedom and control? Yes, of course. Is it worth it for the whole family to sleep again? You betcha.

Texto completo: The New York Times has begun a major initiative, the "1619 Project," to observe the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It aims to reframe American history so that slavery and the contributions of black Americans explain who we are as a nation. Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine wrote the lead article, "America Wasn't a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One." She writes, "Without the idealistic, strenuous and patriotic efforts of black Americans, our democracy today would most likely look very different - it might not be a democracy at all."
There are several challenges one can make about Hannah-Jones' article, but I'm going to focus on the article's most serious error, namely that the nation's founders intended for us to be a democracy. That error is shared by too many Americans. The word democracy appears nowhere in the two most fundamental founding documents of our nation - the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Instead of a democracy, the Constitution's Article IV, Section 4, declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government." Think about it and ask yourself whether our Pledge of Allegiance says to "the democracy for which it stands" or to "the republic for which it stands."
The founders had utter contempt for democracy. James Madison, the acknowledged father of the Constitution, wrote in Federalist Paper No. 10, that in a pure democracy "there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual." At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, delegate Edmund Randolph said, "that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy."
The U.S. Constitution is replete with anti-majority rule, undemocratic provisions. One provision, heavily criticized, is the Electoral College. In their wisdom, the framers gave us the Electoral College so that in presidential elections, heavily populated states could not run roughshod over sparsely populated states. In order to amend the Constitution, it requires a two-thirds vote of both Houses, or two-thirds of state legislatures, to propose an amendment, and requires three-fourths of state legislatures for ratification. Part of the reason for having a bicameral Congress is that it places another obstacle to majority rule. Fifty-one senators can block the wishes of 435 representatives and 49 senators. The president, with a veto, can thwart the will of all 535 members of Congress. It takes a two-thirds vote, not just a majority, of both houses of Congress to override a presidential veto.
In addition to not understanding our Constitution, Hannah-Jones' article fails to acknowledge that black Americans have made the greatest gains, over some of the highest hurdles in the shortest span of time than any other racial group in mankind's history. The evidence: If black Americans were thought of as a nation with our own gross domestic product, we'd rank among the 20 wealthiest nations. It was a black American, Gen. Colin Powell, who headed the world's mightiest military. A few black Americans are among the world's wealthiest. Black Americans are among the world's most famous personalities.
The significance of this is that in 1865, neither a slave nor a slave owner would have believed that such progress would be possible in less than a century and a half, if ever. As such, it speaks to the intestinal fortitude of a people. Just as importantly, it speaks to the greatness of a nation within which such progress was possible, progress that would have been impossible anywhere else. The challenge before us is how those gains can be extended to a large percentage of black people for whom they appear elusive.

Hurricane Comey Was a National Disaster

Texto completo: It is time to start reckoning with the consequences of James Comey.
If not for the former FBI chief, the Justice Department likely would have closed its investigation of Hillary Clinton in 2016 with a terse statement that it was taking "no action." Voters would have had to make of this what they would.
There would have been no Comey press conference simultaneously chastising Mrs. Clinton and excusing her behavior -- an improper intervention by the FBI chief, a subsequent Justice Department investigation found, and one that was undertaken partly in response to intercepted foreign intelligence that even then was believed to be false.
In turn, there would have been no second intervention -- also improper according to the department inspector general -- reopening the Clinton case shortly before Election Day, which may have tilted the election to Donald Trump.
Without Mr. Comey, there may also not have followed a counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, or the conditions under which the discredited Steele dossier would become a widely reported and widely believed account of Trump collusion. An assessment of these Trump-related matters is due any day now, but it's unlikely to break new ground by finding that Mr. Comey acted with good judgment and scrupulous adherence to departmental rules.
In turn, there would have been no Comey firing, no leaking by him of internal FBI memos to outside parties, including the press -- again improper, according to yet another internal report, released Thursday. There would have been no Robert Mueller investigation in search of collusion. There would have been no two-year effort, as it now appears, by junior functionaries of Mr. Mueller to tempt Mr. Trump into illegally obstructing an investigation of crimes that didn't exist.
Mr. Comey is given to portentous rationales. In his memoir, he melodramatically describes his intervention in the Clinton case as being driven by a "development still unknown to the American public to this day" -- referring to the secret intelligence that colleagues at the FBI had already judged to be "objectively false." In this week's report, he is quoted telling the inspector general that his imprudent leaking of FBI memos was justified by their "incredible importance to the Nation."
Let's not pretend to know more than we do. It is impossible to say for sure that Donald Trump would not be president if not for Mr. Comey's unwarranted interventions in the Hillary Clinton case.
It is impossible to know what course Mr. Trump's ideologically noncommittal and weakly partisan administration might have followed had it not been weighed down by the Russia incubus. The New York Times reminds us this week that Mr. Trump was widely understood by the electorate to be "substantially more moderate than his party."
It is impossible to know how Mr. Trump's own behavior and calculations would have been different if he had been greeted with the usual presidential honeymoon rather than a concerted campaign to portray him as a Russian stooge.
But one judgment we are ready to render on Mr. Comey's tenure: If he had chosen a different career (say, driving instructor) and never joined the FBI, I doubt we'd be lamenting his absence now. Indeed, it seems overwhelmingly likely that the country would be better off today without his heedless and ill-advised decisions.
A precedent from U.S. history doesn't leap to mind but one from popular culture does: Maxwell Smart, the bumbling master spy with the inflated ego and talent for disaster from the TV show "Get Smart." As Mel Brooks, creator of the rollicking 1960s sitcom, told a reporter at the time, "No one had ever done a show about an idiot before. I decided to be the first."
Finally, let's have a word about the bureaucracy that Michael Horowitz, the Obama-appointed inspector general, represents. Bureaucracy gets a bad name but it plays a vital role in collecting information and ensuring that government decisions are made on a reasoned, evidentiary and appropriate basis. And Mr. Horowitz is a hero of the bureaucracy in the best sense. With what the reliably foolish Harry Litman in the Washington Post calls his "hall-monitor rectitude," the inspector general's reports are landmarks in upholding the value of established procedures when the powers of government are in the hands of chaotic persons like Mr. Comey.

Colors pop in Nigerian wedding textiles

Texto completo: Dola Fatunbi Olutoye, 25, was ecstatic after becoming engaged last November to Dr. Yinka Olutoye, 26. She knew she wanted a traditional Nigerian wedding, but needed help executing the cultural elements of the ceremony, which took place on May 25 in Houston.
Dola Olutoye, a pharmacy student from Houston, and Yinka Olutoye, a recent medical school graduate, are both Nigerian-Americans who are part of the Yoruba ethnic group, which is heavily concentrated in the southwest region of Nigeria.
On the top of her to-do list, after graduating from pharmacy school and starting a residency program, was to shop for traditional fabrics, which have become emblematic of Nigerian weddings today.
"Nigerian weddings are full of color, vibrant, and are flashy," said Dola Olutoye, who has attended many traditional Nigerian weddings in her hometown. "Without your fabrics, you're not having a traditional Nigerian wedding."
In Houston and throughout other Nigerian enclaves, like Atlanta, New York and Baltimore, Nigerian wedding ceremonies are especially opulent. Guest lists can number in the hundreds - a cultural holdover from Nigeria, where significant life events were typically community gatherings open to close relatives and loose acquaintances. With such a big audience, a bride aims to impart regality, vibrancy and thoughtfulness in each of her bridal looks.
With the help of her mother, Modupe Fatunbi, who had connections to a fabric distributor in Asia, Olutoye picked out the colorful, patterned yards of lace and silk for each of her ensembles. They featured: a champagne and rose gold-color set, heavily beaded with pearls and embroidered flowers for her Yoruba traditional wedding (also known as the engagement ceremony); a royal blue dress with a detachable skirt for her western wedding, which included a conventional white gown; and various fabrics for three thanksgivings after the wedding, when the couple receives well-wishes and blessings from friends and family.
To streamline the process, Olutoye enlisted the assistance of Doyin Fashakin, the owner of Doyin Fash Events, a luxury bridal consultancy and events company in Houston. Fashakin, also of Nigerian heritage, knew the subtle fashion elements necessary for an authentic cultural wedding, and wears many informal hats during the wedding preparation process - family therapist, budget enforcer and fashion consultant for anxious clients.
"When you're picking out your outfits, it's very important that you select something unique and colorful but also of quality," said Fashakin, who along with overseeing the more logistical aspects of planning a wedding, also helps brides source fabrics and accessories for their ensembles from vendors in Nigeria, Switzerland, Dubai and Australia.
What makes a good fabric? "No synthetic fibers or blends; the material should be 100% lace or silk," Fashakin said. "The material also shouldn't bunch or fade. There shouldn't be loose threads and it-should always feel good against your skin."
Chioma Nwogu-Johnson of Dure Events, a wedding and events company in Houston, said that while planning a wedding in Houston is more cost-effective than in New York, the brides who procure her services still spend from $100,000 to $300,000 or more to host their nuptials. A sizable budget - sometimes $10,000 or more - is usually allocated to wedding fashions. Couples also absorb the cost to outfit large bridal parties and select attendees in aso ebi (translating to "family clothes," or a uniform dress worn by friends of the couple as a show of solidarity). Some brides opt to send their raw fabrics to trusted tailors in Nigeria, where the craftwork is less expensive.
"Nigerian brides spend months searching for their wedding fabrics looking for something distinct - something that no one else will have - and that can sometimes be a tedious and frustrating process for brides," said Nwogu-Johnson, whose clients often include affluent professionals, like medical doctors, engineers and oil contractors. "They want to make sure that no other brides are wearing their fabrics. More than anything, they want to make sure they stand out."
Social media can provide some inspiration for brides. The hashtag #nigerianwedding on Instagram touts more than 3 million posts, showing brides in all manner of colors, fabrics and bridal party size.
The style of dress at Nigerian occasions will vary, depending on the tribe of the celebrants. For instance, brides from the Igbo people, another major ethnic group concentrated primarily in south-central and southeastern Nigeria, adorn themselves with coral beads signifying royalty, and at times use George fabric, a heavily embroidered material from India.
Material made of lace is also popular for many Nigerian brides across tribes, as are other textiles like silk and tulle, embellished with hand-stitched beads, stones and pearls tailored painstakingly to a bride's taste.
Many brides spare no expense in making what the Yoruba people call their aso oke or top clothes, made of a matching buba blouse and iro, a swath of fabric wrapped around the waist. A heavy sash of complementary fabric, called an iborun, is draped on one shoulder. The bride's ensemble is matched to her husband's tunic and pants set, along with his agbada draping and fila hat.
But perhaps the most important part of any Nigerian bride's look is her gele, a scarf or fabric folded into an ornate shape atop a woman's head. The gele is standard in African womens-wear, although called by different names throughout the continent. A bride's look is incomplete without it.
Tying gele requires artistry, nimble fingers and a touch of originality; no two geles are tied the same. "A well-tied gele at a wedding is what an ascot is at the Kentucky Derby," said Hakeem Oluwasegun Olaleye, a bridal stylist based in Houston who is known within the bridal circuit as Segun Gele. Named for his skill in fashioning the headscarves, Olaleye is commissioned to wrap geles around the heads of brides and female attendees at weddings around the world.
"Geles are art - it is your crowning glory," Olaleye said. "It's as important as your hair. You can wear a cheap dress and have your head wrap beautifully done and no one will notice your outfit. Your gele is the focal point."
When Charlye Nichols Egbo, 31, a luxury property manager in Houston, married her husband Stanley Egbo, 38, who works in oil and gas logistics, in March, she employed five distinct dress changes for her traditional engagement and western wedding, sourcing materials from Nigeria and Turkey. With nods to her husband's Igbo culture - Charlye Egbo is African American - she solicited help from Nwogu-Johnson and Stanley Egbo's three sisters to pull each of her distinct bridal looks together.
One of her looks was a heavily beaded navy and gold embroidered ensemble with an embellished floral sleeve made from fabric bought in Dubai. Another outfit - a sparkling, two-tone red set number with coral neckwear - was complemented by a fuchsia-laden aso ebi party of 27 and a custom-made white gown by Es� Az�nabor, a Nigerian atelier.
"Every suit-maker, every dressmaker we used was Nigerian," Charlye Egbo said. "I could have bought a gown from Vera Wang, but it was important to us to maintain authenticity, which made everything that more intimate and that more special."

Texto completo: Hallelujah and glory be, football has returned to the Kanawha Valley.
Starting Thursday night up on the hill in South Charleston and on the turf at University of Charleston Stadium, the gridiron games now have real stakes. On Fridays and Saturdays (and a Thursday or two) throughout the fall, championship hopes strengthen or wither with each game.
It's fun to be a fan.
So, about that . . .
When I say it's fun to be a fan, it should be fun for everyone - everyone in the stands, everyone in the room in front of the television, everyone at the sports bar or restaurant. So do ol' Uncle Derek a favor when you go out to have your fun. Make sure you're letting everyone else have fun, too.
Do you have that buddy you love having by your side & except for when he's watching his favorite football team? You spend all week having a ball with his Dr. Jekyll, but you know that when he's rocking his team's colors for the big game, Mr. Hyde is the one cheering in the stands or in front of the screen.
(Well, maybe he's cheering. Most of the time, he's yelling. Or ranting. Or sulking. Or throwing something.)
Nothing kills a good vibe quicker than a bad fan. The attention is forced away from the game in front of everyone and onto the jerk causing the commotion.
And there are those folks who at least are self aware, who will admit, "if my team loses, you don't want to be around me for the rest of the night.
But why be that guy (or girl)? Why make it tough on everyone else who wants to enjoy the game. You might want to enjoy it in your own way, but that may drain the joy from others.
So no matter where you may be - a high school field, a college stadium or in front of a TV - remember you're part of a crowd, not alone. Keep acting like a fool, and you will be, whether you want to or not.
"""
On a serious note, while you're gorging yourself on football over this long weekend, take some time to tear away from it on Sunday to watch an important documentary.
At 6:30 p.m. Sunday, the NFL Network will broadcast "Orangeburg, a documentary on the "Orangeburg Massacre of 1968. On Feb. 8 of that year, students at South Carolina State, a historically black college in Orangeburg, South Carolina, started a bonfire on campus in protest of a local bowling alley that did not allow African-Americans to enter.
South Carolina Highway Patrol officers fired into a group of 200 protesters, injuring 27 and killing three. One of those killed was football player Samuel Hammond.
The football coach at South Carolina State at the time of the incident was Oree Banks, who in 1977 would become the football coach at West Virginia State. When his players joined the campus protest movement, while other coaches might have pulled them back, Banks did not. According to a 2013 New York Times article, he believed change was coming in the United States and this was part of it.
The program highlights a significant point in the both the history of campus protests, one that came years before the Kent State shootings, and the quest for civil rights. It's a good reason to turn off the football for a little while.

Texto completo: Since President Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, Comey has been portrayed as a martyr and saint by much of the media. Comey fueled the adulation with his memoir, “A Higher loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership. ” But a recent report by the Justice Department Inspector General should obliterate whatever halo Comey still possesses.
Comey wrote seven memos summarizing his interactions with Donald Trump. After he was fired, Comey sent one of those memos to a personal friend and lawyer and directed him to leak the contents to a specific New York Times reporter. The leak achieved the result Comey sought — the appointment of a special counsel to investigate President Trump.
James Comey's decision that he was above FBI policy
Today's report documents how Comey brazenly violated federal and FBI policies regarding with his disclosures. Top FBI officials told the IG that they were "shocked," "stunned," and "surprised’ that Comey would leak the contents of one of the memos to a reporter. The IG concluded: “The unauthorized disclosure of this information — information that Comey knew only by virtue of his position as FBI Director — violated the terms of his FBI Employment Agreement and the FBI's Prepublication Review Policy. ”
Where's our apology:James Comey is back to remind us how Donald Trump got elected
Comey claimed that most of the memos he wrote while FBI chief regarding his dealings with Trump were “personal documents” like his will or his passport. That defense cannot even pass the laugh test. The IG concluded that the memos were “official FBI records” and that Comey violated FBI rules by “failing to either surrender his copies of Memos 2, 4, 6, and 7 to the FBI or seek authorization to retain them; by releasing official FBI information and records to third parties without authorization; and by failing to immediately alert the FBI about his disclosures to his personal attorneys once he became aware in June 2017 that Memo 2 contained” information “that the FBI had determined were classified at the ‘CONFIDENTIAL’ level. ”
When asked why he violated FBI policy on leaking the memo to the media, Comey declared that the issue was of “incredible importance to the Nation, as a whole” and that he leaked because it was “something I [had] to do if I love this country…and I love the Department of Justice, and I love the FBI. ” Comey apparently believed that his affection exempted him from the rules that all other current and former FBI officials must follow.
The IG found it “particularly concerning” that Comey failed to disclose to the FBI that he retained copies of his official memos in his personal safe at home even after FBI officials visited his house to remove all FBI property. "Comey took for himself the 'carte blanche authority' expressly denied by the courts" to FBI officials, the report complained.
The IG concluded that by using sensitive information “to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees — and the many thousands more former FBI employees — who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information. ” The IG report warned that "the civil liberties of every individual who may fall within the scope of the FBI's investigative authorities depend on FBI's ability to protect sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure. "
This is true but it ignores the FBI’s long record of violating Americans’ liberties and covert political interventions. As Yale University historian Beverly Gage noted, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover “insisted that investigative files be kept secret, waging repeated battles to keep them away from the courts and Congress. But he also became a master of the leak, parceling out choice tidbits to reporters at strategic moments. ”
This misconduct rings similar to what was allowed from Hillary Clinton
Comey’s abuse of power to undermine President Trump should be viewed in light of last year’s Inspector General report on the FBI’s kowtowing in their investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server. The FBI chose to exonerate Secretary Clinton despite her violations of federal laws on the handling of confidential information and despite the destruction of evidence and false statements by her aides and associates. The FBI intended to absolve her “absent a confession from Clinton” when they finally interviewed her in July 2016.
Lack of accountability:Trump wants to strike fear in anyone who might investigate or expose him, and it's working
The Justice Department, choosing not to prosecute the former FBI chief for the violations disclosed Thursday, awarded Comey the same “get out of jail free” card that the FBI granted to Hillary Clinton.
Thursday's report is a reminder that Trump’s frequent falsehoods do not automatically make his opponents trustworthy. Americans have yet to learn the full extent of illegitimate and/or tawdry political and bureaucratic meddling during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. There is at least one more Inspector General report pending on the FBI's conduct regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretaps of the Trump campaign — a report that may prove far more troublesome to plenty of former FBI officials.

Texto completo: Being a political journalist these days is equal parts exhilarating and exhausting. In the Trump presidency, we have an irresistible and important story that never stops giving. Our work is being read more than ever. But we also have to contend with the criticism and scrutiny that comes along with that - and the magnification of those things that social media allows.
And, sometimes, it gets the better of us.
Two media stories have broken through in recent days. One involves an effort by high-profile Trump supporters to mine the old social-media postings of journalists at top outlets in the hope of publicly attacking them and undermining their employers. This has been met with condemnation by many journalists.
The other story broke overnight, and it involves conservative New York Times columnist Bret Stephens raising a fuss about a George Washington University professor who called him a “bedbug” on Twitter. Stephens wrote the professor a personal email, copied his boss, compared the insult to what “totalitarian regimes” do and quit Twitter. The reaction, particularly among liberals and left-leaning journalists who have long derided Stephens, has been one of gleeful ridicule.
But while many mock Stephens for his apparently thin skin, we shouldn’t avert our gaze from our own. For all the truly righteous indignation we’ve summoned in response to President Donald Trump’s treatment of us, we’ve also put ourselves on too much of a hair trigger when it comes to denouncing criticism and scrutiny.
Jack Shafer summed it up nicely in a piece for Politico, in which he fought back against the criticism of scouring journalists’ social media accounts:
“As much as I would like to sympathize with my fellow journalists, it doesn’t strike me as unreasonable to ask them to own or repudiate vile or impolitic things they might have stated in the past. Nor is it remotely unfair for the president’s supporters to demand that journalists, who are forever denouncing him as a racist (because he is), be held accountable for their bigoted speech, on Twitter or anywhere else. Journalists don’t deserve a get-out-of-bigotry-jail free card just because they’re journalists. If their past tweets, however ancient, undercut their current journalistic work or make them sound hypocritical, they can’t blame their diminished prestige on Trump’s allies. It’s like blaming a cop for writing you a ticket for speeding in a school zone.”
The Times’s publisher issued a memo about the effort to expose journalists, in which he labeled it a “coordinated campaign ... to attack hundreds of journalists in retaliation for coverage of the administration.” The memo added: “This represents an escalation of an ongoing campaign against the free press.”
This is a great example of how the media’s response to Trump can sometimes be over the top. There are many ways in which Trump’s attacks on the media are beyond the pale, including his repeated threats to open up libel laws, his frequent labeling of us as the “enemy of the people,” his revocation of press passes (including of The Washington Post when he was a candidate) and his and his aides’ serial dishonesty with us.
But there is also a tendency to label most every criticism of the media an attack on “the free press.” That makes it sound like Trump is attacking our very freedoms and our right to criticize him, when often he’s just complaining about coverage. (It’s an important distinction, but it’s a hard one to make in the case of a president who has stated his desire to erode some press freedoms.)
Attacking coverage is something every president does, even if no recent ones have done it to the extent Trump has. We should point out when those attacks - from Trump or any other subject of coverage - don’t make sense or fly in the face of the facts, but lumping that in with calling us the “enemy of the people” dilutes the severity of the latter.
And more broadly speaking, we need to be wary of looking like we think we’re immune from not just criticism but also scrutiny. It’s 100 percent true that the Twitter mob can blow things out of proportion, and these Trump supporters clearly hope to weaponize that. But this is mostly a question of how the companies that employ the journalists involved are going to respond to those uproars. And the more times this tactic is tried, the less effective it’s going to be. (We also need to recognize the mere presence of this threat is surely meant to “work the refs” and influence our coverage, as much as to punish us at some later date.)
No journalist wants to be the subject of this kind of scrutiny, and many of us entered this business probably thinking we would never be on the receiving end of it. But we’ve been forced into a situation in which we’ve often had to become the arbiters of presidential behavior, and with that responsibility comes scrutiny of our own moral high ground. When that scrutiny is presented in unfair and overzealous ways, it will hopefully be dealt with as such. But let’s not clutch our pearls too tightly.

Jamelle Bouie: Ending Electoral College would boost democracy

Texto completo: Spend enough time talking politics on the internet — or in any other public forum — and you’ll run into this standard reply to anyone who wants more democracy in American government: “We’re a republic, not a democracy.”
You saw it over the weekend, in an exchange between Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas. In a brief series of tweets, Ocasio-Cortez made the case against the Electoral College and argued for a national popular vote to choose the president. “Every vote should be = in America, no matter who you are or where you come from,” she wrote. “The right thing to do is establish a Popular Vote. & GOP will do everything they can to fight it.”
Crenshaw, who has sparred with Ocasio-Cortez before, jumped in with a response: “Abolishing the Electoral College means that politicians will only campaign in (and listen to) urban areas. That is not a representative democracy.” And then he said it: “We live in a republic, which means 51% of the population doesn’t get to boss around the other 49%.”
Crenshaw is wrong on the impact of ending the Electoral College. A presidential candidate who focused only on America’s cities and urban centers would lose — there just aren’t enough votes. Republicans live in cities just as Democrats live in rural areas. Under a popular vote, candidates would still have to build national coalitions across demographic and geographic lines. The difference is that those coalitions would involve every region of the country instead of a handful of competitive states in the Rust Belt and parts of the South.
But the crux of Crenshaw’s argument is his second point. “We live in a republic.” He doesn’t say “not a democracy,” but it’s implied by the next clause, where he rejects majority rule — “51% of the population doesn’t get to boss around the other 49%.”
You can fill in the blanks of the argument from there. The Founding Fathers built a government to stymie the “tyranny of the majority.” They contrasted their “republic” with “democracy,” which they condemned as dangerous and unstable. As John Adams wrote in an 1814 letter to Virginia politician John Taylor: “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself. There never was a Democracy Yet, that did not commit suicide.”
But there’s a problem. For the founders, “democracy” did not mean majority rule in a system of representation. The men who led the revolution and devised the Constitution were immersed in classical literature and political theory. Ancient Greece, in particular, was a cautionary tale. When James Madison critiqued “democracy” in Federalist No. 10, he meant the Athenian sort: “a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person.” This he contrasted with a “republic” or “a government in which the scheme of representation takes place.” Likewise, in a 1788 speech to the New York ratification convention, Alexander Hamilton disavowed “the ancient democracies in which the people themselves deliberated.” They “never possessed one good feature of government,” he said. “Their very character was tyranny; their figure deformity.”
In more modern terms, the founders feared “direct democracy” and accounted for its dangers with a system of “representative democracy.” Yes, this “republic” had counter-majoritarian aspects, like equal representation of states in the Senate, the presidential veto and the Supreme Court. But it was not designed for minority rule.
Virtually everything was geared toward producing representative majorities that could govern on behalf of the country — to diminish “faction” in favor of consensus. And in the case of the Electoral College, the point wasn’t to stymie majorities but to provide a way to find a competent and popular chief executive in a large nation of parochial states.
It’s worth asking where this quip — “we’re a republic, not a democracy” — even came from. Nicole Hemmer, a historian of American politics and the author of “Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics,” traces it to the 1930s and ’40s. “When Franklin Roosevelt made defending democracy a core component of his argument for preparing for, and then intervening in, the war in Europe, opponents of U.S. intervention began to push back by arguing that the U.S. was not, in fact, a democracy,” she wrote in an email.
One Roosevelt opponent, for example — Boake Carter, a newspaper columnist who supported the America First Committee (which opposed U.S. entry into World War II) — wrote a column in October 1940 called “A Republic Not a Democracy,” in which he strongly rebuked the president for using the word “democracy” to describe the country. “The United States was never a democracy, isn’t a democracy, and I hope it will never be a democracy,” Carter wrote.
The term went from conservative complaint to right-wing slogan in the 1960s, when Robert Welch, founder of the John Birch Society, used it in a September 1961 speech, “Republics and Democracies.” In a democracy, Welch protested, “there is a centralization of governmental power in a simple majority. And that, visibly, is the system of government which the enemies of our republic are seeking to impose on us today.”
“This is a Republic, not a Democracy,” Welch said in conclusion, “Let’s keep it that way!”
These origins are important. If there’s substance behind “We’re a republic, not a democracy,” it’s not as a description of American government. There’s really no difference, in the present, between a “republic” and a “democracy”: Both connote systems of representation in which sovereignty and authority derive from the public at large.
The point of the slogan isn’t to describe who we are, but to claim and co-opt the founding for right-wing politics — to naturalize political inequality and make it the proper order of things. What lies behind that quip, in other words, is an impulse against democratic representation. It is part and parcel of the drive to make American government a closed domain for a select, privileged few.

Tom Cotton: We should buy Greenland

Texto completo: After news leaked last week that President Trump had expressed interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark, his critics predictably derided him as crazy. But once again, the president is crazy like a fox. The acquisition of Greenland would secure vital strategic interests for the United States, economically benefit both us and Greenlanders, and would be in keeping with American — and Danish — diplomatic traditions.
Strategically positioned in the Arctic Circle, Greenland has long attracted the attention of American policymakers. As far back as 1867, Secretary of State William Seward explored the acquisition of Greenland around the time that he negotiated the purchase of Alaska from the Russians. I myself raised the prospect of acquiring Greenland with the Danish ambassador just last year.
In 1946, the Truman administration offered $100 million to Denmark to acquire Greenland, arguing that the island was “indispensable to the safety of the United States” in confronting the growing Soviet threat, just as it had been in World War II when American forces used bases in Greenland to deter Nazi aggression. While the deal didn’t go through, we kept troops on the island throughout the Cold War. Today, the Air Force’s 21st Space Wing is stationed at Thule Air Base in western Greenland to support our ballistic-missile defenses and space missions.
America is not the only nation to recognize Greenland’s strategic significance. Intent on securing a foothold in the Arctic and North America, China attempted in 2016 to purchase an old American naval base in Greenland, a move the Danish government prevented. Two years later, China was back at it, attempting to build three airports on the island, which failed only after intense lobbying of the Danes by the Trump administration.
Beijing understands not only Greenland’s geographic importance but also its economic potential. Greenland is rich in a wide array of mineral deposits, including rare-earth minerals — resources critical to our high-tech and defense industries. China currently dominates the market in these minerals and has threatened to withhold them from us to gain leverage in trade negotiations. Greenland also possesses untold reserves of oil and natural gas.
An agreement to transfer Greenland’s sovereignty must also serve the interests of our good friends, the Danes, and the 56,000 Greenlanders as well. Their considerations ought to include the fact that despite Greenland’s long-term potential, a lack of infrastructure and financing still hamstring the island’s economy today. Greenland’s economy is less than one-tenth of Vermont’s, America’s smallest state economy. Every year, Denmark transfers $670 million in subsidies to support the island.
As the world’s largest economy, the United States could more easily assume support for Greenland’s communities while investing substantially in its future. The transfer of Greenland’s sovereignty would alleviate a significant financial burden on the Danish people while expanding opportunities for Greenlanders. Just look at what American sovereignty has meant to Alaskans compared with conditions in Siberia under Russian control.
Despite the historical ignorance of the president’s critics, the negotiated acquisition of sovereignty is a longstanding and perfectly legitimate tool of statecraft, particularly in the American tradition. More than one-third of America’s territory was purchased from Spain (Florida), France (the Louisiana Purchase), Mexico (the Gadsden Purchase) and Russia (Alaska).
Indeed, Washington and Copenhagen have engaged in exactly this kind of transaction. In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson — the great champion of self-determination — paid $25 million to purchase the Danish West Indies, which have ever since been known as the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Who today believes the acquisition of Alaska was “Seward’s folly”? On the contrary, it has been a great blessing to Alaskans and all Americans. Our nation has much to gain, as do the Danes and Greenlanders. While there are short-term obstacles, the same benefits could apply for Greenland today — and the manifest logic of this idea means that its consideration is here to stay.

It’s Ashley. Here’s the news you need to know Thursday.
But first, genetics are complicated: The largest study of its kind found new evidence that genes do contribute to same-sex sexual behavior but echoes research that says there's no "gay gene. "
Calm before Hurricane Dorian
Floridians are closely monitoring Hurricane Dorian, which could hit the state early Monday as a Category 4 hurricane. If it hits as a Category 4, with winds of 130 mph, the damage could be catastrophic: "Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls," the National Hurricane Center said. Forecasters say it’s too early to tell where Dorian, now a Category 1, will have the greatest impact, but any part of the coast between the Florida Keys and the southern part of Georgia could be a landing spot. After that, the storm’s path would be unpredictable.
The most powerful hurricane in US history was a nameless storm that rocked Florida on Labor Day 1935.
Donated kidneys are being thrown away
About 12 people die every day waiting for a kidney, but an estimated 10 donated kidneys are discarded daily. The U. S. ditches about 3,500 donated kidneys a year, many of which could be used to save lives, new research shows. The study, published Monday, showed the U. S. threw away almost 28,000 donated kidneys between 2004 and 2014, often because the donor had hypertension, diabetes, a heart attack or tested positive for Hepatitis C. Last year, nearly 100,000 Americans were on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.

Former FBI chief James Comey is off the hook
Former FBI Director James Comey broke bureau rules when he kept memos at home about his interactions with President Donald Trump and then had a friend describe one to The New York Times. The Justice Department's inspector general reported Thursday that the memos shouldn't have been revealed (to lawyers OR reporters) without FBI approval. Yet prosecutors found no reason to file criminal charges against him. Within minutes of the report's release, Comey took to Twitter, asserting that the report had absolved him of any wrongdoing.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Purdue Pharma would devote its profits to cleaning up the devastation wrought by opioids, and the controlling Sackler family would be out, under a $10 billion to $12 billion nationwide settlement taking shape at the negotiating table, according to published reports Wednesday.

The agreement, if it comes to pass, would resolve more than 2,000 lawsuits brought against the maker of OxyContin by state and local governments.

Under the proposal on the table, Purdue Pharma would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and transform itself into a "public benefit trust corporation," with all profits from drug sales and other proceeds going to the plaintiffs, news reports said, citing a document outlining the tentative agreement.

The Wall Street Journal said the arrangement would stay in place for seven to 10 years and would be overseen by trustees named by the bankruptcy court. Details of the proposed settlement were also reported by NBC and The New York Times.

The Sacklers would give up ownership of Purdue Pharma and contribute $3 billion of

their own money toward the total, the reports said. They would also sell another pharmaceutical company, Mundipharma, which would add $1.5 billion to the settlement.

In addition, Purdue Pharma would supply its addiction treatment drugs free to the public.

It was not immediately clear whether the reconstituted company would continue to sell opioids. Purdue Pharma also makes laxatives, antiseptics and dietary supplements.

In a statement, the Stamford, Connecticut-based company did not confirm any of the details but said it sees little good in years of "wasteful litigation and appeals."

"Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome," it said.

Paul Farrell Jr., a lead plaintiffs' lawyer representing local governments in the negotiations going on in Cleveland, said all sides remain under a gag order: "All we can confirm is that we are in active settlement discussions with Purdue."

Attorneys general representing several states also confirmed the accelerated negotiations.

"Our mission here has always been clear -- make Purdue Pharma and the other manufacturers and distributors pay for what they did to Pennsylvania and its people, and put the Sackler family out of the opioid business for good," said Jacklin Rhoads, a spokeswoman for Pennsylvania's attorney general.

While the U.S. has many "public benefit corporations," creating one to settle a civil action would be a novel approach, said John Coffee, a law professor and director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School.

In general, public benefit corporations have charters that dictate that they operate not to maximize profits for shareholders but to benefit some other purpose, such as a charity or research, he said. Coffee said that he has never heard specifically of a "public benefit corporation trust" and that it sounded like a hybrid.

The opioid overdose epidemic has killed more than 400,000 people in the U.S. since 2000 and torn apart communities. Purdue Pharma and other players in the industry have been barraged with lawsuits, with the first federal trial scheduled to start in Cleveland in two months. Purdue has been cast by attorneys and addiction experts as a chief villain in the crisis. While its painkillers represent a very small piece of the opioid market, the lawsuits accuse it of playing a central role in creating demand for the drugs by downplaying OxyContin's addiction risks and pushing doctors hard to prescribe it.

New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that the Sackler family "started a national fire" and has "made billions profiting from death and destruction."

The Sacklers were ranked America's 19th-richest family by Forbes magazine in 2016, with a net worth estimated at $13 billion.

In March, Purdue and the Sackler family reached a $270 million settlement with Oklahoma over the opioid scourge.

On Monday, an Oklahoma judge found Johnson & Johnson responsible for fueling the state's opioid crisis and ordered the maker of such familiar household products as Band-Aids and baby powder to pay $572 million to help clean up the problem.

It was the first opioid lawsuit brought against the industry by a state to go to trial, and activists expressed hope the verdict would turn up the pressure on other companies to settle.

Members of the Sackler family are major philanthropists who have given money to cultural institutions around the world, including the Smithsonian Institution, New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art and London's Tate Modern. But in recent months, institutions have come under pressure to sever ties to the Sacklers and take the family name off their walls.

Biden Takes His Turn in the Barrel

Texto completo: In every presidential campaign, each major candidate takes his turn in the barrel. Right now, it's former Vice President Joe Biden's turn to suffer bad press and ultracritical punditry.
His frequent gaffes, routine misremembering and occasional weird observations are partly to blame. When he mistakes New Hampshire for Vermont, recalls Parkland shooting survivors visiting him while he was vice president (the shooting was in 2018) or opines on how bad it would have been if Barack Obama had been assassinated after he became the presumptive Democratic nominee in 2008, many Americans say to themselves: What the heck is up with him?
Yet 298 other people also helped put Mr. Biden into the barrel. That's the number of Democrats surveyed in an Aug. 20 Monmouth University Poll that gave Mr. Biden only 19% support nationwide, compared with 20% for both Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. (Mr. Biden was at 32% in Monmouth's June poll.)
In response, Politico's headline shrieked, "Poll: Bernie, Warren surge to tie Biden" while CBS News and the New York Times declared a "three-way tie" and CNN called it a "three-way lead." These were followed by positive coverage of Ms. Warren's large crowds and deft signaling to her party's establishment that she'll be a team player.
Those swooning over the Monmouth results overlooked that its small sample carried a big margin of error -- almost 6 points up or down for each candidate. They also ignored five other surveys conducted within a week of the Monmouth Poll. In those Mr. Biden drew an average of 29% support, Mr. Sanders 19% and Ms. Warren 15%.
Maybe those five polls were wrong and Monmouth right. Or maybe political junkies were looking for excuses to escort Mr. Biden to the barrel and Ms. Warren to the spotlight. After all, the Massachusetts Democrat has risen in the RealClearPolitics average from 9% on June 1 to 16.1% on Wednesday, while Mr. Sanders grew from 16.5% to 17.8%, and Mr. Biden slipped from the 35% he enjoyed June 1 to 28.5% today.
Let's be clear, however, about presidential primary polling. First, it is very early. Lots will change. Second, national polls at this point are not definitive -- except if you're still polling at zero, in which case you're likely going nowhere. That's why the Democratic contest probably consists of three candidates with a realistic shot, perhaps four and at most five.
Third, national polls matter a lot less than polls in states with early contests. Largely based on name identification at this point, national polls can move quickly when voters really start paying attention right before their local primary. But even then, there will be big fluctuations in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Fourth, it's better to look at the pattern in several recent reliable polls than fixate on one.
Polls are easy to report on. What's much harder to gauge is the quality of each candidate's campaign organization. This matters in the early states, especially Iowa, whose Feb. 3 caucuses kick things off. A top-quality organization in an early state can help a candidate take advantage of any breakthrough moment late this year -- think Mr. Obama's speech at the November 2007 Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Des Moines -- that in turn allows the candidate to beat expectations and gain momentum in what will be a front-loaded contest.
Iowa is where Ms. Warren is pressing Mr. Biden. He has plenty of big-name endorsements there, but she purportedly has built a stronger Hawkeye State ground game. Team Biden is countering by bulking up his staff -- now the state's largest -- and engaging with every Biden supporter they can find.
The politirati also appear to be souring on Mr. Biden's argument that he is the most electable Democratic candidate. His electability is still widely accepted among older Democrats, even as it's likely to be rejected by younger ones. But guess who votes?
More important, Mr. Biden's campaign implicitly argues that he is the leading traditional Democrat in the race, not a wacky radical with a plan for free everything, bent on transforming America into a progressive paradise. His principal competitors help him appear normal with what they say.
This is not to suggest Mr. Biden has the contest locked up. Voters may react to his ragged performance by deserting him. His two main opponents are ideologically in tune with each other, and collectively they have more support that he does, while Mr. Biden has shown little ability to freshen up his message to keep voters engaged.
Though it feels like this election has been going for an eternity, it's just getting started. Not everyone can run an endurance race. Whoever can may end up with the Democratic nomination.

The Joys of Being a Late Adopter

Texto completo: The best gadget that I bought this year cost less than a week's worth of groceries. After my smartphone, it's my most frequently used piece of tech. It was also released four years ago.
Can you guess what it is?
The mystery gizmo is a used Kindle e-book reader from 2015, which I bought on eBay from a repair technician. It lacks frills that some new e-readers have, like waterproofing, but I'm not the type to read in the bathtub. So I decided to be a late adopter, and I couldn't be happier: The dated Kindle does its job well, and if I ever break or lose it, I'll be out 50 bucks and not $ 200.
I'm neither a Luddite nor a cheapskate. But after testing hundreds of tech products -- and buying some along the way -- over the last dozen years, I've come to a conclusion: People will almost always get more joy from technology the longer they wait for it to mature. Cutting-edge gadgets can invoke awe and temptation, but being an early adopter involves risk, and the downsides usually outweigh the benefits.
Keep this in mind when, starting next month, we enter the end-of-the-year tech frenzy. That's when companies like Apple, Samsung and Google will try to woo us with hot new gadgets, including premium smartphones, tablets and wearable computers.
I will be reviewing some of these products and advising whether they are worthwhile purchases. But my default recommendation is to resist hitting the "Buy" button and to wait unless you absolutely need to replace your older tech.
"New doesn't always necessarily mean better, or better in ways that will matter," said Nick Guy, a senior staff writer for Wirecutter, a New York Times company that tests products.
Here's a look at when slow adoption was wise -- and fast adoption a mistake -- followed by a look ahead at brand-new tech to be cautious about.
How I learned from the pain of being early
In 2007, I caved and bought Apple's original iPhone.
Having a fully functional web browser on a mobile device was too tempting, and as someone with a lousy sense of direction, I wanted the maps. So that winter, I paid AT&T $ 600 for the iPhone with a two-year contract. For a while, I relished being among the privileged few to live in the future.
That special feeling faded about six months later when Apple released the second-generation iPhone. Not only did the new model connect with 3G, a much faster cellular technology at the time, but it started at just $ 200 with a contract. Ouch.
I've gone through a handful of iPhones since. But that experience taught me a valuable lesson about the cost of early adoption. Nowadays, whenever Apple makes major changes to iPhones, I wait at least a year for it to iterate the tech and release the S version. (For example, instead of buying the iPhone 5 in 2012, I waited till 2013 to buy the iPhone 5S, which was faster and more durable.)
Wirecutter took a similarly cautious approach with the iPhone X, Apple's first radically redesigned smartphone, with a $ 1,000 price tag. When the device was released in 2017, Wirecutter gave it a positive review but encouraged people not to upgrade because Apple was likely to include the premium features in cheaper models the next year.
"We said everything seems to work well, but we don't think it's worth this price now," Mr. Guy said. "If you like the iPhone X, wait a year or two and see what happens."
The next year, Apple released the $ 750 iPhone XR, which was just as capable as (and in some ways better than) the iPhone X.
Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, which sells parts and publishes instructions on repairing devices, said people had previously upgraded to new phones every 18 months on average, but could now wait more than three years. That's because smartphones have reached a point where their improvements aren't as noticeable year after year.
"We're in the golden age of smartphones," he said. "Your smartphone from two years ago still works great and will continue to work for a while."
Psst, want to buy an old watch? Sure!
My waiting more than a decade to buy a Kindle is an extreme example of late adoption. There are other, newer examples highlighting the advantages to this approach.
My second-best gadget purchase this year was the Apple Watch Series 3. When Apple released that watch in 2017, it cost $ 330. This year, retailers like Amazon and Best Buy slashed the price to $ 200. Apple sells the newest version of the watch, Series 4, for $ 400, and its main improvement is a bigger display -- a feature I can live without because I don't often look at the watch screen.
In other words, by waiting and opting for a previous-generation model, I get to enjoy a fast, long-lasting watch that tracks my workouts and shows my calendar notifications, among other perks, for a steep discount.
The late adopter approach goes beyond tech, Mr. Wiens said. In the automobile industry, carmakers occasionally revamp models with new driving technology and chassis designs. Then they build on that same design for several years.
"With cars you never want to buy the first car of a new generation," Mr. Wiens said. "When they radically change it, there's all kinds of issues."
A case in point: When I shopped for a car in 2013, I bought a used Toyota Prius hybrid from 2011, the year after Toyota released a redesign of the Prius. This generation also came with a price cut, so I got what had previously been a luxury vehicle for a modest price.
What to look out for this fall
The question that I, as a tech reviewer, hear most often from friends and colleagues is whether they should buy the new (insert gadget name here). But using the approach I've described, you can develop an intuition for when it's a smart time to upgrade -- and when it's risky.
Let's say that in the coming weeks, Apple releases a new entry-level iPhone and Google releases a new Pixel smartphone.
Since Apple did its last big redesign of the iPhone in 2017, the next one is likely to be an incremental update. As for Google, its Pixel phones are usually modest upgrades that focus on software enhancements.
If your current iPhone or Google Pixel is on the fritz, this year may be a good time to upgrade, assuming the new phones get positive reviews. (Or, if you're like me, you could consider last year's models when their prices drop after the new ones come out this year.)
In contrast, a brand-new Samsung phone coming out in September screams, "Buyer, beware." That is the Galaxy Fold, which is the first smartphone that can be folded and unfolded like a book to decrease or increase its screen size. Samsung postponed the release after early samples broke in reviewers' hands in April.
Samsung said it had since improved the Fold's design and construction. But with a tarnished reputation and a nearly $ 2,000 price, it is likely to become a hallmark example of a risky bet for early adopters.
The wisest thing we can do is pay attention to foldable screens and how they may benefit us in a few years -- but probably not tomorrow.

Texto completo: When a new men's personal care company called Huron recently asked CrossFit Union Square in Manhattan to test its products, some of the men there didn't have much basis for comparison.
A few told Matt Mullenax, the 33-year-old founder of Huron, that they had never used a face wash. Eric Brown, one of the gym's owners, said he doubted most could list five brands. And the products available in the gym's locker rooms are sufficiently unmemorable that Mr. Brown couldn't name them -- and he's the one who buys them.
"What guy is going to do research into the body wash?" Mr. Brown said. "There are so many guys -- and I'm one of them -- who are good about working out and eating healthy, but when it comes to our bathroom routine, it's kind of pathetic."
Huron is one of a handful of new companies hoping to change that -- and cash in -- by targeting men in untapped (at least for the beauty industry) places. For Huron, which began selling its products at the end of July, that's CrossFit gyms; for a start-up called Bravo Sierra, it's military bases. Neither is the sort of spot one associates with discovering a new moisturizer, but then again, many men don't have a place to do that.
While a tiny fraction of men hunt for face masks (a growing category) at specialty retailers, the rest still stick to the essentials, mostly from legacy brands like Irish Spring, introduced in 1970, and the 81-year-old Old Spice.
Besides function, men prioritize convenience, so the marketing tactics of newcomers like Huron and Bravo Sierra make sense, said Larissa Jensen, a beauty industry analyst at the research marketing company NPD.
"They're putting products in the hands of men where they are," Ms. Jensen said.
In some ways, these companies are following in the footsteps of Hawthorne, a three-year-old "grooming solutions" company whose sales grew 1,000 percent in the last year, according to company figures.
With a roughly 20-question online quiz (90 percent of customers take it on their phones), Hawthorne matches customers with products, solving what Brian Jeong, 30, a founder, calls "an accessibility problem" for men. Eighty percent of its customers are from outside New York and California.
"Guys don't go up to each other and say: 'Hey, your skin looks really soft. What are you using?"' Mr. Jeong said. "Guys don't see this kind of thing as a hobby, and they don't shop at Sephora."
There's reason to listen to him: Hawthorne recently closed $ 8 million in funding. Investors include Imaginary, run by the Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet, and Nick Brown, who at his previous firm invested early in companies like Goop.
"Guys want to be spoken to on their own terms and on their own turf," Mr. Jeong said.
Those terms, for the record, are "clueless" -- a box the majority of customers check on Hawthorne's. (Though often not without overestimating their knowledge first. A good number check "expert" and have to go back and downgrade themselves once they see the level of detail in subsequent questions, Mr. Jeong said.) A recent Hawthorne marketing email explained how to use hair conditioner.
Huron is keeping things similarly simple. The face wash instructs men to use a nickel-size amount because "some guys have super-heavy hands," Mr. Mullenax said. "We want to alleviate that sense of 'I don't really know what I'm doing."'
Each of the company's three products -- the minimum Huron thinks any man needs -- costs less than $ 20. This is already a big jump for men who have only ever used Irish Spring bar soap as an all-in-one body wash, face wash and shampoo, Mr. Mullenax said.
CrossFit gyms in several states are trying the line. Eventually it will be available for purchase alongside hand grips and Rx protein bars, yet another results-oriented product CrossFit's famously loyal fans snap up. (Peter Rahal, a founder of RxBars, is an adviser to Huron.)
Or so Mr. Mullenax hopes. His theory is that men who care about performance when it comes to their bodies can be convinced they need something better than drugstore brands for their skin.
Mr. Mullenax knows this audience: He is a longtime CrossFitter who couldn't discern a real difference between the products at CVS, but on the premium end "the native Ohioan in me couldn't stomach paying $ 65 for face wash," he said. One of Huron's other advisers is Jason Khalipa, a 2008 CrossFit Games champion who owns a string of boxes, as the gyms are called, in the San Francisco area.
The products are also available online, where the brand's welcome screen reads: "Look alive out there. It's time, man."
For its part, Bravo Sierra aims to take over the military's bathrooms and tactical backpacks -- and those of gym boot-camp-loving civilians -- by creating "performance wellness" products tested by men on active duty in the Persian Gulf, South Pacific, Southeast Asia and north Alaska. On Aug. 1, the company made its debut on bases worldwide; on Aug. 21, products became available to civilians online. (Companies that want to sell their products on bases must get approval from the Defense Department.)
Among the offerings, which cost from $ 7 to $ 14 (though cheaper for military): torture-tested biodegradable anti-bacterial wipes -- the company calls these "tactical showers" -- that remove dirt but aren't too astringent. ("Torture test" is research-and-development slang for the most challenging condition a product will have to survive: in this case, clean between the toes without ripping.)
There's also a shaving foam designed not to irritate skin even if men are shaving with cold water, as is sometimes the only option when deployed, along with a four-in-one clear "post-foaming gel technology" -- gel that turns to foam -- that can be used to shave as well as wash one's face, body and hair. There is minimal packaging because these guys don't have time to take a tube out of a box and flip caps. (The look of the packaging was designed by Patrick Li, the creative director of T: The New York Times Style Magazine.)
"They told us they needed something they could open with one hand," said Benjamin Bernet, 42, a founder of the company. Mr. Bernet is a personal care industry veteran; he was part of the Kiehl's team that put the brand in Equinox in 2009, long before every luxury gym had fancy bathroom products.
Why focus on the military?
"The environment was very powerful in terms of stress-testing products, but this is a community that doesn't necessarily get the best," said Justin Guilbert, 41, a founder of Bravo Sierra. "We want to change that."
Mr. Guilbert also has better military access than most. His paternal grandfather, John Becker, a World War II lieutenant, started Eurpac, a nearly 70-year-old company that distributes to military commissaries and exchanges. And Mr. Guilbert grew up in Paris, where his mother worked for the U.S.O. (He recalled being allowed to attend a Nirvana concert at Le Zénith arena in 1992, at age 14, with three Marines as chaperones.)
The company's name, Bravo Sierra, is military speak for, er, BS -- a beauty industry norm the founders say they want to avoid.
"I don't think this is an industry where honesty has been a core tenet," Mr. Guilbert said.

Texto completo: New polls published on Wednesday show Joseph R. Biden Jr. with a significant national lead in the Democratic presidential race as the contest heads into the intense fall campaign season, with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders rounding out a threesome that seems to have separated from the rest of the primary field.
The new data, which shows Mr. Biden earning the support of about one in three Democratic voters, stands in contrast to a poll published Monday that showed a virtual three-way tie between Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders at about 20 percent support each. On Wednesday, the director of that poll called those results an outlier.
The latest round of polling suggests that Mr. Biden's national lead -- at this early stage in the campaign -- has been relatively durable throughout the summer. It has been fueled in part by the former vice president's strong name recognition, calculations about general election viability and good will from rank-and-file Democratic voters, even as there are signs of greater volatility on the ground for Mr. Biden in the early-voting presidential primary states.

Still, national polls can offer a snapshot of the Democratic electorate's mood, and of the extent to which various controversies have caught the attention of voters. One of the polls published Wednesday, conducted by Quinnipiac University, showed Mr. Biden as the top choice of 32 percent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic. Ms. Warren came in at 19 percent and Mr. Sanders was at 15 percent.
Those numbers were close to the figures Quinnipiac found at the beginning of the month, with Mr. Biden's standing unchanged despite several weeks of scrutiny over a series of verbal gaffes.
Separately, a poll from USA Today and Suffolk University also found Mr. Biden at 32 percent, followed by Ms. Warren at 14 percent and Mr. Sanders at 12 percent.
Those numbers contradict a Monmouth University Poll that drew attention from the news media, including The New York Times, earlier in the week. It showed Mr. Biden plummeting 13 percentage points from June, putting him at 19 percent, with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders at 20 percent each. On Wednesday, Patrick Murray, the director of that poll, said in a statement that it was clear the results had diverged from the polling consensus.
"It occurs very infrequently, but every pollster who has been in this business a while recognizes that outliers happen," Mr. Murray said. "This appears to be one of those instances."
Because there is no national primary, the standing of the candidates in the early-voting primary states may matter far more than nationwide snapshots. Some surveys this summer have shown Mr. Biden's lead in Iowa and New Hampshire ebb since he entered the race in April, and conversations with voters in Iowa have revealed signs of an enthusiasm challenge for the front-runner.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, have established themselves in a tier above the rest of the Democratic field. No other candidate has consistently reached double-digit support in recent surveys; in the Quinnipiac and Suffolk polls, the only other candidates with 5 percent or better were Senator Kamala Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. More than a dozen of the Democrats got just 1 percent -- or less.
The Quinnipiac poll, conducted Aug. 21-26, and the Suffolk poll, conducted Aug. 20-25, had margins of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points among Democratic voters. The Monmouth poll, conducted Aug. 16-20, had a margin of error of plus or minus six points. All three were conducted by telephone.
The latest round of polling also suggests that the Democratic candidates are on track to have only one presidential debate next month, after two rounds of two-night debates earlier this summer. As of Wednesday's deadline to qualify for the September debate, only 10 candidates had done so, meaning they can all fit on one stage under the rules set by the Democratic National Committee.
The committee requires that candidates land 130,000 individual donors and 2 percent support in at least four qualifying polls in order to make the debate stage.
The billionaire impeachment activist Tom Steyer was close to meeting those benchmarks, collecting enough donors and hitting the 2 percent requirement in three polls so far. But he failed to reach 2 percent in either of the polls published Wednesday morning, leaving him one poll short as the midnight deadline approached.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

No, it's on its last legs

Texto completo: The assumptions underlying a controversy are often more important than the controversy itself.
Take the case of our blithe acceptance of the electoral college. There is nothing normal or democratic about choosing our president through a system that makes it ever more likely that the candidate who garners fewer votes will nonetheless assume power. For a country that has long claimed to model democracy to the world, this is both wrong and weird.
And there is also nothing neutral or random about how our system works. The electoral college tilts outcomes toward white voters, conservative voters and certain regions of the country. People outside these groups and places are supposed to sit back and accept their relative disenfranchisement. There is no reason they should, and at some point, they won't. This will lead to a meltdown.
Our brewing troubles were underscored last month by the kerfuffle that Nate Cohn, the New York Times' political numbers guru, set off with a story that ran under the headline "Trump's Electoral College Edge Could Grow in 2020, Rewarding Polarizing Campaign."
For election junkies, Cohn's analysis ignited quite a stir, especially since it set off a "Nate vs. Nate" Twitter skirmish between Cohn and Nate Silver, another brand-name data maven. (Yes, fate has made "Nate" a name of choice for people in this line of work.) Silver's main critique was fair enough: "There's just not that much we can say about the Electoral College right now beyond a couple of fairly loose priors (e.g. [it's] more likely to help than hurt Trump)."
Still, Cohn's calculations were revelatory. He stressed, for example, that higher turnout in 2020, which is generally seen as helping Democrats, could actually boost Trump in the key states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and especially Wisconsin by bringing out more of the Trump base.
As Cohn wrote, "the major Democratic opportunity - to mobilize nonwhite and young voters on the periphery of politics - would disproportionately help Democrats in diverse, often noncompetitive states." On the other hand, the GOP's opportunity is "to mobilize less educated white voters, particularly those who voted in 2016 but sat out 2018." This "would disproportionately help them in white, working-class areas overrepresented in the Northern battleground states."
Think about it: The Democratic nominee against Trump could beat him by far more votes than Hillary Clinton did in 2016 - and still lose. Clinton led Trump by about 2.9 million popular votes, 2.1 percent. Cohn's conclusion: "It is even possible that Mr. Trump could win while losing the national vote by as much as five percentage points."
This means that the country could render a negative verdict on Trump's time in office by swinging away from him in a big way - and he would still be president for four more years.
Defenders of such a departure from one-person, one-vote say that if Democrats run up big leads in a few states and regions - especially California but also, say, New York, Illinois and New England - that shouldn't count. Their strained claim is that a president is somehow more "representative" of the country if he wins by eking out tiny margins in several Midwestern states. This transforms our democracy into a casino. If you narrowly hit the right numbers in some places, you take the pot.
What they are really defending, without explicitly saying so, is the idea that states with a higher percentage of white, non-Hispanic voters should have a disproportionate influence on who becomes president.
As a short-term strategic matter, Cohn is right to stress the importance to the 2020 result of states that were closely divided in 2016. But while I have great affection for the Midwest, I see no just reason for an individual voter in California having far less power than an individual voter in, say, Wisconsin or Michigan.
And the system's bias toward white voters only encourages Trump's habit of dividing the country along racial lines. So in addition to being undemocratic, the electoral college encourages a particularly odious politician with no interest in uniting the country to do all he can to promote minority rule.
At some point, the majority will rise up. If Cohn's worst-case-for-democracy scenario materializes, 2020 could be that year. Our founders admitted that the electoral college system they created in the original Constitution was defective by altering it with the 12th Amendment in 1804 . It's time we followed their lead in showing the same willingness to scrap a system that is sending us headlong into a national crisis.

Thomas L. Friedman: How Trump and Xi can both win their trade war

Texto completo: It is impossible to exaggerate what a dangerous cliff the U.S. and China are perched on today.
If the current trade dispute tips over into a full-blown economic war — and that spreads to Chinese students and scientists being thrown out of America and American business executives out of China and that spreads to all the investments we’ve made in each other’s countries being ripped out — the world as we’ve known it for the last four decades is going to be replaced with something much uglier, less prosperous, less stable and less able to meet global challenges, like climate change and cybercrime, that are barreling down on us.
This has become a really bad play. We have a juvenile, unstable U.S. president actually enacting trade policy via Twitter — ignoring the advice of his experts — and we have a pressured Chinese president who is afraid to appear to be kowtowing to any trade demands from the U.S. for fear that his domestic rivals will denounce him as weak and that pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong will be emboldened by his weakness.
So each man is trying to intimidate the other into submission by showing who has the biggest tariff, and this is whipsawing markets and making it impossible for investors to plan long term.
We need a cease-fire now — and if no one else is going to propose the terms, I will.
President Donald Trump should say to President Xi Jinping: “For the next six months, we’ll suspend all the tariffs that we’ve imposed. And in those six months we expect you to order from the top down an end to your worst trade abuses — and you know which ones we’re talking about: stealing intellectual property, forcing technology transfers, restricting access, etc. You don’t have to announce anything or put anything into law. Just get it done your own way and tell your people whatever you want. I won’t tweet a word to embarrass you. And we’ll re-evaluate in six months whether the results constitute meaningful progress.’’
That’s not a perfect outcome after two years of negotiations, but perfect is not on the menu. Only “better” is on the menu right now. I vote for better.
Don’t get me wrong, Trump was right to insist that the U.S.-China trading relationship had to change. But Trump vastly underestimated in several ways how “easy” winning a trade war with China would be.
Trump, by doing the whole thing in public — with his ego-inflating tweets always intended to show that he was winning and China was caving — clearly prompted the Chinese to remind the U.S. president that they’re not some dumpling restaurant in a Trump Tower that can be bullied into paying more rent. They’re actually one-sixth of humanity , and they hold more than $1.1 trillion in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds, which is 27% of all the U.S. government debt held by foreign countries, and they’re pretty good at making stuff.
For instance, it takes about 22 hours on Amtrak to go by train from New York to Chicago. Beijing to Shanghai is about the same distance, and it takes China’s bullet train 4.5 hours to make that trip. That’s not a typo. And it partly explains why a lot of Chinese officials look at America today as a dysfunctional mess that elected a crazy man as president and that can’t build anything big and hard anymore because it can’t act together.
Also, while I respect the comprehensive approach Trump’s actual trade negotiators took in these talks — they wanted China to enact laws and regulations that would outlaw stealing of intellectual property, forced technology transfers, certain government subsidies, and to create a U.S.-China mechanism to verify compliance — it might have been too much change all at once for the Chinese system. That’s not an excuse for Beijing. It’s just a fact.
Xi seems to be saying that he can’t write into Chinese law the market-opening, verification and transparency regulations that Trump demands — even though they would enhance China’s own needed economic reform process — because Xi would appear to be conceding to the demands of foreigners and because it would constrict the Communist Party’s arbitrary powers. Xi has plenty of hard-liners around him — particularly the huge state-owned industries lobby — trying to protect its companies from U.S. competition by telling Xi that the Americans’ trade demands are really intended to undermine Communist Party rule.
I don’t think Trump is looking to take down China. He just wants a deal he can boast about. But there are people around Trump who do want to use this trade war to topple Communist China — as if democracy, not massive global chaos, would automatically bloom in its wake. It’s madness, but that is why this moment is so scary. Trump and Xi could both go either way.
What Trump also underestimated is that we don’t just have a trade access problem with China today, we also have a trust shortage problem. When all we bought from China were toys and T-shirts and cheap electronics, we did not care if they were communists, capitalists, authoritarians or vegetarians. But now that China wants to sell us many of the same high-tech products that America and Europe make — from 5G infrastructure to cellphones to advanced electronics — products that get deeply embedded in our society and can be dual use (civilian and military), we need a whole new level of trust between our societies. That will take time to build.
Xi, for his part, completely misread how much Republicans, Democrats and the broad U.S. business community are behind Trump’s unwillingness to tolerate China’s trade abuses any longer — not when China wants to make and export all the same products that we do. If Xi thinks Americans will continue to tolerate the status quo in U.S.-China trade, he is badly mistaken.
So for all these reasons it’s best to go right now for a truce and a period of confidence-building, during which China proves that it really will open up — if it can do so in its own way without embarrassment — and Trump proves to China that all he wants are results he can brag about — not a revolution in Beijing.
While those six months play out, Trump should sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal — which brings the 12 biggest Pacific economies, except China, into a global Pacific trade pact built around American values and standards — and then line up all our European Union allies as well.
That way when we revisit this issue in six months, we can present China with a united front to formalize its trade openings. By then it won’t be Trump versus Xi, but rather the world versus China over what are the best reciprocal rules for trade for all. That should be our goal, maneuvering China into a rules-based global competition.
If Trump and Xi can forge a big deal right now, God bless them. I’ll tip my cap. But everything I see today tells me that we should just focus on better. I’d be happy making some real trade progress now, lowering the temperature so we can have a more rational, long-term discussion about rules and avoiding a new Cold War with China that will destabilize the whole globalization system — a system that’s also not perfect but, boy, you will miss it if it’s gone.

Texto completo: Back from the G-7 summit in France, President Donald Trump has been busy on Twitter, criticizing the news media, Puerto Rico's government leaders and his Republican opponents in the presidential primary. He even went on a rant about bedbugs.
For those without Twitter alerts turned on for the president, here are his top tweets explained.
'Great job Mr. President!'
Trump tweeted a new complaint about his poll numbers, citing commonly conservative polling site Zogby Analytics. Zogby has reported that Trump’s overall approval rating is 51%, though virtually every recent credible survey has his rating at least seven percentage points lower.
“It is amazing that I can be at 51% with Zogby when the Fake & Corrupt News is almost 100% against me. Great job Mr. President!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning.
More: Buy Greenland? Americans are no more enthusiastic about Trump's idea than Greenlanders are
RealClear Politics, which calculates an average score of reliable polls it aggregates, says Trump’s average approval rating from polls conducted Aug. 10-27 was 42. 8%.
A nationwide USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll conducted Aug. 20-25 showed Trump’s approval rating to be 44%.
Earlier this month a Fox News poll had Trump’s rating at 43%. An Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey said his approval rating was just 36%. Monmouth has it at 40%.

Just six minutes later, Trump referenced his approval rating again, this time touting the 94% figure among Republican voters that apparently comes from internal polling he has tweeted about in the past.
Axios? Whatever that is. . .
Next on Trump’s hit list was a recent report by Axios that said the president suggested using nuclear weapons to stop hurricanes approaching the United States.
He had called the report “ridiculous” on Twitter earlier this week, but returned to Twitter Tuesday night.
More: Strengthening Tropical Storm Dorian threatens Puerto Rico, forecast to become a hurricane 'soon'
“Axios (whatever that is) sat back and said GEEEEE, let’s see what we can make up today to embarrass the President?” Trump tweeted. “Then they said, ‘why don’t we say he wants to bomb a hurricane, that should do it!’ The media in our Country is totally out of control!”
Though he bashed Axios’ prestige by claiming ignorance to its existence, Trump has notably interacted with the outlet before. It was an Axios reporter, Jonathan Swan, who last year conducted the filmed interview that broke news when Trump said he had a plan to end birthright citizenship.
Axios said it stands by its reporting.
Who exactly are Trump's 'Three Stooges?'
Add “Mr. Appalachian Trail” the list of nicknames Trump gives his opponents. Tuesday night Trump also blasted three of the Republicans who have either officially declared or said they are considering campaigns for the GOP primary nomination.
“Mr. Appalachian Trail” refers to former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who has said he will decide to run or not by Labor Day.
Sanford is known for a 2009 scandal in which he disappeared from the public for six days, supposedly to hike the Appalachian Trail. He turned out to be in Argentina having an affair.
More: Joe Walsh doubles down on Haiti comments after apologizing for past racist tweets
The second stooge is Joe Walsh, the former Illinois congressman who has criticized Trump on moral grounds but has a history of racist remarks, including ones that got him pulled off the air during his radio show. He announced his candidacy over the weekend.
Lastly, Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld reportedly collapsed during a 1996 commencement ceremony where he received an honorary degree. Weld has been in the race since declaring in April.
Bedbugs in the news
Trump chimed in on the unusually high volume of recent news reports about bedbugs.
"Tough guy!" Trump said of New York Times columnist Bret Stephens. Stephens deactivated his Twitter account after a wave of backlash against his reaction to being called a "bedbug" by a professor on Twitter. Stephens emailed the professor and the university's provost.
Trump said that Stephens is a "lightweight journalist" and "a Conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do!"
He also refuted reports that there were bedbugs at his resort in Doral, Fla. , where he wants to host next year's G-7 summit.

Trump is the 'best thing' for Puerto Rico
As Puerto Rico awaited Dorian, which has been classified as a hurricane, the island is prepared for the first major weather event since the deadly Hurricane Maria two years ago.
Meanwhile, Trump has said he is "the best thing that's ever happened to Puerto Rico" on Twitter and criticized its politicians.
San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz responded to Trump's false claims Tuesday that inflated the amount of relief aid that Congress approved for Puerto Rico. He said the figure was $92 billion when Congress has only approved $42 billion since 2017.

"Three thousand Puerto Ricans did not open their eyes this morning because this racist man did not have it within him to do his job, so get out of the way President Trump and let the people that can do the job get the job done," she said.
Fox News is no longer 'working for us'
Once again, Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to lambaste what was once his favored network, Fox News. He has recently bashed Fox after it released a poll that said Trump's approval rating was down.
"They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That's what I do, Win. Too Bad!" Trump tweeted.
He has also repeatedly criticized Fox News for bringing on Democratic consultant Donna Brazile.
"We have to start looking for a new News Outlet," Trump said.

Personal connection to slavery still induces anguish

Texto completo: My dad, who is 94, occupies his days touching up old family photos, doing research on the family tree and otherwise just taking life "one day at a time," as he likes to say.
Not long ago, he discovered that a maternal great-grandfather had come to South Carolina on a slave ship in 1822 and was later sold to a plantation owner in Mississippi. But he could not find where in Africa the man had come from, so he took one of those Ancestry DNA tests.
The results showed lots of DNA from the Congo and Cameroon, Dad said. And in a tone barely above a whisper, he added, "and a certain percentage that's British."
When I called to check up on him at his home in Shreveport, La., this past weekend, bells were being sounded here at Washington National Cathedral and at other churches throughout the country in remembrance of the first documented arrival of enslaved Africans in Virginia 400 years ago.
So we began what I figured would be just another chat about slavery and race.
Dad recalled that his paternal grandmother, who lived to be 108, had been born into slavery on a plantation in Mississippi and that he had met her. "She said it was true that landowners would take advantage of black women, force them to do whatever they wanted . . . "
He stopped mid-sentence and let out a sigh.
"Oh, my God, why do you have me telling you all this?" he asked, sounding exasperated. "I didn't intend to get into this. It's so depressing, every time I think about the kind of life that they had to live."
There was something in his voice - a weariness. Then he said, "I'm feeling sick to my stomach."
There have been some excellent reports on slavery recently in The Washington Post, the New York Times and USA Today, among other news organizations that have dug deep into the history and its impact on the country and the world. You can get insightful commentary on the subject by a new generation of black scholars, hear them on podcasts or see them on various television news shows.
But there is nothing quite like talking to a family member or someone else whose connection to the enslaved is not merely history. It should help us remember that slavery really wasn't that long ago, and that the dehumanization and exploitation of those of African descent continued long after the Emancipation Proclamation.
Talk of slavery, racism, Jim Crow has a visceral effect. I've seen it in the squint of my father's eyes, how his hands clench into fists, lips quiver. The stories will send chills down your spine.
Dad was born in 1924, in rural Crittenden County, Ark. Sheriff's deputies would arrest black men on trumped-up charges and hire them out to work in mines and in the fields. He saw a boy who had been accused of stealing a soda tied to a wagon and whipped by the sheriff while being dragged through the streets of the black community.
His father was a dentist. In 1935, sheriff's deputies entered the dental office and shot him to death for defying a racial code that prohibited black businesses from having white customers. White people suffering from toothaches wanted whatever dentist they could find. And his dad was killed for not turning them away, for taking payment that, according to white supremacist ideology, should have gone to a white dentist.
The murder of his father threw an upwardly mobile black family into poverty. But Dad persevered. Somehow he managed to put aside the hate and live with the sorrow. He finished high school in St. Louis, earned a bachelor's degree at Tuskegee Institute and a master's from the University of Minnesota.
He and Mom moved to Shreveport, where they worked as schoolteachers for more than 35 years. They also owned and operated a photographic studio and print shop for 45 years. They raised three kids, sent us all to college. Stayed married 64 years, until Mom's death in 2014.
The last thing I'd wanted was for my dad to have to dwell on the painful subject of slavery and its racist legacy. I wanted to put a bright spin on a remarkable family story. Less than 200 years after his great-grandfather arrived in chains, here he was: successfully retired, blessed with a sharp mind and long life. A nice home. Still driving a car. And both black and white people calling him 'sir' and holding the door open for him when he entered a building.
Some things had changed for the better, he said.
"But the Jews in Germany thought that, too," he noted. "Then Hitler showed up and everything changed overnight."
Now, in this country, he was seeing the same kind of racism that led to the creation of a system of enslavement. Self-avowed white supremacists have marched through the streets of several American cities and towns. The president has made statements that many of us now agree are racist. Others have tried to argue that they shouldn't be held responsible for slavery because they weren't alive.
But many of us have been alive throughout its legacy of Jim Crow laws, redlining, segregated schools and unequal treatment in the legal system. For those like my dad, that connection to our enslaved beginning is all too close. And as we talked about these things, he had one conclusion:
"I'm glad I'm on the other end of the life spectrum," Dad said, "because I don't want to go through that again."

MLK's iconic speech has been balled up and thrown away by Woke America

Texto completo: If Martin Luther King, Jr. were still alive, we wouldn’t have to speculate on how that great man, who rejected violence, would react to the palpable loathing coming from the mouths of today’s progressive Democrats. Even so, his own words offer clear evidence that he would reject their mindset wholeheartedly.
King’s 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech” was a message of aspiration — a “sunlit path of racial justice.”
The overarching theme to King’s Speech was that subliminal stimulus to look ahead, to be forward looking. “Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred," he said. He looked forward to the full grant to blacks of their God-given rights, and predicted that "men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, 'Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!'"
King's powerful words almost seem quaint and irrelevant to today’s hysterical Democrat culture warriors, who thirst for bitterness and hatred above all else.
The transcript of a recent New York Times staff meeting illustrates the point. The infamous front-page headline by the paper about President Trump's speech on the recent mass shootings read, “Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism.”
"Horrors!" said their faithful readers. Who wrote this? Every thinking American knows that Trump’s a racist. The hapless editor was demoted, which led to a meeting in which the executive editor posed the question: “How do you write about race in a thoughtful way?” The answer: The 1619 Project, the story of slavery in America in order to, as the editor put it, “understand the forces that led to the election of Donald Trump."
Really? Is this a joke? Explain Trump by revisiting slavery in Jamestown in A.D. 1619?
For the first two years of the Trump presidency, the New York Times cheered on Mueller, whom its editors presumably expected would set Trump up for impeachment. That failed. So now, for what they surely pray are the last two years of his presidency, they will revisit the history of slavery, starting with the colonies.
I presume they will include the Spanish, English, Dutch, French, in order to “discuss race in a thoughtful way.” They will not only demonstrate that “racism and white supremacy” were the “foundations of all the systems in our country,” but that Trump is perpetuating that legacy for African Americans, and while they’re at it, for Latinos and immigrants too.
John F. Kennedy was president when King gave his speech. Would the New York Times have embarked upon the 1619 project in 1963 in order to “understand the forces that lead up to his election?”
In his speech, King did not dwell on slavery as America’s original sin. He had written earlier on about the colonists' treatment of Native Americans, which preceded the practice of slavery. You can logically argue that colonization was the seminal moment for the origin of our country — as it was with all European countries which were exploring and colonizing the entire planet.
King did not decry the presence of the nearby Thomas Jefferson Memorial, nor even complain about Confederate monuments. He was, after all, a man on a mission, a visionary with the dream of racial justice, determined to achieve civil rights for African Americans. Monuments and slavery are the stuff of history lessons which should be taught but can no longer be experienced. King’s goal was current and achievable.
The New York Times editors have waxed eloquently over the years about how the lasting power of King’s “I Have a Dream” speech would capture the minds of Americans across generations. If so, why abandon King’s forward-looking and aspirational dream to drink from the cup of bitterness?
We all know the answer.

Texto completo: The New York Times found evidence of a possible bedbug infiltration throughout the newsroom of its New York City headquarters.
An email to employees said that there was evidence of the bloodsucking parasites in a wellness room, “on the second floor, a couch on the third floor and a booth on the fourth floor,” the internal email read. “Additionally, evidence of possible bedbug activity was found in a few personal lockers on the third floor.”
“These specific areas were then swept by professionals and found to be otherwise clean,” it continued. “In an abundance of caution, the second-floor room has been temporarily closed, the booth has been blocked off and the couch has been removed to be treated and professionally cleaned.”
Stuart Thompson, an editor at the newspaper, tweeted about the infestation after finding out about the loathsome pests.

Spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha confirmed in a statement to the Hill that the internal memo was accurate and emphasized that, “All affected areas have already been treated.”

"Lab Girl" tells the story of a young woman who finds friendship in odd places, battles bipolar disorder, perseveres through setbacks and becomes a respected scientist and passionate observer of the natural world. Jahren eventually earned a Ph.D. in soil science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1996 and now lives in Oslo, Norway. In 2016, "Lab Girl" was named a New York Times Notable Book and an Amazon Top 20 Best Book.

Texto completo: It looks like more carmakers are going to side with California in the standoff between President Trump and the Golden State over clean-car standards. That's good news for anyone who cares about breathing and not baking the planet.
Last month, Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW announced they will, in effect, ignore the Trump administration's plan to relax fuel economy and greenhouse-gas emissions standards. Instead, they reached a deal with California to voluntarily make their vehicles more fuel efficient.
The New York Times reported last week that Mercedes-Benz is preparing to join the California deal. Another unnamed auto manufacturing power is also planning to reject the Trump rollback and "stick to the current, stricter federal emissions standards for at least the next four years," according to The Times.
Neither company has announced that they are indeed bucking the Trump plan. But the president certainly thinks they're going to, if his tweet last Wednesday morning is any indication: "My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!"
The carmakers are foolish? While Trump is encouraging companies to keep pumping out gas guzzlers, many of the world's leading economies are demanding innovative clean-car technology. China, the world's largest auto market, plans to ban the sale of new vehicles powered by gasoline or diesel in the coming decades. France, Britain, Norway and India have also pledged to phase out fossil fuel vehicles. Clean cars are the future and Trump is clinging to a fossil fuel past.
As for the president's other assertions, they are just wrong.
Consumer Reports, the nonprofit consumer advocacy group, analyzed the Trump administration's proposal and found that the fuel economy rollback would cost consumers an average of $3,300 per vehicle in purchase price and gasoline usage. Academics have already debunked the idea that dirtier cars are somehow safer.
And the assertion that rolling back fuel economy standards will have "very little impact on the environment" is a dangerous lie.
The world is already feeling the effects of global warming in more extreme weather events, including prolonged droughts, endless wildfire seasons and unprecedented heat waves as well as severe hurricanes and floods. Cars and trucks are the nation's largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions. The U.S. cannot address climate change in a meaningful way without cleaner cars.
Nor can Southern California and other smoggy regions across the country clean up their dirty air without reducing vehicle emissions through the development of more zero- and near-zero emission cars. The clean-car standard is one of the federal government's most important environmental and public health policies. There's nothing foolish about automakers rejecting the Trump rollback.

Ex-Aide Is Called in Trump Inquiry

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee on Monday subpoenaed the former top White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's efforts to impede the Russia investigation and asked a court to expedite a ruling on whether Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, must testify, pushing forward in its expansive inquiry into whether to impeach Mr. Trump.
The moves are the latest intensification of a multipronged effort by the Democrat-led House to explore Mr. Trump's conduct in office with an eye toward determining if he obstructed justice and committed impeachable offenses. They unfolded as a growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers have come out over the past several weeks in favor of impeachment, and as the party's progressive base clamors for more aggressive action in the face of insistence by Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the move is premature.
Mr. Porter was a key witness to Mr. Trump's repeated attempts to thwart the special counsel's investigation, including the president's efforts to get Mr. McGahn to falsely deny a New York Times article that revealed his order to fire the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
The Judiciary Committee went to court this month to enforce its subpoena of Mr. McGahn after the Trump administration asserted that top presidential aides were "absolutely immune" from its subpoenas. In its legal filing on Monday, lawyers for the House argued that the former White House counsel was the "most critical fact witness" in the committee's examination of whether the president obstructed justice, including when he instructed Mr. McGahn to remove Mr. Mueller and then to lie about whether the president had done so, and later, to issue a statement lying publicly about it.
"We have made clear that Don McGahn's testimony is the most crucial because of his central role in witnessing the president's multiple acts of obstruction of justice," Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement about the legal filing, which characterizes as "urgent" the panel's need to hear from Mr. McGahn.
"McGahn's central role in these and other abuses described in the report make him the committee's most critical fact witness," lawyers for the House and the committee wrote in their filing. "He is uniquely positioned to explain what happened, bring any additional misconduct to light, and testify regarding the president's intent."
Mr. Porter, one of the highest-profile witnesses sought by the House, is referred to many times throughout the Mueller report's second volume, which focuses on obstruction of justice. Mr. Mueller declined to determine whether Mr. Trump criminally obstructed justice but suggested in his report that others could use the evidence he gathered to make that call.
"This will help the committee determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president or other Article I remedies," Mr. Nadler said in announcing the subpoena of Mr. Porter.
The White House is all but certain to try to keep Mr. Porter, a former aide in the Senate and to a federal judge, from complying with the order to appear on Capitol Hill, just as it has stonewalled previous attempts by the House to secure information from other top aides to Mr. Trump.
If he did speak publicly, Mr. Porter could most likely provide a rich account of Mr. Trump's conduct. His job as staff secretary, which included controlling every piece of official paper the president saw, entailed near-constant presence around Mr. Trump. He kept notes of his time at the White House, which the Mueller team referred to in footnotes of its report.
And unlike other witnesses that the judiciary panel has sought to compel to testify, such as Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director, and Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's first campaign manager, Mr. Porter was not an unquestioning Trump loyalist. He sometimes moved to prevent the president from taking actions that he considered ill advised or poorly considered, and made it his business to try to impose some order on a freewheeling West Wing led by a president who shunned policy deliberation and spoke openly with his staff about his whims.
In asking to speed up the resolution of Mr. McGahn's subpoena, Mr. Nadler was trying to remove an impediment to his committee's inquiry. But the move could also serve to reassure restive Democrats and activists that the elaborate legal strategy Democratic leaders are pursuing against Mr. Trump is progressing quickly, and that it should be allowed to run its course before any decision is made about whether to bring impeachment articles against him.

The real-time failure of democratic socialism

Texto completo: Harry Reid is starting to make sense.
I was afraid this day would come. Perhaps it’s an indication of the apocalypse or, at the very least, that multiple blows to the head, received during my less-than-stellar amateur athletic career, have finally caught up with me.
It’s amazing what a politician will say when he isn’t running for anything or trying to hold onto power. This is one reason (among many) that I favor term limits, which are about as realistic as an Uber to Mars.
Nevertheless, the former Senate Democratic leader has called out his party’s presidential candidates for their unrealistic solutions to intractable problems such as rising health care costs and immigration.
Reid recently told Vice that Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” plan is the wrong way to go on health care. He favors retooling “Obamacare.” He also took issue with the idea of decriminalizing illegal border crossings.
“People want a fair immigration system. They don’t want an open-door invitation for everybody to come at once,” Reid said.
Reid might have also added, but didn’t, that it would be nice if Democrats would come up with an economic policy that wasn’t hatched on the campus of Sherwood Forest University in the Robin Hood School of Economics.
“We will tax the hell out of the wealthy,” said Bill de Blasio, Democratic candidate for president. He’s also rumored to be mayor of New York City, but no one has seen him there recently.
I realize hating rich people and wanting to take their money and give it to someone else is in vogue right now, but it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.
If you are one of those “Stick-it-to-the-man!” proponents, you need to realize that you might actually be “the man” or “woman” or “person” one of these days.
The Democrats’ wish list of free stuff — health care for everyone, student loan forgiveness, college tuition, a guaranteed job — would total about $41 trillion. As Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute wrote in December, the math doesn’t work. Even if you took every penny from the top 1%, you wouldn’t fund a “Medicare for All” program. And doubling the top tax brackets (from 35% and 37% to 70% and 74%) “would close just one-fifth of the long-term Social Security and Medicare shortfall. Even seizing all annual income earned over $500,000 would not come close.”
What all that means is the middle class will eventually bear the burden of these government giveaways. If you didn’t consider yourself wealthy before, congratulations.
This isn’t about “fairness,” either. “The top-earning 20% of taxpayers earn 53% of the income, yet pay 69% of all federal taxes, including 88% of all income taxes,” Riedl wrote, based on numbers from the Congressional Budget Office.
So, the idea that the rich will fund the democratic socialist agenda is either a leftist fantasy or an outright lie. Of course, when you don’t have any serious ideas that don’t involve a massive redistribution of wealth, fantasies and lies will do nicely.
The odd thing is progressives continue to push these policies despite the fact that we can all see they don’t work.
California, for example, long under Democratic control, has become exactly what progressives claim to abhor — a place where only the super wealthy thrive.
“The annual household income necessary to buy a median-priced home now tops $320,000,” wrote New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo in May. “Yet the streets there are a plague of garbage and needles and feces, and every morning brings fresh horror stories from a ‘Black Mirror’ hellscape: Homeless veterans are surviving on an economy of trash from billionaires’ mansions.”
There is a serious shortage of affordable housing in California. Yet, the Democratic Legislature doesn’t seem to have the stomach to do anything about it, which Manjoo calls “another chapter in a dismal saga of Nimbyist urban mismanagement that is crushing American cities.”
“Not-in-my-backyardism is a bipartisan sentiment,” he wrote, “but because the largest American cities are populated and run by Democrats — many in states under complete Democratic control — this sort of nakedly exclusionary urban restrictionism is a particular shame of the left.”
It’s a searing indictment of ultra-progressivism. but for those who think he’s wrong, the evidence suggests otherwise.
You might have heard about California liberals wanting to secede from the United States.
There are a lot of reasons why they won’t be going anywhere anytime soon.
Mainly, they won’t be able to afford the gas.

Texto completo: Americans don’t think enough about slavery? Seriously? As a frequent visitor to your country, I’d argue that you think of little else.
There has been a great fuss about the 1619 Project, an initiative led by the New York Times aimed at making slavery the basis of America’s collective memory. 1619 was the year that the first kidnapped Africans were sold in Virginia, beginning a sordid story that was to last two-and-a-half centuries.
All nations have their shameful episodes, and it is right to face up to them. But where on Earth does the New York Times get the impression that slavery is being overlooked? It dominates high school history lessons. It is the ultimate cause of the race-fixation in universities. Hollywood obsesses over it.
Think of the movies that have come out over the past decade: Django Unchained, 12 Years a Slave, Free State of Jones. None of these films are patronizing; none commits the “white savior” heresy. To see how attitudes have changed, compare the 2016 film The Birth of a Nation, about a doomed slave rising, with the 1915 film whose title it deliberately recalled. The earlier movie, a silent epic which employed revolutionary cinematographic techniques, portrayed black men (often played by white actors) as leering oafs, and so lionized the Ku Klux Klan that its release led directly to that maligned organization’s revival. Watch those two movies, separated by a hundred years, and then tell me that there has not been a revolution in how the United States remembers the peculiar institution.
It is true, of course, that slavery is an unpleasant subject. No one likes to dwell on the horrors it involved: casual torture, sexual abuse, and the sundering of families. In the decades that followed abolition, white Americans understandably preferred to talk about more cheerful aspects of the story, such as the struggle for abolition and the outcome of the Civil War.
But that was then. These days, slavery is held up as the Republic’s "Original Sin," and its taint is carried by every white American. As Nikole Hannah-Jones put it at the launch of the 1619 Project, “This anniversary is why we even exist as a country.”
Politics, as Andrew Breitbart used to say, is downstream of culture. Look at the kids who have been most influenced by contemporary teaching and movies. Young white Americans have become the first group in the history of polling to display pro-outgroup bias — that is, to sympathize more with other ethnicities over their own. A research project carried out last year showed that white liberals are well to the left of non-whites on immigration, and more likely to think that racial disparity is a problem that demands state intervention.
Why? Because of a notion that contradicts modern values, but that chimes with human intuitions — namely, collective guilt. Standing behind every form of affirmative action is the idea that, because Group A exploited Group B at some moment in the past, there is now an inherited debt that binds people who were not alive at that time. This is, on the surface, a deeply illiberal concept. Collective punishments are banned under the Geneva Convention.
Yet on some deep genetic level, we are programmed to think tribally. The morality of the Old Testament, in which whole nations are raised or razed, speaks to an older part of our brains. Never mind the details. Never mind that, say, an Italian-American is less likely to have recent slave-owning ancestors than an African-American. Never mind that, if you go back far enough, we are all descended from both slavers and slaves. Never mind that there was nothing unusual about American slavery — abolition came later than most of Europe, earlier than most of Arabia and Africa, and roughly in the middle for the Americas. As long as you start from the assumption that everything is about race, you will find ways to reason away each objection.
Yet the 1619 Project’s premise is false. Slavery is not “why we even exist as a country”. The United States exists because of the ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. True, those ideals took a long time to be realized. But it was the founding documents that created the moral framework which allowed those shortcomings to be identified and, in time, corrected. When Frederick Douglass asked “What to the slave is the fourth of July?” he wasn’t appealing to abstract justice, but to the specific values enshrined by the Founders. When Martin Luther King appealed to America to live up to its promise, he was invoking precisely the American ideals now being derided.
America is built on the premise that individuals are equal before the law and responsible for their own actions. Replace that concept with collective identity, and America ceases to be America. It is that simple.

What Margaret Chase Smith's ouster could mean for Susan Collins

Texto completo: SKOWHEGAN, Maine -- There was a time when it seemed unlikely that a titan of Maine politics could be taken down in a bid for a fifth term in the U.S. Senate by a quick-rising, progressive Maine transplant.
It happened in 1972, when Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, the Skowhegan native and the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress and be nominated for the presidency at a major-party convention just eight years earlier, was upset by then-U.S. Rep. William Hathaway.
In 2020, Sen. Susan Collins could win a fifth term, surpassing the Senate service of Smith, her political role model. The Republican's seat has been targeted by national Democrats with five challengers, including Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon vying for the nomination to face her.
Collins faces a much different campaign than the one in 1972. She is a more vigorous campaigner than Smith and will be seven years younger than she was. If Collins runs, she will also face a more partisan environment on the 2020 ballot alongside President Donald Trump, whom Democrats are racing to tie her to and is likely to be unpopular statewide.
Still, the 1972 election showed Maine that political icons can be soundly defeated. Here are key factors of the race 47 years ago, with the help of documents held by the Margaret Chase Smith Library in Skowhegan.
Smith campaigned the same way she always did, refusing to raise money and limiting her travel. Federal candidates spent $425 million in 1972, according to a book co-written by a Colby College professor. When adjusted for inflation, that isn't much different than the $3.1 billion pegged by the Center for Responsive Politics in 2016, though that race included another $1.7 billion from outside groups.
Smith was behind the time 1972, when polling and TV ads were emerging in state races. She ran on her record with help from dedicated volunteers. She never took campaign contributions, calling the level of campaign spending "disgraceful" in a debate with Hathaway, a World War II veteran who came to Maine from Massachusetts after law school and served four House terms.
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5U3sDOnt2cg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen height="315" width="560"]
Her primary challenger spent $375,000 while only winning a third of votes. In a letter to supporters, Smith said her volunteers showed "the Maine way is reassuringly different" and "we will not lose our separate identity" en route to the general election. It didn't work again.
Hathaway spent $198,000 on a modern general election campaign that used TV and had a $59,000 advertising budget alone. Smith spent just $14,000 combined in both races and all of her money came from Senate Republicans' campaign arm, not even using their entire contribution to her primary effort.
The run-up to her run was difficult. William Lewis, her chief aide whom reporter Don Larrabee of the Portland Press Herald called Smith's "alter ego" had a heart attack in late 1971. Smith -- who had set a record for consecutive votes -- missed several votes to stay at his bedside.
Otherwise, Smith didn't believe in missing Senate votes to campaign. She limited herself largely to weekend campaigning while Hathaway barnstormed the state. A 2019 Liberty University thesis said many young people had less affinity for Smith than their parents did.
"[Hathaway] was everywhere and it was so much more noticeable because she just wasn't there at all," said Bob Tyrer, who ran Collins' first Senate campaign in 1996 and entered Maine politics in the 1970s as a staffer for former U.S. Sen. Bill Cohen.
Smith faced a primary establishing largely nonpartisan criticisms that plagued her through Election Day. Smith was 74 years old in 1972. Her primary challenger, businessman Robert A.G. Monks, was about half her age and traveled across Maine for more than a year before declaring. U.S. Sen. Angus King, a Hathaway aide, once told an interviewer Smith later confided to him she hadn't planned to run again, but did because Monks irritated her.
Monks was aggressive. As part of his high-dollar campaign, he often noted Smith's age and hit her for not maintaining an office in Maine. The Bangor Daily News quoted him as saying the time she could enjoy her Senate seniority -- which Smith often touted as Collins is -- was "up to God." This manifested itself in other ways.
Dale Whitaker, who chaired Smith's campaign in Auburn, said the 1972 Republican State Convention was marked by an episode in which a wheelchair was left by an entrance to the Augusta Armory with a sign that said "for Margaret Chase Smith."
Smith had used a wheelchair around the time of hip surgery in 1968, but she was moving well again by this time. Whitaker said the wheelchair still caused confusion as Smith loyalists scrambled to see if she had requested it. It was left there for a while in case she needed it.
"To this day, I'm still bellyaching about that damn wheelchair," Whitaker said.
In the general election, Hathaway picked up the age issue in a lower-key way by pushing a mandatory retirement age of 70 for members of Congress and term limits. But there was a strong sense that the real damage had already been done by Monks.
"He softened her up and Bill Hathaway really came across as a young statesman," said Severin Beliveau, a lobbyist who chaired the Maine Democratic Party at the time.
Smith lost with a popular Republican president on the ballot. Hathaway beat Smith in 1972 by a difference of 6.5 percentage points, even though Smith ran alongside Republican President Richard Nixon, who won every state but one in 1972 and got 61 percent of votes in Maine.
Smith, best known for her 1950 "Declaration of Conscience" speech against McCarthyism, had frustrated Nixon early in his first term by opposing two failed U.S. Supreme Court nominees. But she was also a foreign policy hawk who supported him on issues including the Vietnam War. A 1970 episode helped frame her as out-of-touch among young liberal voters.
She appeared at Colby College to address anti-war students and defended the Nixon administration on the war -- as retold by The New York Times -- including its assertion that no troops had been sent to neighboring Laos. Brownie Carson, a Bowdoin College student who was wounded as a Marine in Laos and is now a Democratic state senator, rose to challenge her.
Hathaway, who was liberal for his party, was anti-war when it wasn't a slam-dunk issue in Maine. Nixon began his second term with a 67 percent Gallup approval rating that quickly declined as knowledge of the Watergate scandal increased ahead of his 1974 resignation. Trump is at 41 percent approval and Morning Consult found him 13 percentage points underwater here in the year's second quarter.
Nixon supported Smith going back to her primary. After she beat Monks, Smith told reporters that he called her to say while he "usually runs on people's coattails but perhaps in my case he will ride in on my slip." She introduced Vice President Spiro Agnew at the state convention.
After Election Day, Whitaker, who called himself a moderate Democrat and joined Smith's campaign because he saw her as being "above politics," said he was "astonished" at Smith's loss because Republican otherwise won down the ballot to the local offices in his area.
In a letter to a Smith supporter, Lewis had many grievances, including "severely condemnatory and erroneous news articles" and "voter rejection for being too old." For Smith's part, she released a terse statement the day after the election congratulating Hathaway and saying she was grateful to the Mainers she served.
"I am even more grateful to my loyal supporters who worked their hearts out for me," she concluded. "I regret having let them down."

Group wants lynching marker

Texto completo: It was 1897 in St. Johns County when a mob hanged Isaac Barrett from a tree near the St. Johns River.

Barrett was accused of severely beating the man he worked for and the man's family, and two people died. He was arrested and was being taken to the county judge when the mob took him, The New York Times reported.

Barrett signed a confession after he was captured by the mob. But, as was the case with other African-Americans in that era, whether he was truly guilty will never be known because he never made it to court, said Gayle Phillips, who wants Barrett's story to be told.

Phillips, director of the Lincolnville Museum and Cultural Center, and others in the community want a marker about the lynching of Isaac Barrett to be placed in St. Augustine's Plaza de la Constitucion.

"I think it is a great opportunity for the city to own up to its past," she said.

The City Commission is expected to consider the proposal Monday. City regulations limit the subject of new markers in the Plaza to significant events that happened before Feb. 22, 1981, or to people who participated in the civil rights movement.

Phillips said she sees Barrett's story as part of the civil rights struggle.

According to the application materials filed by Phillips, the marker would highlight an era of "vigilante justice which led to the lack of due process for thousands of citizens who were wrongfully accused and subjected to mob rule without as much as a public hearing before a court of law."

It would help heal race relations in addition to providing education, according to her application.

Phillips is part of the local committee that has organized the local marker effort. The committee is part of the Community Remembrance Project by the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit focused on fighting injustice and mass incarceration. The project highlights racial injustice, in part by having markers erected to remember lynching victims.

One effort of the nonprofit organization "documented more than 4,400 racial terror lynchings in 12 Southern states -- and more than 300 in eight states outside the South -- between the end of Reconstruction in 1877 and 1950," according to the EJI website.

In 2018 in advance of a ceremony, the nonprofit and members of the community placed a different Barrett marker close to where he was killed off State Road 13. But the marker went missing shortly after that, forcing the group to erect a temporary sign for its ceremony.

The Equal Justice Initiative provided a new marker, and community members developed a new plan. The Plaza was chosen because of its security, prominence and history -- civil rights demonstrations and racial violence took place there, and slaves were whipped, bought and sold there, according to a letter to city commissioners from the local committee.

The letter reads: "There is no place in the city of St. Augustine that brings our community together like the Plaza de la Constitucion. ... What better place to proclaim our acknowledgement of a darker time in our civil rights history while celebrating a unified message of ‘never again?'"

Evan Milligan, Equal Justice Initiative program manager, sent a letter to commissioners about the proposal for the Plaza. He wrote that public markers can help spark conversations that educate and empower people in the community.

"We believe the process of memorializing victims long ignored by history is most appropriate when it unfolds in public spaces, as racial terrorism was specifically facilitated in public spaces and was often ignored by public institutions charged with preventing or investigating these acts," he wrote.

The application to the Commission says the community needs healing in race relations.

Jaime Perkins, a former candidate for Florida House District 17 and a West Augustine resident, said in a previous interview she has never felt totally comfortable coming downtown. She has experienced racial discrimination in the city, she said.

Perkins, who has attended some meetings related to the Barrett marker, said she supports the effort to put the marker in the Plaza.

"No matter how dark and ugly, it is a part of the history ... and the story needs to be told," she said.

Texto completo: The Supreme Court ruled in June that federal courts are closed to claims of partisan gerrymandering. But never fear, Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority: "numerous [states] are restricting partisan considerations in districting through legislation," either by legislative enactment or ballot initiative.
That alternative method to solve the problem is no saving grace. Many states simply do not allow ballot initiatives. In others, entrenched politicians will not give up their power easily.
Consider what happened this month in New Hampshire. The New Hampshire legislature passed a bipartisan bill that would have created an independent redistricting commission for the state. But Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, vetoed the bill, an act that was fundamentally anti-democracy.
Mr. Sununu's veto was a pure power grab and nothing more. New Hampshire, like most other states, allows its legislature to redraw district lines for the state legislature and Congress after each census, which occurs every 10 years.
The New Hampshire proposal would have taken much of that power away from the legislators. Instead, the law would have created a 15-member advisory commission comprised of five Democrats, five Republicans and five unaffiliated individuals. The selection process for these commissioners was eminently fair, with each side essentially allowed to choose commissioners nominated by the other party; the 10 chosen partisan commissioners would select the remaining five unaffiliated commissioners.
The commission would meet and redraw district lines using a set of criteria that emphasized fairness to all constituents. At least nine of the 15 commissioners would have to approve a map, ensuring that no one political party could control the outcome. The state legislature would then have the final say on adopting the new maps.
Mr. Sununu wanted no part of this fair process, even though the proposed law passed the state House by a vote of 218 to 123 and passed the state Senate through a voice vote - meaning that members of both parties supported the measure.
Yet what's perhaps most confounding about Mr. Sununu's veto is that Democrats, not Republicans, are in the majority in the New Hampshire legislature. Democrats, therefore, supported a measure that went against their own self-interest and would likely reduce their power in the future. Democrats - and many Republicans - instead put country over party and democracy over self-interest in supporting the commission. Mr. Sununu wanted none of it.
The brazen political move is in line with similar Republican efforts to thwart other independent redistricting commissions. Republicans in Michigan are (again) challenging that state's new redistricting commission, passed overwhelmingly by the voters in 2018.
The public overwhelmingly opposes partisan gerrymandering and overwhelmingly supports independent redistricting commissions. That's why voters have waged a grass-roots movement to sustain our democracy.
The pushback to independent redistricting commissions in New Hampshire and other states shows the folly in Justice Roberts' salvo that all is not lost because states can enact their own meaningful reforms to combat partisan gerrymandering. They can't do so when self-serving politicians stand in the way.
The voice of voters, not entrenched politicians, must win the day. We must all demand it - with our voices, and when necessary, our votes.
Joshua A. Douglas is a law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law. He wrote this for The Washington Post.

The week in watching: Surrendering to the 'Breaking Bad' sequel, vacuous VMAs, and Disney+ goes old school

Texto completo: Your TV GPS, Globe critic Matthew Gilbert's guide to what's on television, appears at the beginning of each week at BostonGlobe.com. Today's column covers Aug. 26-Sept. 1.
FAREWELL TO ENDINGS
I guess I'm evolving. For a long, long time, I was inclined to dislike prequel, sequel, and revival series, simply because they are so often created to milk the financial potential of the source material. Generally, the sequel or prequel didn't need to be written; the story did not need to be told. But the show was made anyway, as a kind of fan service.
I have one title for you: “AfterMASH." And I have another: “The Carrie Diaries."
But it seems as though reboot fever isn't a fever anymore. It's just the way TV and the rest of pop culture operate now. Shows never really end; they just return to TV in different iterations, with no particular shame attached to them. That's the way it is, from the lousy shows to the good ones.
“Breaking Bad" is on my mind. One of the finest TV dramas of all time has spawned a beloved prequel series, “Better Call Saul," and, coming to Netflix on Oct. 11, a sequel movie called “El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie."
The sequel movie, written and directed by “Breaking Bad" creator Vince Gilligan, is about Jesse Pinkman right after the events of the (supposed) series finale. Here's the Netflix summary: “In the wake of his dramatic escape from captivity, Jesse must come to terms with his past in order to forge some kind of future." There's no word yet on whether other “Breaking Bad" characters, including those played by Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, or Bryan Cranston, will appear in the movie. “All I can say, I think people will be really happy with what they see," Paul told the New York Times.
Meanwhile, a prequel series to another one of TV's best-ever dramas, “The Sopranos," is also on the way — in this case, to movie theaters. Called “The Many Saints of Newark," and set in the 1960s, it will be released in September 2020. And then the “Downton Abbey" movie will be in theaters on Sept. 20.
Next thing you know, we'll be hearing about a sequel series to that other great modern drama series, “Mad Men," called “Sally!" or “Blankenship: The Early Years," or “Not Great, Bob: A Pete Campbell Mystery."
So I'm going to stop with the stink eye when I watch these revisitations. It's time for me to drop my bias. I hereby swear that I will no longer automatically look down on a show or movie sequel, prequel, or revival. I will no longer presume that the end is really the end.
WHAT I'M WATCHING THIS WEEK
1. Most awards shows double as product pushers. Yes, sure, such and such an organization is honoring those who contribute to the art of such and such. On that level, it is about merit and vision and blah-bedy-blah-blah-bloh. But for the most part, they are amazing promotional opportunities, where industry people get to sell their movies and albums and TV shows and where stars get to expand their brands. And no awards show is more purely promotional than the “MTV Video Music Awards," which airs on Monday at 8 p.m. on MTV and VH1 (the MTV preshow is at 7). Comic Sebastian Maniscalco is hosting from Newark's Prudential Center, with performers including Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Lizzo, H.E.R., Jonas Brothers, and Shawn Mendes.
2. “Dave Chappelle: Sticks and Stones" is the latest release in Netflix's never-ending stream of stand-up specials. The comedian takes on gun culture and celebrity scandals in his Atlanta set, which will be released on Monday. It's Chappelle's fifth Netflix special, and it arrives two months before he will be honored with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.
3. Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne costar in a new Amazon series called “Carnival Row," due Friday. It's a Victorian fantasy world filled with mythological immigrant creatures who are controlled out of public fear. Hmm. Sounds very allegorical. Bloom is a human detective, and Delevingne is a fairy, and I am so totally going to watch the first episode out of obligation but I don't feel optimistic.
4. The first season of the dark fantasy series “The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance" is available on Netflix Friday. It's a prequel show to the 1982 Jim Henson/Frank Oz movie “The Dark Crystal," with power-hungry overlords on the planet Thra. The voices behind the puppets are pretty impressive. Here are some of them: Alicia Vikander, Andy Samberg, Awkwafina, Harvey Fierstein, Helena Bonham Carter, Keegan-Michael Key, Lena Headey, Mark Hamill, and Sigourney Weaver.
5. “Suits" is in the middle of its final season, and USA is going to re-air the show's pilot on Wednesday at 9 p.m. featuring special cast interviews. Why? Well to bring fans back to where it all started, of course. Oh yeah, and to maybe bring in some lookyloos who remember that Meghan Markle is in the pilot.
6. It got mixed reviews when it aired in the U.K. in 2016-17, but Ovation is bringing us Rowan Atkinson's take on George Simenon's detective “Maigret" nonetheless. The channel will air two two-episode seasons of the mystery series in the coming weeks, set in 1950s Paris, with Fiona Shaw, Lucy Cohu, and Shaun Dingwall also in the cast. Mr. Bean with a pipe premieres Sunday at 7 p.m.
CHANNEL SURFING
“Falling Inn Love"
A romantic comedy starring Christina Milian and Adam Demos. Netflix, Thursday
“Jay Leno's Garage"
The show returns with guest Kevin Hart. CNBC, Wednesday, 10 p.m.
“Styling Hollywood"
In this new series, Jason Bolden and Adair Curtis of JSN Studio connect famous clientele with the chic-est looks. Neflix, Friday
“What Just Happened??!"
Fred Savage's pretend aftershow ends its first season. Fox, Sunday, 9:30 p.m.
DISNEY+ VS. Binge-Watching
Disney+ is coming at us fast. The new streaming service is set to launch on Nov. 12, with all kinds of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and 20th Century Fox goodies.
There will also be original Disney+ series ready at the launch, including “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series," a deep dive into Meta-ville that follows a group of students getting ready for their school's production of “High School Musical," and “The Mandalorian," the first live-action “Star Wars" TV series, set after the fall of the Empire and before the emergence of the First Order. Also ready on Nov. 12: The nonfiction series “The World According to Jeff Goldblum" and “Encore," on which Kristen Bell reunites castmates from high school musicals.
Here's the thing: Disney+ is going to release episodes of its new shows weekly. The service will make only one episode available per week, flying in the face of the trend toward season-binging. Sure, if you wait until the entire season airs, you can go back and binge your heart out. But initially, you'll need to wait seven days in between each episode.
I'm a little surprised, since viewers don't tend to want to wait; waiting is so old school. So is savoring episodes. It's all about speed. And I'm a little pleased, because I prefer the weekly model, especially when it comes to dramas. I like to let each episode breathe before rushing into the next.

Former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh announces he will challenge Trump in Republican primary

Texto completo: Former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh announced on Sunday that he will run against Donald Trump in the Republican primary for president.
The conservative talk show host said on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos" that he's running because Trump is "unfit" and "somebody needs to step up. "
His announcement comes after an op-ed in The New York Times in which Walsh said a Republican should challenge Trump “from the right. ” He said Trump “can’t be trusted. ”
“The fact is, Mr. Trump is a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base and advance his electoral prospects,” Walsh wrote.
Walsh, who notably was backed by the Tea Party during his run for office, floated the idea of taking on Trump last week, saying he was “strongly, strongly considering it. ”
More: Joe Walsh and the other Republicans who may challenge Trump in the 2020 primaries
Walsh has outspokenly opposed Trump, and he has criticized Trump's relationship with Russia. More recently, he denounced Trump after he tweeted that Democratic congresswomen of color should "go back" to their countries of origin, which prompted chants of "send her back" at a Trump rally.
Calling Trump “a child,” Walsh said Sunday that the country is sick of Trump's lying.
“Look at what’s happened this week. The president of the United States is tweeting us into a recession," Walsh said.
Walsh claimed that most of his Republican colleagues privately agree with his opinions of Trump but are too afraid to speak out against him.
“And it stuns me that nobody stepped up, nobody in the Republican Party stepped up, because I’ll tell you what, George, everybody believes, in the Republican Party, everybody believes that he’s unfit," Walsh said.
Walsh announced his campaign on Twitter Sunday morning, saying “It won’t be easy, but bravery is never easy. ”
ABC News’ Jonathan Carl said on the show that the Trump campaign’s only response thus far to Walsh’s challenge is one word: “Whatever. ”
Walsh joins former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who Walsh wrote is challenging Trump “from the center,” in the primary against Trump.

Ex-Congressman Joe Walsh Begins Republican Campaign Against Trump; Former GOP lawmaker begins long-shot challenge to president from the right

Texto completo: Former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh launched a long-shot Republican presidential campaign on Sunday, casting the current occupant of the White House as a failed leader.
"Donald Trump doesn't represent us—he represents the worst of us," Mr. Walsh said in a statement on his website. "He hasn't delivered on his promises, he thinks he's above the law, and he's tweeting us into a recession, as we speak."
Mr. Walsh, 57 years old, entered Congress in the Tea Party wave of 2010 when Republicans took over the House of Representatives. He served just one term representing Illinois, losing in 2012 to Democrat Tammy Duckworth.
He then became a radio host and Trump supporter before turning against the president. He has long history of controversial comments, including suggesting wrongly that President Obama is Muslim. Mr. Walsh expressed regret for those remarks in a New York Times opinion piece this month.
In that piece , he positioned himself to the right of Mr. Trump, raising concerns about growing budget deficits.
William Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, is also running against Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination, but he has gotten little attention. Other figures are considering potential runs, including former South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran for the GOP nomination in 2016.
Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" Sunday, Mr. Weld said he welcomed other challengers to Trump. He also said that he believed that in a second term, Mr. Trump would focus on doing exactly what former presidential aide Steve Bannon has posited: Punish his enemies.
"[F]our years of unadulterated, unrequited payback," Mr. Weld said. "It's another example of his extreme malignant narcissism. He's only happy when other people are losing."
The challengers face tough odds, because the president controls the party machinery and continues to have most of its voters lining up behind him. According to a Monmouth University poll this month, 84% of Republicans approve of Mr. Trump's job performance with just 11% opposed. And 79% of Republican registered voters say Mr. Trump deserves to be re-elected.
Mr. Trump also enjoys a huge fundraising advantage. His re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $105 million alone in the second quarter of this year, exceeding what President Obama raised at the same time heading into his second election.
None of the past three presidents who sought a second term faced serious intraparty challenges.
Republican Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush each defeated primary challengers before losing re-election. In 1968, facing Democratic opponents, President Lyndon Johnson chose not to seek another term.
Mr. Trump's campaign brushed off Mr. Walsh's announcement. "Whatever," said campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh.

Texto completo: It used to be almost gauche to complain about too many tourists. It showed a lack of graciousness, a shameful unwillingness to share, perhaps a touch of xenophobia in the disapproval of the outside world invading Hawaii’s insular ways. Of course, just about everyone did complain about tourism’s imposition on island life, but only in the car with family when the clueless driver of a rented convertible tried to course-correct too late after missing a turn, or when a favorite restaurant suddenly sprouted a long line of people in garish polyester “Hawaiian shirts” crowding the entrance.
Irritation has grown as visitor numbers have grown.
One of the many ways Hawaii is changing is that talking about overtourism is now beyond the realm of private grumbling and has entered public forums. This is true all over the globe as the age of air travel and cheap adventures strains and tramples quaint villages and historic sites just about everywhere.
It is especially true in Hawaii, where for generations it has been drilled into island residents that we are a supremely generous people willing to give the best of what we have to total strangers, but now residents are demanding something be done to stop the madness.
The Maui County Council is now talking about overtourism and actually saying, out loud and in a open meeting, that action has to be taken — not more studies, but real action — to right-size the number of visitors who descend upon the island. At times last year, there was one tourist on Maui for every 2.4 residents.
The Kauai County leaders have been talking about the impact of tourism on Kauai, specifically the island’s North Shore, which, during the long recovery from the devastating flood last year, discovered how peaceful it can be when there aren’t thousands of tourists choking up the roads and spoiling unspoiled places every day.
The New York Times recently ran a piece with the headline “Overtourism worries Europe” that included this big-picture description:
“Every summer, the most popular European destinations get stuffed to the gills with tourists, who outnumber locals by many multiples, turning hot spots into sweaty, selfie-stick-clogged, Disneyfied towns … This growth might once have been considered unambiguously good news. But the world’s most popular destinations cannot expand to accommodate an infinite flood of visitors. Advocates of curbing tourism say too many visitors are altering the character of historic cities, and making travel terrible, too.”
The story describes places around Europe all but ruined by tourism and for every international example, there is a local situation to match.
The gap between the number of people who vacation in Hawaii and the amount of money they spend during their time here has widened, but the fix to this economic challenge is not to bring in more tourists.
The tourism industry has been Hawaii’s economic engine for decades, but the old rules no longer apply. The goal can’t be to increase arrival numbers year after year.

Texto completo: If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way from former President Barack and former first lady Michelle Obama's new production company.
The Obamas launched Higher Ground Productions last spring in partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would "harness the power of storytelling" and touch on "issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more."
"American Factory," the first title from Higher Ground, is available now on the streaming service. It manages to make good on the Obamas' pledge, which is a promising sign for what's to come.
The documentary, which won a directing award this year at the Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of a Chinese billionaire who opens a glass factory in a former General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, and hires both American and Chinese workers. The film looks at how their cultures clash (with the Chinese workers getting lessons in how Americans are overconfident and need to be praised), how the workers are taken advantage of by management (they're convinced not to join a union for the security of their jobs) and how automation could take many of their jobs.
Through the emotional stories of some of the workers, and even the billionaire chairman himself, the documentary winds up being funny, shocking, upsetting and eye-opening. The film works well without a central narrator, allowing the people themselves to tell their stories. There also plenty of How did they get that?! insider footage, courtesy of Dayton-based co-filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar.
At almost two hours, the documentary doesn't drag. Instead, it sets an impressive precedent for the Obamas' forthcoming projects.
What else does Higher Ground have in the works?
Here's what's planned so far:
A drama series about the fashion world: "Bloom" will show the struggles faced by women of color in post-World War II New York. It's written and produced by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri ("Thelma & Louise").
A biopic about Frederick Douglass: Higher Ground plans to adapt the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom" into a movie about the abolitionist and statesman who was born into slavery.
An anthology series about unnoticed deaths: "Overlooked" will be a scripted show adapted from The New York Times' column of the same name that looks to correct the issue of obituaries primarily being written about white men.
A traveling kids' food show: "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents" is a half-hour preschool series from creators Jeremy Konner ("Drunk History") and Erika Thormahlen that will tell the story of food.
A Michael Lewis nonfiction series: The show will be based on "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," the book by the best-selling "Moneyball" and "The Big Short" writer about everyday heroes safeguarding the nation.
A documentary about camp for disabled teenagers: "Crip Camp" will tell the story of how a ramshackle summer camp down the road from Woodstock transformed young lives in the early '70s.

Texto completo: "I like working with tiny little boxes, and it's almost like a puzzle when it fits exactly into that space."
Marie Kondo
Our series "How I became a ..." digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
From becoming fascinated with the art of tidying at the age of 5 to starting her own organizing business as a university student in Japan, Marie Kondo and her approach to tidying has sparked joy in people all across the globe. Her New York Times bestseller "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" helped Kondo share her lessons with the world, and her Netflix original series "Tidying Up With Marie Kondo" is up for two Emmy Awards.
USA TODAY caught up with Kondo to talk about everything from the happiness she gets from organizing items into tiny boxes to producing her own television show for Netflix.
Question: How did you get your start?
Marie Kondo: When it comes to tidying, I was interested in tidying ever since I was 5 years old, and by the time I entered middle school, I dove into researching tidying. I was 19 years old when I became a professional organizing consultant. One of my hobbies when I was in college was to go tidy my friends' homes, and the word-of-mouth quickly spread that when Marie comes to visit your home, your home becomes incredibly tidy.
When I began my organizing consulting business, the wait list became half a year long, so I received a request from one of my clients that they wanted to read my lessons in book form, (and) that was how the book came to be.
Q: How has your career changed since?
Kondo: What I do to impart what I know about tidying hasn't changed at all. But I've always mainly worked in Japan before – now, I have a lot of TV appearances, and the scale of my lectures and presentations I give certainly have changed. I also work predominantly in the U.S. now, so it's changed quite a bit.
Q: What does a typical workday look like for you?
Kondo: For today, for instance, I'm writing a new book, so sometimes I do that. I also create videos related to my tidying lessons, and for Japan I have a Japan exclusive online service, so I have to write content for that. Very full days.
Q: What is your favorite thing about your job?
Kondo: I love creating storage. I like working with tiny little boxes, and it's almost like a puzzle when it fits exactly into that space – my client's space – that we're working with. It feels so great.
Q: To what do you credit your success?
Kondo: I think I credit that to my home is tidy, but my decision-making skills are very tidy. I always feel like I'm attuned to what I need to be doing at that particular moment.
Q: How do you balance work, life and such a busy schedule?
Kondo: I wonder (laughs). In terms of balance, I always try to carve out a time that sparks joy for me, whether that is a time for reflection or relaxing and playing with my children. I make sure that I save that time so that I can always maintain myself to be at 100%, and then I try to think how to conduct my schedule in a most effective way.
Q: What have been some of your career highlights?
Kondo: Producing my own TV show for Netflix – it's been amazing.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Kondo: To put it succinctly, I would to say to trust in what sparks joy for you. Trust in your own sense of what sparks joy for you.

A rock star in tech, dimmed by ties to Epstein

Texto completo: In the world of robots, high-tech gadgets, and Internet startups, Joi Ito is a star. As the head of the freewheeling MIT Media Lab, he oversees an eclectic band of computer scientists, artists, engineers, and architects who tinker on the far edges of innovation in a place commonly known as the “future factory."
Ito has spoken at the Davos World Economic Forum and hosted Silicon Valley royalty and Hollywood celebrities such as filmmaker J.J. Abrams, who was granted a fellowship at the lab. He is in such demand as an authority on the future of technology that he regularly pulls in fees of $100,000 to speak to corporate groups around the world.
But in recent days, the globe-trotting Ito has found himself in the midst of a crisis that is tearing at the lab he has helped to elevate since taking it over in 2011 at age 44.
This month, Ito acknowledged that he had extensive personal and professional ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who committed suicide in prison Aug. 10 while facing federal charges of sex trafficking of underage girls.
Since then, a well-known professor and a visiting scholar have both announced they will quit the lab in protest. Students inside the lab have demanded a fuller accounting of Ito's relationship with Epstein. And a current graduate student and former research associate have called on Ito to resign, saying the apology he posted online is not enough.
“Joi isn't a bad person, but he can't lead us," said Arwa Mboya, 25, a graduate researcher studying imagination and technology who is entering her second year at the lab. Despite questions and concerns raised by students, Ito hasn't offered a complete explanation of why he got involved with Epstein.
“He has not been transparent about who, when, and why," Mboya said.
Late Thursday, MIT president L. Rafael Reif said the school had received about $800,000 over two decades via foundations controlled by Epstein, and he apologized to Epstein's victims on behalf of the administration. Reif also convened a committee to investigate the Epstein donations.
Ito did not respond to requests for comment.
In his public apology, Ito said he had traveled to Epstein's homes and accepted money from him for both the research center and Ito's own investments into tech startups. Ito said he first met Epstein in 2013, five years after Epstein had pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution and served a year in jail.
“I take full responsibility for my error in judgment," Ito wrote, adding that he would raise an equivalent amount to what Epstein gave the Media Lab and donate it to nonprofits that work with survivors of human trafficking.
He also promised to return the money Epstein invested in his funds.
Ito did not explain the purpose of his visits to Epstein's homes; however, he said he was “never involved in, never heard him talk about, and never saw" evidence of Epstein's alleged crimes.
The revelation has shaken an institute that has deep corporate connections and is credited with innovations that range from the electronic ink in tablet readers to new technology that helps children learn computer programming.
Founded in 1985, the Media Lab holds a unique place on MIT's campus.
It is home to more than 30 faculty and senior researchers and 275 other students and staff. Its $80 million budget is funded primarily by corporate giants including IBM, ExxonMobil, and Google, which gain broad access to the lab's research.
“We could work on whatever we thought was important," said Walter Bender, a founding member and former director of the lab, who left in 2006. “That was a tremendous change from MIT's traditional approach to academics."
The lab's funding formula gives its researchers almost limitless freedom to explore areas ranging from digital currency to the future of food and the ethics of technology.
“It was much more serendipitous, and you could go off and chase a wild idea," Bender said.
Ito was an unconventional choice to lead the lab. A two-time college dropout, from Tufts University and the University of Chicago, he had a successful career as an Internet entrepreneur in Japan, where he was born.
Ito was also an early investor in Twitter, Flickr, and Kickstarter.
According to a nonprofit tax filing by an MIT affiliate, Ito earned $327,640 in 2017.
“Ito was a little bit of a breath of fresh air," Bender said. “He comes from very much of a business focus, an entrepreneurial focus, and that certainly had an impact on the lab."
Ito's investment background and expansive global network also helped the lab raise money and even launch its own venture capital fund.
But his fund-raising has sometimes been controversial. The lab recently cut ties with the private foundation run by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who toured the lab last year during an MIT visit, before he was accused of ordering the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to The New York Times Magazine.
Ethan Zuckerman, director of the lab's Center for Civic Media, who recently announced that he is resigning from the lab in 2020 in protest, said he warned Ito in 2014 not to meet with Epstein.
Epstein had courted prominent academics at other institutions, including Harvard, and had expressed interest in the Media Lab several years before Ito arrived.
Epstein “was sniffing round the lab even when I was there," Bender said. “He was making noises about funding some research" in artificial intelligence.
Bender said he never met Epstein and was not aware of any donations accepted from the financier during his tenure as director.
Controversies about the ethics of accepting money from certain companies or individuals sometimes occurred at the lab, Bender said. But Ito, by taking money from Epstein for the lab as well as his own private investments, “muddied a line that I worked hard to avoid," Bender said.
Ito continues to have support among several students and staff at the Media Lab.
Habib Haddad, a friend of Ito's who has known him for 10 years and helps run the lab's venture fund, said he has heard from many students and faculty who want Ito to remain in place.
“While they are sad and disappointed at Joi's mistakes, they don't want Joi to go and believe he is the right leader to put in place corrective measures and lead the lab," Haddad said. “There is an overwhelming majority — one could say silent majority — that is in support of Joi staying and leading the lab through this."
Other students and scientists at the lab said they are disappointed by the social media-driven effort to push Ito out and believe he should be given a chance to make corrections and help MIT better evaluate when to accept donor funds.
But Kim Holleman, a New York City artist who was a research affiliate at the Media Lab from 2013 to 2017, said last week that Ito must resign.
“Anyone who took any money from Epstein, for whatever reason, has taken rape money," Holleman wrote on Medium. “How on earth can anyone claim to be an intelligent person, smart enough to run MIT Media Lab, but not be smart enough to know the difference between right and wrong?"

Texto completo: Many of us ask the digital companions in our homes, whether it's Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri or Google Assistant, to handle innocuous tasks like setting a timer and playing music.
What most of us may not realize is that in some instances, there might be a person listening in, too.
In two separate reports in The Guardian and Bloomberg News, whistleblowers recently said they had listened in on Siri recordings and Alexa activations that inadvertently recorded couples having sex and criminals making drug deals. Another publication, VRT, chronicled how a Google subcontractor shared more than 1,000 excerpts from Google recordings, which journalists then used to identify some individuals.
In the tech industry, it's an open secret that artificial intelligence isn't all that smart yet. It takes lots of people manually sifting through data to train the computing systems. That means humans occasionally cull through voice recordings to train Alexa, Siri and Google to understand the nuances of speech, such as distinguishing spoken words like "Austin" from "Boston," or "U2" from "YouTube."
But tech companies have been opaque in disclosing these practices to us. And they may also have overreached in the types of recordings that they gather.
Google, Apple and Amazon have since publicly said that less than 1% of recordings were subject to human review. Apple and Google also said that they suspended their human review programs, while Amazon expanded its Alexa assistant to include a suite of privacy controls.
That got me wondering: What can we do to protect our privacy with these smart assistants, short of chucking them into the recycling bin?
The good news is that there are steps we can take. Amazon and Google offer the ability to disable human vetting for their virtual assistants. Apple has said it plans to release a software update that will let people opt in to its program, which involves humans grading Siri samples for quality control, rather than being part of the program by default.
And there are other things we can do, such as deleting recordings and turning off sensors, to minimize the information shared with the companies.
Here's a comprehensive guide on what to do to protect your privacy with each of the virtual assistants.
How to curtail Alexa data shared with Amazon
Among smart assistants, Alexa has the most comprehensive and straightforward set of privacy controls. Amazon recently released the Alexa privacy hub, which has a thorough explanation of the types of data collected by the virtual assistant and how to change its privacy settings.
Here's how to opt out of human vetting:
1. Open the Alexa app on your smartphone and tap Settings and then select Alexa Privacy.
2. Tap Manage How Your Data Improves Alexa.
3. For the control that says Help Improve Amazon Services and Develop New Features, toggle the switch to the off position.
Here's how to delete your voice recordings:
4. In the same Alexa Privacy menu, select Review Voice History.
5. In date range, select the time frame of recordings you want to delete, such as All History.
6. Tap Delete All Recordings for All History.
Here are other precautions to take with microphones and cameras:
* Alexa devices include a physical button to disable their microphones. Hit the kill switch whenever you are having sensitive conversations. The device will illuminate with a red light to indicate that the microphone is off.
* Some Alexa devices, like the Echo Spot alarm clock, have a built-in camera. The easiest way to disable it is to say, "Alexa, turn the camera off." If you still feel uncomfortable with the camera, consider buying a cheap webcam cover that can slide over the lens.
Amazon said in a statement that it takes customer privacy seriously. "We continuously review our practices and procedures to ensure we're providing customers with the best experiences and privacy choices," the company said.
How to delete your Apple Siri recordings
Siri is the most lacking in privacy controls among the virtual assistants, and the process to manage user data is the least straightforward.
For example, Apple does not offer an option to let people opt in to its so-called grading program, though it has said it plans to do so in a future software update. In addition, there is no ability to review Siri recordings associated with your account, and deleting recordings is cumbersome.
Siri does take some steps to mask your identity. When you make requests with an iPhone, for example, the device associates those with a random identifier instead of your Apple account ID, according to the company. To reset that random identifier, you can turn off Siri and then turn it back on.
Disabling Siri will also delete your data associated with it, including recordings.
Here's how to disable Siri on an iPhone to erase your data and reset your identifier:
7. Open the Settings app, then tap General, then Keyboards. In the Enable Dictation control, switch it to the off position.
8. Return to the Settings app. Select Siri & Search. Then disable the switches for Listen for "Hey Siri" and Press Side Button for Siri. You will then see a message asking if you want to disable Siri, which will remove your data from Apple's servers. Tap Turn Off Siri and your Siri history will be deleted.
9. To re-enable Siri, go back to each of those settings and turn them back on.
Some of the sensitive recordings uploaded to Siri appeared to have come from unintentional activations, like when the crown of the Apple Watch was pressed down by accident, which summoned the assistant. (In my experience, this can happen when leaning a hand against a couch cushion.)
So here is a precaution to take with an Apple Watch:
* To prevent the watch crown from triggering Siri, disable the Siri side button on the iPhone. In the Settings app, tap on Siri & Search, then toggle off Press Side Button for Siri. This will simultaneously disable the shortcut on the watch. Apple declined to comment beyond an earlier statement announcing the suspension of its Siri-grading program.
How to protect your privacy on Google Home
Google offers some controls for tweaking privacy settings for Google Assistant on Android phones and Google Home smart speakers, among other products.
While Google's human review program is suspended, you can still make sure you're not a part of it by opting out. The search company also lets you automatically delete Google Assistant requests made after a period of time.
Here's how to disable human reviews:
10. Visit Google's web tool called Activity controls.
11. Scroll down to Voice & Audio Activity. Toggle this switch off.
Here's how to set your recordings to automatically delete:
12. Again, visit Google's Activity controls web tool.
13. Under Web & App Activity, click Manage Activity.
14. Click Choose to Delete Automatically. Then click Keep for 3 months then delete automatically.
A Google spokesman declined to comment and referred to a blog post, in which the company described its process of working with human language reviewers to improve speech recognition.

Texto completo: CAIRO - On the Libyan comedy show, the punch line was in the baby carriage.
An elevator door slams shut, separating the mother - an actress in blackface - from her babies. A hidden camera shows unsuspecting passengers trapped inside with the baby carriage.
"Watch my babies!" the mother calls out in mock horror.
But when the passengers pull back the carriage cover, a pair of monkeys leap out.
Blackface, a racist entertainment device with roots in 19th-century America, is alive and well in mainstream Arab entertainment. On television networks across the Middle East, performers regularly darken their faces in comedy skits to wring cheap laughs from demeaning stereotypes and centuries-old prejudices.
The practice is offensive enough in the United States that when a photo of a man in blackface was discovered on the medical-school yearbook page of Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, he faced widespread demands to resign. In Italy, the state airline Alitalia was forced to pull an advertisement in July in which an actor in blackface portrayed former President Barack Obama.
In the Arab world, where racism is a deeply rooted yet rarely discussed issue, blackface comedy is facing a surge of criticism on social media, even forcing the occasional apology. But the practice remains widespread and acceptable enough to be a staple on major television networks.
The monkeys skit, shown on a private Libyan channel, may have been a particularly egregious example. But in the past year or so, comedy shows in Egypt and Kuwait have also featured blackface performances, and so has a music video by a Lebanese pop star.
Several aired during the holy month of Ramadan, the high season for new television programming in the Middle East, when families gather to watch their favorite shows after breaking their daily fast.
Some Arab entertainers defend the device as a harmless joke.
"It's just comedy," said the popular Egyptian comedian Shaimaa Seif after she donned blackface for a show that aired in May on MBC, the region's biggest satellite network.
The targets of that humor - most often from Sudan, a sprawling Arabic-speaking country in Africa - say there is nothing funny about it.
"Blackface is disgusting and offensive," said Sara Elhassan, a Sudanese writer in the United States. "It's not just about skin color; it's about stereotypes."
She listed some common tropes in Arab comedy: "The Black person is lazy. They don't speak Arabic properly. If they're Sudanese, they have a ridiculous accent. Or they're lying on a bed, always falling asleep."
After years of silently ignoring offensive skits on television, some Arabs are turning to social media to vent their anger and demand change.
On Twitter, Libyan activist Nader Elgadi slammed the monkeys-in-the-baby-carriage sketch and called for a campaign "to punish everyone involved." In an interview, he said the clip reflects deep-seated prejudices in a country where 600,000 mostly African migrants live in desperate conditions.
But he was heartened to see that, at least online, many Libyans shared his revulsion.
"People were like, 'This is not OK,'" he said. "It's a good first step."
Al Ahrar, the private Libyan channel that aired the show, did not respond to a request for comment.
In other cases, though, public shaming has had little effect.
In the clip that brought criticism of Seif, the Egyptian actress, she played a boorish Sudanese woman who swears, drinks and talks gibberish on a public bus.
In one segment, her character makes her son urinate into a bottle. In another, she tries to foist a bottle of Russian vodka on a fellow passenger, a taboo for observant Muslims.
After Sudanese viewers flooded Seif's Facebook page with criticism, she appeared on an MBC talk show to explain herself. Yet instead of apologizing, she doubled down on her humor.
"Don't be angry," she chided, smiling and trying to make light of the controversy. "Nothing bad was intended."
Seif and a spokesman for MBC did not respond to requests for comment.
Whatever the intent of such performances, critics say they amplify a tolerance of racism that takes many forms in the Arab world. Slavery was not formally abolished in some Persian Gulf countries until 1970. In many places, the word "abeed," meaning slaves or servants, is still the racial epithet of choice for dark-skinned people.
What happens on screen translates into behavior on the street, said Abdullahi Hassan, 24, a film student who has cataloged dozens of instances of racism in Arab movies and TV shows, mostly in Egypt, going back decades.
"Random people will call me names and find it funny," said Hassan, who grew up in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. "They think it's OK because they've seen it in comedy sketches or television pranks."
As in the United States, blackface in the Arab world is rooted in a history of oppression. For centuries, Arab enslavers captured Black Africans and transported them by dhow to the Persian Gulf. Today, African domestic workers often face rampant abuse in the same region.
"Racial stereotypes persist, including the idea that Black people have bizarre cultural practices or are prone to stealing," said Nicholas McGeehan, an independent human rights researcher who specializes in the Persian Gulf. "It can lead to horrific abuses," including physical violence, he said.
In a rare instance of accountability, a court in Belgium prosecuted eight princesses from the United Arab Emirates in 2017 on charges of human trafficking and degrading treatment of their mostly African domestic workers.
Public apologies for racism are rare in the Arab world, although there are some signs of growing awareness. A new media law in Egypt criminalizes racist content, with an offending television station facing a possible fine or even a shutdown.
Yet the law has yet to result in high-profile prosecutions, and critics worry it could be abused to silence legitimate satire. And more broadly, dark-skinned people remain woefully underrepresented in Egyptian popular culture.
"Rarely do we have a popular Black actor," said Mohamed Azmy, founder of the Egyptian Observatory for the Elimination of Racism, which campaigned for the racism provision in the media law. "Egyptian cinema is a white man's cinema."
Still, ever-louder challenges on social media have caused at least some in the Arab world to question tropes like blackface - including the actors performing them.
After Kuwait's state television station came under fire last year for a crude blackface comedy skit targeting the Sudanese, the show's lead actor, Hasan al-Ballam, took to Instagram to apologize.
Henceforth, al-Ballam said, he would no longer perform impressions of anyone.
"I ask for forgiveness from everyone," he said.

'Wackadoodle': A Ludicrous Word for Ludicrous Times; A suddenly current term mixes the aggressive sound of a blow with the comic barnyard cry of a rooster

Texto completo: PHOTO: James Yang
On Monday, after President Trump tweeted the unfounded assertion that Google had somehow "manipulated" millions of votes in favor of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said , "In a day of wackadoodle claims, this is the most wackadoodle of all, because there is not even any claim that Google manipulated votes." He added, "No one claims that except Donald Trump."
"Wackadoodle," also spelled as "whackadoodle," has emerged as a humorous label for someone or something that is eccentric at best or unhinged at worst. In 2014, the word entered the Oxford English Dictionary, along with its shorter form, "wackadoo." Katherine Martin, head of U.S. dictionaries for Oxford University Press, observed that , for both "wackadoo" and "wackadoodle," "the silliness of the words themselves contributes to their mildly contemptuous effect."
The roots of these words can be found in their first syllable. "Whack" goes back to the 18th century as a noun or verb referring to a vigorous blow—probably a case of onomatopoeia, like the similarly aggressive "thwack." "Whack" gave rise to many different expressions, like "taking a whack" at something. "In fine whack" once meant "in good condition," while "out of whack" described something that's malfunctioning, including someone's mental faculties. The Ishmaelite, a newspaper in Erie, Kan., included an item in March 1871 describing a local character as "one of that sort of fellows whose heart is in the right place" but whose "head is awfully out of 'whack.'"
In the 20th century, "whacky" or "wacky" came to describe an "out of whack" personality—perhaps suggesting that someone needed a whack to the head to be set straight. "Whacko" or "wacko" became popularized as a term for an eccentric person, as in this 1936 passage from the State Journal of Lansing, Mich., describing a search for a fall guy: "They've got to pick some whacko who won't want the state capital building in return for false imprisonment."
Elaborating "wacky" into the longer words "wackadoo" and "wackadoodle" may have been helped along by nonsensical refrains in songs going back to the 1920s. "Doo Wacka Doo" was a song title in 1924, and the singer-songwriter Roger Miller had a hit with the similarly titled "Do-Wacka-Do" in 1965. The "doodle" variation appears as early as 1933 in a song titled "The King Made Whoopee in the Land of Whack-a-Doodle-Doo."
"Whack-a-doodle-doo," of course, resembles the rooster's cry of "cock-a-doodle-doo," which shows up in texts dating back to Shakespeare's time. The "doodle" element has long been used to connote foolishness: The song "Yankee Doodle" is based on a sneering epithet that the British used against American colonists, who were seen as objects of ridicule (especially when they tried to put on airs as "dandies").
Combining all these fanciful components into "wackadoodle" didn't become popular until the early 1990s. The Oxford English Dictionary notes that the humorist Dave Barry wrote a column in 1991 with a list of silly names for "traditional English dishes," including "Whack-a-Doodle Johnson," and a 1993 article in the San Diego Tribune quoted a therapist referring to "wack-a-doodle theories of psychology."
The term is also showing up in our Trump-era politics. New York Times columnist David Brooks recently said on the "PBS NewsHour" that Marianne Williamson, the self-help guru now running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has some "wackadoodle ideas." And in March, President Trump's proposed budget was called "heartless and whackadoodle" by Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell. When the times feel particularly ludicrous, only the most ludicrous terms suffice.

Resumen: Trump touted himself as messiah and looked to buy Greenland. It's the week in politics.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump promoted himself as "the King of Israel" and "Second Coming of God" this week, later calling himself "the chosen one" — all in the same day. He also floated the idea of maybe, possibly, potentially buying Greenland? All that happened, America. Let's review.
The Trump messianic talk came from Wayne Allyn Root, a right-wing conspiracy theorist retweeted by the president on Wednesday: "Jewish people in Israel love him like he's the King of Israel. They love him like he's the second coming of God. " That came just a day after Trump told reporters that Jewish people who vote for Democrats show "great disloyalty. " It also came after Israel banned two Trump critics — Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib — at the president's request. Also on Wednesday, Trump insisted he's taking on China in a trade war because no other president did. "I am the chosen one," he said, looking up at the sky. There's video.
Also this week: Trump wanted Greenland. "We're looking at it," Trump said Sunday of the world's largest island, described as a "vast tundra" with "immense glaciers" that's overseen by Denmark. The Danish Prime Minister called such talk "absurd. " Trump then cancelled an upcoming trip to Denmark, calling the prime minister "nasty. " That was after Trump published a fake photo of a Trump tower looming over the island: "I promise not to do this to Greenland!" said the president, who earlier claimed the island would benefit the U. S. "strategically. "
'No recession in sight,' Trump's team says. But just in case . . .
Yes, there are wild market swings. Yes, there's that trade war. But Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said this week that there's "no recession in sight. " Even so, the White House has been planning for one: Officials reportedly began looking at a temporary payroll tax to prevent a recession, the Washington Post and the New York Times reported earlier this week. Trump on Tuesday said the U. S. is "very far from a recession," but he admitted he'd pondered a payroll tax cut “for a long time. " By the next day, the idea was abruptly out: “I’m not looking at a tax cut now,” he told reporters. "We don't need it. "

Texto completo: "The Peanut Butter Falcon," a critically praised buddy picture starring Zack Gottsagen, a Boynton Beach actor who has Down syndrome, opens in hundreds of theaters nationwide this weekend, including 20 in South Florida.
The film, rated PG-13, also features Hollywood stars Shia LaBeouf and Dakota Johnson among an eclectic cast that includes Oscar nominees Bruce Dern and Thomas Haden Church, and professional wrestling legends Mick Foley and Jake "the Snake" Roberts.
The unknown and unlikely star of "The Peanut Butter Falcon" more than holds his own, according to critics, who have called the film (which scores a 94 on Rotten Tomatoes) a groundbreaking showcase for an actor with Down syndrome.
"Gottsagen is a disarming performer who creates a sweet and funny character," wrote The New York Times' Glenn Kenney. Los Angeles Times' Katie Walsh reviewer called Gottsagen "a performer with natural comedic timing and the ability to deliver funny and unexpected punchlines."
In the film, Gottsagen plays Zak, a young man with Down syndrome whose family has abandoned him in a North Carolina old-folks home. One night he escapes, with a goal to reach a wrestling school in Florida run by the ring villain who stars in the prized VHS tape he has worn out watching. He has no plan, no money and, except for a pair of white briefs, no clothes.
Zak soon crosses paths with an angry young crab trapper (LaBeouf), headed to Florida to escape his own problems. As the journey moves from land to hastily built raft (and unapologetic echoes of Mark Twain), the two form a genuine bond that gives the movie its heart.
Walsh calls the scenes between the two stars "special to watch."
"LaBeouf brings the soul to 'The Peanut Butter Falcon,' while Gottsagen brings the spirit. He has an undeniably charming screen presence, and the actor takes to this starring role with gusto," Walsh wrote. "He more than stands up to the task of movie star, and the filmmakers have crafted the perfect vehicle to showcase both his talents, and the surprising connection with his co-star LaBeouf."
"The Peanut Butter Falcon," which won the Audience Award at the 2019 SXSW Film Festival, among other film festival accolades, was directed by newcomers Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, who met Gottsagen at a camp for actors with disabilities in California. The film was made with two of the producers responsible for the hit indie comedy "Little Miss Sunshine."
"Money's useful. But you don't need ridiculous amounts of it to make a film with interesting characters, compelling actors and a story bringing something old and something new to the table," wrote Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune. "'The Peanut Butter Falcon' reminds us of this, while introducing a beguiling screen newcomer, Zack Gottsagen, who has studied acting for much of his life and now has the audience he deserves."
Of Gottsagen's performance, Phillips wrote: "Gottsagen is not disabled. He has Down syndrome. He is also as able-bodied and innately appealing a screen performer as we've seen in 2019."
Beginning Friday, "The Peanut Butter Falcon" can be seen in theaters from Royal Palm Beach to Kendall. Some theaters will give initial screenings on Thursday. Here's where to find it:
Broward County: Regal Magnolia Place 16 in Coral Springs (opens Thursday), Silverspot Coconut Creek Cinemas, Cinemark Paradise 24 in Davie (opens Thursday), the Classic Gateway in Fort Lauderdale, Regal Oakwood 18 in Hollywood (opens Thursday), AMC Sunrise 8 (opens Thursday).

Texto completo: President Trump is upset that Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called his interest in purchasing Greenland "absurd." Her dismissive response should have come as no surprise. In 1946, when President Harry Truman tried to purchase Greenland, Secretary of State James Byrnes wrote that the proposal "seemed to come as a shock" and an insult to Danish officials, who turned it down.
That was a big mistake. As part of his deal, Truman had offered to trade parts of the Point Barrow district of Alaska, including the rights to any oil discovered there, to Denmark, in exchange for parts of Greenland. The Danes dismissed the idea just as they did Trump's proposal. In 1967, the richest oil strike in U.S. history was made in the Point Barrow area. Bad move, Denmark! Sad!
With that blunder in their rearview mirror, you would think that Danish leaders would at least hear Trump out. The president's idea of buying Greenland is far from absurd. Today we have a military base in Greenland, so there is no need to buy it for that purpose. But Greenland has enormous unexplored stores of natural resources, including zinc, lead, gold, iron ore, diamonds, copper and uranium, that Denmark has been unable or unwilling to exploit.
It also has large, untapped stores of rare-earth elements, such as praseodymium or dysprosium, that are critical to the production of everything from electric cars to smartphones and lasers. Today, the United States gets many of these rare-earth elements from China, which makes Americans dependent on Beijing. The Wall Street Journal reports that Beijing may cut off access to those minerals in its trade dispute with Washington, and China is also trying to corner the market for rare-earth elements in Greenland. Buying Greenland would put those strategically valuable minerals in U.S. hands.
But what makes Greenland particularly valuable to the United States is global warming. The unavoidable receding of Arctic sea ice will open a new sea route in the Arctic that can be used for both commercial and military vessels. In May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered an address at the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Finland in which he pointed out that "steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade. This could potentially slash the time it takes to travel between Asia and the West by as much as 20 days." He added that the emerging "Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st-century Suez and Panama canals."
He's right. A recent report in The New York Times notes that as sea ice melts and "Arctic routes become more direct, voyage times could fall to less than three weeks in some cases, making Arctic shipping potentially more attractive than the southern routes in coming decades."
The United States and its allies have a major interest in not allowing these Arctic sea lanes to fall under Russian or Chinese control. "Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a New South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?" Pompeo asked in Finland. Purchasing Greenland would help the United States to better secure these emerging strategic passageways.
In 1946, the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Truman that Greenland was "completely worthless to Denmark." Today, Denmark may not feel that way. But rather than getting offended, Copenhagen should entertain Trump's offer. After all, it would not be the first time Denmark sold the United States one of its overseas possessions. In 1916, it sold the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands) to President Woodrow Wilson. So, we've long ago established that parts of Denmark are for sale; there's no harm haggling over the price.
Indeed, a Greenland purchase would be in keeping with a long history of presidential land acquisitions. In 1803, Thomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana territory from France. In 1819, President James Monroe bought Florida from Spain. In 1854, President Franklin Pierce, in the Gadsden Purchase, bought part of New Mexico and Arizona from Mexico. In 1867, President Andrew Johnson bought Alaska from Russia. In 1898, President William McKinley bought the Philippines from Spain. And in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt rented the Panama Canal Zone from Panama and Guantanamo Bay from Cuba. If Denmark won't sell Greenland, maybe we can rent it!
On Monday, Trump tweeted a picture of a gleaming Trump high-rise amid small huts on the Greenland coast and declared, "I promise not to do this to Greenland!" But the idea of buying Greenland is no joke. It actually makes a lot of strategic and economic sense.

Israel Is Believed to Be Behind a July Airstrike on a Weapons Depot in Iraq

Texto completo: Israel has carried out an airstrike on a weapons depot in Iraq that officials said was being used by Iran to move weapons to Syria, an attack that could destabilize Iraq and thrust it deeper into the conflict between the United States and Iran.
The attack, believed to be the first Israeli bombing in Iraq in nearly four decades, represents an expansion of the military campaign Israel has carried out against Iranian targets in Syria.
The Israeli attack last month was one of several recent attacks on weapons storage facilities controlled by Iraqi militias with ties to Iran. It was not clear who carried out the other attacks, which have set Iraq on edge as it struggles to recover from nearly 40 years of war and instability.
Responding to the attacks on Thursday, Iraq's national security adviser, Falih al-Fayadh, said that Iraq wanted to avoid taking sides in any struggle between Iran and other countries and being "pushed into a war."
"The Iraqi government and especially its security agencies and armed forces will take all measures necessary to protect Iraq and its people and to deter any attempts at destabilization," he said.
He said the government had yet to determine who was behind the attacks.
A senior Middle Eastern intelligence official said that Israel had bombed a base north of Baghdad on July 19.
Two senior American officials, however, said that Israel had carried out several strikes in recent days on munitions storehouses for Iranian-backed groups in Iraq.
In a statement on Wednesday, Jamal Jaafar Al-Ibrahim, the deputy chief of the Iraqi militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces, blamed "American and Israeli aircraft" for carrying out "repeated attacks" on the groups' local headquarters.
The Israeli military refused to comment on the attacks but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, asked about them on a visit to Kiev, Ukraine on Monday, said "Iran doesn't have immunity anywhere."
"A state that says, 'We are going to destroy you and we will build bases to fire missiles and to send terrorist cells against you' -- as far as I'm concerned, has no immunity," he told reporters. "We will act -- and currently are acting -- against them, wherever it is necessary."
Israel has carried hundreds of airstrikes against Iranian assets in Syria during that country's eight-year civil war.
In Iraq, there have been four attacks on weapons depots in the last three months. Three of them belong to the Popular Mobilization Forces in or near Salahuddin Province. The fourth was a base in Baghdad used by the federal police and the militias.
The Israeli attack on July 19 struck a base that the Middle Eastern intelligence official said was being used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards to transfer weapons to Syria. The Israeli strike, which was launched from within Iraq, the official said, destroyed a cargo of guided missiles with a range of 125 miles.
An Iraqi military official confirmed that a base was hit and said that three people were killed in the strike, including an Iranian.
The most recent attack occurred Monday on the periphery of the vast Balad Airbase, an Iraqi military base that formerly had been used by the United States. The militias have erected storage facilities around the base, and the bombing set off an explosion of Katyusha rockets, mortar shells and grenades into the surrounding area.
No deaths were reported.
The militias, also known as Hasht al Shabi, are officially an arm of the Iraqi Security Forces but a handful operate semi-independently and several have strong ties to Iran. The militias began as informal volunteer forces in 2014 to help defend the country from the Islamic State and are credited with helping defeat the group.
But since then, some of the militias with the closest ties to Iran have been seen as Iranian proxies whose interests align with their sponsors in Tehran rather than the Iraqi government. Some of their leaders are now on the United States terrorism list.
Israeli officials say they have become a conduit for Iran's transit of weapons to its militias in Syria and to the Lebanon-based Hezbollah. Iran has become a critical partner for the Syrian government, which has allowed it to build a substantial military infrastructure there, which Israel has repeatedly attacked.
Iraq, where multiple foreign forces are still fighting the Islamic State, has made clear it wants no part of that fight. Iraq is a close ally of Iran but Iraqi officials are concerned about being used by Tehran or by Washington, which is trying to punish Iran for its military activities in the Middle East.
The Israeli move also holds potential hazards for the United States, whose troops remain in Iraq in the fight against the Islamic State. Because the United States is a close Israeli ally, Iraqis are quick to blame it for allowing the Israelis to carry out attacks in Iraq.
A senior American official said that Israel was pushing the limits with the strikes in Iraq. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss delicate diplomatic matters, the official said the airstrikes could get the United States military removed from Iraq.
The last known Israeli attack in Iraq was in 1981, when an airstrike destroyed a nuclear reactor under construction near Baghdad. Israeli officials contended that the reactor was intended to produce nuclear weapons.
Israel had long maintained a policy of silence and ambiguity about its airstrikes in Syria until January, when its outgoing army chief of staff, Gadi Eisenkot, openly described that campaign in The New York Times. He said Israel had hit Iranian targets or its proxies in Syria and Lebanon "thousands" of times "without claiming responsibility or asking for credit."
Days later, Mr. Netanyahu, who was campaigning for re-election, confirmed that Israel had bombed an Iranian weapons depot at the Damascus airport, and threatened more such attacks.
In a speech in July, Yossi Cohen, the chief of Israel's Mossad spy agency, said Israel had taken "a number of overt and covert measures, of which only a small part has been revealed" to prevent Iranian efforts to gain a foothold in Syria.
Iran and Hezbollah, he said, "are trying to transfer some of their bases to northern Syria. At the same time, they are setting up bases and factories for sophisticated weaponry in Iraq and Lebanon. They mistakenly believe that we will have difficulty reaching them there."

After bizarre twists, Overstock CEO quits; Patrick Byrne made strange comments but was done in by his relationship with a Russian operative.

Texto completo: Overstock.com Inc.'s Patrick Byrne finally gave his critics the flameout they've been predicting for years.
In a 1,600-word email statement in which he vowed to disappear "for some time," Byrne, 56, resigned as chief executive and board member of Overstock, the online retailer he has led for 20 years.
In a series of public announcements in the last two weeks, the flamboyant entrepreneur cited entanglements with the "deep state" that included cooperating with law enforcement agents he called "Men in Black" with their "Clinton Investigation" and "Russia Investigation."

Byrne said he'd been romantically involved with Maria Butina, a Russian operative jailed for failing to register as a foreign agent.
When it came to explaining how these confessions fit together and why they forced his resignation, Byrne has proved less than coherent.
"While I believe that I did what was necessary for the good of the country, for the good of the firm, I am in the sad position of having to sever ties with Overstock," Byrne wrote in the Thursday statement.
Byrne's bizarre comments -- contained in Thursday's statement, in an Aug. 12 release and a New York Times interview published Aug. 15 -- come as little surprise to followers of his career. After all, this is the e-tail impresario and cryptocurrency and blockchain evangelist who espoused grassy-knoll theories about Wall Street and the evil -- and unnamed -- "Sith Lord" hedge fund manager who, he said, conspired to take him down.
He likened Overstock's crypto ambitions to Jonas Salk's polio vaccine and joked on a conference call in recent weeks about lending office space to the Securities and Exchange Commission amid an investigation into the company's tZero blockchain push.
Byrne has talked about the dark underbelly of Wall Street, been spoofed in the tabloids with UFOs hovering over his head and accused journalists of performing sex for access. He launched Overstock in 1999 as a sort of internet garage sale.
His departure was effective Thursday. He'll be succeeded by director Jonathan Johnson on an interim basis. Johnson has been with the company for nearly 17 years and recently served as president of Overstock's blockchain business, Medici Ventures.
Passages in Byrne's Aug. 14 release bewildered investors and left some wondering about his stability. The statement quoted Byrne as saying the investigations were "less about law enforcement and more about political espionage." He elaborated in the New York Times interview, saying he went public this month because of concern about the U.S. government's prosecution of Butina, who is serving an 18-month prison sentence.
Butina is a self-styled Russian gun-rights activist who befriended senior officials from the National Rifle Assn. and Republican Party in the run-up to the 2016 election. Aspects of Byrne's story remain fuzzy, but some of it can be fashioned from the New York Times' account of its interview with him, Overstock's statements and articles published on the website of a Fox News contributor named Sara Carter, which Byrne "confirmed."
In those, Byrne is depicted as becoming involved with Butina after they met in 2015, growing suspicious of her as she pressed for information on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, notifying the FBI of their interactions, then coming to regret the handling of her prosecution.
Overstock shares surged as much as 18% in trading Thursday after the announcement.
They later pared gains, closing up 8.3% at $21.12. That's still down more than 15% since Overstock published Byrne's statement Aug. 12.
Byrne's exit "is a tremendous catalyst for the stock," said D.A. Davidson's Tom Forte, one of two Wall Street analysts covering Overstock. "I think the latest controversy was one too many."
Overstock has been considering selling its online retail business and Byrne's departure will probably accelerate that process, said Forte, who is bullish on Overstock.
"I think his legacy will be the shareholder value created on the blockchain investments," he said. "He saw the writing on the wall early on."
For all his weird, inspired and ill-considered pronouncements, Byrne was done in not by something he said but rather by his relationship with a Russian operative.
How long he remains out of the public eye is one more mystery in his volatile life story.

Texto completo: The New York Times Magazine published an historically significant account of the 400th anniversary of the first African slaves to be brought to the North American continent. In August 1619, 30 to 40 slaves landed in Jamestown, Va. That was 157 years before the British colonies became the United States of America in 1776.
The New York Times has inaugurated "The 1619 Project" to reframe American history by considering what it would mean to regard 1619 as our birth year by "placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are" as a country.
Nikole Hannah-Jones is the lead reporter who is assisted by many others from journalism, academia and the arts. The New York Times 1619 Project promises a comprehensive and readable account of the role and impact of slavery in America.

Texto completo: Do you blame God for Donald Trump?
“I am the chosen one,” Trump announced Wednesday. OK, he was talking about fighting his trade war with China, not ascending into heaven. It was all a joke, sort of. But we’ve been so far down the megalomania road with this president that it would not be a total surprise to discover he had delusions of divinity.
Maybe at night, when he’s alone with nobody but Fox News to keep him company, Trump envisions a future in which all Americans will appreciate how much he’s suffered for their salvation. He does seem to think of himself as something super-special. And if you listen to him answering questions without the help of a teleprompter, there is a tendency to wonder if he’s speaking in tongues.

Resumen: Trump touted himself as messiah, then looked to buy Greenland. It's the week in politics.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump promoted himself as "the King of Israel" and "Second Coming of God" this week, later calling himself "the chosen one" — all in the same day. He also floated the idea of maybe, possibly, potentially buying Greenland? All that happened, America. Let's review.
The Trump messianic talk came from Wayne Allyn Root, a right-wing conspiracy theorist retweeted by the president on Wednesday: "Jewish people in Israel love him like he's the King of Israel. They love him like he's the second coming of God. " That came just a day after Trump told reporters that Jewish people who vote for Democrats show "great disloyalty. " It also came after Israel banned two Trump critics — Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib — at the president's request. Also on Wednesday, Trump insisted he's taking on China in a trade war because no other president did. "I am the chosen one," he said, looking up at the sky. There's video.
Also this week: Trump wanted Greenland. "We're looking at it," Trump said Sunday of the world's largest island, described as a "vast tundra" with "immense glaciers" that's overseen by Denmark. The Danish Prime Minister called such talk "absurd. " Trump then cancelled an upcoming trip to Denmark, calling the prime minister "nasty. " That was after Trump published a fake photo of a Trump tower looming over the island: "I promise not to do this to Greenland!" said the president, who earlier claimed the island would benefit the U. S. "strategically. "
'No recession in sight,' Trump's team says. But just in case . . .
Yes, there are wild market swings. Yes, there's that trade war. But Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said this week that there's "no recession in sight. " Even so, the White House has been planning for one: Officials reportedly began looking at a temporary payroll tax to prevent a recession, the Washington Post and the New York Times reported earlier this week. Trump on Tuesday said the U. S. is "very far from a recession," but he admitted he'd pondered a payroll tax cut “for a long time. " By the next day, the idea was abruptly out: “I’m not looking at a tax cut now,” he told reporters. "We don't need it. "
This week in Trump
Trump blasted Fox News after its poll showed his approval slipping.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's former spokeswoman, will now work at . . . Fox News.

Half of Americans disapprove of Trump's response to recent mass shootings.

Payroll Tax Cuts Coming Soon?

Texto completo: President Donald Trump on Tuesday acknowledged that his aggressive trade policies may result in economic hardship for some Americans. Regardless, he said he does not fear a recession but is considering new tax cuts to promote economic growth.
“Payroll tax is something we think about, and a lot of people would like to see that, and that very much affects the workers of our country,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “I’ve been thinking about payroll taxes for a long time.”
The possibility of a temporary payroll tax cut would put more money in the hands of consumers in order to bolster spending and stave off a possible recession.
The last payroll tax cut came during the Obama administration in 2011 and was intended to kickstart the economy following the 2008 recession. Congress renewed the temporary cuts again in 2012.
Here’s what a payroll tax cut would probably mean for the average American today:
What are payroll taxes and how are they listed on my paycheck?
Payroll taxes are taken directly from the paychecks of American workers and used to finance federal safety net programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
While few details have been shared regarding a potential payroll tax cut this year, it’s likely it would target Social Security, experts say. That has renewed interest on Google for the question, “How is Social Security listed on my paycheck?”
The official name for Social Security is the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance. It’s listed on your pay stub or pay slip as OASDI or FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act). It accounts for 6.2% of your wages overall, which your employer collects and remits to the government.
So a payroll tax cut will give me a bigger paycheck?
Yes, payroll tax cuts would result in more take-home pay immediately. But a reduction of 2% won’t exactly have you rolling in the dough.
Why is that?
Social Security taxes are subject to a wage cap (or an amount you pay until you hit a certain threshold). After that, no more tax. This year, that number is $132,900. An individual earning wages equal to or larger than that sum contributes $8,239.80 to the OASDI program, and his or her employer contributes the same amount.
For those Americans making a mid-range salary, they contribute much less to Social Security than top earners and so there’s less money to consider getting back.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers were $908 in the second quarter of 2019. At least 2% back in what that worker pays into Social Security would not be a substantial amount even if the cuts last 12 months.
But overall, the amount you’d get back would depend on the size of the cut and the duration.
Would that kind of money really stimulate the economy?
According to reports, some prominent economists don’t appear to be optimistic and believe the majority of people may tuck the money away if recession fears grow deeper.
In addition, the same economists believe a lift to the GDP growth would be minimal and the bump to the federal deficit substantial.
According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, enacting the same policy of a 2% cut from 2011-12 would cost the government nearly $300 billion before interest.
Is Trump considering any other economic adjustments?
The president also told reporters he’s thinking about unilaterally reducing capital gains taxes without going through Congress. That would reduce the amount of taxes owed on profitable sales of stocks, bonds and other investments.
Economists say it’s basically cutting taxes for the rich, which the New York Times says could be potentially problematic for Trump before his 2020 re-election campaign. The Democratic National Committee on Tuesday said 97% of the benefits would go the wealthiest 10% of people in the country, including nearly everyone in Trump’s cabinet.

Here's what you need to know about the MIT Media Lab and Jeffrey Epstein

Texto completo: In the wake of revelations about the MIT Media Lab's ties to Jeffrey Epstein, two star scholars have announced they will resign from the esteemed research center. Epstein, a disgraced financier who faced charges of trafficking underaged girls and previously pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution, killed himself earlier this month. Joi Ito, the director of the lab, has apologized for associating with Epstein but has not resigned. Here are five things to know about the controversy:
What is the Media Lab? Founded in 1985, the Media Lab's mission is to design technologies for a better future. The research center prides itself on an “antidisciplinary" culture that encourages its affiliates to work together across fields, its website said.
More than 30 faculty and researchers lead the lab, which was working on more than 450 projects last fall. The lab, which MIT says “creates disruptive technologies that happen at the edges," has gained credit as the incubator of a wide range of innovations.
The lab accepts approximately 50 master's and PhD candidates — from a range of backgrounds, including computer science, architecture, and psychology — through the Program of Media Arts and Sciences each year. It has 100 staff members, according to its website.
Who funds the Media Lab? Unlike most academic centers, the lab adopted an industry-sponsored funding model that aims to give scholars more time to focus on their projects instead of grant applications.
Most of its annual operating budget of about $75 million comes from more than 80 companies, according to its website. The companies include consulting firms, banks, biotech companies, car companies, and tech giants such as Google.
Who is Joi Ito? Joichi “Joi" Ito took the helm of the Media Lab in 2011.
Born in Japan, Ito has established himself as an entrepreneur, a venture capitalist, and a leading expert on the ethics and governance of technology. In 2018, he completed his PhD program at Keio University's Graduate School of Media and Governance.
Ito serves on the board of several organizations, including The New York Times Co. and the MacArthur Foundation, according to his personal website.
How is Joi Ito connected to Jeffrey Epstein? A week ago, Ito publicly apologized for accepting money from Epstein for the lab and for his own investment funds. Ito said he had traveled to Epstein's homes and invited him to visit the research center. He emphasized he “never saw any evidence of the horrific acts" Epstein was accused of.
In the open letter, Ito vowed to raise the same amount of money that Epstein had donated to the Media Lab and donate it to nonprofits that support survivors of sex trafficking. He also pledged to return the money Epstein had invested in Ito's venture capital funds.
Ito and MIT have not disclosed the amount of money Epstein donated, but publicly available documents show that Epstein's foundation and nonprofit gave MIT at least $200,000.
Other Boston-area academics have also been forced to explain their ties to Epstein in recent weeks.
Who is Ethan Zuckerman and why did he resign? Ethan Zuckerman, director of the lab's Center for Civic Media, said he decided to resign from the lab after learning of Ito's ties with Epstein.
In a Medium post published Tuesday, Zuckerman said Ito told him on Aug. 9 about his connections to Epstein. Zuckerman said he told Ito the next day he planned to move his work out of the lab by May 2020.
Zuckerman is a respected scholar in quantitative research on media and cofounded Global Voices, an international community of bloggers and activists. Focusing on the relationship between media and social change, his center designs tools to better understand how ideas spread in the media and to support civic participation.
His plan to resign was first reported by the Globe, which had obtained a note that Zuckerman sent to the women who last year won the lab's Disobedience Award for their #MeToo activism. In his apology to them, Zuckerman said he was “ashamed" of his institution.
“I no longer feel I can continue working on issues of social justice under the banner of the Media Lab," Zuckerman wrote.
Who is J. Nathan Matias? The second person associated with the lab to announce his intention to resign was J. Nathan Matias, a visiting scholar who had studied under Zuckerman.
During his past two years as a visiting scholar, the lab supported a project he founded “to advance a safer, fairer, more understanding internet," Matias wrote in his own Medium post Wednesday.
“CivilServant does research on protecting women and other vulnerable people online from abuse and harassment," Matias wrote. “I cannot with integrity do that from a place with the kind of relationship that the Media Lab has had with Epstein. It's that simple."
Matias said he was “profoundly disappointed" in Ito's ties with Epstein and the lab's lack of oversight in that regard.

Texto completo: News Corp is developing a news-aggregation service meant to address concerns that Alphabet Inc.'s Google News and other digital platforms don't reward publishers' work adequately and play down articles from certain types of sites, according to people familiar with the plans.
The service, currently called Knewz.com, is expected to be a website and a mobile app. An early version is being shown to a small group of News Corp executives and an official launch could come later this year, though no specific timeline has been set, the people said. The company could still decide not to proceed with the project, they said.
The service will draw from hundreds of news sources, including national outlets such as The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post and NBC News, digital-native players, magazine publishers and local newspapers, the people said. News Corp owns Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal.
The articles on Knewz.com will link directly to publishers' sites, and News Corp won't take a cut of the advertising revenue the articles generate. News Corp also expects to share data with those publishers. The service will aim to promote original news reports rather than those that are quick rehashes of existing articles, and it will treat subscription news sites the same as nonsubscription sites in determining which articles to link to, the people familiar with the plans said.
News Corp isn't striking licensing deals with media companies for the service, since it is simply linking out to their sites without hosting their content on its platform or charging for it, one of the people said.
The project aims to give exposure to smaller outlets that News Corp executives believe are often demoted in Google's search results and Facebook Inc.'s social feed, the people said.
That includes publishers with conservative audiences such as the Daily Wire, the Daily Caller, the Washington Free Beacon and the Washington Examiner, according to some of the people. Others said the idea is to highlight deserving news stories, regardless of politics, noting that progressive sites such as Daily Kos and ThinkProgress are included.
Representatives for Google and Facebook had no immediate comment. The companies have said their algorithms don't rank or prioritize content based on the political leanings of news organizations.
News Corp is preparing an advertising-sales strategy for Knewz.com, and there will be a marketing push for the launch, people familiar with the plan said. Some of the people said the hope is that it could potentially give News Corp more leverage in its relationship with Google and other platforms.
"We are exploring this with the goal of recognizing and rewarding the provenance of journalism, and to drive traffic and data to publishers—including subscription sites—so their original work is respected," said James Kennedy, a spokesman for News Corp. "We want people to see a wide spectrum of news and views, from local, niche and national sources, without bent or bias."
The service will select stories to surface through a combination of human curation and software that will scan a variety of publications, people familiar with the plans said.
Garnering consumer attention for a startup news-aggregation product could be difficult. To manage the project, News Corp has brought in Noah Kotch, a veteran media executive who has previously worked for NBC News and Fox News, in addition to an earlier stint at News Corp, the people familiar with the plans said.
News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson has been a vocal critic of Google and Facebook and how the algorithms built into their platforms affect the reach publishers get for their news articles. Mr. Thomson has suggested the creation of a so-called Algorithm Review Board that would allow for more transparency into how they operate.
In 2017, following pushback from News Corp and other companies, Google said it was ending a policy that downgraded articles in search rankings if they required users to have a subscription to read them. Still, concerns from publishers have persisted over a range of issues.

President Trump’s deregulatory promise: John Stossel

Texto completo: President Donald Trump promised he’d get rid of bad rules.
“Remove the anchor dragging us down!” he said when campaigning for president. “We’re going to cancel every needless job-killing regulation!”
Trump was a developer, so he knew that the thicket of rules government imposes often makes it impossible to get things done.
But would he keep his deregulation promise? I was skeptical.
Republicans often talk deregulation but then add rules. People called President George W. Bush an “anti-regulator.” But once he was president, he hired 90,000 new regulators!
Trump has been different.
When he took office, he hired regulation skeptics. He told government agencies: Get rid of two regulations for every new one you add.
I think his anti-regulation attitude is why stock prices rose and unemployment dropped. Trump sent a message to business: Government will no longer try to crush you. Businesses then started hiring.
Of course, the media wasn’t happy. Reporters love regulation.
They call Trump’s moves “an attack on the environment” and on “workers’ health.” The New York Times ran the headline “Donald Trump Is Trying to Kill You!”
What the media don’t get is that regulations have unintended side effects that often outweigh the good they’re intended to do.
Cars built smaller to comply with President Obama’s rules that require doubling of gas mileage cause increased deaths because smaller cars provide less protection.
“Should the government tell you what kind of car to buy?” asks Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in my new video about Trump.
Norquist says that Trump has largely kept his deregulation promise, and that’s been great for America.
For example, Trump repealed the Obama-era plan to classify franchise businesses like McDonald’s as one single business. Why?
“The trial lawyers want to be able to sue all of McDonald’s, not just the local McDonald’s, if they spill coffee on themselves,” says Norquist. “And the labor unions want to unionize all McDonald’s, not just the one store. That would have been a disaster.”
Trump’s FCC repealed Obama’s “net neutrality” rule, which would have limited internet providers’ freedom to charge different prices.
Democrats and other regulation-lovers predicted repeal would mean that rich people would dominate the internet. Bernie Sanders even tweeted that repeal would mean “the end of the internet as we know it.”
Of course, none of those things happened. Or as Norquist puts it: “None of it! None of it!”
But some Obama regulations sounded so important.
Norquist laughs at that. “The names for these regulations are written by regulators. They’re advertisements for themselves.”
Of course, unlike advertisers, regulators don’t list side effects of their rules, which Norquist says should read: “May cause unemployment, may reduce wages, may raise the cost of energy, may make your car not drivable.”
Trump’s deregulation record would be better were he not so eager to add regulations, such as tariffs, at the same time.
“There is a challenge. Trump is a protectionist in many ways,” says Norquist, sadly. “Tariffs are taxes, and regulations on the border are regulations on consumers.”
So are Trump’s “buy American” rules.
“That sounds like a good idea, but it’s a dumb idea, and I wish he hadn’t done it,” says Norquist. “That is not deregulation. The good news is that the vast majority of the acts have been deregulatory and tremendously helpful.”
Recently, Trump announced, “We have cut 22 regulations for every new regulation!”
He exaggerated, as he often does. The real number is about five. But that’s still pretty good. Better than Ronald Reagan did.
I wish Trump would do more.
I wish he’d remove his tariffs and agricultural subsidies and kill the Export-Import Bank, drug prohibition and the onerous rules that encourage illegal immigration by making it almost impossible for foreigners to work here legally.
Keep your promise, President Trump! Repeal 22 regulations for every new one!
Nevertheless, so far, mostly good.
Every excessive rule repealed is a step in the right direction: toward freedom.

'Scared': Trump critics charge he canceled trip to Denmark because Obama would outshine him there

Texto completo: President Trump scrapped his trip to Denmark next month which would have preceded a visit by Barack Obama a couple weeks later.
Obama is scheduled to give a talk in the northern city of Aalborg at the end of September, which is less than a year after his last visit to Denmark.
Trump was set to visit the country on Sept. 2 and 3 as part of a larger tour of Europe, but abruptly announced Tuesday evening that he was postponing a meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.
The president explained on Wednesday that it was the way Frederiksen refused to entertain his interest in buying Greenland — she said the idea was "absurd" — that prompted his decision to cancel his state visit to Copenhagen.
"That it was an 'absurd' idea was nasty. I thought it was an inappropriate statement," Trump told reporters. "All she had to do was say, 'No, we wouldn't be interested.'"
Obama was also on his mind as Trump revived his criticism of European countries, including Denmark, for not contributing enough to NATO. Denmark “can’t treat the United States the way they treated us under Obama," he said. iFrame ObjectJournalists and pundits have guessed Trump made the decision to cancel his trip to Denmark for a variety of reasons, including Obama's visit in the same month.
David Frum, a senior editor at The Atlantic, tweeted, "This isn't about Greenland. Obama scheduled to visit Denmark 9/28. Trump was scared of the likely contrast to his state visit on 9/2-3."
CNBC's chief Washington correspondent John Harwood, in offering context for Trump's criticism of Denmark, noted how its citizens' opinion of the U.S. has dropped since Trump took office.TweetMaggie Haberman, the White House correspondent for the New York Times, said that Trump "was already getting disinterested in this trip" before it emerged that he was having conversations about purchasing Greenland.
This is not the first time Trump has been scheduled to make a trip to a foreign country at around the same time Obama was there. For instance, Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in late 2017 weeks after Trump made a visit to Beijing.
More than two years after he left office, Obama remains a counterpoint to Trump on the world stage. He visited Germany in April and reportedly received a warm welcome as he offered contrasting views of key policy issues to those prioritized by his successor.

A call with Trump gets the NRA results

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump spent at least 30 minutes on the phone Tuesday with Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association, the latest conversation in an aggressive campaign by gun rights advocates to influence the White House in the weeks since the back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio.
The call ended the way that LaPierre had hoped it would: with Trump espousing NRA talking points in the Oval Office and warning of the radical steps he said Democrats wanted to take in violation of the Second Amendment.
“We have very, very strong background checks right now, but we have sort of missing areas and areas that don’t complete the whole circle,” the president told reporters Tuesday afternoon, adding, “I have to tell you, that it’s a mental problem.”
“Democrats would, I believe, give up the Second Amendment,” Trump said. “A lot of the people that put me where I am are strong believers in the Second Amendment, and I am also.”
For Trump, his dealings with LaPierre and other gun rights advocates in recent weeks have been a reminder that even if his initial instinct after the mass shootings this month was to say he would press for aggressive gun legislation, any such push would be seen as a betrayal of the NRA members who helped elect him.
At the NRA’s annual convention in 2017, Trump assured the group’s members: “You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you.” And that is what he was doing on his call with LaPierre, according to two people familiar with their conversation, assuring LaPierre that even after another round of mass shootings, he was not interested in legislation establishing universal background checks and that his focus would be on the mental health of the gunmen, not their guns.
Trump, who did most of the talking on the call with LaPierre, according to those briefed on the conversation, made it clear that he believes there are ways to scrutinize people’s fitness for gun ownership other than the current proposals. But his latest comments on guns were the strongest sign to date that he is unlikely to make bipartisan gun legislation a priority this fall, when Congress returns from its summer recess. Without his backing, congressional Republicans said, any chance of a bipartisan bill passing the Senate is likely to be dead on arrival.
Instead, the president told LaPierre that he wants to focus on mental health and access to juvenile criminal records. Those measures fall far short of the sweeping new restrictions that Democrats sought and that Trump said he was prepared to endorse in the immediate aftermath of the mass shootings on Aug. 3 and 4 that left 31 dead.
The president’s remarks also demonstrated how the NRA, which spent $30 million on Trump’s campaign in 2016 and stuck with him when other Republicans wavered in their support, still wields great influence over the White House, even as its own future is in question. The organization has been mired in investigations into its finances by two attorneys general, in New York and Washington, as well as a legal battle with its former advertising firm and calls from its own board members for change.
But those problems have not diminished the group’s influence in the West Wing, despite Trump’s frequent insistence to aides that LaPierre and his team are “going bankrupt.”
In a statement, LaPierre expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the call. “I spoke to the president today,” he said. “We discussed the best ways to prevent these types of tragedies. President Trump is a strong 2A President and supports our right to keep and bear arms!”
Aides to Trump insist that he is still seeking legislative action. But they acknowledge that the president’s definition of background checks is different from the type of universal background checks that Democrats have urged him to pursue. And the type of sweeping bill he is discussing — which at the moment is loosely defined and could contain several different piecemeal proposals — would be viewed warily by a number of Republican senators, as well as Democrats, who would consider it either too much or too little.
The weakening of Trump’s stated interest in pursuing what he had described this month as “very meaningful background checks” fits a pattern of behavior.
In the past, when Trump has shown a willingness to compromise on gun legislation after a mass shooting, some West Wing officials have made sure to secure an audience with the president for LaPierre and Christopher W. Cox, the NRA’s former top lobbyist, who resigned in June. After the February 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 students and staff members were killed, Trump expressed support for universal background checks, keeping guns away from mentally ill people and restricting gun sales for some young adults.
But that support quickly evaporated after a late-night Oval Office meeting with NRA officials. Trump later threatened to veto a background check bill.
The NRA has not been pressing its case alone. Trump has heard from a wide range of conservative allies who have warned him that he will imperil his reelection chances if he makes a deal with Democrats on guns.
The country’s leading gun group has been embattled this year amid internal fighting, investigations, financial strains and scandal. A revolt against LaPierre has already led to the departures of the NRA’s president and its top lobbyist, as well as five board members, including NASCAR team owner Richard Childress, who resigned this week.
Many of those who oppose LaPierre internally harbor hard-line gun rights views and want him gone before the 2020 election cycle begins in earnest. But the period after the shootings has provided LaPierre with an opening to show off the NRA’s organizing muscle.
Earlier this month, he said he “opposes any legislation that unfairly infringes upon the rights of law-abiding citizens.” Willes K. Lee, the second vice president of the NRA board and a key ally of LaPierre, went further, tweeting recently that “Nothing short of disarming America satisfies @democrats. Give them NOTHING,” and even promoting the hashtag “#allguncontrolisracist.”
This year, the House passed its first two significant gun control measures in a quarter century. One of the bills would require background checks at gun shows and on internet sites, where private buyers and sellers can arrange to meet in person to complete a sale. A second bill would increase the waiting period if a potential buyer does not immediately pass a background check, a measure aimed at closing a loophole used by Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.
Those measures have stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate.
So have the so-called red flag laws, which give the police extra powers to confiscate firearms, and were the subject of a new study released this week by researchers at the University of California, Davis, which said that “this urgent, individualized intervention can play a role in efforts to prevent mass shootings.”

Texto completo: On the eve of our first Cap Times Idea Fest two years ago, six of us dined at the Tornado Club Steak House downtown, and half of those at the table had won a Pulitzer Prize in journalism.
Madison native David Maraniss wanted to treat his boss, Washington Post Editor Marty Baron, to an authentic Wisconsin restaurant, and the rustic, supper-club vibe fit the bill. We were joined by Washington Post reporter and author Amy Goldstein, who was back in Wisconsin after publishing her book "Janesville: An American Story," a seminal treatment of a community losing its major employer, in this case a General Motors assembly plant. Each of the three is a Pulitzer winner.
Maraniss, whose father, Elliott, was the Cap Times' editor decades ago, is the author and Post editor who has helped with Idea Fest every year, including this fall. He interviewed Baron on stage the next afternoon after the Tornado dinner and Goldstein spoke at an Idea Fest session about her book.
Baron is a giant in contemporary American journalism. He gained cultural celebrity from his work as top editor of the Boston Globe and was portrayed in the Academy Award-winning movie "Spotlight" about the priest child mo-lestation scandal in that city. Baron is now the Post's top editor.
So why am I doing all this name-dropping?
It's because of Bernie Sanders, who has vociferously complained that Baron's newspaper is biased against his presidential candidacy because it is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Only in recent years has "mainstream" been pejoratively added by critics to describe the largest and most prestigious brands in journalism. Now institutions like the Post and the New York Times are said by some to be part of a "corporate journalism" cabal, the implication being that ownership interests seep into and skew reporting outcomes.
When Sanders recently blasted media coverage of his campaign, he sounded like Donald Trump.
"I talk about that all of the time," Sanders said of Amazon paying "nothing" in taxes. "And then I wonder why the Washington Post, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon, doesn't write particularly good articles about me. I don't know why. But I guess maybe there's a connection."
Later, backtracking on CNN, Sanders said, "I think my criticism of the corporate media is not that they are anti-Bernie that they wake up, you know, in the morning and say, 'What could we do to hurt Bernie Sanders?' that's not the case, that Jeff Bezos gets on the phone to the Washington Post."
Well, that's exactly what you just implied, Bernie.
Sanders and his campaign whined throughout the 2016 campaign about a media bias helping Hillary Clinton, a laughable contention given its fixation on her email problems.
Sanders and company have also been attacking the New York Times. When a recent Times story from the Iowa campaign trail described how Sanders "has grounded his campaign in championing ideas rather than establishing human connections," the Sanders' campaign and his backers in online journalism went nuts. One pro-Bernie podcaster described the reporter who wrote the piece as the "New York Times' Senior Anti-Bernie Correspondent."
EDITOR'S COLUMN Google the terms "Sanders" and "media" and you'll find all sorts of critiques by lesser-known online journalists alleging bias by the agenda-setting big dogs of media. They have it "in for" Bernie; this alleged anti-Bernie bias is "documented" whatever that means and so forth.
The Post's Baron responded in a statement: "Sen. Sanders is a member of a large club of politicians of every ideology who complain about their coverage. Contrary to the conspiracy theory the senator seems to favor, Jeff Bezos allows our newsroom to operate with full independence, as our reporters and editors can attest."
As evidenced by the priest abuse expose in heavily Catholic Boston, it is clear that Baron is as committed to the truth as any American journalist.
Oh, it's not hard to understand what Sanders is doing here his campaign is flagging and he wants to work the refs. So he gripes about "corporate" media. Top aide Jeff Weaver recently faulted coverage by CNN, MSNBC and major newspapers for reporting what he regards as false narratives about Sanders' declining prospects.
So do I trust Marty Baron or Bernie Sanders? That's easy.
Look, I don't give a hoot that voters apparently are deciding that Bernie Sanders has passed his "use by" date, but his effort to drag down our most credible journalists with him is repugnant.
American journalism is fighting a two-front war these days. One front is economic the advertising models that made journalism so easy to afford have vastly contracted, putting severe pressure on the capacity of newsrooms everywhere.
The other front is the war over journalistic integrity, already under years of attack by a president whose hatred of the media is one of the top two or three pillars of his political brand.
Think about it: Does anything outrage you more than someone contending that Fox News balances out the Post or Times? Fox is a fully and deftly integrated propaganda arm of the Trump administration, while the Post and Times employ some of the nation's finest journalists and are always searching for how they can do better, whether that is reporting more voices from Trump's red-state America or looking deeply into campaign finance trends.
To have Trump always bellowing about "fake news," well, that's baked in, but to have a Democrat at least someone who campaigns as a Democrat joining in on the media conspiracy chorus is just too much.
If Bernie's campaign is destined to drown anyway, he should at least have the decency to not try to yank the reputation of our embattled press under water with him.
Because, Senator, the enemies of a strong and vibrant press do not need your help. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund ; Paul Fanlund is editor and publisher of The Capital Times

Texto completo: Silvestre Revueltas es uno de los mayores compositores de México. Sus obras para orquesta sinfónica y de cámara destacan en el ámbito de la música mexicana de concierto por su originalidad, espíritu libre y filiación popular. En la voz de Revueltas (1899-1940) resuenan con maestría manifestaciones del alma popular que, siendo profundamente mexicanas, se resisten a caer en los estereotipos y corsés del arte nacionalista y tienen una expresión muy personal, cargada a la vez de rebeldía, humor, compasión, drama, alegría y solidaridad.
Durante su vida Revueltas tuvo una conexión importante con Estados Unidos, donde vivió, estudió y trabajó entre 1917 y 1929. Fue en Estados Unidos donde Revueltas –que residió en Austin y San Antonio (Texas), Chicago (Illinois) y Mobile (Alabama) – realizó buena parte de su formación musical y dio sus primeros pasos como compositor, si bien la porción más importante y significativa de su obra la compuso en México durante la década de 1930.
Pero fue en Chicago donde Revueltas tuvo contacto con una actividad musical que sería clave para él: la música para el cine. En Chicago y luego en otras ciudades estadounidenses, Revueltas tocó en orquestas de salas de cine mudo, acompañando a las películas con música, y ello le habría dado un aprendizaje clave que luego se concretó en sus propias partituras para cine.
‘Redes’ es la más importante de todas ellas, una película en la que la música compuesta por Revueltas tiene un papel central. Tanto que pareciera que la acción estuviese ensamblada para apoyar a la música y no lo contrario y usual en el cine.
La CSO Latino Alliance, un grupo de latinos interesados en ampliar la difusión de la música clásica y de la Orquesta Sinfónica de Chicago en la comunidad hispana de la ciudad, exhibirá la película ‘Redes’ para celebrar su quinto aniversario, este jueves 5 de septiembre a partir de las 6 pm en Symphony Center (220 S. Michigan Ave., en el centro de Chicago).
Y todo ello coincide con el centenario del arribo de Revueltas a Chicago, que vivió en la ciudad entre 1919 y 1925. ‘Redes’ será exhibida vía el nuevo DVD de la película clásica, lanzado por la disquera Naxos, que ofrece una remasterización de las imágenes realizada por el World Cinema Project del cineasta Martin Scorsese y con una nueva grabación de la banda sonora compuesta por Revueltas con la orquesta PostClassical Ensemble bajo la batuta de su director Ángel Gil Ordóñez, quien ha sido uno de los impulsores más destacados de la obre de Revueltas en Estados Unidos en décadas recientes.
Gil Ordóñez asistirá al evento de la CSO Latino Alliance y conversará con la audiencia sobre ‘Redes’, la obra de Revueltas y su trabajo en ella.
Además, se tocará en ese evento el Segundo Cuarteto de Cuerdas ‘Magueyes’ de Revueltas y el Mariachi Herencia Mexicana interpretará algunas canciones clásicas de la época revolucionaria mexicana. Cabe señalar que el citado cuarteto de cuerdas fue presentado por el compositor estadounidense Aaron Copland por estrenado en Estados Unidos en el primer Festival de Yaddo (Nueva York) en 1932, con el violinista, y luego director asociado de la Sinfónica de Chicago Hans Lange, al frente del conjunto de cuerdas. Copland además habló auspiciosamente de ‘Redes’ en un artículo publicado en 1937 en The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/14/specials/copland-mexican.html) con motivo del estreno neoyorquino de la película.
La película ‘Redes’, estrenada en México en 1936 pero filmada y editada entre 1934 y 1935, es notable por su fotografía, obra del estadounidense Paul Strand, uno de los más influyentes fotógrafos del Siglo 20, y sobre todo por la música de Revueltas. La relevancia de la música es tal que, en gran medida, la edición del filme se realizó para acoplarse a su dinámica y las escenas mayores de la película (que retrata la lucha de pescadores de Alvarado, Veracruz, por liberarse de la opresión y la pobreza) transcurren en una dicotomía fotografía/música, sin diálogo pero con poderosas capacidades expresivas.
Además, si se tiene en cuenta que ‘Redes’ fue producida en los primeros años del cine sonoro y cuando el género mismo de música especialmente compuesta para una película estaba en su etapa naciente, la relevancia de esta obra de Revueltas es clara, a lo que cabe añadir sus virtudes musicales intrínsecas y su poderoso sentido a la vez épico e individualmente emotivo.
Pero ‘Redes’ tuvo durante décadas un problema: la banda sonora original de la música de Revueltas que integra el filme es deficiente, tanto por la tecnología de grabación de su época como por la interpretación en sí, por lo que la experiencia musical al ver la película era incompleta. Inclusive, por años ‘Redes’ sólo podía disfrutarse en las contadas ocasiones contadas en que era exhibida en cines o salas de concierto con proyección y música en vivo.
El DVD de ‘Redes’ con la banda sonora dirigida por Gil Ordóñez que será presentado este 5 de septiembre en Chicago por la CSO Latino Alliance resuelve en gran medida esos asuntos: permite una poderosa audición de la partitura de Revueltas y está disponible para el gran público. Es por ello una presentación de gran mérito artístico y educativo, al mostrar al público de Chicago un producto de la época de oro del cine mexicano, con música de uno de los mayores compositores de México y con una versión, el DVD con el filme remasterizado y la banda sonora dirigida por Gil Ordóñez, que le da nueva fuerza y proyección a esa obra clásica.

Williams named winner of Game Changer Award

Texto completo: The Chicago Tribune's Food & Dining Game Changer Award, established in 2018, is presented annually to a chef, restaurateur or other industry figure whose work has brought significant, positive change to the restaurant industry as a whole, and to the Chicago dining scene in particular. The award was presented Aug. 13 during the launch party for Chicago Tribune Food Bowl at City Hall restaurant in Fulton Market.
This year's recipient is chef Erick Williams, whose rise to prominence is as old school as it gets. His career began at the salad station at the late, great MK restaurant, a typical starting point for a raw beginner. Williams worked his way up the ladder, at every station in the house, until he was named MK's executive chef in 2008.
Williams continued to uphold MK's high culinary standards -- earning the restaurant three stars from the Tribune in 2013 -- and remained the executive chef until the restaurant closed, reportedly over a lease dispute, in 2017. By that time, Williams had another restaurant to oversee, County Barbeque on Taylor Street.
A little more than a year later, Williams took his talents to Hyde Park, opening Virtue in November 2018. As the name suggests, Virtue's mission is as much an ethical one as a culinary one; it's deeply ingrained in the community, and Williams has made his kitchen a virtual incubator, recruiting young and inexperienced workers to learn by working alongside industry veterans.
This hands-on instruction came without any sacrifice in quality; Virtue quickly became one of the best new restaurants in Chicago, earning a three-star review from this critic in January. The accolades didn't end there; in July, Eater named Virtue one of the best new restaurants in the country, and The New York Times profiled Williams in a story titled "16 Black Chefs Changing Food in America."
With his consistent culinary excellence, his outreach to young workers and community commitment, and for attracting a national spotlight to South Side restaurants, Williams has changed the restaurant game in Chicago and beyond.
Food Bowl, a celebration of Chicago's culinary scene with more than 100 events, runs through Sept. 1. See the schedule at foodbowlchicago.com.

There's more to cicadas than the perfect soundtrack

Texto completo: of summer If the calls of hundreds of glittering cicadas don't remind you of the dog days of summer, what will? "When I hear the cicada I think of summertime and BBQs," self-proclaimed bug guy Christopher Wade said Monday. His official title is environmental program administrator for the pesticide section at Delaware's Department of Agriculture, but bug guy is a lot easier to say. The unique sound that cicadas make is one of the most fascinating things about them, he said. Another is their complex life cycle.
Here are a few things to know about the bulky, big-eyed insects found in so many Delawareans' back yards.
They're likely dog-day cicadas You may have heard that cicadas only emerge from the ground once every 17 years.
While that is true of some cicadas, others have much shorter lifespans. Generations of these bugs overlap, which means they emerge from the ground annually, Wade said.
In the U.S., they're often referred to as dog-day cicadas, because they molt and take flight in July and August, during the hottest days of summer, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Delaware does also have periodical cicadas — the kind that have 13- to 17-year life cycles — but the next big batch of those isn't due until 2021. The group that typically emerges in Delaware is known as Brood X, or the "Great Eastern Brood."
Every 17 years, Brood X cicadas emerge from the ground, lay eggs, and then die off in several weeks. After mating, females cut slits in the bark of young twigs and lay hundreds of eggs, according to the USDA.
Six to 10 weeks later, the eggs hatch and newborn nymphs drop to the ground, where they burrow into to the soil and feed on the juices of plant roots. They go through several stages of development underground before emerging 17 years later, molting and taking flight.
The Great Eastern Brood has the greatest range and concentration of any of the 17-year cicadas, which means the year after next there will be a lot of them.
Broods can number in the billions.
That sound is a mating call "They are so loud," Wade said. "If there's more than them hatching, then, of course, the combined noise could be louder."
The sound you hear is actually the mating call of the male cicada and can be louder than a lawn mower. In a swarm, the high-pitched hum can reach 85 decibels, which is slightly louder than a diesel train, reported the New York Times.
Cicada songs are painful to birds' ears and male cicadas from the same brood often stick together in order to scare away predators.
The bugs have a set of ridged, drum-like organs called tymbals, which vibrate very quickly when pulled in by tiny muscles in their abdomens, according to cicadamania.com.
The chirping and clicking noises can be heard by females up to a mile away.
The sound can also damage human ears. If, for instance, you were to pick a cicada up and hold it next to your head, you could end up with hearing damage, the Cicada Mania website warns.
Female cicadas, in comparison, are mostly silent.
They won't hurt you Cicadas generally don't do that much damage. And they don't sting or bite.
Sometimes confused with locusts, they do not feed on trees once they emerge from the ground, though they cut slits in them to lay their eggs. As nymphs, they feed on the juice of tree roots but, again, don't cause significant damage.
"Their numbers aren't great enough to cause substantial damage to property," Wade said.
The only trees that may require protection are young or ornamental fruit trees. If a female cicada picks one to lay its eggs in, it may lose most or all its branches. But basic garden netting should be enough to stop the damage, experts say.
But these creepy wasps might Cicadas don't sting, but large wasps called cicada killers may attack if threatened.
Big solitary wasps that nest in the ground and feed on cicadas, they generally keep to themselves. They are mostly black with yellow bands and can reach up to 1.5 inches in length, according to the USDA.
"Like any other wasp, they can sting, but they're very docile," said Wade, who has petted a cicada killer on the head before.
"I'm just a weird bug guy, but they're very docile," he said.
If you see one, Wade recommends leaving it alone.
If you do step on a cicada killer or disturb its nest, the females have big stingers that they will use to defend themselves.
The males don't have stingers at all.
"They're actually beneficial because they keep the (cicada) population in check," Wade said.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- Even as the United States and the Taliban seem close to a deal on an American troop withdrawal, the Islamic State in Afghanistan is making clear that it stands to inherit the role of violent spoiler if any peace agreement is reached.
That message was punctuated on Saturday by a suicide bomber who killed 63 wedding celebrants in Kabul, mostly from the country's Shiite minority, in an attack that the Islamic State attributed to one of its loyalists from Pakistan. It was among the most devastating attacks in Afghanistan claimed by the Islamic State in the five years since it first established a beachhead in the eastern part of the country.
The bombing was a painful reminder of the immediate threat posed by the militants: that they can slip through tight security in the capital and cause the kind of carnage that devastates a vulnerable community, while cranking up pressure on a government already on the edge.
But the Islamic State also poses a longer-term danger that the United States military and Afghan officials worry about: It has positioned itself to gain in the event of a peace deal with the Taliban. The Islamic State is set to grow if an extreme layer of insurgents breaks away from the Taliban to keep fighting, and it is likely to thrive if a hastily managed American military withdrawal leaves chaos behind.
"This is a replacement for the Taliban," said Abdul Rahim Muslimdost, an Islamist cleric who has been jailed in Pakistan and in the American detention camp at Guantánamo Bay.
In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Muslimdost explained how he helped create the Islamic State chapter in Afghanistan -- mostly, he said, from former Pakistani and Afghan Taliban members. He said he had since dissociated himself from it, contending that it had been infiltrated by Pakistan's military and intelligence services.
That view is shared by some Afghanistan security officials. They have consistently portrayed the Islamic State as the continuation of what they describe as Pakistan's policy of "strategic depth," in which it exerts influence in Afghanistan through militant proxies.
The Taliban, whose leadership operates out of Pakistan, had long been seen as that country's main source of leverage in Afghanistan. But even though international pressure has led Pakistan to support the peace process with the Taliban, Afghan officials accuse the country's military establishment of investing in the Islamic State's local chapter to maintain its influence.
They say there is overlap between the support networks in Afghanistan and Pakistan that enable the Islamic State's suicide bombings and the ones that helped the Taliban's most lethal arm, the Haqqani network, carry out urban attacks for years.
"The responsibility of all these attacks -- which are carried out with same tactics as the Taliban -- goes to the Taliban," said Massoud Andarabi, Afghanistan's interior minister, even after the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the wedding bombing on Saturday.
"It is the Taliban who have created the networks that make possible such terrorist attacks in our cities, and now they claim responsibility when they want for an attack and not when they don't," Mr. Andarabi said.
American officials who have monitored the Islamic State's development say there is no evidence that its chapter in Afghanistan gets support from Pakistan's military establishment. Pakistani officials have also rejected the accusation, saying the military has backed away from its policy of nurturing militant groups. Islamic State affiliates have tried to carry out attacks in Pakistan, but with less frequency, as better security measures are in place there.
One American official acknowledged that there might be some modest overlap between the Islamic State and the Taliban, but described it as mostly being among low-ranking profiteers, not decision makers or trainers.
Sher Mohammad Karimi, a retired former chief of the Afghan Army, said it was worrying that Afghan officials and their American allies seemed to disagree about the extent of the Islamic State threat, and its source, at such a desperate time.
"It is a fact that Pakistan wants a weak government in Afghanistan so it can fulfill its strategic goals," Mr. Karimi said. "But defending this country is our responsibility, and we should well prepare our forces."
Different parts of the American government disagree over whether the local Islamic State chapter has either the capability or the ambition to strike the United States directly. But they agree that the group poses a threat that the United States needs to watch by maintaining counterterrorism units in Afghanistan, so that attacks like Al Qaeda's strikes in 2001 cannot be repeated.
Two critics of the United States in the region, Russia and Iran, claim that the Islamic State here is being nurtured by the Americans in order to destabilize everything around it.
Since it was formed around 2014, the Islamic State's Afghan chapter has been steeped in a long history of militancy in the region, a legacy of the C.I.A.'s use of Islamic jihadists, the mujahedeen, in its effort to defeat the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
Mr. Muslimdost, the cleric who helped to found the Islamic State cell, was part of the mujahedeen effort. And his complex personal history epitomizes the legacy of perpetual insurgency and violence surrounding Afghanistan.
During the 1980s, he ran a library and published an Arabic magazine in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, a transit stop for the Arab fighters, including Osama bin Laden, who were coming to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan.
After the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to destroy Mr. bin Laden's new group, Al Qaeda, Mr. Muslimdost was among the hundreds of militants sent to Guantánamo, where he spent three years. He says that he had no formal role with the Taliban, and that Pakistan had wrongfully handed him over to the Americans.
After he was released from Guantánamo, Mr. Muslimdost wrote a book that was critical of Pakistan, in which he also described a dream about the formation of a global caliphate. The book landed him in a Pakistani prison.
When he came out, he allied with, and sought protection from, Pakistani militants who were fighting the state.
In the Islamic State's 2014 declaration of a caliphate from Iraq, Mr. Muslimdost said he saw the opportunity for the fulfillment of a lifelong dream: that the Muslim world would unite under one government.
But right away, disagreements plagued the group he helped to form. He wanted to fight in Pakistan, but other members had already established the base in eastern Afghanistan that they still hold.
Mr. Muslimdost said he realized that the group was out of his hands -- infiltrated, he said, by elements of Pakistan's intelligence agency, in order to push what was left of the militancy in Pakistan across the border. That infiltration intensified as the United States kept killing the group's original leaders with drone strikes, he said.
Today, the Islamic State is active or present in nearly two dozen districts along the border with Pakistan, despite strong pressure from the American and Afghan militaries. The Afghan intelligence agency says it has also broken up Islamic State cells inside the capital, operating in universities and recruiting among the city's educated elite.
It is possible that concerns about the Islamic State could become a catalyst in the search for a deal with the Taliban. The two militant groups have fought many turf battles, and American officials say that in talks, the Taliban have said they do not want Afghanistan to become another Syria or Iraq.
But there is also widespread anxiety that the Islamic State has positioned itself for the fracturing of the Taliban in the event of a peace deal. Mr. Muslimdost agrees with that assessment, seeing Pakistan at work behind the scenes.
"Remember my words," Mr. Muslimdost said. "If there is a settlement with the Taliban, and they become part of the government, Pakistan has the replacement for them ready already. They will continue this war in Afghanistan in the name of the Islamic State."

Routine hits to the head, not just concussions, may cause brain damage in football players, study finds

Texto completo: Concussions aren’t the only type of head injuries that damage the brains of football players. Other hits — the ones football players sustain routinely while practicing or playing competitively — can also cause observable structural changes to the brain.
That’s the deeply troubling finding reported last week in a study published in the journal Science Advances.
“Public perception is that the big hits are the only ones that matter. It’s what people talk about and what we often see being replayed on TV,” said senior author Brad Mahon in a released statement. Mahon is a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University and scientific director of the Program for Translational Brain Mapping at the University of Rochester, in Rochester, N.Y.
“The big hits are definitely bad,” he added, “but with the focus on the big hits, the public is missing what’s likely causing the long-term damage in players’ brains. It’s not just the concussions. It’s everyday hits, too.”
How the study was done
For the study, Mahon and his colleagues had 38 University of Rochester Division III football players wear accelerometers — devices that measure acceleration forces — in their helmets for an entire season (2011, 2012 or 2013). The accelerometers detected all hits of 10 gs or more.
To put the force of 10 gs in perspective, Carnegie Mellon’s press release on the study notes the following: “Astronauts on the space shuttle experienced 3 gs during lift-off. Race car drivers feel the effects of 6 gs, and car crashes can produce brief forces of more than 100 gs.”
Each player also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their brain within two weeks before and after the season.
The accelerometers revealed that the players sustained a combined total of more than 19,000 hits of at least 10 g force while participating in the study. Most of those hits — 59 percent — occurred during practices, while 37 percent occurred during games and 4 percent during scrimmages or other team gatherings.
The median force of the hits was about 25 gs, which means, of course, that half of the hits exceeded that amount.
Only two of those hits — affecting two players — were concussions, but the MRIs revealed that two-thirds of the remaining players experienced a decrease in the structural integrity of their brain — specifically, a reduction in the integrity of the white matter (the fibers that carry messages between neurons) in their midbrain.
The more hits a player experienced, the greater the amount of damage.
The study also found that hits in which the head twisted were more damaging to the midbrain than linear, or head-on hits.
‘Canary in the coal mine’
Why did the researchers look for changes in the midbrain? Because, as Mahon told New York Times’ reporter Gretchen Reynolds, the midbrain is particularly susceptible to hits to the head and thus acts as a kind of “canary in the coal mine” — an advanced warning of the silent damage that sub-concussive hits (ones that don’t produce the dizziness, headaches, ringing in the ears and nausea of full-blown concussions) might be doing to the brain.
To help validate these findings, the researchers also looked at white matter in the midbrains of 29 University of Rochester athletes who had sustained concussions while playing various other contact sports. The players had undergone MRIs within 72 hours of their concussion.
In addition, the researchers studied MRI images of the midbrains of 58 other individuals, including a few students who had played non-contact sports at the University of Rochester. None in this “control” group had a history of concussion.
The players who had experienced a concussion — but not those in the control group — exhibited the same kind of changes in the white matter of their midbrains as the football players in the study.
They also had higher levels of tau, a protein, in their blood. Elevated blood levels of tau are associated with neurodegenerative brain diseases like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which has been linked to the early deaths of many professional football players.
‘Settled science’
Mahon and his colleagues did not test the University of Rochester players to see if the brain changes that showed up on the MRIs had an effect on their cognitive skills. Nor did they scan the brains of the players a third time to see if their white matter returned to normal.
Mahon told the Times that he presumed some healing was likely to have taken place because the veteran players who participated in the study showed no signs of damage to their midbrains before the season, only afterward.
Still, the study’s findings are in line with other research that has shown the cumulative and long-term effects that sub-concussive hits can have on the brain.
“It’s close to being settled science that repetitive head hits are their own source of permanent damage to the brain, independent of concussions,” Mahon told reporter Justin Martin of the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. “In the mainstream discourse, I don’t think we’re anything close to that being the settled understanding.”
“That’s potentially a very dangerous attitude,” he added.
FMI: You can read the study in full on the website for Science Advances, which is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Funders for the study included the National Football League Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Army. Based on this research, Carnegie Mellon University has taken out a provisional patent for a device that assesses “asymptomatic brain injury caused by head injuries.”

Texto completo: Timing is everything. On Monday, we explored how we would handle the missing details surrounding Apple’s forthcoming streaming service, Apple TV+, including the still unknown cost and launch date of the platform. Today, we may have been given an answer on the former.
Apple is reportedly “weighing” a $9.99 per month cost following a free trial, Bloomberg reports. Given the disparity in library size between Apple, which will house exclusive originals and little to no licensed back catalogs of content, and its well stocked streaming competition, this seems high on a relative value proposition. For reference, Disney plans to launch Disney+ at $6.99 per month; the ad-supported version of Hulu costs $5.99 per month, while the ad-free version runs at $11.99 per month; Amazon Prime costs $12.99 per month; and Netflix’s standard plan (it’s most popular tier) is $12.99 per month. At Apple’s current price point, its hit rate of success for quality content is going to have to be very high.
SEE ALSO: Ranking Entertainment Conglomerates By Their Wall Street Valuations
Casting further doubt on that cost is the number of originals that may or may not be available at launch. According to The New York Times , “As of March, five reportedly had finished shooting.” Apple has lined up a star-studded roster of exclusives, but remains a complete unknown in the content development area. Dating back to 2017, there have been multiple reports that Apple TV+ is aiming for “broad appeal” without any nudity, raw language, violence or potentially controversial content. Those elements aren’t necessary to create quality programming, but the active steps to avoid them speaks volumes.
The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Apple has committed $6 billion for original shows and movies after an initial first-year budget of at least $1 billion was originally reported in 2017. Disney+ will similarly invest around $1 billion into content within its first year with that number expected to rise to about $2.5 billion by 2024. Industry analysts project Disney+ to attract around 30 million subscribers by that time. WarnerMedia’s HBO Max is eyeing 50 million subscribers within five years and 70 million overall.
Per Bloomberg, “Analysts have suggested Apple TV+ could top 100 million subscribers in the next half-decade, which would make it a major challenger to Netflix and Amazon.” Apple boast the greatest potential market penetration with 1.4 billion active devices worldwide. The service is said to be launching sometime in the fall (September to November).

Here to Help; How to Make Homemade Meals Simpler

Texto completo: I'll never forget when I realized that I was cooking dinner all wrong. My hungry preschooler had just thrown a Category 5 meltdown while I was making burritos -- which took me about 30 minutes, using a half-dozen pots and dishes. When my husband came home later, he dumped the cold beans, rice, and cheese on a tortilla, microwaved it, and peacefully sat down to eat -- all within two minutes. Why hadn't I thought of the microwave? This, I realized, was how to do burrito night!
As a former cookbook editor and kitchen-equipment reviewer, I pride myself on being a good cook. But since having kids, I've learned to simplify my approach, which allows me to spend quality time with my daughters.
For many families, the job of making dinner falls on one parent, and it's hard work figuring out what to make every night, let alone what kids will want to eat.
"Food blog proliferation has pushed forward this idea even more that this is all kind of fun for everybody, and that it's relatively easy to come up with something easy to eat, when it's not," said Lesley Téllez, author of "Eat Mexico: Recipes from Mexico City's Streets, Markets and Fondas," who cooks nightly for her two young children.
To find better strategies, I asked accomplished home cooks and cookbook authors -- who are also parents -- for their real-world tips on making meals simpler and family time more relaxed.
Invest in timesaving tools
As I came to learn after burrito-gate, there's probably no better friend to time-strapped parents than a microwave (Wirecutter has several recommendations). "We live and die by our microwave," said Francis Lam, host of The Splendid Table. He often makes dinner in the morning, and his wife later reheats it in the microwave to feed their 3-year-old daughter before Lam returns from work.
Electric pressure cookers and slow cookers both require little attention -- just dump in the ingredients and push a button. If you have a little time before dinner, go with an electric pressure cooker, which cooks something in half the time (sometimes less) it would take in the oven or on the stove. Ms. Téllez uses hers to make beans from scratch in 45 minutes. (We recommend the Instant Pot Duo 6-Quart in its guide to electric pressure cookers.)
If you prefer to let food cook overnight or while you're at work, choose a slow cooker. "Slow cookers were something I totally turned my nose up at in my more chef-y career days, and I now think are genius," said Sarah Copeland, author of "Every Day Is Saturday: Recipes + Strategies for Easy Cooking, Every Day of the Week." She'll braise pork shoulder or short ribs overnight, then stow the meal in the fridge to serve dinner later to her 4- and 8-year-old kids. If you don't have a slow cooker, Wirecutter recommends the Hamilton Beach Set & Forget, and once you get one, NYT Cooking features a variety of easy slow-cooker recipes.
Another no-attention-required appliance is the rice cooker, which you can use to cook more than just what its namesake suggests. "I throw on the rice cooker with rice or quinoa or a mix of whole grains, to get a blank slate going for dinner," said Ms. Copeland. We have a thorough guide to rice cookers at Wirecutter, but ultimately recommend the Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy NS-ZCC10. I regularly use a rice cooker and an Instant Pot in tandem, setting both to cook before I pick my kids up so that dinner is ready when we get home.
Tara O'Brady, author of "Seven Spoons" and mom to 11- and 13-year-old boys, uses an upright blender to make quick puréed soups. "They come together lightning fast in a blender, especially one with a cook function," she said. "The rest of dinner might be grilled cheese sandwiches, but there's a homemade, hearty soup to accompany, and I feel like that's a win." (The Vitamix 5200, which we recommend in our guide to blenders, will heat soup, although it won't actually cook the ingredients.)
Sheet pans can also do double duty for baking and making easy dinners. "I love my sheet pans: It's a way to make delicious dinners with minimal cleanup (this is key)," said Emily Weinstein, deputy editor of The New York Times Food section and editor of NYT Cooking, who has a 21-month-old daughter. Ms. Weinstein will pile vegetables and a protein onto one pan (she recommends this recipe for sheet-pan squash and sausages served over farro or herbs), or she'll bake carrots on one pan and meatballs on another (she also recommends these four simple shape-and-bake meatball recipes). We recommend Nordic Ware half-sheet pans, if you're looking for good ones.
Maximize your freezer
On nights that you're cooking something special, take advantage of the effort by making extra to freeze. "I always try to make a double batch of Bolognese, meatballs, or falafel, or simply cooked beans in their broth," said Ms. O'Brady. "Quinoa, pasta, and grains also hold well in the freezer. I'll roast a second chicken, or plan on extra when braising or grilling meats and vegetables that freeze or keep well."
Frozen dinners certainly extend past meals you've made. "I love frozen or pre-prepared dumplings or tamales from Trader Joe's or bought, wrapped, and frozen, from our great local vendors," said Ms. Copeland. "These are two things I serve about once a month each that feels like a complete night off." And freezing specialty items you love can help elevate even the simplest meals. Ms. Téllez freezes freshly made tortillas from a tortilleria near her home in Queens, N.Y., then defrosts them as needed.
Collect a few back-pocket dinners
For those times when you don't have a dinner plan, try to learn a few dishes that you can always fall back on. For Ms. Téllez, that often means hot dogs wrapped and baked in Pillsbury crescent rolls, served with ketchup and mustard, along with frozen veggies or a spinach salad on the side. For Mr. Lam, that's generally spaghetti aglio e olio -- pasta mixed with garlic sautéed in olive oil -- combined with whatever vegetables he has on hand. For Ms. Weinstein, it's a breakfast classic: "My now-and-forever easy dinner is scrambled eggs with toast. It's one of my favorite foods, and I can always make it, no matter how tired I am."
And dinner doesn't always need to be cooked. "I rely on grazing, platter-style meals at least once a week, and much more in the summer," said Ms. Copeland. "This lets me get away with serving all the things -- meats, cheeses, crackers, vegetables, dips, olives, bread, hummus, or whatever we have on any given day -- in new and inventive ways that always end up to be a please-all meal."
On the nights when you really don't have energy -- maybe a child is sick, or you're late getting home from work -- it's worth budgeting for takeout, especially if it will relieve your stress level. "I try to leave one day a week when we order out," said Ms. Téllez. "Just having the one day of a break is really nice. I try to keep a Wednesday or Thursday, when I'm in a rut."
Do what works for your family
"I 100 percent believe in the power of a family sitting down to eat together every night. I also know that is not possible every night," said Mr. Lam. "You don't have to beat yourself up."
This forgiving approach extends to rethinking what mealtime looks like for your family. Because of a busy schedule, Ms. Copeland has made breakfast the main mealtime in her household. "Evening is, collectively, our most worn-out time of the day, so keeping dinner simple and something that doesn't absolutely have to check off all the boxes has taken so much pressure off of us as parents, and made our evenings much breezier and more enjoyable."
If (and when!) getting dinner on the table feels like a chore, the best advice is to keep it simple. "In all aspects of parenting, my goal has been to make everything as easy and low key as I can, when I can," Ms. Weinstein said. "If I get mired in the details or stressed about hitting a goal that ultimately isn't terribly important, I just won't be my best self for my daughter."

Texto completo: In a crisis, a person considering suicide needs someone to talk to -- that's why there is a suicide hotline so people can call in rather than take an irreversible step. But at a time of trouble, it might be difficult to remember the number, 800-273-8255 (TALK).
Enter 988.
That's right, just as 911 is the number to call for help, there soon could be a three-digit number to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The New York Times reported last week that the Federal Communications Commission is recommending a three-digit number as a way to prevent suicides in the middle of what appears to be a deepening mental health crisis. The FCC was charged by Congress to put together a report on how to improve national suicide prevention and mental health crisis interventions; 988 is the result.
This is smart strategy. Started in 2005, more than 160 crisis centers across the country staff the network answering calls. Trained counselors answer the calls, which are routed to the nearest center or sent to backups when the lines are busy. In 2018, some 2.2 million calls went through. Another 102,640 crisis chats took place online. The suicide hotline is a project of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and nonprofit administrator, Vibrant Emotional Health.
Now, the FCC is proposing a rule change to make those calls even easier. The change does not need congressional or presidential approval, either. The notice of a possible rule change eventually will be posted to allow for public comment and the commission votes on the measure. We don't see much reason to oppose such a sensible solution.
Even a young child knows to punch 911 when daddy keels over in pain. People who lack English skills can dial 911 when a wreck occurs in front of them. We are trained to get help, quickly.
Remembering 10 digits, especially when a person is upset and contemplating suicide, is more complicated. Frustrated, a person might give up. With some 47,000 Americans dead by their own hands in 2017, this change could save lives.
The FCC report shows why intervention is needed: "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from 1999 to 2016, suicide increased in 49 of the 50 states, and in more than half of those states, the increase was greater than 20 percent. Moreover, the largest increase in deaths by suicide occurred in the past decade, and from 2016 to 2017, an increase of 3.7 percent (more than 2,000 additional suicide deaths) was recorded."
In New Mexico, the Department of Health reports that the suicide rate has consistently been more than 50 percent higher than the U.S. rate, with state suicide rates increasing by 28.2 percent from 2009-17. In 2017, 491 New Mexicans died by suicide. Our state ranks fourth in the nation for suicide as a leading cause of death, according to Health Department statistics. This change would save lives right here as well as nationally.
The people saved would then have a second chance at living the life they were meant to find. Making it simpler to stop suicide makes sense. This rule change should be approved and put in place.

Lou Dobbs rages as 'goal posts' move again for release of DOJ inspector general FISA abuse report

Texto completo: Lou Dobbs railed about shifting predictions regarding when the Justice Department will release the inspector general's report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses.
The Fox Business host began his Monday evening segment by criticizing Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said over the weekend the report is “coming out in weeks, not days, not months," and he believes it will be “ugly and damning” for the DOJ because of its handling of the Russia investigation.
"The RINO and often confused Sen. Lindsey Graham, well — making some bizarre statements over the weekend, about the imminent release of the Department of Justice inspector general report on FISA abuse," Dobbs said, using the acronym for "Republican in Name Only." "Now where have we heard that before? And heard that repeatedly?"
He put up a graphic titled, "Moving the goal posts," which began with Attorney General William Barr saying in April he expected Inspector General Michael Horowitz's work to be "complete probably in May or June."
Since then, a number of reports and lawmakers have pushed the date back, with the latest prediction being early September. Dobbs' list included a New York Times report in early July that said Horowitz will release his findings "in the coming weeks," Rep. John Ratcliffe saying in early July that he expected the report sometime after Labor Day, and House Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins hinting in early July that the investigation will drag into the fall.

Dobbs then turned to his guest, The Hill's John Solomon, and asked the investigative reporter to clear up "this cacophony of misinformation."
Solomon noted that some things he first reported in mid-May were unknown to Horowitz's investigators and led to "a whole new round of questioning." Documents revealed that anti-Trump dossier author Christopher Steele met with top State Department official Kathleen Kavalec. Her notes cast doubt on the British ex-spy's credibility.
Solomon said this included a 16-hour interview with Steele. Steele's dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with wrongdoing.
Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and they have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.
Newly released FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, even after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from "Russian conspiracy theories." Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI, too.
Solomon made an even later prediction based on his sources.
"I think now, barring any new disclosures, the IG is on course — sometime — I've heard early to mid-September to earliest week of October as the window they are trying to hit," Solomon said. As he mentioned the new information had prompted Horowitz to reopen his investigation, Dobbs smiled.
"Inconvenient evidence, disturbing, perhaps, what had appeared to be conclusive resolution. Now it looks like it could be quite something different, and closer attention to the truth," Dobbs said.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
THE RIGHTEOUS GEMSTONES Stream on HBO platforms. John Goodman plays the patriarch of a family of televangelists in this new comedy series. The show, whose first episode aired Sunday night and is available to stream, is the latest creation from Danny McBride ("Eastbound & Down"). It wrings laughs by mixing excess with righteous language, centering on Eli Gemstone (Goodman) and his children -- Jesse (McBride), Judy (Edi Patterson) and Kelvin (Adam DeVine) -- who are experts in turning the word of God into cash. They're also extremely dysfunctional and comically selfish, casually using their faith as justification for misdeeds. "Your ability to accept me for the sinner I am," McBride's character says while praying, "only speaks to your greatness."
DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST (1991) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon. A completely different depiction of multiple generations of a family interacting with each other can be found here, in Julie Dash's lush feature about a group of Gullah people in 1902 living on the Sea Islands off the South Carolina-Georgia coast. The story takes place as family members are preparing to leave for the mainland; the cinematography, by Arthur Jafa, won an award at the Sundance Film Festival.
THE BOOKSHOP (2018) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Vudu. The Spanish director Isabel Coixet was behind this adaptation of the 1978 novel by the English writer Penelope Fitzgerald. The 1950s-set story centers on a young woman, Florence (Emily Mortimer), and an important piece of real estate. Having been widowed during World War II, Florence decides to open a bookshop in an English coastal village. That move elicits the outrage of a wealthy local, Violet (Patricia Clarkson), who tries to pry the space away. Florence stands her ground alongside a soft-spoken ally: a book connoisseur played by Bill Nighy. "His character's near-silent connection with Florence is an oasis of long, meticulously choreographed moments that are enormously affecting," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "Their relationship is emblematic of a movie whose greatest pleasures often seem to derive from what fails to happen, the showdowns and declarations that hang tantalizingly in the wind."
What's on TV
WALL-E (2008) 7 p.m. on Freeform. "I never think about the audience," Andrew Stanton, who directed and was a writer of this movie, told The Times shortly before the film's release. "If someone gives me a marketing report, I throw it away." An animated love story with robots at its center and little in the way of lines seemed like a bit of a risk back then -- but "Wall-E," of course, ended up being a hit. That's thanks in part to the expressiveness of Wall-E, the titular machine sent to clean up an Earth ravaged by environmental catastrophe, and Eve, the robot he falls in love with. "It is, undoubtedly, an earnest (though far from simplistic) ecological parable," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "But it is also a disarmingly sweet and simple love story, Chaplinesque in its emotional purity."

Bunge to grow footprint in St. Louis' agriculture hub as it shifts HQ from New York

Texto completo: The St. Louis area further cemented itself as a corporate hub for agriculture this week with Tuesday's announcement that Bunge would move its global headquarters to the region from New York in the next year.
So, what can the region expect from the move?
And even though the company is set to become the second-largest public corporation headquartered in the St. Louis area in terms of annual revenue -- trailing only Centene -- who, exactly, is Bunge? After all, despite the company's size and its existing North American headquarters in Chesterfield, the largely anonymous products of commodity agriculture can often lurk out of sight and out of mind, which may leave some wondering about the company's identity and background.
At this point in time, the second question is easier to answer than the first, with key details -- like how many jobs will change places -- still yet to be determined by the company.
Bunge, though, is a big name in the business. The company is part of the "ABCD" quartet of grain trading giants -- Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Co. -- that dominate the industry of buying and selling agricultural commodities.
And with an already established presence, it's not a newcomer to the St. Louis area. Its North American headquarters has called the region home since 1990 -- first in Maryland Heights' Westport Plaza, and in a new facility in Chesterfield since 2017.
The Chesterfield site will accommodate the positions that shift west in the move, company representatives said. Based on the building's current workforce of about 525 employees and its 750-person capacity overall, that means the area could expect to welcome about 200 new jobs from New York.
"We built for growth, so we're growing," said Deb Seidel, a Bunge spokesperson, who added that there is not yet any timetable to determine how the move affects individual employees.
She said that while some tax incentives were used in the construction of Bunge's Chesterfield facility, none are involved with the relocation of its global headquarters to Missouri.
The company says it makes sense to shift to a part of the country where it already has a sizable footprint, and where agricultural production and distribution is concentrated.
"Most of our facilities are in this region," Seidel said. "The Mississippi River and its tributaries are key to (the company's) export market."
But thanks to a global glut of grains and protracted trade tensions, it has been a rough stretch for the agriculture industry -- turmoil that has prompted some reshuffling and associated rumors among Bunge and its peers.
In May, for instance, Reuters reported that the company appointed a new chief financial officer and other high-level executives, and also shifted from a regionalized business model -- centered on North America, South America, and Europe and Asia -- to adopt a more global approach.
And at one point last year, Bloomberg reported that the company was in "advanced talks" to be acquired by its competitor, Archer Daniels Midland. A sale never materialized.
One recent bright spot for the company has been its ownership stake in Beyond Meat -- the company offering a popular product line of plant-based meat alternatives -- which is largely credited with helping Bunge boost earnings in its most recent quarter.
Outside experts acknowledge that, yes, Bunge and other agricultural commodity traders are going through a challenging period.
"When you think about a bulk commodity shipper like Bunge, they want volume," said Seth Meyer, a professor at the University of Missouri's Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute. "Anything that reduces agricultural trade volumes is going to be something they're concerned about."
That has certainly been the case over the last year or so, as trade disputes have escalated between the U.S. and places like China -- a dominant destination for soybeans and other agricultural staples. New data show that China took in 83 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans since last year's harvest -- down from 94.1 million metric tons the year before, Meyer said.
"(Chinese demand) has been growing pretty strongly for years, so this is a big change," said Meyer.
But ongoing hurdles don't diminish the long-term optimism that Meyer has for companies like Bunge.
"This isn't like a permanent, forever body blow to these agricultural trading commodities," Meyer said, describing current challenges. "These folks have good long-term outlooks. … Overall, the world needs more agricultural trade in the future."
Bunge has also been tied to some controversy, such as deforestation linked to soy production in South America. It was one of a handful of trading companies fined by the Brazilian government last year for buying grain from off-limit areas, according to Reuters. And the New York Times reported that Bunge, specifically, was linked to more than 1.4 million acres of deforestation from 2011 to 2015, based on satellite imagery analysis from the environmental group Mighty Earth.
Meyer, however, said he does not regard the company to be particularly controversial.
"They buy these commodities from other folks," he said. "They're not growing them themselves."

Texto completo: Here's a crazy idea: Maybe the forces of liberty will win.
Sadly, few people are rooting for liberty these days, and even among those who are, there's a dismaying amount of pessimism about its prospects.
Consider China.
There's a new bipartisan consensus these days: The "elites" made a "bad bet" on China.
We were told by "elites" that giving China access to the global marketplace would deliver huge benefits for America. Simultaneously, economic liberalization in China would lead to political liberalization. After all, the history of democratization usually begins with growing prosperity. As the middle class gets richer, it demands rights and protections once enjoyed only by aristocrats - i.e. political representation and the rule of law. This is how liberal democracy emerged in England and Holland in the 16th and 17th centuries, and in much of the rest of the free world since then. The same will happen in China, policymakers said. And since democratic societies tend not to go to war with each other, American and global security will improve.
And now, today's elites insist that it was all false. While it's true that the benefits were oversold and the costs minimized, it's not clear to me that any of these claims are settled.
On the economic front, plenty of studies show that Americans benefited from increased trade with China. Consumer goods got cheaper, particularly for lower-income Americans. Yes, America lost some manufacturing jobs to China - though it almost certainly lost more to robots. But competition with China also yielded more hiring of Americans in nonmanufacturing jobs, a much larger part of our economy. Perhaps this painful transition was necessary and inevitable.
In short, the economic argument is a mixed bag. Though the fact that hundreds of millions of Chinese people were lifted out of abject poverty - by markets - is a moral victory for humanity and an important demonstration of the fact that police states alone don't make life better for the policed.
Which brings us to freedom. Beijing remains stubbornly authoritarian. It's not as bad as when Chairman Mao killed some 60 million of his own people, but China's technologically advanced police state is still plenty grotesque.
Why? A scholar who spent years in China once explained to me that the government - i.e., the Communist Party - is often more afraid of the people than the people are of it. The Communist Party understands the history of democratization as well as anyone. It's just betting that artificial intelligence and facial recognition will keep its aristocrats in power in ways that the bayonets and gunpowder of yesteryear could not.
China is in a nationalist phase, just as Germany, France, Italy and other former or would-be Great Powers were on their way to democracy. That poses real dangers to the global order in the same way the nationalist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries did. Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm wanted what he called a "place in the sun" for the German empire, and so did Adolf Hitler. Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants it too.
Whether it was a young political scientist named Woodrow Wilson hailing Otto von Bismarck's authoritarian Prussia as the most "admirable system ... and most nearly perfected" in the world, or Lincoln Steffens claiming upon his return from Soviet Russia that he'd "seen the future, and it works," or New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wishing that America could learn from China's "one party authoritarianism," virtually every time nationalist and authoritarian regimes seize the reins, countless Western intellectuals became convinced that a better, more "efficient" model of government had been created.
As George Orwell observed, this sort of thinking amounts to power-worship, and this mindset leads people to think that current trends will only continue in a straight line into the future.
But that's not how the last three centuries have gone. Power-hungry experts love to tell us freedom has had its day, yet liberty keeps winning.
The freedom fighters in 2019 Hong Kong may meet the same fate that the protesters in Tiananmen Square did in 1989. But that doesn't mean they'll be remembered as victims of a lost cause. Rather, they might be remembered as proof that liberty can win in the long run, when people fight for it.
Liberty is never easy. It takes work.

Thomas L. Friedman: If you think Trump is helping Israel, you’re a fool

Texto completo: I am going to say this as simply and clearly as I can: If you’re an American Jew and you’re planning on voting for Donald Trump because you think he is pro-Israel, you’re a damn fool.
Oh, don’t get me wrong. Trump has said and done many things that are in the interests of the current Israeli government — and have been widely appreciated by the Israeli public. To deny that would be to deny the obvious. But here’s what’s also obvious. Trump’s way of — and motivation for — expressing his affection for Israel is guided by his political desire to improve his re-election chances by depicting the entire Republican Party as pro-Israel and the entire Democratic Party as anti-Israel.
As a result, Trump — with the knowing help of Israel’s current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu — is doing something no American president and Israeli prime minister have done before: They’re making support for Israel a wedge issue in American politics.
Few things are more dangerous to Israel’s long-term interests than its becoming a partisan matter in America, which is Israel’s vital political, military and economic backer in the world.
As Dore Gold, the right-wing former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and once a very close adviser to Netanyahu, warned in a dialogue at the Hudson Institute on Nov. 27, 2018: “You reach out to Democrats, and you reach out to Republicans. And you don’t get caught playing partisan politics in the United States.’’
Trump’s campaign to tar the entire Democratic Party with some of the hostile views toward Israel of a few of its newly elected congresswomen — and Netanyahu’s careless willingness to concede to Trump’s demand and bar two of them, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, from visiting Israel and the West Bank — is part of a process that will do huge, long-term damage to Israel’s interests and support in America.
Netanyahu later relented and granted a visa to Tlaib, who is of Palestinian descent, for a private, “humanitarian’’ visit to see her 90-year-old grandmother — provided she agree in writing not to advocate the boycott of Israel while there. At first Tlaib agreed, but then decided that she would not come under such conditions.
Excuse me, but when did powerful Israel — a noisy, boisterous democracy where Israeli Arabs in its parliament say all kinds of wild and crazy things — get so frightened by what a couple of visiting freshman American congresswomen might see or say? When did Israel get so afraid of saying to them: “Come, visit, go anywhere you want! We’ve got our warts and we’ve got our good stuff. We’d just like you to visit both. But if you don’t, we’ll live with that, too. We’re pretty tough.’’
It’s too late for that now. The damage of what Trump and Bibi have been up to — formally making Israel a wedge issue in American politics — is already done. Do not be fooled: Netanyahu, through his machinations with Senate Republicans, can get the U.S. Congress to give him an audience anytime he wants. But Bibi could not speak on any major American college campus today without massive police protection. The protests would be huge.
And listen now to some of the leading Democratic presidential candidates, like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — you can hear how unhappy they are with the behavior of this Israeli government and its continued occupation of the West Bank. And they are not afraid to say so anymore. As The Jerusalem Post reported on July 11, “Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose presidential candidacy has rallied in recent weeks, told two Jewish anti-occupation activists ‘yes’ when they asked her for support.’’
But who can blame them? Trump is equating the entire Democratic Party with hatred for Israel, while equating support for Netanyahu — who leads the most extreme, far-right government that Israel has ever had, who is facing indictment on three counts of corruption and whose top priority is getting re-elected so that he can have the Israeli Knesset overrule its justice system and keep him out of court — with loving Israel.
How many young Americans want to buy into that narrative? If Bibi wins, he plans to pass a law banning his own indictment on corruption, and then, when Israel’s Supreme Court strikes down that law as illegal, he plans to get the Knesset to pass another law making the Supreme Court subservient to his parliament. I am not making this up. Israel will become a Jewish banana republic.
If and when that happens, every synagogue, every campus Hillel, every Jewish institution, every friend of Israel will have to ask: Can I support such an Israel? It will tear apart the entire pro-Israel community and every synagogue and Jewish Federation.
Then add another factor. By moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem — and turning that embassy, led by a Trump crony, Ambassador David Friedman, into an outpost for advancing the interests of Israeli Jewish settlers, not American interests — Trump has essentially greenlighted the Israeli annexation of the West Bank.
Again, should Netanyahu remain prime minister — which is possible only if he puts together a ruling coalition made up of far-right parties that want to absorb the West Bank and its 2.5 million Palestinians into Israel — Israel will be on its way to becoming either a binational state of Arabs and Jews or a state that systematically deprives a large and growing segment of its population of the democratic right to vote. Neither will be a Jewish democracy, the dream of Israel’s founders and still the defining, but endangered, political characteristic of the state.
Don’t get me wrong. I strongly oppose the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement — which Reps. Omar and Tlaib have embraced — because it wants to erase the possibility of a two-state solution. And I am particularly unhappy with Rep. Omar.
I know a lot about her home district in Minnesota, because I grew up in it, in St. Louis Park. Omar represents the biggest concentration of Jews and Muslims living together in one district in the Upper Midwest. She was perfectly placed to be a bridge builder between Muslims and Jews. Instead, sadly, she has been a bridge destroyer between the two since she came to Washington. But anytime she is legitimately criticized, Democrats automatically scream “Islamophobia’’ and defend her. That’s as disturbing as Trump.
I know that more than a few Somali immigrants in Minneapolis, who face so many challenges — from gang violence to unemployment — are asking why is Omar spending time on the West Bank of the Jordan and not on the West Bank of the Mississippi?
I love Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs — but God save me from some of their American friends. So many of them just want to exploit this problem to advance themselves politically, get attention, raise money or delegitimize their opponents.
In that, Trump is not alone — he’s just the worst of the worst.

Records on Ohio gunman pit safety against privacy

Texto completo: COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Disturbing behavior that the Dayton gunman reportedly exhibited in his youth may be detailed in law enforcement and school files so far off limits to the public, records that could shed light on whether authorities properly handled early warning signs.

The measures used to shield 24-year-old shooter Connor Betts' school records and whatever is on his juvenile rap sheet were intended to protect people's privacy as they move from childhood into their adult lives.

But could erasing youthful bad behavior from the public record limit insights that could protect public safety? And might such measures also serve to insulate school officials from having their decisions questioned?

"Obviously, it's a very, very complex issue," said Rachael Strickland, co-chair of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy.

Betts was killed by police after opening fire Aug. 4 in the city's crowded Oregon District entertainment area, killing nine, including his sister, and injuring dozens more.

High school classmates have since said Betts was suspended years ago for compiling a "hit list" of fellow students he wanted to harm. Two of the classmates said that followed an earlier suspension after Betts came to school with a list of female students he wanted to sexually assault.

Police investigators say they now know that Betts had a "history of obsession with violent ideations with mass shootings and expressed a desire to commit a mass shooting." The FBI said it uncovered evidence Betts "looked into violent ideologies."

On Thursday, the Montgomery County coroner said Betts had cocaine, alcohol and an antidepressant in his system and more cocaine on his body at the time of the shooting.

Authorities have yet to publicly identify a motive, and the shielded records could provide insights into Betts' previous activities both in and out of school. Dayton police said Tuesday that they're divided on one of the more vexing questions: whether Betts intended to kill his sister, Megan, or whether her death was inadvertent.

His school district, Bellbrook-Sugarcreek Local Schools, has denied media requests for access to Betts' high school files on the grounds that such "records are generally protected by both federal and state law." News organizations, including The Associated Press, CNN, The New York Times and others, have sued.

Likewise, his juvenile police record has been expunged, which makes it off limits to the public.

Strickland said her coalition mostly focuses on protecting children from the lifelong ramifications of systematic monitoring of their social media. She said the group opposes "as a matter of principle" government surveillance of children without due process, saying it takes staff and police hours to carry out while "unfairly labeling kids."

That was part of the thinking of those who championed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the federal law that protects student education records, back in 1974. The act does give districts the option to release a student's records "in connection with an emergency," however.

"The mandate to Ohio schools is that we must not divulge confidential student records without clear consent from the student or parents and we have not received such consent," Liz Betz, board president for Bellbrook-Sugarcreek Local Schools, said in a statement after the shooting. "We know everyone is trying to make sense of the devastation that occurred, but we cannot bypass the law, plain and simple."

While the U.S. Department of Education holds that federal privacy protections cease upon death for those over 18, the school district is arguing that Ohio law provides broader protection.e."

Vast white supremacist violence in America is a myth the media won't give up

Texto completo: The national media’s ongoing campaign to spread that myth that there’s a surge in “white supremacy”-related violence continues with Washington Post columnist Petula Dvorak insisting with great originality that “White men are becoming some of America’s greatest threats.”
Where have we heard that before?
“The biggest terror threat in this country is white men.”— CNN’s Don Lemon, Oct. 30, 2018
“We Have a White Nationalist Terrorist Problem.”— New York Times, Aug. 4, 2019
“You can pick any batch of statistics you like to illustrate the seriousness of white nationalist terrorism.”— Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin, Aug. 6, 2019
The media myth that there's been a surge of "right-wing" or "white supremacist" violence under Trump is extensively documented in my forthcoming book Privileged Victims: How America's Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People.
Among Dvorak’s scant evidence that there’s an uprising of right-wing, white supremacy-related violence under President Trump is the thoroughly laughable study by the Anti-Defamation League that found a grand total of 50 murder deaths perpetrated by “right-wing extremists” last year (read more on that crack study here), and also a case last year about a 17-year-old boy in Virginia who collected Nazi Germany memorabilia and killed two blacks.
Wait, I read that wrong. He didn’t kill two blacks. He killed two Latinos.
Wait, that’s wrong, too. He didn’t kill any blacks or Latinos. He killed the two white parents of a white ex-girlfriend. The boy’s mother said she didn’t know he was engaged in online white supremacy chat rooms but she did say that she knew he had a history of mental and emotional health issues. He had also been enrolled at a school for children with behavioral problems and been charged with crimes in a juvenile court. He had been diagnosed with both depression and autism.
This is the profile of a crazy person, not a calculating white supremacist driven to kill by racial hatred.
And that’s the case with virtually all “white supremacy”-related violence. Of the relatively few people in this country who even identify as white supremacists, even fewer act out violently, and among those, almost none of them attack other people for racial reasons.
True, parents should keep an eye on their online activity of their children. You would think that goes without saying. But it’s simply not true that there is a sudden epidemic of whites targeting people of other races for mass violence.

Texto completo: A year ago today, more than 200 newspapers across the U.S. ran editorials decrying President Donald Trump’s repeated application of the term "enemies of the people" to describe the press and reinforcing the need for a vibrant free press in a healthy democracy. There is still cause for concern.
Since that show of solidarity, the U.S. has fallen three places in Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index ranking. We’re now 48th out of 180 countries surveyed.
Data compiled by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker points to an escalation in violence: By April, there had been 10 reported attacks on journalists this year alone and 46 since 2017, including a reporter in California who was struck in the face and had her phone stolen as she interviewed voters.
It’s not just the U.S. In some places, threats against journalists are now "occupational hazards" — in Brazil, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have attacked members of the media both online and physically.
And President Trump continues to attack the media, revisiting the "enemy of the people" slogan in June when he accused The New York Times of a "virtual act of treason." Such attacks, whether from the president or any person in power, must be resisted.
The press is not perfect, to be sure. But to vilify the entire institution because of its imperfections poses a very real danger to America’s freedom.
In one of our first editorials on the topic in December 2016, we weren’t necessarily thinking of physical harm when we warned that the assault on the press is dangerous. We wrote: "It undermines our democracy.
"It allows those in power to say, ‘Ignore the facts no matter what the facts may be.’ "It allows partisans of both parties to say, ‘Believe in my distortions because you agree with my ideology.’ Or, ‘because you agree with my cult personality.’ "It allows anyone who screws up to say, ‘The problem’s not me; the problem’s the messenger.’ " The "enemy of the people" refrain can provide a useful political rhetorical slogan. But repeating such a slogan, a practice common among history’s strongmen, and infusing it with a tone of legitimacy is not a harmless political device.
Writer Richard Frankel described the impact in a June 9 article for Salon: "After all," he wrote, "enemies are not debated. Enemies are not reasoned with. One doesn’t compromise with an enemy. An enemy is confronted, is combated, is neutralized, and ultimately, an enemy is destroyed. The point at which politics shifts from truth to lies, from opponents to enemies, is the point at which democracy dies."
That distinction, that warning, is as important to remember today as it was a year ago.
Facts matter. Support a Free Press.

Trump’s policy on China: incoherent, values-free

Resumen: [...]it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time.

Texto completo: A concern for human rights and democracy has often been seen as an add-on to our country’s foreign policy, an attractive veneer over the usual realpolitik. But President Donald Trump is demonstrating that a supposedly "America First" policy focused entirely on trade and divorced from a commitment to our values is incoherent.
Trump is embarrassing our country — and weakening it, too — by refusing to stand with the people of Hong Kong as they struggle against China’s dictatorship.
We have long wondered when the thoughtless chaos of Trump’s presidency would finally catch up with him and endanger our country. How long could an administration that replaces policy with impulse and thinking with tweeting stay out of crisis? The disarray around Trump’s China policy and the economic turmoil it has unleashed tell us that moment is now.
Somehow, Trump seemed to think that he could be tough on China and still express his admiration for President Xi Jinping’s brutally authoritarian rule.
"He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great," Trump told Republican donors at a fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in early 2018. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot some day."
So it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time."
"Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that," Trump added. "But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China." Translation: Do what you have to do, China.
Trump underscored his indifference to democracy Tuesday on Twitter. Responding to Chinese troops gathering at the Hong Kong border, he said only: "Everyone should be calm and safe!"
This reaction is scandalous from the leader of a nation whose Constitution begins with the words: "We the People." When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people."
But Trump’s correction-on-the-fly may not be able to undo the damage he (and Xi) have done to the world economy. The stock market’s dive on Wednesday reflected recession fears gripping investors. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s about-face seemed motivated not by any grand strategy but by a purely selfish concern for his own re-election. "Nobody wants to run for president, on either party, in the middle of a recession," Tom Donohue, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO, told CNBC.
What’s maddening about Trump’s approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States’ traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights. But rather than going about the patient work of building support for what should be a broad and united front against China’s abuses, Trump’s erratic approach is making it easier for China to cast the U.S. as the heavy. This does not put the interests of America first.
And Trump’s affection for dictatorships is squandering the high ground our country has historically been able to occupy, even in the face of our imperfections and inconsistencies. Championing democracy is not simply the right thing to do. It is a strategic asset. It is also in our national interest at a time when democracy is under challenge from both China and Russia and faces nationalist threats in countries whose free institutions once seemed secure.
Our president has already done grave damage to our nation’s domestic fabric by dividing us against each other, provoking both racism and nativism, and seeking to delegitimize all who stand against him. Now, his nihilism is wreaking havoc on our economy and around the world. This is the place where a slapdash, value-free approach to governing was bound to lead us.

When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people."
We count on presidents to consider "just in case" issues before they act. With Trump, it's all a thoughtless, strategy-less blur. Say anything, see how it goes, then say something else.
He charmingly expressed concern about the effect of the tariffs on "the Christmas shopping season," thus effectively contradicting his own false claims that Chinese, not Americans, would pay the tariffs.
But Trump's correction-on-the-fly may not be able to undo the damage he (and Xi) have done to the world economy. The stock market's dive on Wednesday reflected recession fears gripping investors.

A TOTAL KAEP OUT; Jay-Z's deal with NFL comes at expense of banned QB

Texto completo: As it turns out, Jay-Z was not starting a protest. He was making a sales pitch.
In his 2018 song "Apes-t," the lead single off the Beyonce/Jay-Z collab EVERYTHING IS LOVE, rapper and mogul Shawn "Jay-Z" Carter summarized his now-infamous rejection of the Super Bowl halftime show: "I said no to the Super Bowl/You need me, I don't need you." On Wednesday, the NFL admitted Hov was right when it announced a multi-year agreement with Jay's Roc-Nation to lead the NFL's music and entertainment endeavors.
This is a shocker. For some. Carter has been a vocal proponent of criminal justice reform. His frustrations with law enforcement's mistreatment of black men embed his music, as intimately connected to Jay as self-appreciation for his business endeavors. He's written an op-ed for the New York Times about nonviolent drug offenses, produced documentaries on Trayvon Martin, Kalief Browder and fellow hip hop star Meek Mill. Now here he is laying down suppressive fire for the NFL while the most glaring symbol of the league's ambivalence to such topics languishes out of sight.
Three years ago this Wednesday, Colin Kaepernick began a protest. The quarterback sat (and later knelt) during the national anthem to protest social injustice, specifically police brutality. He has not stepped onto an NFL gridiron in three years, despite having the stats and playoff pedigree to be a starting quarterback. He was blackballed. The league would eventually settle a grievance over Kaepernick's inexplicable unemployment, but the quarterback remains unsigned, despite his insistence that he is interested and in shape.
"We forget that Colin's whole thing was to bring attention to social injustice. In that case, this is a success. This is the next phase," Carter said Wednesday, despite immediate scrutiny from reporters in attendance.On social media, Kaep's former Niners teammate (and closest ally) Eric Reid accused Jay of helping the NFL "bury Colin's career," while Reid's girlfriend, talk radio host Nessa,expressed her "disappointment and disgust" with Hov's latest hustle.
Straddling sincere and cynical, Carter defended his partnership with the league that ended Kaep's career during his press event. "We are past kneeling," Carter said, visibly annoyed anyone would "get stuck on Colin not having a job" and miss the potential of setting up shop in the lion's den.
Why not sell anti-racism to a business built atop a white fanbase wary of allowing their children to play the brutal sport while cheering on black and brown bodies engaged in the destruction they fear for their own? Why not sell fire in Hell?
Shawn Carter is worth nearly a billion dollars. I paid $30 more than the minimum on my credit card this month. Carter and I have different perspectives. We're in the same skin, but we're not in the same world. To him, there are few problems not solved by throwing money at them and the NFL's dollars spend the same as anyone else's. It doesn't work like that for everyone, even when they share the same hue. Kaepernick's settlement money has not spared him the indignity of being frozen out of his chosen profession.
Buying your way out of the most violent customs inflicted upon black Americans for exactly 400 years is nearly impossible. For a few lucky souls that make it, personal wealth is illusory and conditional, but it's an understandable reprieve.
It's why my father, who grew up in an East New York he watched crumble under decades of municipal neglect, left the 'hood to raise me in an affluent Queens enclave. To no one's surprise, especially not Dad's, officers patrolling the neighborhood often questioned the skinny teen he raised, just to make sure I belonged in the neighborhood and, presumably, that the sleeve of Oreos I bought from the corner store belonged to me.
Money did and didn't save me from my last exchange with the police: a crazy Uber ride that almost left me a hashtag, or perhaps the subject of a Jay-Z docuseries. In the middle of a simple one-mile ride to a friend's Bed-Stuy apartment, a cop car flashed its lights and instructed the driver to pull over. Instead, he ran. He zipped between side streets and oncoming traffic on Myrtle Avenue, blowing multiple red lights before finally giving up and pulling over.
The car was clearly marked as an Uber, but the plainclothes cops who approached greeted me and my friend with guns drawn. To the officers ready to light up the sedan's backseat, we were accomplices, not hostages. With my hands pressed against the trunk, I calmly told officers about the Fortune 500 company we worked for, and gently asked them to pull my work ID card from my wallet. They saw my smiling face above the familiar corporate logo and let us walk home with our leftover slices (and bodies) intact. Corporate money talked, but only after the damage was done.
And yet, Hov's sales pitch wouldn't work if it weren't attractive. On the "In My Lifetime" remix, released in 1997, Hov drops a timeless and timely verse making it plain: "I'm tryna make all of my dreams materialize, so I sorta / Say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow / I found a new route, you 'bout to see my life change / I make the means justify the ends."
Jay made good on the promise. But the means cannot justify the end - they are the end. Kaepernick sparked his conversation, and I walked away from the worst cab ride ever, but the indignities inflicted on both of us are just as much the point. Someone should protest that.

Paul Krugman: Useful idiots and Trumpist billionaires

Texto completo: Whoever came up with the phrase “useful idiots” — it’s often credited to Lenin, but there’s no evidence he ever said it — was on to something. There are times when dangerous political movements derive important support from people who will, if these movements achieve and hold power, be among their biggest victims.
Certainly I found myself thinking of the phrase when I read about the Trump fundraiser held at the Hamptons home of Stephen Ross, chairman of a company that holds controlling stakes in Equinox and SoulCycle.
Most reporting on the Ross event has focused on the possible adverse effects on his business empire: The young, educated, urban fitness fanatics who go to his gyms don’t like the idea that their money is supporting Donald Trump. But the foolishness of Ross’ Trump support goes well beyond the potential damage to his bottom line.
I mean, if you’re a billionaire who also happens to be a racist, supporting Trump makes perfect sense: You know what you’re buying. But if you’re supporting Trump not because of his racism but despite it, because you expect him to keep your taxes low, you’re being, well, an idiot.
It’s true that Trump (breaking all his campaign promises) has indeed cut taxes on the wealthy, and will surely cut them further if reelected. By contrast, whoever the Democrats nominate is likely to raise those taxes if she or he wins the general election, perhaps substantially.
But let’s get real. If you’re a billionaire, you don’t need the extra money. At that level, purchasing power has nothing to do with the quality of life; having a 45,000-square-foot house instead of just 40,000, or flying to one of your multiple other residences in a bigger private jet, won’t make you significantly happier.
People who’ve studied the extremely rich argue that money, for them, is largely not about being able to buy things but is instead a way of keeping score; their satisfaction comes not from more consumption but from overtaking their perceived peers.
And tax cuts don’t help on that dimension, since your peers get the same tax breaks you do.
More to the point, Trumpism is about much more than tax cuts: It’s an attempt to end the rule of law and impose an authoritarian, white nationalist regime. And even billionaires should be terrified about what their lives will be like if that attempt succeeds.
This is especially true if you’re a member of a minority, even if your skin happens to be white. Ross is Jewish — and anyone Jewish has to be completely ignorant of history not to know that when bigotry runs free, we’re always next in line for persecution.
In fact, the ingredients for an American pogrom are already in place. The El Paso shooting suspect, like many right-wing terrorists, is a believer in “replacement theory” — the claim that immigration is part of a vast conspiracy to replace whites with people of color. And who’s behind that conspiracy? You know who: “Jews will not replace us,” declared the torch-carrying marchers in Charlottesville.
Is Trump a replacement theory guy? The replacement theorists think so.
In any case, billionaires who imagine that their wealth will insulate them from the purges and insecurity of an authoritarian regime are deluding themselves. Look at Vladimir Putin’s Russia, a place Trump surely sees as a role model. Putin certainly coddles an inner circle of oligarchs. But he has shown no hesitation about using a politicized legal system to persecute and ruin his critics, no matter how wealthy.
Oh, and don’t say it can’t happen here. The man who prompts chants of “lock her up,” who has declared the independent media “enemies of the people,” has made it abundantly clear that he’d love to engage in politicized prosecutions of anyone who gets in his way.
Again, there are surely some wealthy Americans who want to live in that kind of country. But most Trump-supporting billionaires would probably be horrified at the prospect. So what are they thinking raising money for a would-be authoritarian?
The answer, of course, is that they aren’t thinking. Instead of considering what a consolidation of Trumpist power would mean, they’re reacting mindlessly out of a combination of greed and ego.
By the way, the greed part is obvious. But it has also been clear since the Obama years that a fair number of the superrich aren’t satisfied with being immensely wealthy; they also want adulation. They expect to be praised as heroic job creators and are enraged at any suggestion that some of their number may have behaved badly, let alone that they may have benefited from a rigged system.
Hence the hatred for even reasonable, pro-market progressives like, say, Elizabeth Warren. It’s not just that these progressives might make billionaires a bit poorer, but that they make them feel small.
But this is no time for such pettiness. Vast wealth brings many privileges, and it will continue to do so even if progressive Democrats win big next year. What wealth doesn’t bring is the right to let self-indulgence turn you into a useful idiot, lending aid and comfort to a movement that’s trying to destroy America as we know it.

The Dubuque Museum of Art, 701 Locust St., will present two exhibits this fall, highlighting the imagination of celebrated children's book author and artist Arthur Geisert and the paintings of artist Alec Egan.
Opening Saturday, Sept. 21, in the Falb Family Gallery on the museum's second floor, "Arthur Geisert: Tall and Not-So-Tall Tales" will feature original illustrations from Geisert's latest work of fiction, "Pumpkin Island," published by Enchanted Lion Books, along with illustrations from his 2013 book, "Thunderstorm."
The exhibit will feaure more than 60 hand-colored etchings - including one measuring more than 30 feet long - displayed alongside the artist's drawings, videos and hands-on activities for children and families.
The exhibit will continue through Sunday, Jan. 5.
Geisert is the author of more than two dozen books, three of which have been awarded The New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Book Award.
Born in Texas and raised in Los Angeles, Geisert relocated to Bernard, Iowa, in 2007 and today makes his home and studio in Elkader.
Through the generosity of several local families and the artist, DuMA acquired all of the artist's prints, books and etching plates more than a decade ago - an archive that expands with each new publication.
A variety of public programs and events are planned in conjunction with the exhibition. Details will be shared through the museum's Facebook and Instagram pages and at www.dbqart.com.
"Alec Egan: The Living Room" opened on Aug. 10, in the Kris Mozena McNamer Gallery. A reception for the exhibition is scheduled from 5 to 8p.m. Friday, Sept. 6, in conjunction with First Fridays. The exhibit will continue through Sunday, Oct. 20.
Egan also will present a gallery talk at 1:30p.m. Saturday, Sept. 7. Admission is free.
California-based artist Egan explores nostalgia and memory in his latest series of contemporary oil paintings. Motifs including books, flowers, architectural elements and wallpaper designs - similar to those found in his grandparents' home - repeat throughout the group of paintings in this exhibition.
Egan completed a Millwork Residency in Dubuque in 2015 and has participated in solo and group exhibits across the U.S. His work is represented in Los Angeles by Anat Ebgi Gallery.

Texto completo: A young reporter in Manila wanted to live as a Filipino, preferably in a slum. A 40-year-old woman was willing to take him in. Thus began the education of New York Times reporter Jason DeParle, thus began a decades-long friendship, and thus began a remarkable book.
The United States has 44 million immigrants — more than the entire population of Canada and, as DeParle tells us, “it's no exaggeration to say their future is America's."  But migration also shapes countries around the world, the places migrants leave as much as the places where they settle, often temporarily, sometimes permanently. 
“Migration is to the Philippines what cars once were to Detroit: the civil religion," DeParle argues. More than a million people leave the country every year, and in examining the phenomenon at close range, DeParle himself was transformed from journalist to student of migration. “I wasn't thinking about migration when I arrived in Leveriza," he writes of his perch in the Philippines. “I was thinking about rats and eggs, about people...endure such hopeless poverty. Migration was part of the answer." 
This three-decade journey took him to that Filipino home and to periodic visits with the family in the Philippines, Abu Dhabi, Florida and Texas. “This was immersion journalism," he wrote. “I immersed."
In the course of this tutorial in migration, DeParle saw that all of Tita Comodas's five children became overseas workers and he came to understand, perhaps even to endorse, the unofficial family creed: A good provider is one who leaves. Thus the otherwise inscrutable title of this indispensable book, a Baedeker to an unnoticed and largely unappreciated global phenomenon, and a guide to understanding not only the flow of people worldwide but also the tensions that infuse politics worldwide.
This may be a portrait of Tita's world, but it is also the portrait of the world today — a world, DeParle shows us, that is in profound transformation as millions seek to better their lives. 
“My study of the global poor shrank to a sample size of one," he writes. “I was absorbed by Tita and her world." 
But the book's real personification of these sweeping changes is Tita's daughter Rosalie, a 15-year-old C student when DeParle met her, and a 48-year-old Texas nurse now: “She never crossed a border illegally. She doesn't sport gang tattoos. To the challenges of assimilation, she brings advantages the poor and unauthorized lack. She's the kind of immigrant who's become invisible in the political debate, yet increasingly common."
In these pages DeParle offers us a brisk history of immigration and immigration policy and wise reflections on contemporary migration. “The average immigrant a century ago was a penniless European in a big city," he writes. “Now the foreign born are economically diverse, ethnically varied, and geographically scattered."  
Indeed, he's a historian in seeing the process with a centuries-long perspective — he notes that Benjamin Franklin called the German immigrants of the mid 18th century the “most ignorant Stupid Sort"  — but is a journalist with a reporter's eye on contemporary events, seeing how corruption, poverty, and violence spur great waves of migration. 
Fleeing war and woes, migrants are changing our world both literally and metaphorically, and the evidence may be sturdiest in the Philippines. By 1871, Filipino workers were in 108 countries. DeParle's preoccupation is to tell their 21st century stories. 
As a result, this book is a journey: on foot, in planes and on cruise ships, to the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Singapore, Taiwan, Canada, and Hong Kong. With DeParle as tour guide, the reader discovers that the phenomenon of migration is not only a transfer of people but also a transfer of money.
“The case for migration as a development tool starts with the migrants' loyalty," he writes. The workers leave, the money goes home. Mexicans in the United States send a third of their salaries home, Senegalese in Spain send half. “Since the money bypasses the government, it is less susceptible to corruption that foreign aid," he explains. “It's also counter-cyclical; private investors pull back in bad times, but migrants send more." 
But while migration eases poverty it doesn't boost countries' GNP. “Migration hasn't enlarged the Philippine economy," he writes, “but it's enlarged the incomes of millions of Filipinos."
These journeys are not endeavors of ease. DeParle shows us that they are full of peril: fears of false and real failure, disorientation and disappointment, visa problems and health threats. Families split geographically are split psychologically as well. Technology helps and hurts: “Webcams don't replace mothers," he reminds us. That's especially true when the migrants are rearing other people's children. 
As the pages turn — as the book develops — the focus turns as well, bringing into sharp relief the issue of immigration to the United States, and here the story turns from heartbreaking to heartening. DeParle understands what he calls the “moral hazard"  posed by amnesty for the undocumented. He also sees challenges faced by the new immigrants that makes assimilation more challenging: “[E]conomic mobility has waned; legal status is often an impediment; and most of today's immigrants are racial minorities."
But in the end he brings us back to Tita's daughter, and his closing argument is a potent one: “Migration was her vehicle of salvation. It delivered her from the living conditions of the 19th century. It respected her talent, rewarded her sweat, and enlarged her capacity for giving. It made her life deeper, fuller, and more filled with hope... That her quest ended in Texas is something for Americans to cheer. It's good for your country to be the place that people go to make dreams come true." 
In short, DeParle shows us, immigration was very, very good for her. But it's also very, very good for us.

Texto completo: AP Entertainment Writer
NEW YORK — There are some physicians who forbid their patients from going online to type in their symptoms, fearing they’ll get incorrect information or become more anxious. Dr. Lisa Sanders is not among them.
Sanders, whose monthly “Diagnosis” column in The New York Times Magazine inspired the hit Fox TV series House, has a more practical, and democratic approach to so-called Dr. Google.
“I actually think that no matter what doctors said or when they said it, patients have been discussing their illnesses as the first symptoms happen,” she said.
“By the time a patient brings their story to me as their primary care doctor, they’ve already run it by their best friend, their spouse, their mom, their kids — they’ve told their story to everybody. It turns out that the internet is now just one more everybody you tell your story to. I don’t think that’s a bad thing.”
Not only does Sanders approve of crowdsourcing, she’s harnessing the internet and social media in her work diagnosing unusual cases. This month, she’s showing off that approach to a whole new crowd — Nexflix users.
The new seven-part documentary series Diagnosis piggybacks on her Times columns by profiling seven patients as they track down a diagnosis, from a Gulf War veteran in New Mexico to a girl with seizures in New York City.
“The show is about diagnosis as a process that doctors go through, but it’s also a show about diagnosis as a process that patients go through, too. And I think both ends have to be treated with respect and honored,” Sanders said.
In the series, Sanders consults as the patients and their doctors seek various treatments, go down blind alleys and seek advice on social media, from patients and doctors alike. More voices in the mix mean more dizzying options, but some lead to unexpected solutions.
The little girl in New York with seizures is told by one doctor that an operation to remove half her brain is the “gold standard.” But her parents decide to keep looking and instead choose to have a less invasive brain implant, an option they found out about through feedback.
“Never in human history has medicine been able to do and know as much as we do and know right now,” said Sanders. “Never before have we been able to make as many diagnoses as we can now.”
Jonathan Chinn, an executive producer alongside Scott Rudin and his cousin, Simon Chinn, said the series highlights the benefits of technology — in this case to connect a global village of experts.
“We focus a lot on the negatives of technology — spying and a lack of privacy — but this is an example of a way that technology, if harnessed the right way and responsibly curated, can actually save lives and make peoples’ lives tangibly better,” he said.
While there’s a lot of misinformation online, Sanders thinks patients are becoming more critical about where they get their information. She thinks the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health have excellent information, and even Wikipedia can be helpful so long as the entries are edited by “people who have skin in the game.”
“We are getting to be savvier consumers,” she said. “I hope that people have enough sense to understand that when money is guiding your message, that maybe the message isn’t the best.”
Chinn said the series struck home in a personal way. Not long before prolific producer Rudin brought the project to him, his son was hospitalized with a mysterious intestinal problem whose cause was never known. Doctors in white coats just shrugged.
“It was interesting as a parent in that situation — not as a producer — the frustration of knowing that somewhere out in the world there probably was an answer to what was wrong with my son but there was no way to get it,” he said.
As the series shows, Sanders is a champion of patient-centered care. If in the past doctors were liable to dismiss or downplay their patients’ experiences, those days must come to an end, she thinks.
“The way I see a medical interaction is it’s a conference between two experts. I am the expert on bodies, how bodies work, how bodies don’t work and what we can do about it. What the patient is the expert on is that body and how that body feels,” she said. “There is no one who can tell you how the patient feels except the patient.”
Sanders, a professor at Yale, said she hopes doctors in particular tune into Diagnosis, in part to better understand what their patients go through. They often see a patient for 20 minutes, but the sick have to live with private suffering for weeks or months or years.
“I think one of the things that doctors will take away from this is how hard it is for patients to live with this kind of uncertainty,” she said. “This is an opportunity to remind doctors of how frightening it is to be alone out there.”

Who is Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell?

Texto completo: Ghislaine Maxwell, longtime confidante of the late Jeffrey Epstein, has reportedly been living in Manchester-by-the-Sea amid the controversy over the now-deceased millionaire.
The Daily Mail reported that Maxwell had been living at a property on Summer Street owned by Maxwell's boyfriend, Scott Borgerson, a tech CEO. The newspaper also said Borgerson was seen in July running errands there, as well as walking Maxwell's dog on Boston Common.
So who exactly is Maxwell, and how does she relate to the Epstein scandal? Here's a look.
■ A British socialite who grew up in a 53-room mansion, Maxwell moved to New York from England in 1991, around the same time her father — a media mogul who had been engulfed in financial scandal — died, according to The New York Times. She began dating Epstein, who was able to help her “resurrect the lifestyle she coveted" after her family lost much of its publishing empire, while Epstein was introduced to her friends in high places — including Britain's Prince Andrew, according to the Times.
Maxwell and Epstein would often host friends and celebrities, and one described Maxwell to the Times as the “charming, likable front person" in the couple: “A big part of the reason people talked to him [Epstein] was because of Ghislaine."
■ After revelations about Epstein and his alleged penchant for young girls surfaced, questions were also raised about Maxwell's involvement, as some alleged that her role included recruiting young girls for him. One former employee of Mr. Epstein's mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., referred to her as the “lady of the house," while one of Epstein's accusers called her Epstein's “madam" in court papers, according to the Times.
■ Two Epstein accusers have said Maxwell participated in the abuse.
Virginia Giuffre alleged in a 2009 lawsuit that Epstein began sexually abusing her when she was 16 and working at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. She said Maxwell invited her to Epstein's house, forced her into sexual relations with him, and then paid her, according to the New York Times.
Giuffre told the Miami Herald that Epstein would expect sexual activities from girls like her, saying that Maxwell “participated in these acts with him as well."
Maxwell has denied Giuffre's claims.
And while Maxwell has not been criminally charged, she has struck confidential settlements with two Epstein accusers, according to the Times.
The Times also described an advertisement that appeared in Yoga Journal in 1993 that sought a personal instructor, describing it as a job with “fantastic perks," telling candidates to call “Miss Maxwell" and listing Epstein's office number.
■ The Associated Press reported Wednesday that a woman had sued Maxwell and three unnamed members of Epstein's staff. Jennifer Araoz alleges that Epstein forcibly raped her when she was a teenager in 2002.
Maxwell's publicist and lawyers did not immediately respond to e-mails from the AP seeking comment.
■ After Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida to soliciting prostitution, Maxwell turned to environmental causes and founded a nonprofit intended to save the oceans, according to the Times. She also never quit being a socialite — she was seen attending Chelsea Clinton's wedding (Maxwell was a friend of Bill Clinton and sometimes traveled with him on Epstein's plane) and was photographed with celebrities like Arianna Huffington and Martha Stewart, according to the Times.
■ Maxwell is now reportedly dating Borgerson, the cofounder and CEO of CargoMetrics, a Boston-based firm that tracks seaborne cargoes and vessels all over the world. However, Borgerson described Maxwell as a “former friend" in an interview with Business Insider on Wednesday and denied that she was staying with him.

Texto completo: A$AP Rocky has just been found guilty of assault in Sweden, but the verdict comes a little late. Thanks to President Trump and Kim Kardashian, the rapper has already returned to the United States.
His case, which lit up the internet last month with its confluence of pop culture — the reality TV star-turned president joined the reality TV star-turned-criminal justice reform advocate to defend a Harlem-born rapper — has generally united Americans. (Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., appeared to express the minority opinion by calling Trump’s involvement a misuse of power.)
At least we can all agree that we never thought we’d see Trump tweeting, “A$AP Rocky released from prison and on his way home to the United States from Sweden. It was a Rocky Week, get home ASAP A$AP!”
Welcome to 2019.
It’s interesting, though, that many onlookers appeared to support A$AP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, in the conflict. In a dustup involving Rocky and a couple of his crew members, Rocky claimed a man who had been following his entourage was actually the one who threw the first punch.
According to the New York Times, “The judges found his defense unconvincing. ‘Based on two witness statements, the court finds the defendants were not subject to imminent attack,' the judgment said. ‘Therefore, the defendants were not entitled to use violence in self-defense.’”
As Swedish journalist Nathalie Rothschild wrote for Variety, some onlookers tended to take sides based on which party in the conflict appeared to be part of a more aggrieved group. It was A$AP Rocky, the 30-year-old African American rapper, versus Mustafa Jafari, a 19-year-old Afghan refugee.
“In fact, the affair highlights the limits of characterizing people as either victimized or privileged by virtue of their ethnicity and then judging their behavior accordingly,” Rothschild wrote. “That clouds rather than clarifies reality. We’d do better coolly to consider the facts, which of course the Swedish court has tried to do during its deliberations.”
In addition to highlighting the way intersectionality reduces the chances justice, the case brings up another question: Why were Americans so eager to see A$AP Rocky get off with just a slap on the wrist? Was it because they didn’t realize his counterpart was a young refugee, or was it because we still, despite our commitment to identity politics, prioritize the rich and powerful?
Maybe A$AP Rocky is the protagonist of this story because he gave our summer one of its most absurd headlines. In the entertainment industry, all press is good press.

Texto completo: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy denounced Iowa Rep. Steve King's recent comments that questioned how much of the world's population would remain if rape and incest had never happened.
"I have a great deal of problems with that," McCarthy told Bret Baier regarding King's phrasing of his anti-abortion position, adding, "This isn't the first time I’ve had concerns with what Steve King has said. Earlier in this Congress, there are things that Steve King said that I do not believe the party of Lincoln would stand for. And as a united conference, we actually removed Steve King from his committees inside Congress, and I think this just continues to show why that action was taken."
King incensed many Wednesday when he argued against abortion in the case of rape or incest by saying, "What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that? Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that."

Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the House's number-three Republican, also condemned King's comments, saying it was time for him to be out of office.

In January, McCarthy and other House Republicans voted to remove King from all his committee assignments after he appeared to wonder when "white supremacist" and "white nationalist" became offensive terms in an interview with the New York Times.

Texto completo: Samsung Electronics Co. is testing how fifth-generation wireless networks can speed up connections at its chip-making factory in Austin, Texas, a pilot that aims to prove 5G is more than a buzzword.
The company has teamed up with AT&T Inc.'s communications division to develop a customized 5G network to experiment with how it could be used in chip manufacturing.
The fifth generation of cellular networking, 5G is designed to replace current 4G technology, also known as LTE. The ultrafast speeds and reduced lag that will come with 5G will buttress new applications such as augmented reality and self-driving cars. Peak download speeds using 5G are expected to be about 100 times as fast as with 4G.
The transformation that will come from widespread commercial 5G deployments in manufacturing, logistics, transportation and energy is still about a decade away, experts have said . That's partly because it will take time to roll out the infrastructure to achieve full 5G coverage.
In the meantime, Samsung and other companies are testing 5G's potential in limited pilots to show what the technology can do.
"We're still in the experimentation phase, but we're hopeful there's value," said Alok Shah, vice president of networks strategy, business development and marketing at Samsung Electronics America, the company's U.S. unit.
Factories will be a big beneficiary of 5G connections, said Andre Fuetsch, chief technology officer for AT&T Communications, AT&T's biggest division.
"We see 5G being a great solution for solving a lot of the Wi-Fi issues that typical factories have today," he said. The technology, for example, could be used on manufacturing floors to power more reliable connections for computer-vision-scanning equipment that checks product quality.
AT&T has also rolled out consumer 5G networks in about 20 U.S. cities .
Samsung Electronics America and AT&T have invested millions of dollars in 5G innovation at Samsung's chip-manufacturing facility in Austin. Thousands of employees work at the chip factory, which is the size of about 10 football fields, Mr. Shah said.
Chip-making uses a lot of water and toxic chemicals; 5G could help chip factories cut waste and alert workers to safety hazards.
For example, 5G would allow more sensors to be installed to detect air quality, Mr. Shah said. Streaming real-time data from the sensors over 5G networks would mean that a control center can immediately detect serious air-quality hazards and move people out of harm's way. Sensors in factories today can't rely on existing wireless networks to pass along warnings to a control center, Mr. Shah said.
"Being able to put thousands of sensors within a relatively small space is hard for other [networking] technologies to support," Mr. Shah said. Certain networks can only support a finite number of devices. Fifth-generation wireless networks could support 1 million devices per square kilometer, up from about 100,000 devices per square kilometer with 4G LTE, he said.
Sensors on pumps and valves could also stream data about water usage over 5G networks so the facility can improve the efficiency of its water usage in real time and reduce waste.
Using 5G connections, workers could also learn how to repair equipment on the factory floor through augmented and virtual-reality headsets without any buffering or lags.
Other companies including New York Times Co. and German engineering firm Robert Bosch GmbH are testing 5G in pilots. The market for 5G, including related network infrastructure, is forecast to grow to $26 billion in 2022 from $528 million in 2018, according to research firm International Data Corp.
The tests are often "showcase demonstration pieces," useful for proving that 5G could generate revenue through new services or make processes more efficient, said Jason Leigh, research manager for mobility and 5G at IDC.
"The sooner you can get something tangible, it makes it easier to have that discussion at a C-suite and board level about what 5G really is, and it's not just this fad," Mr. Leigh said.

The last Great American novelist

Texto completo: Toni Morrison, dead last week at 88, was a great American novelist who was also a Great American Novelist. This means she had a special form of celebrity, an oracular status, and also that she was embraced by the tradition that regards novels as keys to interpreting America - insisting that you must read Morrison (and Ellison and Wright and Hurston) to understand the black experience, just as you must read Hawthorne and Melville to understand the legacy of Puritanism, or Faulkner or Cather to understand the South or West, and so on down the high-school English list.
So her passing raises the question: Is she the last of the species? The last American novelist who made novels seem essential to an educated person's understanding of her country?
That question won't be answerable for decades - the time it took to exhume, for instance, "Moby-Dick" and "The Great Gatsby" from their temporary graves. We can't know how Morrison's reputation will change, or the reputations of her peers or the status of their art form. The American novel was supposed to be eclipsed long ago by movies and television  and yet it proved resilient enough that, coming of age long after TV, I was still imprinted with the idea that novels were essential cultural ground, as important as Spielberg or "The Sopranos."
But something has changed in the cultural status of the novel in the time I've been a reader, the years between Morrison's canonization and her passing - and maybe especially the years since social media and the iPhone first arrived.
Part of that change is measurable. Sales of adult fiction have slumped by 16% just since 2013, with almost $1 billion in vanished sales. In both the United States and the United Kingdom, novelists find it harder to earn a living, while pop franchises and young-adult sales increasingly keep the industry afloat.
The change in the discourse has been less quantifiable but no less real. The humanities were a crucial zone of cultural debate in the 1980s and 1990s, when canons were understood to matter and were contested by right and left accordingly. Today technocracy is crushing the English department and the equivalent debates are often about representation in Marvel movies.
Likewise, controversies about the novel qua novel attracted substantial attention 20 years ago - Tom Wolfe's feuds, Jonathan Franzen's Oprah anxieties, the judgments passed on the State of the Novel in The Atlantic or The New Republic, the criticism wars waged over James Wood or The Believer. Today you get that kind of attention only when a fiction touches some raw culture-war nerve, as with the New Yorker story "Cat Person" or the Margaret Atwood revival. Otherwise, the book media feels dominated, as Christian Lorentzen wrote recently in Harper's, by "a consumerist mode of engagement with the arts," in which the only point is to recommend and "like."
Do these trends reflect the philistinism of late liberalism or capitalism? The tyranny of the political? The absence of traditional constraints that used to lend dramatic tension to social and domestic novels? The migration of literary talent to shows like "Girls" and "Atlanta," the novel-equivalents of the Millennial age?
Probably all of the above. But in my own life it's the internet that's killing novel-reading. And specifically the social media/iPhone combination, whose distracting effect is the enemy of the novel more than of other forms of art.
You cannot jump in and out of serious novel-reading, and a book doesn't claim your gaze the way the movies and television do. You have to enter and remain, undistracted and immersed. I used to be able to do that easily; now I only achieve immersion with high-end genre fiction, relying on murders and dragons to pull me away from the online. (I have a similar experience with another lost love, baseball, where now I only watch the playoffs.)
This is not the fault of contemporary novelists. Like Wood and others (but less intelligently) I had theories about What Was Wrong With the Novel back when I read lots of novels. But I'm pretty sure it's my relationship to media and technology, not those theories, that are the reason I read so many fewer now. And although some of my favorite 1930s authors developed a more cinematic style in the shadow of the talkies, I wouldn't want to read a novel adapted to the Twitter age.
What I want instead is the experience of my early-adulthood canon dives and quests for new books that might one day be canonical; the feeling of losing yourself in a story while also participating in a tradition.
That loss of depth and memory means that if the decline of the novel is not the internet's more troubling influence, it might be one of the more telling.
For now there's only one way to resist. I've got the new Sally Rooney novel, "Normal People," on my dresser. Is she the Great Irish-Millennial Novelist - or at least as good a writer as her reviews suggest? The only way to know is the old one: Take and read.

Belgian editor defends publication of column saying Jews have 'ugly noses'

Texto completo: The editor of a prestigious Belgian daily defended an op-ed described as anti-Semitic, saying its critics were trying to silence criticism of Israel.
The column, written by Dimitri Verhulst, was published July 27 in De Morgen and quickly drew outrage. It describes Jews in Israel as land thieves with a religious superiority complex and says they have "ugly noses."
"We clearly do not view the text as anti-Semitic. Otherwise we wouldn't have published it. Neither did the author intend it as anti-Semitic," Bart Eeckhout, De Morgen's editor in chief, wrote in response to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. "The op-ed surely is a harsh criticism on Israel's politics towards the Palestinian people. It is written in a hard, sarcastic fashion and it foretells the current uproar, stating that any hard criticism on Israel will always be reinterpreted as anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism is a very serious allegation, which we think is used too easily in this case, in a way to silence the debate about Israel's policies."
Titled "There is no promised land, only stolen land," the op-ed charges through sarcasm that Israeli Jews and their supporters regard themselves as "chosen" and God's "darlings," and they use the ambiguous biblical concept to justify the subjugation of the Palestinians.
"Because God has His favorites and they have their privileges, Palestinians were driven out of their homes in 1948 to make place for God's favorites," Verhulst wrote. "Speaking with [the] chosen is difficult. As soon as you mention Israel and the fate of the Palestinians, they look at you like you masterminded the Holocaust yourself."
It inaccurately quotes the late French-Jewish singer Serge Gainsbourg as having said that "Being Jewish is not a religion, no God would give creatures such an ugly nose."
Gainsbourg's original self-deprecating quote contains neither the word "God" nor "ugly." Rather, he is believed to have said that "Being Jewish is not a religion. No religion makes you grow such a nose." The singer appeared to be joking about being ethnically Jewish rather than religiously. Verhulst musters his version to suggest that God doesn't regard Jews as the "chosen" people after all.
He also accuses Israel of "murdering" 10,000 Palestinians since 2002. That period includes three armed conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the second intifada.
The Forum of Jewish Organizations of Belgium's Flemish Region complained to police about alleged incitement in the Verhulst column and said the article does not merely criticize Israel, but insults Jews as a people.
The Central Jewish Board of the Netherlands also condemned the op-ed as anti-Semitic.
Hans Knoops, a prominent Dutch journalist who handles media issues for the Forum of Jewish Organizations, said he understands how the paper might have published the article.
"Things slip through, I know this all too well," Knoop told JTA. "It even happens in The New York Times because of poor judgment or lacking review."
Far more troubling to Knoop, however, is De Morgen's refusal to pull the article, and its editor in chief's insistence that complaints by Belgian and Dutch Jews about the column's alleged anti-Semitism are merely designed to shield Israel from criticism. The web version now includes a box noting the Jewish forum's complaint against Verhulst.
"For the first time since the 1940s, pure anti-Semitism is displayed and kept in the op-ed section of a mainstream Belgian daily," said Knoop, who ran the news division of the Telegraaf daily in the Netherlands and is responsible for exposing the Nazi war criminal Pieter Menten in the 1970s.
"This summer, a line has been crossed," he added.
The controversy spilled over into the Netherlands when local Jews asked NRC Handelsblad, a Dutch left-leaning daily, to drop an in-depth interview with Verhulst, an award-winning author in the Dutch language, or at least address the controversy in the 3,500-word interview. NRC Handeslblad refused, with a deputy editor telling critics that it does not intend to "punish" Verhulst.
Like Knoop, Dutch Chief Rabbi Binyomin Jacobs also found echoes of the rampant anti-Semitism that characterized mainstream media in the region during the 1940s and previous decades.
"The anti-Semitic article in De Morgen reminds me of yesterday, the '30s. And unfortunately, it also reminds of today," Jacobs, the son of Holocaust survivors, wrote in an op-ed. "I am worried, and I don't know if that will be understood."
In an unusual move, Israel's embassy in Belgium condemned the publication for printing and defending the column.
The embassy wrote on Twitter that it "is deeply shocked by the publication in Belgian newspaper De Morgen of a blatantly anti-Semitic article."

Texto completo: A Saturday morning shooting rampage in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 3 took the lives of 22 people and seriously injured more than two dozen others. Reportedly, the alleged shooter wanted to kill as many Mexicans as he could. Armed with safety glasses, ear coverings and an assault-style rifle, the shooter entered a Walmart store during a back-to-school sale.
"Saturday's attack on El Paso was an attack on the Mexican heritage of millions of Americans - and also part of a history of white supremacist and nativist acts in Texas across three centuries," wrote Hector Tobar in a recent New York Times op-ed. Tobar, an associate professor at the University of California at Irvine, is also a published author.
Later that day during evening hours and nearly 1,600 miles away in Dayton, Ohio, another gunman's attack left nine people dead and 27 injured in that city's Oregon district. Like the Texas shooter, Ohio's shooter was heavily armed but was shot by police before he could enter a nightclub where he could have killed far more. The victims of this shooting reflected the city's diversity and included Blacks, Latinos and whites.
How in a span of only 24 hours could two cities in different states and regions suffer mass shootings - one in a city only a few miles from the nation's southern border, and the other, a former Midwestern manufacturing hub?
Despite the shock of two unprovoked attacks, family and community members in both cities must somehow cope through their grief while preparing funeral arrangements. These two communities are also challenging governmental officials at both the state and federal levels to take actions to prevent further fatalities.
Nationally, a profusion of prayers and condolences from the nation together signaled that a tragic moment may yet be transformed into a groundswell movement that reckons with the American conscience. The profusion of assault weapons combined with easy access is a gripping issue that confronts us all.
In response to these and other tragedies, a rainbow coalition of leaders held a noon rally on Aug. 6 in the nation's capital. In a joint statement, the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights was joined by key partners including but not limited to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Voto Latino, the Center for Community Self-Help and the Center for Responsible Lending.
"None of this is acceptable," said the leaders in a written statement. "None of this is normal. Our organizations are united in saying that members of Congress can no longer look away as communities of color are murdered with impunity. We must all unite and demand accountability."
The NAACP and the National Urban League are additionally calling for the passage of the bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. Passed on a bipartisan House vote of 240-190 on Feb. 27, the bill has yet to be taken up by the Senate. The bill would address both background check requirements for firearms, and firearm transfers between private individuals.
Beyond congressional actions, however, other spheres of influence can also take an active role in curbing violence. For example, corporate leaders could publicly condemn efforts to demonize immigrants, minorities or other groups targeted for hate crimes and violence. In pulpits across the country, pastors should preach about the moral dilemma the nation faces and call upon congregants to live their faith every day. Community-based organizations can call upon state and local officials to also speak out against senseless acts of violence and white supremacists.
Now is also a time to remember that regardless of race or ethnicity, our history chronicles the range of hate crimes that have taken the lives of Latinos as well as Native Americans, Blacks, Jews and the LGBTQ community. The terror now facing America's Latinos resurrects these horrors, particularly how Blacks encountered racial hatred for more than a century during Jim Crow era and later during the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s.
Too many times in recent years, in our unique Black American experience we remain at risk as a people. In 1998 the body of James Byrd, a Black, 49-year old Jasper, Texas, man was ripped to pieces as it was dragged over a mile and a half by whites driving a pickup truck. Other and more recent heinous hate crimes remind us of Tray von Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Tamir Rice - just to name a few.
According to Rutgers University, Black men today are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be victims of violence. From 2013 to 2017, 11,456 fatal encounters with police and members of the public were reported.
At the same time, the emergence of hate groups has been on the rise, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).
"The total number of hate groups rose to 1,020 in 2018, up about 7 percent from 2017," wrote Heidi Beirich, who leads SPLC's Intelligence Project and its award-winning publication, The Intelligence Report.
Its report released in February found that the number of white nationalist groups grew from 100 in 2017 to 148 in 2018 - a 50% increase. Other hate groups - anti-Semitic, anti-LGBTQ and anti-Muslim - also grew during the same period from 233 to 264. While the Ku Klux Klan dominated hate groups in the Jim Crow and civil rights eras, its presence across the country now appears to have been eclipsed by the growth of neo-Nazis, white nationalists and skinhead organizations.
SPLC's Hate Map by State shows that the largest number of statewide hate groups are located in California (83), Florida (75) and Texas (73). At the local level, hate organizations operate in Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego and Tallahassee, Florida. Beyond these three states, hate groups can also be found in 45 other states and in more metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Sacramento, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
Just as the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. prompted the enactment of major civil rights legislation, now is another time for our nation to stand up to the many forms of domestic terrorism that plague the nation. People of conscience and principle have a duty to stand up and speak out for the fullness of our "inalienable rights."

The EU's last ultimatum on Brexit is intended to fail

Texto completo: Imagine that Donald Trump wanted to reopen trade talks with the European Union. I know, I know, but humor me.
Suppose that the United States were to ask, in good faith, to resume the negotiations that were halted in 2016. And suppose that Brussels were to respond as follows: “We’ll discuss a trade deal with you, but with two preconditions. First, you need to give us control over the terms of your trade with third countries. From now on, we get to negotiate deals on your behalf with Canada, Mexico, and the rest. Second, we will assume administrative control over California, laying down its technical standards. Oh, and after all that, there is no guarantee that we will actually give you the trade deal.”
We know how Americans would respond to such demands. Yet these are the terms that the EU is demanding from the United Kingdom. Its officials say they won’t discuss trade — or police co-operation, or the exchange of information, or any of the usual courtesies between neighboring states — unless the U.K. first agrees to remain in the EU’s customs union (in other words, accepting its common tariffs and agreeing not to sign its own trade deals) and to allow the economy of Northern Ireland to be regulated by Brussels.
The former Greek economics minister Yanis Varoufakis declared that “this is a deal that a nation signs only after having been defeated at war,” a theme taken up by many British politicians. I see his point, though it reminds me more of the ultimatum issued by Austria-Hungary to Serbia in July 1914, demanding control of large chunks Serbia’s internal affairs. That ultimatum, like this one, was designed to be rejected.
The EU’s calculation was that, if it offered harsh enough terms, Britain might drop the whole idea of Brexit. Its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told EU leaders at the start of the process: “I’ll have done my job if, in the end, the deal is so tough on the British that they’d prefer to stay in the EU.”
That tactic has worked in the past. Denmark and Ireland were browbeaten into backing down after voting the “wrong” way in EU referendum — twice in Ireland’s case. When Theresa May was prime minister, it seemed to be working again. But Boris Johnson is a different beast. Since becoming prime minister, he has declined to meet any EU leaders, saying that he sees no point in sitting there and being told that they won’t budge.
The EU could offer a standard break-clause, of the kind that every other treaty has. But for many Eurocrats, that would take the whole point out of the withdrawal terms, namely that they must be seen to be punitive.
American friends keep telling me that the blockage has something to do with the Irish border or peace some such. It does not. If, as now seems likely, Britain leaves the EU with no deal on Oct. 31, it will immediately become obvious that there was never any possibility of physical infrastructure being erected at the Irish border. Both governments have said as much, and both sets of customs officers have confirmed that it is unnecessary. Who, then, is going to build this hard border, for heaven’s sake? Is Mexico going to pay for it?
The border issue is simply a way of sugarcoating the EU’s demands, disguising their unreasonableness from outside commentators. There are always lazy and gullible journalists prepared to swallow the Brussels line, or, in the case of the New York Times, to exaggerate it.
But the last three years have taught Britons that they are not dealing with friendly negotiating partners. The EU would rather inflict damage on all sides than watch a post-Brexit U.K. succeed. Faced with such an attitude, many Britons feel that the time has come to pivot to friendlier countries; countries that want to maximize the prosperity that comes from free exchange.
At the top of our list, naturally, is the U.S., our biggest investor and the biggest recipient of our investment. Last week, 45 senators signed a letter by the lanky and patriotic Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, calling for a free trade agreement with Britain. Such a deal is one of the few deals to unite anti-Trump Republicans (because they like free trade) with pro-Trump Republicans (because the president wants this particular deal) with a fair number of Democrats (who have become more pro-free trade since Trump took over).
Here’s the good news, senators: A draft trade deal already exists. It was drawn up by eleven U.K. and U.S. think tanks and published last year, and it provides for complete mutual recognition in goods, services, and professional qualifications. It would bring our nations closer and make our peoples richer.
What are we waiting for?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has had a busy day — on Twitter.
While the president is on vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, he has repeatedly tweeted on a number of topics from the protests happening in Hong Kong to criticizing CNN anchor Chris Cuomo after the journalist was captured on video threatening a heckler.
Trump only took a short break from Twitter while he spoke at the soon-to-be-completed Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex in Monaca, Pa. But after his speech, which lasted a little over an hour, the president went back to his favorite social media platform.
Trump has tweeted or retweeted posts over 30 times so far on Tuesday — to his roughly 63 million followers on Twitter.

Here is a roundup of some of the things Trump has tweeted about Tuesday:
Arizona politics and Curt Schilling
One of Trump's first tweets of the day was about Curt Schilling, a former pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks and an outspoken conservative.
In a statement to the Arizona Republic, which is part of the USA TODAY Network, Schilling said that he is "absolutely considering" running for Congress in Arizona against one of the state's five House Democrats.
Although Schilling did not say in which district he might run, Trump wrote on Twitter that it would be a "terrific" idea if he did.
"Curt Schilling, a great pitcher and patriot, is considering a run for Congress in Arizona. Terrific!" Trump wrote.
Chris Cuomo and CNN
Trump repeatedly slammed Cuomo on Twitter on Tuesday, as well as CNN, the network he works for.
Cuomo was videotaped during a heated exchange with an unidentified man who called him "Fredo. " Cuomo described the term as a racist slur toward Italian Americans. It's a reference to a character in the 1972 film "The Godfather," Fredo Corleone, who Cuomo said is "a weak brother. "
"I thought Chris was Fredo also. The truth hurts. Totally lost it! Low ratings" Trump wrote in a tweet.
The president later tweeted: "Would Chris Cuomo be given a Red Flag for his recent rant? Filthy language and a total loss of control. He shouldn’t be allowed to have any weapon. He’s nuts!"
Trump has repeatedly criticized CNN throughout his tenure as president and even while on the campaign trail for the 2016 election. He often calls media outlets he dislikes "fake news. " At the president's rallies, chants of "CNN sucks" have broken out and CNN journalists at Trump rallies have been heckled.
Trump later retweeted a post from his son, Donald Trump Jr. , who wrote that YouTube had taken down the video of Cuomo yelling at the unidentified man. The video is currently still active on YouTube; it's unclear if it was perhaps taken down temporarily.
"Put it back up. We are living with a Rigged & Fake Media!" Trump tweeted.
He went on to repost several tweets from Trump allies, such as Diamond and Silk, criticizing Cuomo. His re-election campaign also criticized Cuomo, which Trump retweeted.
Throughout the day, Trump continued to knock Cuomo and CNN. He also retweeted several posts criticizing the New York Times.
'Make sure we win': Donald Trump mixes 2020 politics into Pennsylvania energy speech
"It always happens! When a Conservative does even a fraction of what Chris Cuomo did with his lunatic ranting, raving, & cursing, they get destroyed by the Fake News," he wrote in a tweet. "But when a Liberal Democrat like Chris Cuomo does it, Republicans immediately come to his defense. We never learn!"
Nearly 20 minutes later, Trump replied to a tweet claiming without evidence that a majority of the viewers of Cuomo's CNN show are "unwilling passengers at the airports. "
"True! Without being stuck at an airport, where CNN buys (at a big price) an uninterested audience, they’ve got nothing going," Trump wrote. "@CNN is BAD for America!"
Hong Kong protests
After being asked by reporters about clashes between riot police and pro-democracy protesters at Hong Kong's airport, Trump told reporters that it was "tricky" situation and that he hoped it would resolve itself.
But after speaking to reporters, Trump took to Twitter to question why he was being blamed for the clash.
"Many are blaming me, and the United States, for the problems going on in Hong Kong," Trump wrote in a tweet. "I can’t imagine why?"
More: Trump saves Christmas? Tariffs on some Chinese goods delayed until December
Democratic lawmakers have criticized Trump for being slow to speak out against the clashes, and Republican lawmakers have taken a more aggressive position on the situation, saying China shouldn't be cracking down on protesters.
Several minutes after Trump's tweet about being blamed, he followed up with: "Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!"
2020 Democratic candidates
Trump also slammed several of the Democratic presidential candidates in a series of retweets.
Trump retweeted a post from Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who criticized Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , for her stance on providing health care coverage.
"Kamala Harris isn’t fooling anyone on health care," McDaniel tweeted. "Here’s one of Iowa’s seniors calling her out for her socialist plan. "
The president also tweeted a post from his son, Trump Jr. , making fun of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's crowd size.
Trump Jr. tweeted three laughing emojis, along with "Bill de Blasio draws 15-person crowd in Iowa" and linking to an article that shared that headline. President Trump has repeatedly bragged about his crowd size throughout the 2016 election and his presidency.
More: California, other states sue Trump administration over replacement of Obama's Clean Power Plan
Trump also reposted another tweet from McDaniel, this time targeting Julián Castro, the former Obama Housing and Urban Development secretary. The tweet criticized Castro for not denouncing a tweet his twin brother wrote condemning Texas donors to Trump's re-election campaign.
"2020 Democrat Julian Castro says he’s 'very proud' of his brother’s target list of @realDonaldTrump supporters," McDaniel wrote. "Castro has no business being president and – if you look at the polls – nearly every American agrees. "

Texto completo: Antolín López Aguilar , un ciudadano guatemalteco de 23 años, intentó el 3 de diciembre de 2017 cruzar la frontera de Nogales, Arizona, para entrar en territorio de EEUU. Pero Matthew Bowen , un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza que dos semanas antes había definido a los inmigrantes como él “infrahumanos”, y “salvajes asesinos”, interceptó el intento.
El agente fue acusado posteriormente de golpear y herir al migrante con un vehículo del servicio de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés) cuando este trató de escapar de él y de otros compañeros que trataban de detenerlo. El joven fue hospitalizado tras el accidente.
Ahora, Bowen reconoce que trató de atropellarlo. “Lo golpeé de manera intencional con fuerza desmesurada” , aseguró en una declaración recogida en documentos de una corte federal y citada por The New York Times y otros medios. El abogado del agente, Sean Chapman, confirmó a EFE que su cliente admitió ser culpable de esos hechos.
Bowen agregó en su declaración que sus actos “no estaba justificados” y violaron los derechos de López-Aguilar “protegidos por la Constitución de EEUU”.
Tras el accidente, el migrante fue sentenciado a 30 días de prisión por tratar de entrar ilegalmente al país, según el diario The Arizona Republic. The New York Times dice que se desconoce lo que pasó después con él.
Este y otros medios aseguran que el agente se enfrentaría a hasta un año de prisión y podría ser multado con 100.000 dólares cuando una corte determine en octubre la sentencia por el caso. El abogado dijo a EFE que a cambio de la admisión de culpabilidad y de renunciar a su posición en la Patrulla Fronteriza, Bowen evitará el juicio en su contra y quedará en libertad provisional.
El agente, que estuvo trabajando de patrullero desde 2008, fue suspendido de empleo y sueldo a partir de su procesamiento judicial en junio de 2018, según algunos medios.
El caso de Matthew Bowen cobró relevancia nacional en mayo de este año, cuando se supo que, dentro del proceso por el intento de atropello del migrante guatemalteco en la corte de distrito de Tucson, Arizona, salieron a la luz mensajes de corte racista y agresivo contra los inmigrantes enviados por Bowen a otros agentes fronterizos anteriormente a ese hecho.
En estos mensajes, el agente se refería a los inmigrantes con expresiones como “escoria”, “repugnante basura infrahumana” que “no merece ni ser astillas para prender un fuego”. Según su abogado, lo que se dice en ellos no es extraordinario, y responde a sentimientos “habituales entre los patrulleros de Tucson”.
Posteriormente, sin embargo, el abogado aclaró que sus explicaciones concernían sólo a la palabra “tonc”, usada en los mensajes para referirse a los inmigrantes, y que se sospecha que puede ser una onomatopeya del sonido de un agente golpeándoles con una linterna en la cabeza. Otra interpretación podría ser el acrónimo “temporalmente fuera de su país nativo” (escrito en inglés).
The New York Times asegura que la corte determinó que los mensajes enviados antes del accidente no se podían considerar relevantes para el caso. Pero una juez estableció que a partir de la fecha del intento de atropello, los mensajes de Bowen que pudieran referirse a este asunto o con contenidos racista sí lo serían.
El día después del accidente, Bowen confesó en un mensaje a un compañero que sí había usado una camioneta Ford F-150 para intentar detener a un migrante, pero que solo había sido “un pequeño empujón”.
El agente fue acusado también de falsificar un documento enviado al jefe del Sector de Tucson de la Patrulla Fronteriza y en el que “declaró falsamente que no estaba seguro si su vehículo contactó a López-Aguilar, y que nunca tuvo la intención de golpear, asustar o entrar en contacto con el hombre que huía del agente”. Tras su admisión de responsabilidad, los fiscales acordaron desestimar esta acusación, dice The Arizona Republic.
En el pasado, Bowen ya había sido acusado de usar fuerza excesiva sin motivo para realizar arrestos en al menos cinco ocasiones.

Texto completo: Shari Redstone finally pulled it off: a deal reuniting Viacom and CBS, the two media titans her father Sumner broke apart 13 years ago.
The merger announced on Tuesday has been in the making for several years — with National Amusements Inc., the Redstones' Norwood-based movie theater business, at the heart of it. National Amusements doesn't just run the Showcase Cinemas chain. It also acts as the holding company through which the Redstone family controls 80 percent of the voting shares in both CBS and Viacom.
CBS and Viacom last came close to merging in the spring of 2018, but as typical with the CBS-Viacom soap opera, personalities got in the way. Then-CBS chief executive Les Moonves clashed with Shari Redstone over the merger, with Viacom's valuation and the combined company's leadership particular sticking points. Moonves apparently wanted his protégé at CBS, Joe Ianniello, to succeed him, while Bob Bakish, the head of Viacom, was seen as Redstone's choice. Redstone tried to exert control while CBS tried to ease itself out from under the Redstone shadow. Things got ugly.
Moonves was eventually shown the door, one of the most high-profile executives to fall in the #MeToo wave of sexual misconduct allegations. His departure helped usher in a détente between the two factions. National Amusements agreed not to push the CBS-Viacom merger for two years, but that didn't rule out leaders at either company from promoting it on their own. That was fine with Redstone — sooner or later, the deal would come.
In the end, Ianniello and Bakish both survive in what will be called ViacomCBS Inc. — Bakish as chief executive, and Ianniello as head of the CBS portfolio. Redstone, who works primarily out of New York City now, maintains control: National Amusements keeps its majority voting stake, and she becomes chair of the new board.
Redstone left it to Bakish, Ianniello, and chief financial officer Christina Spade to hold forth with analysts about the merger's nitty-gritty details and purported benefits on a conference call Tuesday afternoon. CBS shareholders will own 61 percent of the combined company, while Viacom shareholders own the rest after the deal closes at the end of the year. Together, the two companies generate more than $28 billion in revenue. Expect $500 million in annual savings within two years, and a boost to earnings soon after the deal closes.
The deal brings together Viacom's Paramount movie studio and its cable TV networks — MTV, Nickelodeon, BET, among them — with CBS, Showtime, and the Simon & Schuster publishing house. Now, you will probably see Paramount movies on Showtime's premium channel, or Viacom's programming on the CBS All Access streaming service.
Sumner Redstone used to say “content is king," and that mantra is more true than ever in the media business. That's why AT&T paid big money and took on the Trump administration for Time Warner, and Disney beat out Comcast in fierce bidding for 21st Century Fox. As more consumers cut the cable cord, media companies are racing to come up with new ways to get their programs to viewers. Subscription services, made famous by Netflix, are all the rage now.
Analysts on the CBS-Viacom call seemed to wonder aloud whether the two companies, once united, will still be big enough to compete over the long haul. The Viacom/CBS executives made it clear they would be looking to acquire more content producers along the way, to build the already enormous media library.
The executives also emphasized the power of the content that CBS and Viacom are currently creating: It's the result of some $13 billion in combined annual spending, one of the largest amounts in the industry. They plan to sell shows to third-party channels — Netflix, Disney+, and the like — and beef up their own subscription services.
It's the vision that Shari Redstone has pushed all along, that the two companies were stronger together than apart in this shifting media landscape.
In her Sumner Redstone biography “The King of Content," Keach Hagey describes Shari Redstone as “her father's daughter: doggedly determined, shrewd, and not particularly patient."
The way Shari Redstone endured through all these negotiations, corporate machinations, and backroom deals indicates she possesses those first two traits in spades. But she also had to show patience, too, to finally emerge victorious.

Texto completo: Seventy-five years ago, "Double Indemnity" opened in theaters across America. It was an instant hit, and remains to this day a staple offering of revival houses and on cable TV and streaming video. Yet little journalistic notice has been taken of the birthday of Billy Wilder's first great screen drama, a homicidal thriller that nonetheless had—and has—something truly unsettling to say about the dark crosscurrents of middle-class American life.
Directed by Wilder and co-written by him and Raymond Chandler, the celebrated mystery novelist, "Double Indemnity" is the story of a restless insurance salesman who helps a sexy, frustrated housewife murder her husband for profit. Though neither Wilder nor Chandler realized it at the time, it would later be acknowledged by critics and scholars as the first fully developed example of film noir, in which a flawed but basically innocent protagonist is presented with a moral choice, makes the wrong call, and is plunged into a violent after-hours world of passion and crime. From "Out of the Past" to Quentin Tarantino, every subsequent noir and neo-noir film has been haunted by the ghosts of Walter Neff, the wisecracking salesman who secretly longs to "crook the house" by any means necessary, and Phyllis Dietrichson, the shopworn babe who takes Walter for all he's got—until he finally gets wise.
It's hard to understand what possessed Wilder to take on such a project. He was best known in 1944, after all, for having collaborated with Charles Brackett, a Harvard-educated WASP, on the screenplays for such romantic comedies as "Ninotchka" and "Ball of Fire." But then he swerved far off course and decided to make a movie out of a 1936 crime novella by James M. Cain, who was also the author of "The Postman Always Rings Twice," another hard-boiled tale of sex and bloodshed. Moreover, Wilder was determined to direct "Double Indemnity" himself, having concluded that most Hollywood directors treated scripts like "toilet paper that they either used or they didn't." The patrician Brackett had no interest in adapting so sordid a tale for the screen, so Wilder found himself another collaborator in Chandler. The two men soon grew to loathe one another, but the fruit of their uneasy labors landed seven Oscar nominations and turned Wilder into the hottest of properties.
Small wonder: Every aspect of "Double Indemnity" is distinguished, so much so that you could write a column about any single element. The script is a dazzling amalgam of precisely tooled plot points and sharp-cornered repartée. (Phyllis: "We're both rotten." Walter: "Only you're a little more rotten.") Miklós Rózsa's background score skillfully heightens all the on-screen emotions, while Wilder's unshowy style exemplifies his prime directive of direction: "When somebody turns to his neighbor and says, 'My, that was beautifully directed,' we have proof it was not."
Fred MacMurray, who would reinvent himself years later as the bland sitcom dad of "My Three Sons," plays Neff with a cheerful snappiness that barely conceals his inchoate longing to break free from the iron shackles of respectability. Edward G. Robinson, the gangster-star of the '30s who here switched over to his first supporting role, gives the performance of a lifetime as Barton Keyes, the claims manager of Pacific All-Risk Insurance, who loves Walter like the son he never had, then discovers to his horror that his "son" is the killer he's been hunting down. Best of all, though, is Barbara Stanwyck. Part of what makes her so striking is that Wilder showed her villainy in an unexpectedly sympathetic light (an impression underlined by Rózsa, whose music for the love scenes is overtly romantic). In addition, she'd acquired from her earlier comic roles a deftness that allowed her to toss off the film's crisp dialogue with beguiling ease.
None of the makers of "Double Indemnity" knew they were shooting one for the ages. Critics are no better at spotting true innovation, and few of them saw in 1944 how original it was. Bosley Crowther of the New York Times dismissed it as "a variably intriguing crime game" that was "diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length." Even the vastly more perceptive James Agee, writing in the Nation, called it "essentially cheap." Not so: "Double Indemnity" is deadly serious, a moral tale about the thinness of the ice on which human decency rests. In a 1978 interview, Wilder went so far as to admit that it reflected the "deep-seated influence [of] having read a lot of Dostoyevsky."
On another occasion, Wilder called "Double Indemnity" a "love story between two men," alluding to the last scene, in which Neff, who is lying in a pool of blood on the floor of his office, gasps to Keyes that he couldn't see that the murderer he'd sought was "too close. Right across the desk from you." To which the heartbroken Keyes replies in a voice whose hardness cannot conceal his anguish, "Closer than that, Walter." That wrenching climax sums up "Double Indemnity," a pop-culture masterpiece exemplary of the very best that golden-age Hollywood had to offer.

Area refugee groups brace for Trump policy changes

Texto completo: Exodus Refugee in Indianapolis is bracing for the possibility the Trump administration will lower the number of refugees allowed annually into the United States to 10,000 or possibly even zero.
Administration officials have said they want to redirect some federal refugee funding toward processing asylum claims on the border.
Many refugee advocates, including Exodus Executive Director Cole Varga, disagree with this either-or policy and hope the refugee cap at least stays the same.
"In a best-case scenario, it holds steady at 30,000," Varga said. "Even that is an awful response to a global crisis."
Politico reported in July discussions among Trump advisers of lowering the cap. A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services representative suggested a zero cap, while officials from Homeland Security Department suggested a number between 3,000 and 10,000.
The Trump administration already reduced the cap from 110,000 under President Barack Obama to 45,000 in fiscal year 2018 and 30,000 this fiscal year. A finalized cap for federal fiscal year 2020 should be released before it starts Oct. 1.
How refugee groups are funded Varga said if the number is further reduced, the action wouldn't just leave stranded tens of thousands of refugees abroad who are done or nearly done with the U.S. screening process.
It also would mean financial trouble for resettlement reorganizations who help new arrivals and refugees already here. Much of these organizations' budgets come from federal funding based on the number of refugees they resettle.
Exodus was forced to cut about one-third of its staff in 2017 after the initial cap reduction.
Varga said Exodus does have other sources of funding and has fared better than other organizations across the country, though, some of which have been forced to shut down.
Although the number of refugees Exodus settled has dropped from 947 in 2016 to 323 this fiscal year, Indianapolis benefits from having large established Burmese and Congolese populations that grow as family and friends of current residents arrive.
"We're in better shape than a lot of places because we have a large Burmese population and Congolese population," Varga said. "We haven't felt as drastic a decrease as a lot of offices."
Trump's focus on the border Ken Cuccinelli, acting U.S. citizenship and immigration services director, said in an Aug. 1 CNN interview the administration wants to keep the number for refugee admissions low so funds can be redistributed to handle the administrative backlog of asylum cases from the border.
"I'd like to see us have a number low enough so we can handle asylum claims," Cuccinelli said.
A similar reasoning was given for the last cap reduction. In September, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said lowering the refugee cap to 30,000 was not a "barometer of America's commitment to vulnerable people around the world" but reflected the "greater public expense" of processing an increased number of asylum seekers, according to a report in the New York Times.
Varga disagrees with this approach and said the U.S. has helped both asylum seekers and refugees for decades. The number of refugees admitted was more than 100,000 annually for much of the 1990s, when the U.S. also experienced a similar surge in and administrative backlog of asylum cases.
Varga also said whether new cuts happen, the effects of the previous cap reductions will be felt long into the future. Even if someone is elected in 2020 or later who wants to raise the number of refugees admitted, it will be hard to do so because so many resettlement organizations are gone.
"This is a huge issue because no matter what happens with future administrations, the infrastructure is continuing to be eaten away at by the Trump administration," Varga said. "You can't just restart a resettlement agency."
Economic impact of refugees Reducing the number of refugees admitted also may affect the economy, said Indiana University Professor Elizabeth Dunn, who studies refugees and humanitarian aid.
A Department of Health and Human Services report in 2017 showed that over a decade, refugees contributed $63 billion more in revenue for the government than they received in assistance. Immigrants, including refugees, also help make up for labor shortages caused by changing demographics, especially greater numbers of baby boomers retiring.
"Refugees have historically been a really significant labor pool," Dunn said. "We're now really hurting for labor."
The president of one organization in Indianapolis that helps refugees and other immigrants find jobs said the labor pool is the tightest he has ever seen, and the organization is trying to help fill jobs every week.
"It's a heightened state of emergency," said Seth Morales of Morales Group. "There's a labor and talent shortage."
Varga said the cap reductions also keep families separated. He said a large portion of refugees resettled recently are part of family reunification efforts.
"People aren't just waiting to start their futures," Varga said. "They're waiting to reunite with their families."
Varga said he would like to see Indiana representatives in Washington stand up for the resettlement program, and added if people want to help Exodus, they can donate household items to furnish refugee homes or call their representatives to voice support for resettlement.
"It would be amazing," Varga said, "to have elected leaders actually take some leadership and bring some Hoosier values to the table."

Texto completo: When Variety's Marc Malkin sat down for a conversation with "Vida" showrunner Tanya Saracho as part of the 2019 National Association of Latino Independent Producers (NALIP) Media Summit, she admitted that her Mexican heritage wasn't always a point of pride.
In fact, she once attempted to erase the evidence: "When I came to this country, I was trying to get rid of my accent," she said, explaining that her motivation was a desire to join the speech and debate team as a student in Texas.
But Saracho has since emerged as an outspoken voice for Latinx representation in Hollywood, which is why she was honored with the Media Advocacy Award at the organization's Latino Media Awards gala.
Last year, Saracho signed a three-year production deal with Starz, and she's currently working on Season 3 of the series in addition to a new show titled "Bruja."
During her conversation with Malkin, Saracho recounted her journey from aspiring actress to playwright to TV writer (writing for mainstream hits like "Girls" and "How to Get Away with Murder"), which ultimately culminated in the opportunity to create "Vida."
"Me being here is an accident," she said.
As it turns out, instead of perfecting the art of American enunciation, competitive public speaking awakened something in Saracho. "I was always a ham," she said, and soon she fell in love with performing in front of an audience. More importantly, she learned about the lack of diversity in American theater, which inspired her to pursue playwriting, and since Saracho tends to think big, she also founded Teatro Luna - the first all-Latina theater company in the country.
Standing out as a fresh voice in the contemporary theater scene, her plays soon attracted the attention of The New York Times, which helped Saracho get an agent.
Her gift for storytelling also led to her first job as a staff writer for Marc Cherry's "Devious Maids."
Saracho became determined to prove her value as a TV writer with her next job on HBO's LGBTQ series, "Looking." "I was there because of my queerness," she said, and this experience informed her inclusive vision for "Vida," where she writes sex scenes for nonbinary people too. Saracho is the first to admit that she didn't have to fight to get her passion project made - Starz pitched it to her, and its offer included the creative control to hire Latinx talent behind and in front of the camera.
But one victory does not constitute a movement in her eyes. "I can count the Latinx-themed shows with my hand," she said. "We're definitely having a moment, but it's dangerous to congratulate ourselves too much - we're not there yet."

I told you I’m no Shakespeare expert

Texto completo: So I had a good day this week when local resident Douglas Bruster, using his considerable expertise, confirmed something I’d recently told you. Specifically, I told you I’m no Shakespeare expert. That now-confirmed assertion came as I wrote about my recent viewing of a play at the University of Texas’ Shakespeare at Winedale program near Round Top.
Bruster confirmed that I’m no Shakespeare scholar by noting I screwed up several things in the column. First, let’s check Bruster’s bona fides to see if he indeed can claim to know more about Shakespeare than I do. (And let’s stipulate there could be single-cell organisms that know more about Shakespeare than I do.)
Bruster is a distinguished teaching professor at the University of Texas. He’s also the post-baccalaureate programs coordinator and the Mody C. Boatright Regents professor in American and English literature. That last part seems redundant to me because, unless I’m mistaken, a whole bunch of American literature is in English.
So Bruster holds a distinguished chair at UT. Impressive. Me? I hold a swivel chair here at the local daily newspaper. Comfy.
Bruster has a Ph.D. from Harvard University. Bruster’s UT bio page includes among his interests Shakespeare, drama, Renaissance literature and theory. “His discoveries have been featured in such venues as The New York Times and National Public Radio,” the bio says.
I also attended college and have interests. I have read The New York Times and listened to NPR.
And Bruster knows the Bard of Avon, perhaps on a personal basis, maybe having even bought cosmetic products from him: “His books on Shakespeare and early modern drama include ‘Drama and the Market in the Age of Shakespeare,’ ‘Quoting Shakespeare,’ ‘Shakespeare and the Question of Culture,’ ‘Prologues to Shakespeare’s Theatre,’ ‘To Be or Not To Be’ and ‘Shakespeare and the Power of Performance.’”
Me? I recently entertained a 6-year-old in a swimming pool by referring to her inflatable floaty as “tubey or not tubey.” (Yes, 5- to 7-year-olds are my humor demographic sweet spot. Did you hear the pony was sick? He was a little hoarse.)
So, if the court of public opinion pleases, I think we’ve established that Bruster is qualified to confirm my affirmation that I’m pretty much Shakespeare ignorant.
“Glad you liked the Winedale experience,” Bruster wrote to me, “absent the cherry pie.”
That last bit referred to the part of the column about how the cherry pie my group ordered at Royers Café in Round Top could not be delivered because former Texas governor and current U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry had left with the last of the cherry pie.
But pie was not why Bruster contacted me. “Just a couple of typos,” he wrote, prior to listing four.
• First, he wanted me to know that what I called Cliffs Notes now has gone spaceless and calls itself CliffsNotes. OK, got it.
• Second, it’s “Macbeth” not “MacBeth,” as I wrote. “Please no capital B, ever,” he helpfully informed me, answering the question “To B or not to B?”
• The next correction came in my quoting of the second witch in Macbeth as saying, “Something evil this way comes.” Bruster: “I think the second witch says, ‘By the pricking of my thumbs/Something wicked this way comes.” He’s correct, and we’re about to find out if I can say pricking in the newspaper.
• The fourth correction: “In the ‘Hamlet” quotation, please add the ‘er’ to ‘o’erwhelm.” Will do. Here it is in its correct form: “Foul deeds will rise, though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.”
Bruster, as a good prof does so as to not shatter the delicate ego of a student, ended with a positive note: “You got Juliet exactly right.”
As Shakespeare said, “Well, shiver me timbers.”
I appreciate the input and take solace in an expert’s confirmation that, as I told you, I’m not a Shakespearean scholar.
Mody C. Boatright would be proud. He was a renowned Texas folklorist who died in 1970 and is not to be confused with his son the late Mody K. Boatright who was married to Frances Ann Naismith, whose grandfather, James A. Naismith, invented basketball.
Now we’re talking about something I know something about, as opposed to my Shakespearean comedy of errors.

For 8chan's owner, it's the wrong kind of ink

Texto completo: The House Committee on Homeland Security wants to have words with the elusive owner of 8chan - the infamous, anything-goes Internet forum favored by white supremacists and mass shooting suspects. Jim Watkins appears to have accepted the invitation, eager to defend his website as the world's last bastion of unregulated speech. "I am on my way back to America as we speak," he wrote to Congress from 8chan's base in the Philippines on Wednesday. "Rest assured I am not an extremist."
This raises the question of who Watkins is, then. If you were expecting to see members of Congress interrogate a man in a hooded robe or some hacker kid in a Guy Fawkes mask, let us clear up the misconception and introduce you to this 50-something American expat - a total fountain pen freak.
"Every day's a great day when you have a new Marlen pen!" Watkins said in an unboxing video on his YouTube channel in late March, two weeks after a gunman massacred 51 people at a mosque in New Zealand and a 74-page missive on 8chan was linked to the suspect.
In May, about a week after police linked a fatal shooting at a California synagogue to another declaration on 8chan, Watkins showed off Marlen's Ulysses model, which he was dismayed to discover leaked ink.
The 13-part fountain pen series culminated in a July shootout between a Jinhao Flower and an Ohto Dude, which easily won for its ultrasmooth nib. A week later, 22 people died in a shooting at an El Paso Walmart and 8chan users, predictably, celebrated the anti-Hispanic missive that authorities link to the alleged shooter. 8chan's Web security provider subsequently cut ties with the site, forcing it offline and prompting Watkins to record a rare video that was not about pens.
"8chan is an empty piece of paper for writing on. It is disturbing for me that it can be so easily shut down," he said, backdropped by the enlarged head of Benjamin Franklin while a bugle played "Taps," lending the production a sort of 1990s cable-access flavor. "Ours is one of the last independent companies that offers a place where you can write down your thoughts, free from having to worry about whether they are offensive to one group or another."
The shootings were tragedies, Watkins said. He always cooperated with law enforcement when an 8chan user did something illegal, he said. But he rejected demands that he permanently shut down the forum, which he has bankrolled almost since its inception, keeping it afloat after its founder abandoned it in disgust.
The founder is Fredrick Brennan, a 25-year-old Brooklynite who matches 8chan's likely demographic more closely than a pen connoisseur with a wife and son in Manila. Brennan created the site in 2013, naming it after another anonymous "imageboard" forum called 4chan, which had too many rules for Brennan's liking.
"Imageboards are a haven for all of the terrible things you listed. That's exactly what makes them such wonderful places," Brennan told Know Your Meme in 2014, after 8chan had become an organizational hub for the Gamergate movement, which harassed female journalists in the name of more objective video-game reviews.
8chan's users created subforums dedicated to anarchy, white nationalism, suicide and swimsuit photos of girls in their early teens. More than a few of these had titles that were variations on the n-word, and one was a crass reference to the gassing of Jews.
By then the site had accumulated more than 8 million posts (it had more than 88 million as of this week), and Brennan was having trouble affording servers and bandwidth to host all that free speech.
The imageboard's notoriety was already warding off mainstream Internet companies, and it kept crashing under its traffic load or disputes with its bandwidth provider. 8chan's Web registrar took it offline temporarily in early 2015, citing "child abuse" after receiving complaints about its pedophilia forums. But Brennan had good news at 8chan's first birthday party, held at a strip club in Queens: He was moving to the Philippines to join his new business partner, an unlikely savior named Jim Watkins.
Watkins had learned of Brennan's plight through his son and offered to help, he told Splinter in 2016. The article didn't explain how Watkins could afford to host 8chan - or why he would want to - but he already had on his résumé a collection of small, oddball businesses rooted at the intersection of technology, free speech and smut.
The first of these was a website called Asian Bikini Bar, which Watkins claims was one of the biggest porn-streaming sites in the world during its heyday in the 1990s, when porn-streaming sites were few and far between. Built while Watkins was working a day job for the U.S. Army, Splinter reported, the site catered to people in Japan, where censorship laws prevented people from hosting their own bikini bars.
Asian Bikini Bar has vanished from the Internet. In its place, Watkins and his company N.T. Technology host or are otherwise associated with a handful of ventures, including a conspiratorial website called the Goldwater, and Books.audio, which claims Watkins as a narrator and benefactor but denies any corporate affiliation with him. Anyway, if you run out of pen reviews on Watkins's YouTube channel, he has several dozen videos of himself reading books such as Ayn Rand's "Anthem" and L. Frank Baum's "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."
This ramshackle biography of computer stuff and porn stuff and censorship stuff and whatever else Watkins had been doing in the Philippines since he moved there in the mid-2000s helped convinced Brennan to entrust him with 8chan. He assured 8chan's users that "Jim was completely trustworthy" in a 2015 video, after Watkins had effectively taken over the website.
Watkins sat beside him in what looked like a Philippines living room, smoking a cigarette and wearing camo beach shorts that clashed dizzyingly with his tiger-pattern T-shirt. "Basically his life is a real-life Minecraft," Brennan told the camera. "He goes out in the jungle and cuts down trees and builds some shacks."
No shack-building is evident on Watkins's YouTube channel, though he has posted copious footage of himself raising pigs and black soldier fly maggots - and doing yoga on a beach in western Luzon.
Learning more about his life overseas has proved difficult. When a reporter with Japan's Kyodo News tracked him down in Manila in 2012, Watkins demanded: "How dare you barge into my office like a gangster?" In May, 8chan's Twitter account claimed a Vice News crew had "just broke and entered into Jim's bedroom" - although the accompanying pictures and emails showed them standing outside on a walkway after trying to negotiate an interview. When The Washington Post contacted Watkins after the El Paso declaration turned up on 8chan, he replied, in toto, "I hope you are well."
He has probably been better, himself. Brennan had a change of heart some time after moving to the Philippines and severed his ties to 8chan. He still lives near Watkins in Manila, he told the New York Times this week, but is trying to convince him to shut the site down. "A full 24 hours after the shootings [8chan] still had on the front page the words 'Embrace Infamy,' " Brennan told CNN. "It's kind of like they're laughing about this."
The world might beat him to it. 8chan has been offline since shortly after the El Paso attack, when its Web security company abandoned it and hackers promptly crashed it. Watkins has promised to bring it back online, but has had little success finding a new security provider, with his site a pariah in international news.
It's in these circumstance that he is apparently traveling back to his native United States, toward a possible confrontation with Congress over the boundaries of freedom and hate. So get your pen ready.

First-ever musically complete cast recording of ‘Fiddler’ is released

Texto completo: For the first time in its 55-year history, a musically complete cast recording of “Fiddler on the Roof” was released Friday.
The collection includes 11 songs in English that were cut from the original Broadway production in 1964. It is available for streaming and download via Time Life.
The collection is also notable for its use of Yiddish lyrics, the authentic language of the play’s shtetl, or village.
Featuring the 2018 cast of the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene’s groundbreaking production, “Fiddler on the Roof in Yiddish: The 2018 Cast Recording” also includes new recordings of songs from the show that never made it into the 1964 Broadway production, sung by theatrical legends including original “Fiddler” lyricist Sheldon Harnick. All the bonus tracks are in English.
Since its debut in July 2018, “Fiddler on the Roof in Yiddish” has won the 2019 Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Musical Revival; the Drama Desk Award for Best Musical Revival; a New York Drama Critics' Circle Award Special Citation; and star Steven Skybell was the winner of the 2019 Lucille Lortel Award for Best Lead Actor.
“I am thrilled that this new production is now memorialized in this wonderful recording,” said Joel Grey, who directs the current stage production. “When Zalmen Mlotek (NYTF Artistic Director) approached me, with my dear friend Hal Prince’s ringing endorsement, with the suggestion that I should direct NYTF’s Yiddish version of ‘Fiddler,’ I was intrigued by the prospect of taking on a quintessential work of the American Broadway stage translated into its underlying language - the true language of Anatevka.”
Grey not only agreed to direct the production, he also sings “When Messiah Comes” on the new cast album.
The album was produced by seven-time Grammy and Tony nominee Robert Sher (“Gypsy,” “Annie,” “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” “Fela!,” “Ain’t Misbehavin’ ”).
“This is the first time that a ‘Fiddler’ cast album is musically complete,” explains Sher. “All of the dance music, entrance, exit and scene change music is in here. It’s never been done before in the show’s 55-year history and we really wanted to give the listener a full experience.”
Don Walker and Larry Blank provide orchestrations for the cast recording (and the stage production), which includes performances by the NYTF cast as well as 11 bonus tracks in English sung by Sharon Azrieli, Donna McKechnie, Nancy Opel, Alysha Umphress, Mimi Besette, Lauren Molina, Richard Kind, Rosalind Harris, Alexandra Silber, Neva Small, Tam Mutu, Tom Wopat, Sheldon Harnick, Matthew Sklar, Joel Grey, Austin Pendleton, Joanna Merlin, Hal Linden and Shaina Taub, in order of appearance.
Particularly notable are two cast members from the 1971 film adaptation: Rosalind Harris (Tzeitel) and Neva Small (Chava), two who appeared in the original Broadway cast in 1964: Joanna Merlin, Austin Pendleton and “Fiddler” lyricist Sheldon Harnick. The new album gives them the opportunity to finally release these songs that were written for, but not included in, the original Broadway production.
“Fiddler on the Roof” first opened on Broadway on Sept. 22, 1964, a musical that took audiences inside a Russian shtetl in 1905 during a period of great violence, oppression and expulsion. The play won nine Tony Awards during its eight-year run and has returned to Broadway five times since.
In July 2018, the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene mounted the Yiddish production of “Fiddler” in New York City, accompanied by English and Russian subtitles. It has been extended multiple times and will run until at least Jan. 5, 2020.
The new production “…offers a kind of authenticity no other American ‘Fiddler’ ever has…the language of Tevye and his neighbors would have spoken in Anatevka,” the New York Times reported.

Texto completo: 'My Iran: Six Women Photographers' The Iranian photographer Newsha Tavakolian has recently been barred by Iranian authorities from working in her home country - along with her husband, New York Times correspondent Thomas Erdbrink - according to the Times. Tavakolian, an acclaimed artist who began as a photojournalist, and who has work in several major museum collections, is one of six artists showcased in a new group show at the Smithsonian's Sackler Gallery, along with Gohar Dashti, Shadi Ghadirian, Hengameh Golestan, Malekeh Nayiny and Mitra Tabrizian. (You may remember Tavakolian's work from the 2016 show, "She Who Tells a Story," at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, which also featured images by Dashti and Ghadirian.) From the political to the personal, the artists in "My Iran" look at the struggles of life inside their home country and in its diaspora.
When: Saturday through Feb. 9, 2020.
Where: Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, 1050 Independence Ave. SW. freersackler.si.edu.
Admission: Free.
African Diaspora International Film Festival For 13 years, the African Diaspora International Film Festival has treated audiences to invaluable new releases and repertory films that capture the vast cultural reach of work by and about people of African descent. This year, ADIFF returns to Washington with a lineup that includes films from Djibouti, Brazil, Barbados, Panama, France, Guadeloupe, Cuba, Morocco and the United States. The festival's opening night film, "Ali's Comeback: The Untold Story," chronicles how the unlikely team of a white businessman, an African American senator and a Jewish mayor helped Muhammad Ali reclaim his career after being marginalized for resisting the Vietnam draft. Fifteen more narrative features and documentaries will play throughout the weekend.
When: Through Sunday.
Where: George Washington University's Marvin Center, 800 21st St. NW. nyadiff.org/dc-2019.
Tickets: $13; $11 for students; $10 for groups of 10 or more. Day passes $40-$50; festival pass $120.
County fair season Summertime brings almost all the county fair kitsch your heart could desire. Start the season in Prince William County with Virginia's largest fair (Aug. 9-17), where the sprawling list of activities for all ages includes ranch camel and pony rides, a petting zoo and a circus. Be sure to catch the more destructive standards, such as chain-saw art, monster trucks and a demolition derby. For those same nine days, Maryland's Montgomery County hosts its own fair, which features a similar slate of vehicles flinging themselves at each other, but ramps up the action to include ATV and truck drag racing. Don't miss the Chesapeake DockDogs from Aug. 9-11, which showcases pups competing with each other in big air and speed retrieval competitions. If auto mayhem isn't your speed, set your sights on the Arlington County fair (Aug. 14-18), a more charming affair that draws massive crowds every year. There will be carnival games and fried food galore. And while a full schedule of programming will be announced closer to the day, one of this year's marquee events will be the addition of goat yoga.
When: Through Aug. 18.
Where: Locations vary.
Tickets: Prices vary by fair.
Summer Restaurant Week Combat the summer doldrums with a three-course meal out during the summer edition of Restaurant Week, a semiannual tradition during which diners can score deals at restaurants in D.C., Maryland and Northern Virginia. This time around, more than 200 restaurants will offer prix fixe menus for lunch, brunch and dinner. If you're indecisive about which array of small plates to choose from the regular menu at such hot spots as chef Erik Bruner-Yang's standing-room-only Spoken English at the Line Hotel, let the streamlined Restaurant Week menu make the choice for you. Or try out a very pricey spot like Nobu D.C. without busting your dining budget.
When: Monday through Aug. 18.
Where: Locations vary. Check ramw.org/restaurantweek for a full list of participating restaurants.
Price: $35 for dinner; $22 for lunch or brunch.
3 Stars seventh anniversary party The team at D.C.'s second-oldest production brewery knows how to brew hazy IPAs and bright, tart sour ales. They also know how to party. 3 Stars's seventh anniversary bash, which fills the brewery's taproom, brewhouse and expanded space next door, includes the unveiling of new collaborations with Virginia's Ocelot and Maryland's Burnish and RAR, and access to a wide variety of easy-drinking IPAs, barrel-aged stouts and tropical fruited sours. DJs and live bands provide the entertainment, and food trucks are on hand if hunger strikes. All tickets include a souvenir glass and one beer; VIP tickets add exclusive samplings.
When: Sunday from 1 to 6 p.m.
Where: 3 Stars Brewing, 6400 Chillum Pl. NW. 3starsbrewing.com.
Tickets: $15-$50.

Texto completo: For some of my Talking SCHOP! longtime readers, you might remember a period when I was on an eating program called The Plan from New York Times best-selling author and former Harlem resident, Lyn-Genet Recitas. The core exercise of The Plan is to eliminate and manage foods causing inflammation in the body, effecting overall health and wellness.
While on The Plan I lost 20 pounds by first cleansing my body of all things I love-animal protein, dairy, salt, sugar, alcohol, carbohydrates. After the cleanse I slowly (very slowly) integrated these items back into my diet in a controlled testing way evaluating their effect on my body through daily weight gain. "Safe" foods, I saw little to no weight gain. "Non-safe" foods caused weight gain (inflammation) from .02-2+ pounds for which 1 would return to the cleanse until my weight normalized.
The Plan was effective for many people, but like anything worth doing well, it took a lot of time, attention and commitment. Being in food, cooking, writing and events, it became too much for me to manage, but it gave me the tools to learn the foods, food combinations and a cleanse routine for which to follow. Thank you, Lyn-Genet!
If I have piqued your interest in The Plan, awesome! If I then dissuaded you with my "life in food" backpeddling, have I got great news for you. Lyn-Genet has opened her first restaurant in Hamilton Heights called Lyn-Genet's Kitchen (3473 Broadway, 646.590.0554, lyngenetskitchen.com).
All of the work original Plan users had to do, like preparing the cleanse or determining what clean and "safe" foods to eat, are taken care of in a country cabin space with a full bar and wine menu curated by Lyn-Genet, a former sommelier. There is a little something for every omnivore, vegetarian and vegan alike.
A couple of friends and I went to the soft opening a couple of months back to see the new space and of course try the food. We began with some appetizers of potato bacon cheddar croquettes, avocado fries and my favorite of the whole meal, warm kale salad with goat cheese, dried cranberries and pepitas. For our entrees we shared the branzino with vegetables and the lamb burger and finished with some Plan-friendly desserts.
There were some cookery issues I brought to Lyn-Genet's attention, as any customer who wants to see a restaurant win should do. However, there is a large opportunity for the food to evolve and develop as Lyn continues to get feedback from customers and The Plan clients alike.
Continued success LynGenet! Cin cin!
Happy eating and thanks for reading!

Jordan on debt: ‘We’re running out of time’

Texto completo: LIMA - As the national debt nears $22.5 trillion, Rep. Jim Jordan’s position on rising deficits is clear.
“We’re running out of time,” Jordan said during an interview with The Lima News. Jordan, Ohio’s 4th Congressional District’s Republican representative, visited the area Wednesday as part of a tour of the region undertaken during the House of Representatives’ six-week-long August recess.
“The revenues are up, and we should be scaling back some spending. You don’t have to take the spending curve from this to that or to even that. You have to take it from here to here,” Jordan said while demonstrating different trend lines with his hand. “Bend the direction that it’s going and show over time that you’re making some progress. Particularly if you got your economy growing at an even higher rate, you can make it work.”
But Jordan said before the national debt can be reduced, Republicans need to retake the House, and President Donald Trump needs to remain in office.
“(The debt) is the one thing that we haven’t really got a handle on. But the president has indicated that he wants to in his second term, which I think he gets. I really do,” Jordan said.
In Trump’s first two years of his term while Republicans still controlled the House, the national debt grew by $2.5 trillion while the country experienced an economic upswing. The latest 2020 budget estimates put Trump’s first term addition to the national debt at $5 trillion - an total increase comparable to President Barack Obama’s first term.
The national debt, however, was just one topic among many broached by Ohio’s 4th Congressional District representative. The immigration issue and civility in politics both took spots in the conversation.
Immigration
Like other members of Congress, Jordan recently visited the southern border near McAllen, Texas, to tour government facilities holding immigration detainees and talk with customs officials about the steps needed to address the strain caused by an increased number of Central American families seeking asylum.
Jordan’s solution focused on three initiatives - increasing the length of time children and, therefore, families can be detained by reversing the Flores decision, increasing the number of judges to push cases along faster and building a wall on the southern border.
But doing one without the other will not solve the problem, Jordan said. All three are needed.
Jordan also called out Democratic House members for their unwillingness to solve the problem or approve the funds headed toward the border.
“Everyone knows what to do. It’s common sense, but Democrats won’t do it because they hate the president,” Jordan said.
Earlier this summer, the White House had asked Congress for $4.5 billion to be able to send more resources to the border, but the emergency aid bill found Democratic resistance due to a line-item that would expand ICE’s ability to hold more detainees. The bill was eventually passed and signed by Trump on July 1.
But while much of the national discussion on immigration has been the living conditions of the families seeking asylum, Jordan said a change in immigration laws, especially the Flores decision, should help reduce future strain on the system.
“If they know they’re not being let in and let go, and that there’s going to be a real adjudication, then it’s going to reduce the incentive to come,” Jordan said. “I think it’s all driven by the fact that they know, right now, that the law just allows it.”
Civility in politics
Jordan’s comments on civility in politics began with questions about his response to Gov. Mike DeWine’s initiative to pass red-flag gun laws in Ohio.
“I don’t think it’s helpful to the political debate when you say some of the things that are being said, frankly particularly by the left, about the president and the idea that the left says the president is responsible for what happened last weekend,” Jordan said referencing the recent mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso. “That’s just ridiculous. The people that are responsible are the people that do the terrible things.”
Instead, Jordan called for political actors to stop attacking individuals and return to debates over policy. A good example, Jordan said, is the type of discussions he has had in the past with Dennis Kucinich.
“Let’s have a debate. Dennis and I can have a debate. That’s fine. It should be robust. It should be intense, but I never question Dennis’s motives. He believes the things he believes. I believe in mine, and we’re going to fight for our positions. That’s how it’s supposed to work,” Jordan said. “Unfortunately, it’s just getting way too much going after people.”
Jordan, who often paints the left’s positions as radical, said personal attacks are changing the dynamic of politics.
“To say your opponent is a racist, which is what they’re saying about the president, which is absolutely not true … that’s the distinction. The intense debate is exactly how it’s supposed to work in American politics, but it should be focused on policy,” Jordan said. “That to me is the key distinction, and what I try to follow.”
When asked whether he thinks Republicans are blameless for the current political climate, Jordan pointed to Trump’s condemnation of white supremacy this past Monday.
“Our side has condemned any type of racially motivated policy. The president did in his remarks and appropriately so. The president did a good job Monday condemning. I’d like to see the same thing from the left,” Jordan said. “I’d like to see the left condemn Antifa and the violence they promote. That’s how it should be.”
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi condemned Antifa in August 2017 after violence led to arrests of demonstrators in the Bay area.
By the New York Times’ count, Trump has criticized 598 people, places and things on Twitter since announcing his candidacy. Among the list include Ohio gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray, who Trump called a “big failure” and “clone of Pocahontas” (the president’s nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren), past Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who was labeled a “dummy,” “pathetic,” and “total failure” by the president, and most recently Sen. Sherrod Brown, who Trump called a “failed presidential candidate” despite never deciding to run for president.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday that he is likely to commute former Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s sentence.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as they flew back to Washington from El Paso, Texas, the president hinted he was open to giving Blagojevich, 62, a break, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
Blagojevich has served about half of a 14-year federal prison sentence for corruption that included seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to become president.
"In the last hour of the flight, POTUS came back to the press cabin for a 45-minute off-the-record conversation. He then said the press could put one part on the record — that he is again considering commuting the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich," the pool report said.
"I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly; he was given close to 18 years in prison. And a lot of people thought it was unfair, like a lot of other things — and it was the same gang, the Comey gang and all these sleazebags that did it. And his name is Rod Blagojevich," the president said, misstating Blagojevich’s sentence.
"He’s been in jail for seven years over a phone call where nothing happens — over a phone call which he shouldn’t have said what he said, but it was braggadocio you would say. I would think that there have been many politicians — I’m not one of them, by the way — that have said a lot worse over the telephone."
The New York Times’ Maggic Haberman tweeted that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had pushed for a pardon, but aides instead persuaded Trump to agree to commutation.
In June 2018, Trump broached the possibility of freeing Blagojevich, suggesting the one-time "Celebrity Apprentice" contestant was convicted for "being stupid."
Wife Patti Blagojevich has waged a focused campaign — primarily in FOX News appearances and through social media — to appeal to Trump for clemency, the Sun-Times reported.
"His wife I think is fantastic, and I’m thinking about commuting his sentence very strongly. I think it’s enough, seven years," Trump said.
Contacted by a Sun-Times reporter late Wednesday, Patti Blagojevich was surprised to hear of the president’s comments but declined to comment.
The pool report did not mention why Trump wanted to discuss Blagojevich.
Blagojevich is scheduled to be released on May 23, 2024. He currently is serving his sentence in an Englewood, Colorado, facility.
In 2018, Trump first dangled the potential of helping Blagojevich. That prompted seven Republican House members from Illinois to urge the president not to commute the sentence after Trump raised the possibility of a clemency for the man he got to know on "The Celebrity Apprentice" in 2010.
Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill., organized the letter, which asked Trump, to "give thoughtful attention to our fear that granting clemency for the former governor would set a detrimental precedent and send a damaging message on your efforts to root out public corruption in our government."
In addition to trying to sell Obama’s Senate seat, Blagojevich was convicted of attempting to, among other counts, trying to shake down the CEO of Children’s Memorial Hospital for $25,000 in campaign contributions and threatening to hold up a bill to benefit the racetrack industry for $100,000 in campaign contributions.
The CEO of what was then called Edward Hospital in Naperville, Pam Davis, is credited with helping blow the whistle on Blagojevich. She wore a wire to record conversations with Blagojevich cronies trying to shake her organization down as the hospital tried for years to build a second hospital in Plainfield but was denied repeatedly from the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board.

Texto completo: A man who grew up in North Jersey plans to file a lawsuit alleging that he was sexually abused as a child by former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, his attorney announced Wednesday during a press conference.
Mitchell Garabedian, the attorney, also released the names of 28 New Jersey priests who allegedly abused 30 of his clients who are seeking settlements through a victim's compensation fund set up by the state's five Catholic dioceses.
The New Jersey Independent Victim Compensation Program began accepting applications in June and offers a way for victims of clergy abuse to settle their cases without going to court. As of Aug. 5, more than 50 victims filed claims and seven received cash settlements. The process calls for the victims to file claims with independent mediators who evaluate the supporting documentation and, once they establish an accusation's credibility, offer a monetary award.
Twelve of the priests on the list have never been publicly named before, Garabedian said during the press conference, which was held in West Orange.
The attorney said that if the victims aren't satisfied with the settlements offered by the church, they could file lawsuits in December when a new state law opens a two-year window for such cases to be filed.
Garabedian said that the abuse occurred between 1946 and 1982, when the victims were children.
One victim, James Grein, who grew up in Bergen County, plans to file a lawsuit rather than go through the compensation fund, said the attorney, who declined to reveal where the lawsuit would be filed.
Grein, now 61 and living in Virginia, told the New York Times last year that McCarrick was a close family friend he knew as "Uncle Ted." The report said that in 1958, shortly after McCarrick was ordained as a priest, he baptized Grein at Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Tenafly.
An attorney who previously represented Grein told NorthJersey.com that some of the abuse took place at his client's home in Tenafly.
The 88-year-old Cardinal was removed from the priesthood earlier this year after the Vatican found him guilty of sexually abusing children and adults.
Robert Hoatson of West Orange, a victim's advocate and former priest, announced at the press conference that he was among the 30 people being represented by Garabedian, and that he had been sexually abused as a child by one of the 12 priests on the list who had not been previously identified. Hoatson said he also had been abused by others.
"There's not a day in my life that I've had a peaceful day since I was a child," he said. "It has taken me years to overcome some of the abuse."
He founded the organization Road to Recovery, in part, to help himself heal while advocating for other victims of sexual abuse.
Among the priests named was Ronald Tully, who recently died and has now been accused of abuse by at least 10 people. The priest served decades ago at the now-defunct Pope Pius XXII High School in Passaic and was the pastor of Sacred Heart Parish in Dover in 2004 when two victims came forward and church officials removed him from ministry.
The Paterson Diocese has paid an estimated $2.1 million to settle claims by nine of Tully's accusers, including one woman, over the years. The latest accuser alleges Tully abused him from 1974 to 1975, according to Garabedian.
Tully had been arrested on Long Island in the late 1970s after two Pope Pius students alleged that he abused them at a vacation home. The students and their families were told by church officials that Tully would never again work with children. They said they were surprised to learn decades later that he was promoted to monsignor.
Also on Garabedian's list was Gerard Sudol, who was removed from ministry last year. The priest had been cleared of an allegation of abuse years before, but was removed from Our Lady of Czestochowa Catholic Church in Jersey City after a new accuser came forward.
The Archdiocese of Newark issued a statement Wednesday asserting that it "is committed to the ongoing support and healing of victims and the acknowledgement of those accused of the sexual abuse of minors. We continue to focus on transparency and accountability and to reinforcing established reporting and prevention policies and programs to protect minors and support victims in our parishes, schools and ministries."
The statement, issued by email, also noted that its compensation fund provides "eligible victims who were sexually abused by clergy of New Jersey Roman Catholic dioceses an efficient alternative to litigation that is both speedy and transparent."
The statement vowed that the Archdiocese will continue to cooperate with the New Jersey Attorney General's Clergy Abuse Task Force and local law enforcement officials on investigations. "In line with the Memorandum of Understanding established in 2002 with state and local law enforcement agencies, any new allegations of abuse involving minors, whether by a member of the clergy or a lay employee or volunteer, are immediately reported to law enforcement, and if found credible, the individual is permanently removed from any capacity in the Archdiocese."
Earlier this year, New Jersey's Roman Catholic dioceses released the names of 188 priests and deacons who church officials found to be credibly accused of sexually abusing children over a period of decades. Much of the abuse took place years ago and most of the perpetrators on the list have died.
But Garabedian and other advocates of clergy abuse victims assert that the lists released by the New Jersey dioceses are incomplete. "How can you trust them to put out a reliable list?" Garabedian said. "Their criteria is too biased. As we speak today, they have no safeguards in place to protect children. The church will do the bare minimum so they won't be prosecuted."
Garabedian was portrayed by actor Stanley Tucci in the 2016 film "Spotlight," which depicted the unraveling of the priest abuse scandal in Boston in the early 2000s.
New Jersey has recently extended the statute of limitations which opens the window beginning in December for survivors of sexual abuse to take legal action against their abusers and the institutions that may have protected their perpetrator, whenever the abuse occurred.
Garabedian stressed that if his clients do not find validation through the compensation program, they will likely take action through a lawsuit.
A lawsuit provides complete transparency, including various documents, and "secret files that show who knew what and when," he said.
The church leaders who knew what was happening and allowed it to continue were complicit in the abuse of children, Garabedian said. "Where were the supervisors?"

Tech Meets Health Care, Sometimes Shakily

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Katie Thomas, who covers health and is based in Chicago, discussed the tech she's using.
As a health care reporter, what are your most important tech tools for doing your work?
I mostly work from home near Chicago, and I do a lot of interviews by phone. I've recently started taping more of my calls (with permission) because a handful of online transcription services have become fast and relatively cheap.
To record the calls, I use the Olympus TP-8 Telephone Pick-Up Microphone. The microphone plugs into my Sony digital recorder, which is not flashy but gets the job done. I've tried a handful of apps that promise to record calls from my iPhone, but I've found them unwieldy and unreliable, sometimes dropping calls unexpectedly, which is a reporter's worst nightmare on deadline.
Trint, which is $ 15 an hour, can transcribe an interview within minutes because it is done by machine. The transcript is sometimes rough, but it's synced to the audio in an easy-to-use interface, so it's great on deadline, when I can search for keywords and check the audio for accuracy. For longer projects, I use Rev, which uses human transcribers and is more accurate. Rev is $ 1 a minute and returns transcripts within 24 hours, although it frequently delivers faster than that.
I often collaborate with other reporters who are thousands of miles away. To do this, Google Docs is invaluable -- we can write stories together in real time, analyze data using Google Sheets and upload documents into a shared drive. Like many reporters, I also communicate securely with sources with tools like Protonmail or the Signal messaging app.
For health care stories, a few websites are essential. The federal government's Open Payments site tracks what drug and medical device companies pay to doctors. Users can look up an individual doctor or company on the website directly, or download data sets for a deeper dive. The investigative nonprofit ProPublica also maintains several health care databases, such as Prescriber Checkup, which uses Medicare data to show how doctors are prescribing certain drugs. The website Sqoop allows me to track developments in federal court cases.
I use LinkedIn to find current and former employees of the companies I'm writing about, and Facebook and Instagram are helpful to see how health companies are promoting their products, sometimes in questionable ways. I take screenshots when I'm worried a company will change its site or remove social posts after I begin asking questions. For that, I use Fireshot, or I archive the page with the Wayback Machine.
How has technology upended health care?
The tech industry is intensely interested in breaking into health care, but several high-profile attempts to disrupt this highly regulated industry have stumbled. (See: Theranos.)
One hot area is online prescribing. Platforms like Hims and Roman are using telemedicine to sell everything from erectile dysfunction treatments to drugs for performance anxiety. But while some users have praised the sites for their convenience, they have raised questions about whether they are running afoul of federal and state laws that regulate the marketing, prescribing and distribution of prescription drugs. And while ads for the sites may be ubiquitous, the vast majority of Americans still get their prescriptions the old-fashioned way -- from a face-to-face doctor who sends the prescription to a pharmacy.
As someone with a deeper understanding of health insurance, have you come up with a tech setup to make your health care less frustrating?
My family and I are healthy, and thankfully our health insurance is pretty simple.
But here's one thing I do: Whenever we are prescribed a drug, especially a generic, I check the cost of the drug on a site called GoodRx before I fill the prescription using my insurance. That's because, as I've written with Charles Ornstein of ProPublica, it's sometimes cheaper to pay cash for drugs than to use insurance. GoodRx shows the cash price of drugs at nearby pharmacies.
Sometimes that's easier said than done: When my daughter was 2, she needed drops for an ear infection. She was so cranky while we waited in line that I didn't check to see if using my insurance was the best deal. I later learned I would have saved money if I had paid cash.
Amazon is getting into the drug business with its acquisition of Pillpack. Is this a game changer?
Amazon has upended everything from books to groceries, the thinking goes, so why not prescription drugs? The health care industry has worried for years about whether the retail behemoth was coming for it, and those fears appeared to have been confirmed last summer when Amazon acquired the online pharmacy site.
Pillpack is still a relatively small player in the pharmacy world. It offers free shipping for medications -- users are responsible only for their co-payments or other out-of-pocket costs. To expand significantly, it will have to work with entrenched players, like pharmacy-benefit managers, which operate their own mail-order pharmacies and may not be motivated to assist a newcomer like Amazon.
One year after the acquisition, Amazon's plans for Pillpack are still unclear, and the company has said little, though it has been promoting the service on its home page.
Outside of work, what tech product are you obsessed with?
An app, iNaturalist, makes me giddy nearly every time I use it.
Using the camera on my phone, the app snaps a picture of any living thing -- trees, flowers, bugs, fungus, birds, mammals -- and then scans its database to provide educated guesses about which species I've seen. I decide which species I think it is (there is a handy summary and distribution map to help), then I share the post with a worldwide community of naturalists. Once others have confirmed my identification, the sighting is considered "research grade" and is used by scientists around the world to better understand our natural environment.
The app turns nature walks -- or just a trip to the playground -- into a treasure hunt for my kids and me, and it's cool to think that we're helping the broader scientific community. Thanks to the iNaturalist app, I know that a house finch recently visited me while I was working on my roof deck, and that we spotted a family of sandhill cranes on a camping trip to northern Illinois.
My favorite household tech product is an Ecovacs Deebot robotic vacuum. I named him Fred. I know he's just a robot, but I've become quite fond of my new co-worker: Fred whirs efficiently around our house, sucking up Cheerios and toast crumbs, while I pound out a story on deadline.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

'I almost got a good headline': Trump weighs in on New York Times headline change about him

Texto completo: President Trump weighed in on the New York Times' decision to change a headline about his response to the two mass shootings that occurred over the weekend.
The Times original headline read, “TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM," but it was widely criticized. Multiple 2020 presidential candidates expressed their outrage at the headline because they felt it did not address the president's own culpability. The article focused on Trump's Monday morning speech where he addressed the shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio that left over 30 people dead.
Following the outcry of condemnation, the Times then changed the headline to '“ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS.”
Trump referenced the change on social media Wednesday morning by quoting former Clinton adviser Mark Penn who appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight the night before.Tweet"'Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism,' was the correct description in the first headline by the Failing New York Times, but it was quickly changed to, 'Assailing Hate But Not Guns,' after the Radical Left Democrats went absolutely CRAZY! Fake News - That’s what we’re up against...," the president's tweet read.
A subsequent tweet said, "..'This is an astounding development in journalism. I’ve never seen it happen before, I’ve just never seen anything like this! Is that journalism today? I don’t think so!' Mark Penn, Former Clinton Advisor. @TuckerCarlson After 3 years I almost got a good headline from the Times!"
The New York Times' executive editor Dean Baquet called it "a bad headline," and added that "I understand the concern people have. Headlines matter. But I hope they read the coverage, which I will argue was strong."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Last weekend's senseless carnage thrust the politics of gun control into the center of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, prompting numerous candidates to make or reiterate full-throated calls for sweeping gun reforms, like assault weapons buy-backs or national licensing systems.
Among the candidates who have yet to release a detailed gun safety policy is an unexpected name: Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Senator who has made ambitious and progressive policy proposals the bedrock of her presidential race. There are 29 policy accouncements listed on Warren's campaign website, but none of them specifically mention guns.
That is likely to change by this weekend, however: A campaign aide said she is set to release a new plan on guns prior to a forum organized by Everytown for Gun Safety and other groups in Iowa on Saturday. The plan will deal at least in part with enforcement, according to a person familiar with it, calling for strengthening the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms with more money and tougher regulations, and revoking licenses from gun dealers who violate rules.
Warren has consistently called for stronger gun safety measures in Congress, winning her high praise from gun safety groups. But the fact that she waited until the eighth month of her campaign to deliver a comprehensive policy on an issue at the heart of some of her opponents' platforms gives their allies an opening to suggest that she has a hard time getting out of her own policy wheelhouse.
“The senator does an extremely good job dealing with issues that fall within the realm of economics," said Bakari Sellers, a former state lawmaker in South Carolina who has endorsed California Senator Kamala Harris. “Some of the other issues . . . she struggles with."
Warren has already released an immigration plan, and in recent days she has strongly condemned white supremacy, domestic terrorism, and called President Trump a racist.
But she has a worldview that is at once sweeping and deeply focused, relating most of society's ills back to the issues of corruption, corporate greed, and economic inequality that animate her campaign. While critics like Sellers suggest her focus on her core themes is limiting, other Democrats see that focus as an asset for her campaign that helps her link different issues together.
“No matter the issue, it can connect back to an overall theme, which I think is powerful for voters," said Andrew Feldman, a progressive Democratic strategist in Washington.
This week, instead of immediately rolling out a new gun plan, she tied gun control directly to her concerns about the role of money in politics.
“The majority of Americans want to see us put sensible legislation in place to get the guns out of the hands of people who pose threats like this, and yet it doesn't happen and the reason for that is because the gun manufacturers own Washington," Warren said in an interview on MSNBC on Sunday, vowing to do “everything I can by by executive order," and calling to get rid of the filibuster so the Senate can pass new gun laws with a simple majority. Warren also urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to call the Senate in for a vote on background check bills passed by House Democrats.
Other candidates, meanwhile, have already made detailed, multi-part gun safety proposals a central tenet of their campaigns. In April, Harris released a plan to take four specific executive actions to increase background checks, take lawbreaking gun dealers to court, and more. The following month, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker rolled out a 14-point gun violence plan that is anchored by a federal licensing program for gun owners.
Following the shootings over the weekend, two other candidates — Washington Governor Jay Inslee and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — each rolled out new multi-step gun safety plans on Tuesday, both of which echoed Booker's call for nationwide gun licensing.
On Sunday, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders called for a ban on making, selling, and transferring assault weapons and a buyback program; the following day, in a CNN interview, former vice president Joe Biden endorsed a national buyback program, and his campaign is touting his efforts to pass the 1994 ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, which has since expired.
Gun safety advocates say the issue is likely to become central in both the primary and the general election, marking a significant shift from the 2008 and 2012 elections.
“What we're going to see in 2020 is a referendum on the future of firearms policy in America," said Peter Ambler, the executive director of the gun safety group Giffords. He said guns were also a galvanizing issue for Democratic voters in last year's midterm elections.
Warren is not the only top-tier candidate who has yet to lay out a comprehensive gun policy. Biden has not released one, either, although an aide said the campaign will do so in the future.
At times over the course of her campaign, Warren has sounded a cautious note on guns that is at odds with some of her more crusading liberal politics. During the first Democratic debate, she called for new research into gun violence, which has gotten little government funding in part because of an NRA-backed amendment from the 1990s that stymied gun research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In a video interview with the New York Times, she emphasized a cultural connection to guns drawn from her childhood in Oklahoma. “My family had guns when I was growing up. My brothers have guns," she said, adding, “We need to have better gun safety laws in place, serious laws."
Warren speaks more about the issue on the campaign trail if she is asked specifically about it by audience members, and often seeks to broaden the conversation beyond mass shootings to the pain of everyday gun violence — a point some gun control advocates appreciate.
“It's not just the mass shootings that make headlines, it's the children who are shot on our sidewalks, in our playgrounds and backyards, visiting a friend," Warren said in Lansing, Mich., recently.
“We know what we need to do," Warren said, calling for universal background checks, closing gun show loopholes, and to “take the weapons of war off our streets."

Texto completo: After each mass shooting in America, the nation relives a near-scripted clash: calls for stricter gun laws, pushback from pro-gun activists led by the National Rifle Association, and an ultimate impasse.
But this time — following seven days that left at least 35 people dead in shootings in Gilroy, Calif. , El Paso and Dayton, Ohio — one side of that power struggle appears to have shifted.
The NRA is busy managing another crisis: its own.
For months the organization has weathered a series of public spectacles stemming from both infighting and outside scrutiny. Most recently, in the middle of last week’s mass shootings, three members of the NRA board resigned, citing concerns over irresponsible spending by the organization’s leaders.
The NRA’s opponents see the chaos as a vulnerability, something not lost on supporters who have grown frustrated with the national organization.
“Those of us who are plugged into this, who are living it, are wondering why this is happening and why it seemingly isn't being fixed,” said Mark Walters, an NRA member and host of the syndicated Armed American Radio. “[Especially] at a time it is so important that we have a strong National Rifle Association coming into 2020, in particular on the heels of this mess with California, El Paso, and Dayton. ”
A spokesman for the NRA did not respond to a request to interview Chief Executive Officer Wayne LaPierre, instead providing a statement that touted “a string of recent victories” under the NRA’s new political team.
“With many in the media writing the obituary of the NRA, we are scoring big wins in the legislative, legal, and public policy arenas,” spokesman Andrew Arulanandam wrote.
The NRA’s opponents see them as putting on a good face.
“I've never seen them weaker,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national advocacy group. “I think that they have been very much sidelined. ”
As proof, he pointed to the fact that that gun control groups outspent gun rights groups in the 2018 midterm elections. The gun control lobby spent about $12. 1 million to the gun rights’ $10 million ($8. 2 million of that coming from the NRA), according to numbers compiled by Open Secrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks lobbying and election spending.
And that, he said, was all “before the five-alarm fire. ”
The turmoil in the NRA has been unfolding for months.
The group began the year by downplaying its relationship with Maria Butina, a Russian agent later convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison for trying to infiltrate political organizations on behalf of the Kremlin. Butina had become cozy with the organization, including helping to host a delegation of NRA insiders in Moscow in 2015. McClatchy has reported that the Justice Department is investigating whether one of her associates, former Russian official and NRA member Alexander Torshin, illegally moved Russian money through the group to back President Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Then in April, the organization’s president, Oliver North, was forced out after raising concerns about the group’s finances and amid allegations that he had attempted to engineer the removal of LaPierre. LaPierre, who accused North of extortion, is now facing increased pressure to resign, including from deep-pocketed donors concerned about the ongoing strife, the New York Times has reported. The palace intrigue continued in June when the group ousted its longtime top lobbyist, Chris Cox, saying he also engineered the attempted coup against LaPierre.
Even with public pressure from the recent mass shooting, many watching the debate are skeptical that the NRA’s troubles will dramatically move the needle on gun control legislation. Congress has failed to pass broad reform for decades. And Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has thus far ignored Democrats’ calls for a special vote over the summer recess to consider gun measures.
Some Republican lawmakers have signaled a willingness to consider “red-flag” legislation that would allow law enforcement, family members and other concerned individuals to ask a judge to confiscate guns from those who may be a danger to themselves or others. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R. , S. C. ) this week said he planned to introduce a bill that would create a federal grant program to encourage states to pass such laws.
President Trump in remarks at the White House on Sunday backed the idea of red-flag laws, while blaming violent video games and mental illness as causes of mass shootings. On Wednesday, the president said he is also considering tougher background checks for gun buyers, calling such checks “important. ”
The NRA praised the president’s Sunday call to address “the root causes” of violence and said the organization believes anyone “adjudicated as a danger to themselves or others should not have access to firearms. ”
Lawmakers considering new gun measures know that how they vote will influence whether the NRA endorses them — one of the most powerful tools at the organization's disposal, said Adam Winkler, a professor at the UCLA School of Law and author of Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.
“The threat is always there and I think that is enough to sway a lot of lawmakers,” he said. “But we’ll have to see how it plays out. I think the NRA is going through remarkable internal strife right now. ”
Harry L. Wilson, a political scientist at Roanoke University who focuses on gun control, said he doubts that the NRA’s troubles will have much impact on the current legislative debate. In the short term, he said, there’s “nothing the NRA honestly needs to do. ”
“The sides are pretty firmly dug in, I think, legislatively,” he said. “Most elected officials are representing districts that are pretty firmly Democrat or pretty firmly Republican and they're not going to change their positions because there's no incentive for them to change their positions. ”
The majority of NRA members, also, won’t be swayed by the national strife, according to Jerry Henry, executive director of gun-rights group Georgia Carry.
“A lot of people belong to organizations just to say they belong to them. . . . That’s what the majority of basically what all NRA members are,” said Henry, who has been a member for more than five decades. “They just follow it because they know that it can help them. They know it’s not going to hurt them, and they know they can get hurt without organizations like the NRA. ”
Wilson said the impact of the NRA’s infighting could be more dramatic down the line if the problems persist and discourage donations. He said while it’s impossible to know how much money the organization has lost due to the crisis, “it has to be having an impact on fundraising. ” Walters, the radio show host, said the same, noting that many of his callers have vowed to not donate to the NRA until LaPierre resigns, something Walters has publicly called for.
Some former NRA supporters appear to be taking their money elsewhere. Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, said he’s seen at least a 20 percent increase in donations and memberships since April, likely a combination of those disenfranchised by the NRA and those motivated by seeing “20 plus Democratic candidates for president out there attacking gun rights every single day. ”
“They play into each other,” he said. “One, the Democratic candidates screaming for gun control creates the threat. And two, people can't necessarily count on the NRA to be there to solve all the problems for them. ”
Gottlieb said his organization is trying to “fill up some of the gaps” created by the NRA’s turmoil, not just legislatively but looking ahead to the 2020 general election.
Activists in battleground states are watching the national organization’s strife closely. Shira Goodman, executive director of the nonprofit CeaseFire PA, said she hopes the “the lawsuits, the turmoil, the internal dissension, the attempted coups” will damage the NRA’s brand. Over time, she said, that could weaken the group’s own support and strengthen the other side by motivating those who had viewed the NRA as unbeatable. “Having a belief that you will ultimately prevail is critical,” she said.
She and others stressed, though, that the NRA still has its biggest asset: single-issue, pro-gun voters it can mobilize in an election.
“Those people will take the NRA voting guide to the polls,” Goodman said. “And that is not going to disappear overnight. ”

Democratic voters’ preferences aren’t following the moderate/liberal policy script

Texto completo: People who read stories like this (and the guy who writes them) may make the mistake of thinking that the electorate is made up mostly of people who follow politics and issues closely.
To us (and I definitely include myself), it makes senses that Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, for example, are competing for voters on the left wing of the Democratic Party electorate, while former Vice President and current polling frontrunner Joe Biden has to worry mostly about fending off challenges from moderately liberal figures like Sen. Kamala Harris, who (according to the drama critics who review the debates) scored big points against Biden in the first round of the debates, but is now being criticized from the left for a health care plan that doesn’t go as far toward “Medicare for All” as Sanders and Warren do.
If you thought that (as I did), check out yesterday’s analysis of polling on first and second choices of likely Democratic voters by political numbers analyst Nate Cohn of the New York Times.
After analyzing polls in which Democratic voters indicated both their first and second choices, Cohn reports that Warren’s strongest group among the Democratic primary electorate was highly educated, generally affluent, mostly white voters who self-identify as “very liberal,” and that the second choice of voters those categories is not Sanders but Harris.
Bernie Sanders, surprisingly, doesn’t do particularly well among likely Democratic primary voters who describe themselves as “very liberal,” especially if they are affluent. He appeals at least as much to those who describe themselves as “moderates,” and is the leading second preference of Democrats whose first choice is the current front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.
And if, for example, you expect black Democrats, who are disproportionately poor, to be more liberal, you’d be wrong again, at least if you judged their place on the spectrum by their current polling preferences in the Democratic field. Biden, the “moderate,” has, according to Cohn’s analysis, “a far larger lead among black voters in most national surveys than he has among moderates.”
If that surprises you (and it surprised me), get over it. If you’re reading this, you probably pay a lot of attention to politics and to issue positions. But, Cohn argues, comparing issue positions “is not the way that many voters make up their minds.”
I won’t steal any more of Cohn’s main numbers or points, which of course, he is also borrowing from others, namely from polling by Morning Consult and Reuters/Ipsos about the first and second choices of various likely Democratic voters, broken down by age, age and gender.
Cohn eventually discusses why various groups may not vote the way our stereotypes might suggest they would. There’s the “electability” perception, of course, and perhaps especially in the age of Trump.
And, I would add, what the polls tell us today is not what they will tell us next month, let alone what they will tell us after the primaries get under way. Buckle up. Tune in. Pay less attention to short-term movement in polls. And don’t overrate your ability to know, or any pollster to tell you, what’s going to happen next.

Google's anti-Trump bias calls attention to its questionable ties to China

Texto completo: Google is getting bad press for doing business in China, and it’s only getting worse. The widespread perception that Google is anti-Trump and anti-conservative is further fueling its China problems in Washington.
Last week, billionaire tech investor and Trump supporter Peter Thiel penned an op-ed in the New York Times accusing Google of doing business in China in a way that is “Good for Google, Bad for America.” Specifically, Thiel condemned the company for agreeing to work with the Chinese — but not the U.S. military — on artificial intelligence.
He’s right: While Google runs an AI lab in China, it refuses to work on AI with the Pentagon.
“A.I. is a military technology,” wrote Thiel. So why is Google sharing it with China, America’s chief strategic competitor?
Google insists it is not working with the Chinese military, and that it has “no evidence” that Google has been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence.
Of course, not having evidence of infiltration does not mean infiltration has not happened. After all, AI is precisely the type of technology the Chinese military wants. The Chinese government has made no secret of its ambitions in this area, and has announced its intentions to dominate the world’s AI market by 2030.
Furthermore, China’s economic development in the past four decades has shown that the country is not at all averse to stealing intellectual property it wishes to acquire. As the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has estimated, China’s intellectual property theft costs the U.S. economy between $225 billion and $600 billion annually.
It’s highly likely the Chinese government would make aggressive efforts to steal cutting-edge technology such as AI that has military applications. Thiel hence alleges that Google’s collaboration with the Chinese on AI is at best naïve — and at worst treasonous.
When Thiel made similar accusations against Google on Fox News in mid-July and called for FBI and CIA investigations, Trump quickly chimed in.TweetThe company’s predicament might not be so bad if the political right did not widely believe that it is anti-Trump and anti-conservative.
Some of Google’s harshest critics on China on Capitol Hill are lawmakers who advocate for Google to be investigated for censoring conservative speech and viewpoints. After all, Google’s employees overwhelmingly lean left in their political support. In 2016, roughly 90% of the political contributions by employees of Google-related companies went to Democrats. And on the same day that Thiel’s op-ed was published, a former Google engineer accused the company of terminating him in 2018 for voicing conservative views.
Not a good look for a company that claims to be politically neutral.
If Google had actually been neutral, would Trump have refrained from calling for an investigation? It is quite possible, as Trump tends to go easy on his friends.
Google is not his friend.
Conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill might also be less aggressive in condemning Google’s China connections and activities if they did not believe Google was actively working against their policy agenda and undermining their political activism.
So yes, Google’s AI involvement in China is a grave national security concern that requires serious discussions and solutions. But to facilitate more productive conversations with relevant lawmakers, Google may want to begin by building better relations with conservatives and the Trump administration, and encouraging more intellectual diversity within its ranks.

Texto completo: New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet said the publication changed a controversial front page headline in the wake of President Trump's speech on last weekend's mass shootings.
"It was written on deadline and when it was passed along for approval we all saw it was a bad headline and changed it pretty quickly," Baquet told the Daily Beast Tuesday. "I understand the concern people have. Headlines matter. But I hope they read the coverage, which I will argue was strong."
A representative for the publication said the headline in question "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM" was "clearly flawed" but that it had been changed for every edition but the first.
The headline change followed criticism of the Times by a handful of liberal pundits and Democratic presidential candidates.

The Times replaced the original headline with "ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS."
The headline followed President Trump's response to mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.
In a speech after the shootings, the president condemned white supremacy, calling it a "sinister" ideology.
Trump urged lawmakers to pass gun background checks in tweets before his speech but did not talk about potential solutions during the speech.

Texto completo: The New York Times changed its print edition headline about President Trump's response to two mass shootings after the paper received flak from multiple presidential candidates.
Over the weekend, over thirty people were killed in shootings hours apart in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. The president addressed the shootings in prepared remarks on Monday morning. He called out "grisly video games" and condemned white nationalism, but many felt as though he didn't address his own culpability.
The original headline read “TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM." The accompanying photo is of the memorial set up at the Walmart where the El Paso shooting occurred. Tweet
The Times' headline was widely ridiculed and those who were critical of it included some who are seeking the presidency.
Tweet
Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke simply referred to the headline as "unbelievable," while New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said, "Lives literally depend on you doing better, NYT. Please do."
New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand also commented saying that the headline was "not what happened," while New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, "Hey, @nytimes — what happened to 'The Truth Is Worth It?' Not the truth. Not worth it."
Tweet
“The headline was bad and has been changed for the second edition,” a spokesperson for the Times told the Washington Post.
The backlash also included members of the media. Some were critical of the headline but argued that those who said they are canceling their subscription, like Joan Walsh, were wrong to do that after the controversial headline.
Tweet
“One headline writer’s mistake is not cause enough to close the door on an army of truly great journalists who don’t write the headlines,” tweeted Julie K. Brown, an investigative reporter with the Miami Herald, in response to Walsh.
Tweet
Following the outcry of condemnation, the Times then changed the headline to '“ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS.” The photo that went along with the story was also changed. The new photo is captioned, "A vigil at Horizon High School in El Paso for Javier Amir Rodriguez, a 15-year-old student who was fatally shot at a local Walmart."

Never Trump quandary: When you want Trump to lose but can't bear his Democratic opponents

Texto completo: The Democratic debates have been hard on Never Trumpers. The small but vocal group of Republicans and former Republicans who oppose President Trump has watched in horror as Democrats veered leftward, embracing "Medicare-for-all," virtually open borders, sky-high taxes, and other positions no conservative could ever accept. The Never Trumpers see disaster coming in the form of the president winning reelection over a Democrat who moved too far left for the American voter.
So they issue warnings. The Democrats' performance in the most recent debate was "worse than farcical," the New York Times' Bret Stephens wrote. "It's tragic. It will make the Trump campaign's job of selling the president as the non-insane option in next year's election shamefully easy."
Bill Kristol, the former Dan Quayle aide who founded the now-shuttered Weekly Standard, tweeted, "Best moment in this debate: 'It's time for closing statements.'"
After the first debate — a widely watched event that gave voters across the nation their initial impression of the Democratic field — some Never Trumpers were deeply alarmed.
"Trump wants to portray Democrats as open-border socialists," wrote the Washington Post's Max Boot. "And in their eagerness to court progressive primary voters, the candidates are playing into his hands."
The alarm sometimes felt personal, as when the Times' David Brooks issued a plea: "Dems, Please Don't Drive Me Away." The columnist announced that he could "never in a million years vote for Donald Trump" and plaintively asked Democrats: "Will there be a candidate I can vote for?"
Maybe not. The fretting and complaining, coming from people who had been Republicans until Trump came along, set some liberals on edge.
"We should just ditch this whole primary thing and just have a small panel of NeverTrump Republicans solomonically decide which Democrat would make them most comfortable," tweeted MSNBC's Chris Hayes.
"I, for one, have pretty much had it with the chorus of center-right voices braying that the Democrats are heading for certain doom...if the party picks a nominee who actually embraces the party's ideals," wrote the Post's Eugene Robinson, adding that "NeverTrump Republicans and independents may be shocked to hear this, but the Democratic Party is likely to nominate a Democrat for president."
The pushback served to highlight the Never Trump dilemma. First, they went through a torturous process searching for a candidate to support in the 2016 election. Now, it's happening again.
The 2020 problem is twofold. The first part is that there is no hope of challenging Trump within the Republican Party structure. As a sitting president, Trump controls the Republican National Committee and has the support of the vast majority of GOP voters. The only Republican running against Trump so far is William Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts who left office more than 20 years ago. With scant polling, it is not clear how much support Weld has, but it's not much.
The second part of the Never Trump dilemma is the depressingly woke Democratic field. Only a few Never Trumpers would be able to support a Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or Kamala Harris. Some would probably be happy with Joe Biden, but perhaps more the Biden of their memories than the man who will have to move far enough left to capture the Democratic nomination.
So, with no hope of stopping Trump inside the GOP, and with Democrats moving in an unacceptable direction, what to do?
There's always hope that some Republican more prominent than Weld will defy the odds and challenge Trump in the primaries. There aren't a lot of choices. Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor and congressman who lost a GOP primary in 2018, says he is thinking about running on a platform of fiscal responsibility. That's unlikely to generate much voter excitement.
Some Never Trumpers would like to see Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the GOP over Trump, take on the president, although running in the Republican primaries might be a stretch for someone who has just left the Republican Party.
Some might also search for a candidate of neither party whom they can support in the general election. If that happens, it could well end up like 2016, when Never Trumpers supported Evan McMullin, an ex-CIA agent who received 731,788 votes, or 0.54% of the total votes cast. He was not exactly an inspiring standard bearer.
The fact is, barring some extraordinary event that no one can predict, the 2020 presidential race will be between President Trump and a Democratic challenger. Trump will be chosen by Republicans. The Democrat will be chosen by Democrats. And one of the two will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2021.

ONE NATION UNDER THE GUN WHEN THE PRESIDENT LACKS MORAL AUTHORITY, WE HAVE TO STEP IN.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump began the week with an early morning lie via Twitter: "The Media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our Country. Fake News has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years. News coverage has got to start being fair, balanced and unbiased, or these terrible problems will only get worse!"
Mr. Trump sent that tweet at 7:32 a.m. Monday. He was addressing weekend massacres in El Paso and Dayton through the lens of media criticism, a go-to tactic for a president who, lacking any moral authority, believes his bully pulpit should be used for bullying.
Early in the day he was scheduled to make a speech to the nation about the carnage of the previous days, Mr. Trump was still not prepared to indict guns or utter the words "white supremacy" and "domestic terrorism" in the same breath.
Something happened to Mr. Trump between 7:32 a.m. and shortly after 10 a.m. on Monday when he addressed the nation with prepared remarks. Sounding less confident than usual, Mr. Trump delivered the speech with the ponderous, wheezy cadence he uses whenever he's forced to "act presidential" during a crisis. He sounded like a man with a gun to his head.
Because moral reflection isn't part of Mr. Trump's repertoire of talents, the cracks in his facade as a leader during a national crisis showed quickly. After all, he spent much of the previous two weeks stirring up racial resentment so that his perpetually angry base would be motivated to turn out for him next year. He lacks moral authority and knows it.
"We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism," Mr. Trump, who had proposed cutting resources in recent months for this mission, said with a straight face.
"Whatever they need. We must recognize that the internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts," he said. "We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start."
Meanwhile, the alienated white men with guns he was denouncing as domestic terrorists are pragmatic enough to continue loving him. They know that he occasionally has to say mean things at their expense, but they know he would rather talk about Mexicans "invading the United States" than denounce white supremacy by equating it with domestic terrorism.
So even though he forcefully denounced both white supremacy and the internet during Monday's speech, we all know that the president himself is the King of Twitter Hate and one of the most noxious personalities on social media today. His presence in the Oval Office has helped the white supremacy movement grow because it perceives him as an ally.
Listening to Mr. Trump stumbling over the internal contradictions of the speech even as he read it was a stark reminder of how important it is for a leader to have some capacity for moral reflection. His inability to address his own contribution to the toxic mix of hate and violence on social media only shows his lack of self-awareness.
While calling for the death penalty for domestic terrorists, Mr. Trump refused to call for tougher background checks for gun buyers or a ban on military-style weapons. He blamed the finger pulling the trigger, not the gun. He blamed mental health as more of a factor for massacres than easy access to guns. Once again, guns were exonerated.
On Saturday morning, I wrote the following on Facebook as El Paso was happening. It represents the clearest distillation of my thoughts on the situation:
"The fact that most Americans can walk into any gun shop in the country and buy a weapon of mass destruction (as long as the buyer isn't flagged by a background check) tells you everything you need to know about the suicidal impulses of American capitalism, the obscene power of the gun lobby, the brokenness of our (unresponsive) political system and the insanity of a civilian population of potential victims that would tolerate such a state of affairs for one more day.
"Even though the NRA is close to insolvency, the gun industry as a whole continues to exert enormous power over the Republican caucus and a handful of conservative/moderate Democrats. Will the graphic awfulness of the Saturday morning massacre at an El Paso Walmart change any of this? Did an elementary school massacre by another lunatic with a gun weeks before Christmas change anything? No! Worship of the Second Amendment and belief in the right to take another person's life at the first sign of a threat trumps everything. Our national motto: Stand your ground, America, even if it means everyone else has to die."
Upon waking the next morning and finding out about Dayton, I wrote the following:
"And so every day we wake up to news of some fresh horror. Before we have processed the shock of the previous day's massacre, another man exercising his "right to bear arms" (and the implied right to deprive random people of their lives) makes his mark and extends the legacy of death guaranteed by the community of gun fetishists. It doesn't have to be this way. We don't have to let a vaguely worded amendment from the 18th century, when people were allowed to own other people, dictate the fearful quality of our lives. Every politician who would sanction a constitutional abstraction that results in so much routine death to ordinary citizens living their lives has to be repudiated at the polls and in public life. Gun manufacturers should be made to understand that their lack of morality comes at a massive financial cost and that the bill has finally come due."
When the president lacks moral authority, it's up to the rest of us to step into the breach.

Texto completo: The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles an evil comic book character for the developmentally arrested intellectual - the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.
Last week, The New York Times reported that the financier/convicted sex offender/philanthropist - and now accused sex trafficker - is also a "transhumanist," who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch.
Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed that ought to be replicated.
The carriers of Epstein's apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn't be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers. Instead, according to the Times' reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.
For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein's very special black book, according to the Times.
The male invitees weren't your run-of-the-mill scientists but were some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia. Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an "intellectual imposter." Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks. To the layman's eye, such behavior suggests a purposeful deflection when the topic at hand is reaching a point beyond the speaker's comfort range.
Others on Epstein's guest lists apparently were seduced by his charm and intellect, as well as his wealth, which he reportedly dangled as bait for funding-starved researchers. He was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes, including the Clinton Foundation. But he wasn't convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.
Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering at Harvard, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary. Gods don't like to be contradicted and Pinker was thereafter told he'd been "voted off the island" and banished from future gatherings.
Speaking of which, Epstein's private island in the Caribbean - which he dubs "Little St. Jeff's" - is of renewed interest thanks to an NBC News report last week. Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall, according to permit records.
What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh's headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein's remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen. Also a fan of cryogenics, believing that frozen human parts and bodies could be resurrected in the future, Epstein is no ordinary bloke. Indeed, he is a perversely tragic figure.
Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable. Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind and image, he forgot that he was merely mortal and may have flown too close to the sun. Given his confinement now to a jail cell (with further punishment perhaps to come) - and removal from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries who suffused his ego with admiration - his suffering must be immense.
And so richly deserved.

Texto completo: The news on Monday morning was especially unsettling: Tensions rising in the Persian Gulf over oil shipments, Hong Kong partially paralyzed by antigovernment protests, mass shootings in Texas and Ohio “shaking a bewildered nation to its core," as The New York Times headline blared.
But the development that really rattled investors — at one point sending the Dow Jones average tumbling nearly 1,000 points — was a decline by China's currency against the US dollar. The Dow ended the day with a loss of 767 points, or 2.90 percent, the biggest percentage decline of the year.
The ups and downs of the renminbi usually go little noticed outside the foreign exchange market. But these days, investors' primal fear is that the escalating trade war with China will trip the US economy into a recession.
Can you blame them?
Last week, President Trump said he would impose new tariffs on a huge basket of Chinese goods starting Sept. 1, and US stocks had their worst week of the year.
On Monday, after China let its tightly managed currency hit the lowest level against the dollar since 2008, it sure seemed like retaliation for Trump's new tariff threat.
A cheaper renminbi serves a dual purpose for Beijing: It makes Chinese exports less expensive for international buyers, easing the impact of American tariffs, and complicates life for US companies as they compete against Chinese rivals.
For good measure, China also stopped making purchases of US agricultural goods, which the Trump administration has been seeking to boost.
Then, after the markets closed Monday, the Treasury Department ratcheted up the dispute further, labeling China a currency manipulator.
Deep into July, stocks had been trading at record highs, thanks to hopes for a trade deal, which seemed possible as recently as a week ago. Now the two sides have entered a new, more dangerous phase of the confrontation: currency warfare.
“The response of the equity markets over the last several days to the reignition of protectionist trade policy by the Trump administration toward China has been incredibly negative, and not without reason," Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at wealth manager Boston Private Financial, said in an e-mail. “The economic impact of this potential next round of tariffs could be meaningful, as the goods subject to the next round are consumer focused."
In March of last year, Trump tweeted “trade wars are good, and easy to win."
That was early in his attempt to close the trade gap with China and end unfair tactics such as requiring transfers of US technology to Chinese partners. While most investors and economists dismissed the president's tweet as nonsense, they agreed China's trade practices were a problem that needed to be addressed.
The $200 billion worth of tariffs Trump ordered in July 2018 targeted goods mostly used by companies to make other products. But last week, after a brief round of talks yielded no progress, Trump announced a 10 percent levy on $300 billion of Chinese products, everything from sneakers to cellphones. He made the move despite opposition from some top advisers, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The reaction on Wall Street was overwhelmingly negative. The economy isn't growing as fast as it was when the trade spat started. There is less room for error — a fact acknowledged by the Federal Reserve last week when it approved a quarter-point rate cut as insurance against damage from the trade fight.
“Tariffs are taxes; it is as simple as that," said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Delaware-based Wilmington Trust. “Raising taxes reduces economic growth, just as the tax cut package boosted growth in 2018. . . . First-order impacts of the tariffs wipe out a substantial portion of the tax stimulus that had been created."
So what happened on Monday?
China allowed its tightly managed currency to fall below 7 renminbi to the dollar, a symbolically important move that could make US products even less competitive against Chinese rivals. The president accused China of deliberately weakening its currency to gain an edge in export markets. China blamed Trump for “unilateralism and trade protectionism."
Investors just ran for the hills. A weaker renminbi could prompt other exports-dependent countries to devalue their currencies, leading to a race to the bottom that causes a global recession.
Stocks fell sharply at the opening bell — at one point, the Dow was down more than 960 points. When the dust settled, the market closed at 25,718, 6 percent below its recent record. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 3 percent to 2,845. Stocks also tumbled in Europe, Japan, and China.
“The escalation dashes any hopes of a trade deal any time soon," said Milton Ezrati, chief economist at financial communications firm Vested. “It also makes more immediate and severe the damage this dispute will have on the US economy."
The yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to fell to 1.714 percent, the lowest since before Trump's election and a giant red flag that bond investors see increasing odds of a recession. In a switch from last week, investors are betting the Fed will cut rates several more times this year in hopes of avoiding a hard landing.
Then came the formal US declaration that it considers China a currency manipulator, a largely symbolic move that nonetheless escalated the fight once more. S&P futures markets slid in early Asian trading for Tuesday.
There are benefits to falling interest rates: mortgages and credit card borrowing are cheaper for consumers, and businesses can get cheaper loans for expansion. And some investors aren't convinced a downturn is inevitable.
“We have the power to outspend, certainly in the near-term, any adverse effects from China," said Jason R. Escamilla, chief executive of ImpactAdvisor LLC, a San Francisco-based financial adviser. “And I am less concerned that the net effect of all this will be higher new tariffs over the longer term. It's too easy to cut a mutually beneficial deal as this escalates."
That's true. If Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping can step back from the abyss, they would take a lot of pressure off their economies and financial markets. But that's a big if.
“What will happen as a strong-willed US president tries to face down a small cabal of 'hard to read' leaders [in China?]" said Warren Ward, founder of Warren Ward Associates, a financial advisory firm in Columbus, Ind. “No one knows."
Markets hate uncertainty. Expect more ugly days like Monday until the trade picture gets a lot clearer.

Texto completo: J. D. Scholten, a Democrat who nearly toppled Representative Steve King of Iowa in a heavily Republican district in 2018, announced on Monday that he would run again for the seat in 2020. His decision sets up a possible rematch with Mr. King, whose history of racist remarks has made him a pariah among Republican leaders, though not always with voters.
"Last time, we were hoping to win," Mr. Scholten said in an interview before the announcement. "Now, we are expecting to win. We know how to do it."
Mr. King was stripped of his congressional committee assignments this year by House Republicans, after he questioned why white nationalism was offensive. He later said he had nothing to apologize for and would run in 2020 for a 10th term in his deeply conservative district in northwest Iowa.
If he survives a primary challenge next year, Mr. King will appear on the same ballot as President Trump, whose nativism and anti-immigrant remarks Mr. King long foreshadowed. In Mr. King's Fourth District, which Mr. Trump won by nearly 30 points, voters in the past have either agreed with or overlooked Mr. King's divisive language about Latino migrants, who sustain much of the agricultural economy there.
"Having Steve King have a voice in Congress, I think that's at the root of why I feel it's so important to get him out of office," Mr. Scholten said.
[A fourth Texas Republican plans to retire from the House, G.O.P. officials say.]
Mr. Scholten, a former minor league baseball player and a fifth-generation Iowan, said he would once again crisscross the 39 counties of the largely rural district in an R.V., overnighting in Walmart parking lots, while engaging with voters about health care, agriculture and getting corporate money out of politics.
Mr. Scholten, 39, weighed running against Senator Joni Ernst, a potentially vulnerable Republican, but learned in June that national Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, were backing a different challenger, Theresa Greenfield.
"Ultimately, I would have a tough time abandoning what we were able to accomplish and watch Steve King get re-elected if I were to run in that race," Mr. Scholten said over the weekend. "And, I mean, the Fourth District is where my heart's at."
Iowa will be in the political spotlight next year, not just for its presidential caucuses in February, but also because it will feature competitive races up and down the ballot in November, for the Senate and all four of its congressional seats.
[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]
To win re-election, Mr. King must first defeat three primary challengers, most prominently Randy Feenstra, a state senator who has outraised him with the support of the Republican establishment. Mr. King brought in just $ 91,000 in the quarter ending in June, compared with Mr. Feenstra's $ 140,000.
Money, however, has never mattered much in Mr. King's re-elections. He has nearly universal name recognition in his district, and, until recently, voters broadly embraced his pugnacious personality and positions on bedrock conservative issues like abortion and gun rights.
Mr. Scholten, who outspent Mr. King nearly four to one in 2018, came within three percentage points of unseating him after the congressman endorsed a candidate for Toronto mayor with neo-Nazi ties and, in an interview with an Austrian publication that surfaced late in the race, seemed to endorse the "Great Replacement," a conspiracy theory espoused by white supremacists.
In January, in an interview with The New York Times, Mr. King said, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?"
House Republican leaders removed him from the Judiciary and Agriculture Committees, while Mr. King defended himself by saying his remarks had been taken out of context.
More recently, in town-hall-style events with constituents, he has claimed he did not utter the words as quoted.
Many Democratic politicians issued fresh condemnations of white nationalism over the weekend after at least 29 people were killed in mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, and some placed a portion of the blame on Mr. Trump's remarks. The authorities said they were investigating the El Paso shooting as a possible hate crime.
"Words have consequences," Mr. Scholten said when asked about the shootings. "The hatred and racism that has become too commonplace in our country does fuel violence."
Despite his yearslong history of racist remarks, Mr. King was rebuked by Republican leaders only recently. Senator Ernst denounced Mr. King this year, but she has campaigned with him in the past, eager for the support of his voters in the state's most conservative region.
Should Mr. Feenstra or one of the other primary challengers emerge as the nominee, Republicans would quite likely have an easier time against Mr. Scholten without Mr. King's baggage.
If Mr. King wins the nomination, Mr. Scholten would have to win the votes of many Republicans and unaffiliated voters to defeat the congressman in a district where active registered Republicans greatly outnumber Democrats. Mr. Scholten lost to Mr. King by about 10,000 votes last year, out of 313,000 cast.
"We got 24,000 more votes last time than there are Democrats in the district," Mr. Scholten said. "I have to do even better than that this time."
Strategists for both parties in Iowa said they would still consider Mr. King the favorite if he became the nominee.
"Republicans in the Fourth District have not yet indicated they've had enough" of Mr. King, said Kurt Meyer, a Democratic county chairman in the First District. "If a Democratic candidate for president runs strong in Iowa, there's maybe a one-in-three chance we take him out."

Trump's first response: sending out tweets

Texto completo: As the nation reeled from two mass shootings in less than a day, President Trump spent the first hours after the tragedies out of sight at his New Jersey golf course, sending out tweets of support awkwardly mixed in with those promoting a celebrity fight and attacking his political foes.
Americans did not glimpse the president in the immediate aftermath of a shooting in El Paso that killed at least 20 people and, hours later, one in Dayton, Ohio, that claimed at least nine lives. Not until Trump and the first lady prepared to fly back to Washington in the late afternoon Sunday did he appear before cameras.
"Hate has no place in our country, and we're going to take care of it," Trump declared before boarding Air Force One.
While connecting "hate" and mental illness to the shootings, Trump made no direct mention of gun laws, a factor brought up by Democratic officials and those seeking their party's nomination to challenge Trump's reelection next year.
As he had in tweets, Trump offered condolences to victims' families and thanked law enforcement for their efforts. He tried to assure Americans he was dealing with the problem and defended his administration in light of criticism following the latest in a string of mass shootings.
"A lot of things are in the works. We have done much more than most administrations. We have done actually a lot. But perhaps more needs to be done," he said.
Never seemingly comfortable consoling a nation in grief, Trump will be carefully watched for his response to the attacks, again inviting comparison to his predecessors who have tried to heal the country in moments of national trauma.
In recent weeks, the president has issued racist tweets about four women of color who serve in Congress, and in rallies has spoken of an "invasion" at the southern border. His reelection strategy so far has placed racial animus at the forefront in an effort that his aides say is designed to activate his base of conservative voters, an approach not seen by an American president in the modern era.
Trump has also been widely criticized for offering a false equivalency when discussing racial violence, notably when he said there were "good people on both sides" after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., that resulted in the death of an anti-racism demonstrator.
Associated Press
Democratic candidates seek to link shootings to Trump
Democratic candidates for president reacted strongly Sunday to the two shootings that killed at least 29 people, calling on Congress to act decisively on gun control while denouncing a culture of hatred and white nationalism that some said emanated from the Trump White House.
Speaking to CBS News early Sunday, former representative Beto O'Rourke said President Trump had “a lot to do with what happened in El Paso yesterday," arguing that Trump's rhetoric about immigrants and asylum-seekers was responsible for having sown “the kind of fear, the kind of reaction that we saw in El Paso yesterday."
“It's up to all of us to put an end to this racism and make sure that we don't just tolerate our differences, but as we've shown here in El Paso, we embrace them as the very source of our strength and our success," said O'Rourke, who is from El Paso and represented the district for years in Congress.
Law enforcement authorities are looking into whether the suspect in El Paso was connected to a hate-filled, anti-immigrant manifesto that had appeared online minutes before the shooting. They said Sunday that they were investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism.
Like O'Rourke, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey put the blame for the shootings on the president, saying, “Donald Trump is responsible for this."
“He is responsible because he is stoking fears and hatred and bigotry," Booker said of Trump.
The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, called the shootings “a serious problem" on ABC, but denied that the president was to blame and rejected the idea that he had not taken seriously the threat of white nationalism.
“They are sick, sick people and the president knows that," Mulvaney said, referring to the attackers. “I don't think it's fair to try and lay this at the feet of the president."
Other Democratic candidates were more indirect in reference to the president's connection to the violence, and focused on the need to enact stricter gun controls and combat the influence of the National Rifle Association.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said he believed politicians and the White House were hesitant to condemn white supremacist terrorism because they were “embarrassed."
“At best he's condoning and encouraging white nationalism," Buttigieg added, speaking of Trump.

Aide: McConnell trips, breaks shoulder in Kentucky
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is recuperating at home in Kentucky after suffering a shoulder fracture in a fall Sunday, a spokesman said.
McConnell tripped Sunday morning on his outdoor patio, but has been treated and released, David Popp, a spokesman for the Kentucky Republican, said in a statement. The statement said McConnell, 77, is working from home in Louisville and "will continue to work from home" for now.
The statement didn't elaborate on what treatment he received or the expected time needed for recovery.

Analysis: A small, but ill-timed exodus of Texas Republicans from Congress

With a number of Texas Republicans deciding not to seek reelection to Congress, the state suddenly has a bunch of openings in its delegation. At least three of those vacancies increase the odds that Texas will send more Democrats to Congress after the 2020 elections.
That means there will be first-time officeholders being sworn into Congress in 2021 — the same year that the Texas Legislature is drawing new political maps. This is significant: Tenured incumbents tend to have bigger voices when it’s time to redesign political districts. The new kids, whoever they are, whatever party’s flag they’re flying, will start at the back of the line.
U.S. Rep. Pete Olson, R-Sugar Land, was the first out of the box, saying he won’t seek another term in 2020. He almost didn’t get another term in 2018, skating past Democrat Sri Kulkarni with 51.4% of the vote. Fort Bend County has gone from reliably red to arguably purple, and the 2020 race will be competitive. In 2018, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz won the 22nd Congressional District by less than one percentage point over Beto O’Rourke. Any Republican and any Democrat in the 2020 contest can expect a tough race.
A few days later, U.S. Rep. Mike Conaway announced he won’t be back after the 2020 elections. That doesn’t exactly put new opportunities on the table for Democrats in the 11th Congressional District: Cruz beat O’Rourke here by 56 percentage points in 2018, and the average statewide Republican candidate did even better than Cruz. Conaway himself got 80.1% in 2018 — with both a Democrat and a Libertarian opposing him. That said, his replacement after 2020 will go into redistricting with a relatively underpopulated West Texas congressional district to defend, and with state legislators remaking the boundaries.
The big surprise landed — via Twitter, naturally — when U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Helotes announced he won’t seek reelection in the state’s most competitive congressional district. Set aside the easy argument that this is the Democrats’ best chance to pick off a Republican seat in the entire state. He won by just 926 votes out of 210,418 cast in 2018 — or less than half a percentage point, and clearly would have a hard contest ahead of him. But Hurd has been a counter-balance to the administration on several issues and, because of the precarious politics of the 23rd Congressional District, a swing vote when his local politics were out of sync with those of congressional Republicans. He is the only black Republican in Congress, and has been an outsized voice in the 36-member Texas delegation on issues of immigration, border security and intelligence matters.
U.S. Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Heath, might have joined the departees, but his moment in the national spotlight was short. President Donald Trump tweeted a week ago Sunday that Ratcliffe was his choice to become director of national intelligence, effectively crowd-sourcing an appointment before sending it to the Senate for confirmation. Ratcliffe didn’t survive that virtual hazing, and the president — again using Twitter — pulled him from consideration on Friday. Ratcliffe or any other Republican would have a strong advantage in his 4th Congressional District; statewide Republican candidates finished more than 51 percentage points ahead of their Democratic opponents there in 2018.
And U.S. Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Carrollton, is expected to announce his decision not to run on Monday. That was first reported late Sunday by The New York Times, and two sources confirmed the news to The Texas Tribune. His 24th Congressional District, drawn as a safe seat for Republicans, is now competitive. Cruz lost to O'Rourke there by 3.5 percentage points in 2018, and Marchant himself won reelection that year by just 3.1 percentage points.
The ranks of Republican congressional repatriates coming home to Texas from Washington could increase as the rest of the pack announces their 2020 intentions. It’s highly unlikely that departures and competitive seats would swing the balance of the Texas delegation to the Democrats, who now hold 13 of those 36 districts.
But the Democrats have targeted a half-dozen Republican seats they think they could win, in a good year with good candidates.
And their state efforts, buttressed by out-of-state money and advice, are aimed at gaining a majority in the Texas House, which now has 83 Republicans and 67 Democrats. Democrats are betting on the domino effect: Win the Texas House for a larger voice in drawing congressional maps (the Texas Senate has a sturdy Republican majority), take advantage of wins in Congress and the weak bargaining power of those newbie Republican officeholders in Texas in 2021, and fortify the Democratic majority in the U.S. House.
The Republicans have other plans, but at the moment, they’re counting retirements.

Texto completo: Another Republican congressman from Texas is planning to retire, making him the fourth from the state to announce in recent weeks that he won’t run for reelection in 2020.
Rep. Kenny Marchant will announce his retirement Monday, according to the New York Times.
Marchant, who represents a suburban Dallas district, was first elected to Congress in 2004. The margins of victory he saw in previous races shrunk to three points in the 2018 midterms in a state that is becoming more competitive for Democrats.
Marchant becomes the 11th House Republican to announce retirement or to seek another office in the upcoming election. Only three House Democrats have said they won’t run again.
Democrats currently have a 37-seat majority in the lower chamber and are hoping they can increase their margins in 2020 with wins in Texas. Texas Republican Reps. Pete Olson, Will Hurd, and K. Michael Conaway have also announced they’ll be stepping down.

Kamala Harris and Cory Booker jockey for strongest gun control positions

Texto completo: Even before the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker positioned themselves as Democratic presidential hopefuls with some of the most aggressive gun control proposals in the crowded primary field.
Nearly all of the 2020 Democrats support strengthening background checks for firearm sales, banning assault-style weapons, and encouraging “red flag laws” to quickly remove firearms from those deemed to be a threat to themselves or others. But not every candidate has released a proposal on how he or she would address gun violence. Booker, a New Jersey senator, and Harris, a senator from California, go further than most other candidates in their plans.
Harris, 54, has pledged that as president she'll take executive action to achieve gun control priorities if Congress does not send her a gun control bill within her first 100 days. Her proposed executive actions include mandating near-universal background checks, banning the importation of assault weapons, and closing the “boyfriend loophole” to “prevent dating partners convicted of domestic violence from purchasing guns.”
Harris touted her plans to take executive action during a CNN appearance on Sunday, an email to supporters on Sunday and on Twitter throughout the weekend.
Tweet
“Congress must have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws. If they won't act, I will,” a Saturday tweet from Harris said.
The Booker campaign calls his firearm control plan “the most sweeping gun violence prevention proposal ever advanced by a presidential candidate.” The former Newark mayor, 50, calls to create a federal gun licensing system, require handgun microstamping so law enforcement can more easily trace shell casings to a specific gun, limit gun buyers to one handgun per month, and require firearm owners to report lost or stolen guns.
Booker also referenced some of his plans in the wake of the shootings.
“There’s evidence-based measures that we can take that will dramatically reduce or eliminate this problem,” the New Jersey senator said on MSNBC Sunday. “It’s why I’ve come forward on commonsense things like gun licensing, which says that hey, if you need a license to drive a car, it’s common sense that you should need a license to own and possess a firearm.”
In a tweet on Monday, Booker mentioned Chicago in addition to El Paso and Dayton as locations that suffered gun violence over the weekend, drawing attention to his focus on comprehensive reform rather than lone-wolf mass shootings.
While Harris and Booker have laid out some of the most comprehensive and detailed plans to address gun violence, other candidates have expressed support for their ideas. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper have expressed support for federal gun licensing.
Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke has also released a plan to address gun violence that includes reversing “regulatory action that allows access to the 3D printing of plastic guns” through executive action but does not go as far as Harris and Booker on executive action and gun licensing.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar one-upped one portion of Harris’ plan, pledging to “immediately” take executive action rather than waiting for 100 days to close the “boyfriend loophole” to prevent those who abused dating partners from owning or buying guns.
Former Housing Secretary Julián Castro has not released a proposal specific to gun control, but he did go further than many of his primary competitors when he told the New York Times that “in an ideal world, people would not own handguns.”
One former 2020 Democratic candidate, Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, had planned to run his White House campaign explicitly on gun control. But Swalwell dropped out of the race on July 8, after garnering negligible support in the polls.

The obsession with 'white supremacy' violence is based on cooked studies

Texto completo: Brace yourself because for the rest of this week you’ll hear about nothing but the supposed “surge in right-wing extremist violence” or the “rise of violent white supremacists.”
True, a lunatic who feared immigrants (and automation and a corporate takeover of the federal government) did shoot up a Walmart in El Paso on Saturday, killing nearly two dozen people. But that’s no more a reason to panic about a nonexistent proliferation of violent white supremacy than a single plane crash is reason to ground all commercial air travel.
Naturally, any time a white male even attempts a mass shooting, the national media will reheat the “right-wing extremism” and “white supremacist violence” myths.
The New York Times editorial board on Sunday evening declared that the United States has “a White Nationalist Terrorist Problem.” The piece linked to an ABC News story from early July on the “growing threat of violent white supremacist extremists.”
Back in June, CNN’s Jake Tapper wondered on air whether a shooting by a white guy that resulted in no deaths or injuries “represents a growing threat in the U.S. of extremist right-wing violence.”

As detailed in my forthcoming book Privileged Victims: How America’s Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People, it’s all a hoax. Every news story about right-wing violence or “white supremacy”-linked violence is based on the same set of joke studies that count each and every murder involving a supposedly racist white person, no matter how ridiculous the circumstances, as racially motivated.
One of those studies is put out by the Anti-Defamation League every year. Take this one from last year that said 2018 “was a particularly active year for right-wing extremist murders.” It further said that “extremist-related murders in 2018 were overwhelmingly linked to right-wing extremists.”
Unfortunately, the report obscures the most crucial information. It doesn’t list all of the violent incidents that it takes in to account, but even in the few concrete examples that the Anti-Defamation League does provide, you get examples like this: “Richard Starry shot and killed four relatives at a local nursing center and at his home in an apparent act of domestic violence before killing himself. According to local media, Starry had been a member of a white supremacist group while in prison.” Or like this: “James Mathis, a member of the Georgia-based white supremacist prison gang Ghostface Gangsters, and his wife, Amanda Oakes, allegedly killed their six-month-old son and put his body in a freezer in a hotel room.”
So when white people kill their own family members, even their own babies, that’s the kind of “white supremacy”-linked violence the Anti Defamation League is looking at. It’s not a rash of Ku Klux Klan members lynching blacks and Latino immigrants in the streets.
By contrast, let’s have a look at what the Anti-Defamation League has to say about Islamic extremism. The same report admits that despite a higher number of “incidents” related to “white supremacy,” the ones perpetrated by Islamic extremists have a far higher body count. “Compared to right-wing extremists,” said the report, “domestic Islamist extremists in the U.S. have been involved in far fewer lethal incidents — but a number of those attacks have been high-casualty events, including most notably the Pulse nightclub attack in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, which left 49 dead.”
Another one of the media’s favorite studies to cite is the Government Accountability Office’s 2017 report on “countering violent extremism.” The report lists a number of violent incidents between 2001 to 2016 that the Government Accountability Office believes were either motivated by “far-right extremists” or “radical-Islamist extremists.” The supposed “far-right” included white supremacists, “anti-government” people and “right-wing extremists,” totaling in 62 incidents and 106 victims. The radical-Islamist extremists, by contrast, was literally just Muslims and the group accounted for 23 incidents, with a total of 119 victims.
Using a very advanced form of arithmetic, that’s less than two victims per “far-right” attack versus at least five victims per Muslim attack. Put another way, Muslim extremists had a third of the “incidents” that the “far-right,” had, but they claimed more victims.
I’m not the best at math but something about those numbers leads me to believe there’s at least some difference between what constitutes a “far-right” attack and the mass terror perpetuated by Muslim extremists, a group with a much narrower definition than that applied to “the far-right.”
Included in the radical-Islamist extremist category of the Government Accountability Office study were some well-remembered episodes of mass terror, like the Orlando night club shooting in June 2016, resulting in the death of nearly 50 people; the San Bernardino shooting spree of December 2015 that claimed 14 lives; and the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, which the study says killed 3, but that doesn’t include all the limbs and muscle tissue lost by another nearly 300.
By the way, the Government Accountability Office report only looked at data after Sept. 12, 2001, thus excluding the 3,000 people who lost their lives in the 9/11 New York terror attacks. That’s convenient for anyone searching for proof that the “far-right” bears at least equal blame in turning the country into a hellhole.
The details of the “right-wing” violence are far less comprehensive or even comprehensible. One entry in the report reads that in Mesquite, Texas, in 2001, a “White Supremacist member of Aryan Brotherhood killed a man.”
Okay, but what was the man’s race? The odds are that he was white, given the extremely low number of interracial homicides. Other entries lack the same information. Another one tells of a “White supremacist [who] shot and killed 9 at his community college.” That one is a reference to 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, who shot up Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, but he wasn’t targeting minorities. Witnesses said he was targeting a specific religion, asking his victims if they were Christians before pulling the trigger on those who said yes.
The next several days will be yet another attempt by the national media to shake the country into believing that white supremacists and the “far-right” are on a violent rampage. The purpose, naturally, is to link it all to President Trump, who as we're reminded day in and day out, is supposedly a racist himself.
It wasn’t true before and it’s not true now, even after El Paso.

8chan down after El Paso mass shooting — for now

Texto completo: After several hours of downtime, 8chan, the online message board that appears to have been used by the suspect in the El Paso mass shooting to post an anti-immigrant manifesto, was again accessible for a few hours Monday, then back down again.
“8chan is coming back online around the world,” a message on the site read as of 10 a.m. Pacific time. “Shout out to our team working hard in the background to restore services.”
Sunday night, 8chan said on its Twitter account that it would be down for the next 24 to 48 hours after Cloudflare dropped it as a customer. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides support against denial-of-service attacks on websites, so its move opened up 8chan to attacks that could take the site offline.
Calling 8chan a “cesspool of hate,” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in a blog post: “The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths.”
The suspect in Saturday’s El Paso shooting that killed 22 people and injured more than 20 others, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, is believed to have posted on 8chan a screed titled “The Inconvenient Truth,” in which he rails against immigrants and said the rampage was meant as a response to an “invasion” of Hispanics into Texas. The writing praises the suspect in another mass shooting who posted an anti-Muslim manifesto on 8chan: the man who carried out the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March, which killed 51 people.
The suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting in April, in which one person died and three people were injured, is also believed to have posted a manifesto on 8chan in which he complained about Jewish people.
“What these killers want to do is inspire the next, and 8chan is the place to do that,” said Oren Segal, director of the Center on Extremism at ADL, in an interview Monday.
Segal said he wasn’t surprised that 8chan was back up, and that it would be tough to keep it or similar platforms offline for long. He cited the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, and Gab, a far-right social network, as examples of extremist sites that have persisted online despite running into technical obstacles.
“The reality is that there is a market for this hate and extremism online,” he said.
Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, said as much in his blog post: “While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online.”
There were reports that 8chan — which spun out of 4chan after that online message board was deemed to infringe on free speech in the wake of the sexist Gamergate controversy a few years ago — has already switched to a new domain name registrar, and a new host for its site. Epik, which is also known to host Gab, was 8chan’s new host. After public pressure from people such as Alex Stamos, adjunct professor at Stanford University and former Facebook security chief, the company that leased servers to Epik cut it off.
That company, Voxility, said Monday on Twitter in response to Stamos and others who announced its ties to Epik: “We are all in the same team here! Thank you for the support and for the notes. The 3rd party hoster is blocked completely.”
Fredrick Brennan, creator of 8chan, told media outlets including the New York Times that he stopped working with 8chan’s current owner last year.
“Shut the site down,” Brennan told the Times. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it.”
Brennan told the Washington Post that 8chan’s owner, Jim Watkins, makes little money from the site. Watkins, a U.S. military veteran and web entrepreneur who now lives in the Philippines, would not comment to the Washington Post.
In a press conference Monday, President Donald Trump, whose racist rhetoric is being blamed for inciting violence against immigrants, said, “We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored.”
Trump has repeatedly spoken of immigrants “invading” the United States.
“According to Facebook’s ad archive, Trump has run around 2,200 FB ads since May 2018 mentioning the word ‘invasion’,” tweeted Natalie Martinez, researcher for Media Matters for America. “Scrolling through, all of them seem to be about immigration.”

Texto completo: Growing up in Pasadena, I knew Manuel Real's name, given his heroic role in the desegregation case. So it was a shock when, as an L.A. Times journalist, I covered hearings in his courtroom. I have never seen a judge as tyrannical as Real.
Let's not rejoice at Manuel Real's death. But his passing offers some good news: California's most troublesome federal judge is off the bench. While federal judges are appointed for life, the fact that it required death to retire Real is a scandal that survives him. The 53-year career of Real — the nation's longest-serving active judge — offers ugly lessons about character, impunity, and the impotence of our leaders.
If those first two paragraphs seem harsh, it may because you read the ludicrously glowing obituaries following Real's death this summer. The New York Times, L.A. Times, Associated Press and legal publications portrayed his career as that of a judicial giant. Appointed to the bench by LBJ in 1966, Real courageously ordered the desegregation of the Pasadena schools in the early 1970s, and blocked President Trump's efforts to strip funds from police departments that don't cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.
"A towering legal figure," the L.A. Times called him. Stories approvingly quoted a statement from Central District of California Chief Judge Virginia A. Phillips calling Real the court's "heart and soul" and adding: "His legacy of public service is an inspiration beyond compare."
Real's record is incomparable, but let's pray it's not an inspiration.
What the obituaries missed was Real's routinely awful treatment of people in his courtroom, and a decision-making style so rushed and lawless that he was routinely reversed by higher courts. In 2006, Congress even held a hearing about impeaching him.
Growing up in Pasadena, I knew Real's name, given his heroic role in the desegregation case. So it was a shock when, as an L.A. Times journalist, I covered hearings in his courtroom. I have never seen a judge as tyrannical as Real.
Real sometimes justified his behavior in the name of efficiency. But his behavior encouraged disrespect for the law. He prevented jurors from taking notes or having courtroom testimony read back to them. He often yelled or cut off questioning of witnesses in nonsensical ways. When challenged, he repeated a bizarre mantra: "Counsel, this is not Burger King! In this courtroom, we do it my way!" Real "created a courtroom of terror," attorney Victor Sherman once told the L.A. Times.
That Real was a menace was no secret, but no one could knock him off the bench. Not colleagues who saw his difficult tenure as the central district's chief judge. Not the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judges who reversed him at record-high rates (in two-thirds of major cases, according to one analysis) and repeatedly removed him from cases during which he ignored their orders and violated basic procedures. He even survived mismanaging the assets of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos in one case.
Real wasn't even kicked the bench after his lawless 2000 takeover of a bankruptcy case involving a woman whose probation he personally oversaw. A U.S. Supreme Court commission would later cite Real as exemplifying an unaccountable judge. But federal judges police their own, and Real escaped that episode with a reprimand. Appallingly, in his later years, other judges honored him.
Real was unrepentant. In one of several LA Times stories about his misconduct, Real said: "The best thing about being a judge is the nature of the service you think you're rendering. The worst thing, probably, is the inability to come down off the bench and punch somebody in the nose."
So why did Manuel Real get the generous judgment in death that he denied others in court?
One reason is the human reluctance to criticize the deceased. Real also could be charming and public-spirited outside court; a school is named for him in Riverside County, where he helped establish a school district.
But there are other, more troubling explanations. First, in these politicized times, we have the bad habit of conflating ideology — Real was a liberal — with character. Second, the American system provides no practical way to remove people who violate norms and abuse power, be they federal judges or — as today's news demonstrates — president of the United States.
Even after his death, those who know better won't challenge Real. If you're expecting judges to protect us from tyrants, you'll be disappointed.

Texto completo: Can you believe Christmas is right around the corner? It seems like we were just celebrating the Fourth of July, and now it's time for another Christmas season.
Okay, don't get mad and protest that I'm bringing up Christmas too early. Even though the actual holiday is still five months away, it's not too early to budget for it.
One of the most frequent stressors I hear about during the holiday season is overspending. So many people have the best intentions — and they want to give to as many people as possible — but those good intentions often come with a lot of bills in January.
If you're worried about overspending this Christmas, the fix is to do a Christmas budget. Here's how you make a very simple zero-based Christmas budget:
Step 1: Decide how much you can spend on Christmas gifts
I'm not talking about throwing Christmas parties or decorating your house. This is just about gifts.
Last year, 33 percent of Americans planned to spend $1,000 on Christmas gifts. Now, depending on your family and money situation, that might be a lot or not nearly enough. But chances are you don't have that kind of cash just lying around in your bank account, which is why you'll want to start putting a little bit aside each month starting now.
For example, let's take that number and reduce it a little. Let's say you budget $600 for Christmas gifts. That's the total amount of money you plan on spending on your family and friends this holiday season. If you start saving for that this month, you'll need to set aside $120 per month. That's if you do all your shopping in December.
Step 2: List the people you want to buy for, and how much you plan to spend on each
Your Christmas budget might look like this:
Kid One: $135
Kid Two: $135
Spouse: $50
Mom: $50
Dad: $50
In-Laws: $100
Sister: $30
Friend: $30
Office Secret Santa: $20
Step 3: Subtract all those numbers from the total amount you've budgeted for gifts
If you end up with zero, then you've perfected a zero-based Christmas budget!
Every dollar you'll spend is attached to someone's name, just like categories in a normal budget. It's that simple, and all you really need is a sheet of paper. If you prefer a digital budget, check out EveryDollar. It's the budgeting app I use.
Don't get too caught up in the specifics of this example. Your situation might be totally different. The main thing is being intentional, proactive, and precise with your spending. And when December comes around, your Christmas shopping experience will be much more merry and bright. You'll be checking everyone off your budget list, instead of spending first and worrying about the consequences later.
Merry Christmas in July, and happy budgeting.

Consumers will feel Trump's latest tariffs

Texto completo: President Donald Trump announced another wave of China tariffs last week, essentially saying he would impose a tax on nearly all $540 billion in Chinese goods that come into the United States in a year. And this batch could really bite.
The administration carefully tailored previous rounds of tariffs to pinch businesses in ways that most Americans might not notice. But the 10% levy on $300 billion of imports that Trump announced Thursday, which would take effect Sept. 1, is expected to hit consumers where it hurts. From Apple's iPhones to school supplies, a broad swath of everyday products are about to get more expensive.
The latest move is likely to prompt companies to submit exclusion requests to be spared from the tariffs, cause the Federal Reserve to rethink its plans for interest rates and inspire fresh retaliation from China that could compound Americans' economic pain.
Here's what to expect.
Scramble for exclusions
Until Sept. 1, the focus will be on the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for a final list of the Chinese products subject to the new tariffs. The items will come from a 76-page list published in the Federal Register in May after Trump said that he wanted to have more potential tariffs in his quiver if the trade dispute dragged on.
Not every item on the May list will necessarily face tariffs. The trade representative's office held a week of hearings about the proposed duties and has received comments from businesses around the country hoping for exemptions.
If the tariffs do take effect Sept. 1, companies will have an opportunity to apply for exemptions. In previous instances, those seeking waivers had to explain why the tariffs would cause them "severe economic harm," whether the product at issue or a comparable one was unavailable outside China and whether the item was "strategically important" to China's industrial policy.
Slump at retailers' registers
Earlier rounds of tariffs mostly focused on industrial goods, but the 10% levy announced Thursday is directed squarely at consumer items like clothes, toys and footwear.
That is bad news for, among others, shoemakers and the stores that sell their products, said Matt Priest, chief executive of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. Less than 1% of shoes are made domestically, and China is the source of 70% of the goods imported into the United States.
"We're very concerned this will be a long-term cost baked into what consumers will pay," Priest said, adding that he was not expecting exclusions to be made for footwear.
"Nearly every type of shoe is made in China, so there will be impact across the board," he said. The only exceptions are some high-end leather shoes that are made in Europe.
With some consumer products, the supply comes almost entirely from China, said David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation. He cited umbrellas, electric blankets and toys.
"Trump is feeling very muscular right now," French said. "But the next round of tariffs will hit the president's base particularly hard. The people who voted for him in 2016 felt economically vulnerable. The tariffs will cause job losses and higher prices for everybody but especially his base."
A bite out of Apple
The most prominent U.S. company bracing for the tariffs is Apple, which typically unveils new products every September.
In a letter in June, Apple urged Robert Lighthizer, Trump's top trade adviser, not to proceed with any new tariffs. The company warned that such tariffs would hamper its global competitiveness and reduce its contribution to the U.S. economy. Apple also said that new tariffs would tilt the playing field in favor of its global rivals.
Thus far, Trump has shown little sympathy for Apple. Last month, after the company filed 15 tariff-exclusion requests, he said that they would be denied and that the company should make its products in the United States.
Should the new tariffs take effect on Sept. 1, they will hit Apple's phones, watches, MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, AppleTV, keyboards and batteries. The company's shares fell more than 2% Thursday after Trump said the new tariffs were coming.
Will China hit back?
Throughout the trade conflict, Beijing has demonstrated a willingness to respond to the Trump administration's tariffs as proportionately as possible.
On Friday, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, said that "adding tariffs is definitely not the correct way to resolve economic and trade frictions." U.S. officials were waiting to see how China planned to retaliate.
The trade imbalance between the two countries leaves China with limited options for imposing additional tariffs on imports from the United States. Beijing could introduce different kinds of barriers, including surprise inspections, license rejections for U.S. companies or a broadening of China's "unreliable entities" list.
Analysts have also suggested that China could consider curbing exports of so-called rare-earth minerals to the United States, reinstate a tariff on U.S. cars or continue to shun soybeans from U.S. farmers.
Throughout the yearlong dispute, China and the United States have continued to talk through their disagreements. China's next move may be to give the silent treatment a try.
Will the Fed cut Trump more slack?
The Fed was already laser-focused on the trade war before Trump's latest tariff announcement. Officials lowered interest rates last week for the first time in more than a decade, partly because of the uncertainty stoked by the tariffs and the risk that they pose to the economic outlook.
Fed officials do not believe that the tariffs already in place have by themselves hurt growth significantly. But policymakers worry that the extended fight is causing businesses to hold back on investment, which could ultimately hurt the broader economy.
Trump's choice to escalate the fight with China puts Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, and his colleagues in a difficult position. Their job is to keep the economy operating at an even keel. But by lowering rates, which can help keep growth steady and buttress the stock market, the Fed may inadverlently give Trump the cover he needs to pursue his trade spats.
Powell has often said the Fed would keep its focus on its two statutory responsibilities: sustaning maximum employment and stable inflation.
On the latter point, tariffs offer the Fed a surprise silver lining. They could drive inflation higher if companies raise prices on imported goods. The central bank has tried to coax prices up to, or even slightly above, its 2% inflation target - a goal it has undershot for years. Officials might seize on an opportunity to prove that they are ready to accept hotter price gains.

Epstein became lost in his own perversely tragic fantasy

Texto completo: The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles an evil comic book character for the developmentally arrested intellectual — the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.
Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the financier/convicted sex offender/philanthropist — and now accused sex trafficker — is also a "transhumanist," who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch, named "Zorro."
Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed that ought to be replicated.
The carriers of Epstein’s apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn’t be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers. Instead, according to the Times’ reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.
For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein’s very special black book, according to the Times.
One can only imagine the conversations at such soirees: So, Penelope, what do you think of transhumanism? Oh, you do? And how do you like the desert air?
The male invitees weren’t your run-of-the-mill scientists but were some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia. Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an "intellectual impostor." Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks. To the layman’s eye, such behavior suggests a purposeful deflection when the topic at hand is reaching a point beyond the speaker’s comfort range.
Others on Epstein’s guest lists apparently were seduced by his charm and intellect, as well as his wealth, which he reportedly dangled as bait for funding-starved researchers. He was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes, including the Clinton Foundation. But he wasn’t convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.
Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering at Harvard, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary. Gods don’t like to be contradicted, and Pinker was thereafter told he’d been "voted off the island" and banished from future gatherings.
Speaking of which, Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean — which he dubs "Little St. Jeff’s" — is of renewed interest thanks to an NBC News report last week. Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall, according to permit records.
What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh’s headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein’s remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen. Also a fan of cryogenics, believing that frozen human parts and bodies could be resurrected in the future, Epstein is no ordinary bloke. Indeed, he is a perversely tragic figure.
Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable. Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind and image, he forgot that he was merely mortal and may have flown too close to the sun. Confined now to a jail cell (with further punishment perhaps to come) — and removed from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries who suffused his ego with admiration — his suffering must be immense.
And so richly deserved.

Texto completo: My memory flickers a bit dark these days, but clear as a starry night it awakens to Mick dancing in stutter steps across the stage at the Assembly Hall in Champaign, snapping the end of a long crimson scarf behind him with brash flicks of an audacious wrist.
Vivid in my mind, as if it were yesterday, not the half century ago that it was — Nov. 15, 1969, three weeks before Altamont.
The Stones opened with "Jumpin’ Jack Flash." It was a gas, gas, gas.
Such exhilaration, Jagger and the Stones in their prime, soaking them in with a breathtaking sense of bottomless youth. We thought we were going to live the rest of our lives with beaded curtains and bean bag chairs. Far out and outta sight.
I don’t remember what I paid for the tickets. A vintage article from The New York Times serves as a reminder: prices for that Rolling Stones’ tour went for $3 to $8. For perspective, a loaf of bread cost 23 cents, according to mprime.com; a gallon of gas, 32 cents. The Dow ended the year at 839.
My, my, my, my, my. Though the Stones somehow persist, a lot has changed in 50 years.
A while ago, I drove down the street where I grew up. It had been part of a new subdivision when we moved in, shadeless saplings popping almost imperceptibly out of the parkway. Now, they are mighty trees overhanging the street like leafy umbrellas.
A year ago, much was made of 1968 as a benchmark, a time of paisley, protest, turmoil and assassination — the coming of age, presumably, for the Baby Boomer generation.
But for my money, I’ll take 1969.
As with any year, it wasn’t all pretty. The Vietnam War polarized the country. Hearts were stunned or broken by Charles Manson, Chappaquiddick, the Days of Rage, the passings of Everett Dirksen and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the police raid that killed Black Panthers Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in their sleep, the violence at the Altamont Music Festival.
And for Cubs fans, alas, there were the Miracle Mets.
Despite those traumas, what we remember most of 1969 was the wonder, the hope and promise.
Near the top of the charts was "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In," the Fifth Dimension imagining, "... Then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars. This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius."
At the outdoors that year, we took in Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson, "Easy Rider" leading the pack at the box office. At the theaters, too, we could get anything we wanted at "Alice’s Restaurant."
With inspiring eloquence, Maya Angelou touched us with "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," her biography of pain, racism and resilience: "The caged bird sings with a fearful trill, of things unknown, but longed for still, and his tune is heard on the distant hill, for the caged bird sings of freedom."
That was the July we gathered around our television sets to watch, breathlessly, in black and white, humanity reach the moon.
"That’s one small step for man," Neil Armstrong said in words no witness will forget, "one giant leap for mankind."
With that surreal step — coming less than a decade from when it had been vowed — we understood that there are no limits to what we can accomplish.
"No dream," Armstrong’s fellow moon walker Buzz Aldrin later wrote, "is too high."
"For one priceless moment in the whole history of man," Richard Nixon told Armstrong and Aldrin in a phone call to the moon, "all the people on the earth are truly one."
Woodstock took place in August on a farm in Bethel, New York, three days of love that came to define a generation.
It was a concert that drew hundreds of thousands with the lure of peace and music, some of the greatest bands to ever play, no small amount of marijuana and hallucinogens.
A documentary movie by the same name played a large role in cementing the festival’s place in history. As it makes clear, the gathering was one filled with good intentions and, in retrospect, a good bit of naivetÃ© as well.
"Over the years, Woodstock got glorified and romanticized and became the event that symbolized Utopia," Academy Award-winning director Ang Lee said in interviews to promote his movie "Taking Woodstock" in 2009. "It’s the last page of our collective memory of the age of innocence."
Our generation was going to change the world.
In many important ways, we did. Just think of the enormous social, medical and technological advances since 1969, how much stronger our understanding of the universe has grown.
But we didn’t change the world in the fundamental ways we believed we would.
We still have war. Hunger and hatred have not been eradicated. Aquarius remains far from reach.
Too little harmony and understanding. No sympathy and trust abounding.
We relish the images, the memories and the exhilarating nostalgia of 1969.
But clear as a starry night, there still is work ahead — no matter what generation may claim it.
As Mick Jagger told the Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s in 2001: "The past is a great place and I don’t want to erase or to regret it, but I don’t want to be its prisoner, either."

Texto completo: El heroísmo de un guardia de seguridad evitó que la masacre de Dayton, Ohio, el domingo en la madrugada tuviera un mayor número de muertos.
James Williams, dueño de una pizzería vecina al bar Ned Peppers , donde ocurrió la tragedia, dijo al New York Times que en la escena se conoció que el guardia de seguridad evitó que el pistolero ingresara al club. La acción evitó un escenario como el del club Pulse en Orlando ya que la pista de baile del bar es lo primero que se ve al entrar.
El guardia sufrió lesiones por esquirlas, pero se recupera satisfactoriamente. Nueve personas murieron y 16 fueron heridas.
We need to thank the heroics of the bouncer at the door of @nedpeppersbar.
From what I'm bring told, he stopped Connor Betts from entering the bar enabling Dayton Police to drop him.
The unamed bouncer recieved injuries from shrapnel and was taken to hospital#DaytonShooting

Williams y otros hombres acudieron a la escena cuando dejaron de sonar los disparos. El comerciante dijo que era como una escena de la Segunda Guerra Mundial , con cuerpos desangrando a lado y lado. Su cinturón sirvió de torniquete.
El tirador fue identificado como Connor Betts, de 24 años. El sujeto habría disparado con un fusil de asalto ya que la munición era calibre .223 y su ataque ocurrió en un minuto.
Fue la segunda masacre en menos de 24 horas en el país. El sábado un individuo mató a 20 personas en un Walmart de El Paso, Texas.

Keep eyes open for marijuana stock scams

Texto completo: Question: Tracy and Mark from Kenton County: We were recently told we could get in on a specific marijuana stock before others could. We were also told we would probably double our money. With legalization catching on, should we give it a go?
A: Our answer is not going to focus on the legitimacy of marijuana as an investment (that's another column for another time). Instead, we want to warn you about a few parts of your question that have us a little concerned you may be falling for an investment scam.
There have always been "hot" investments – think gold or, more recently, cryptocurrency. Now it's marijuana's turn to grab the spotlight. And all this attention is making it all too easy for scammers to easily promote their illegitimate schemes.
They play to your FOMO (fear of missing out), and also to the part of you that's greedy (who wouldn't want to make a ton of money?).
In your case, it sounds like they're taking the angle of exclusivity. The fact they're guaranteeing you a return is also a major red flag. You should never feel pressure to invest in anything or with anyone. Period.
And keep this in mind: Marijuana-related scams are so prevalent now that the Securities and Exchange Commission recently issued a warning to investors. The alert reminds everyone to watch out for unsolicited "opportunities," market manipulation and even false press releases.
The Simply Money Point: You need to understand all risks involved when investing in something, no matter if it's a certificate of deposit or a marijuana stock. Do your research, and if you're handing your money over to someone, check them out at BrokerCheck.org – you'll thank yourself later.
Q: Joel in Wyoming: I heard of something called an ABLE account that's for people with disabilities. Is this a legitimate type of account? My granddaughter has a learning disability and I was thinking of opening up an account for her.
A: Yes, an ABLE account is very much legitimate! This is a tax-advantaged, state-based account created to help those with disabilities save for the future without hurting their eligibility for federal benefits. This type of account is fairly new onto the scene: Congress signed the ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) Act five years ago, and the account debuted just three years ago. They're so new, in fact, that only a fraction of the number of people who qualify for the account are actually saving in one. The New York Times reports more than 40,000 ABLE accounts had been opened by the end of March – but as many as 8 million people could qualify, according to some estimates.
In Ohio, the account is called a STABLE ("State Treasury Achieving a Better Life Experience") account. To qualify, an individual must have developed his/her disability before the age of 26 and must have lived with their disability for more than a year, or expect it to last for at least a year. There are also additional criteria involving Social Security benefits. There is an account maintenance fee of $2.50 a month. You can learn more by going online to stableaccount.com/faq.
It's important to note that unless you are your granddaughter's legal guardian, you will not be able to open an account for her. However, you can contribute to her account. There's an annual contribution limit of $15,000 from any person or source.
Kentucky also has a STABLE account, and Indiana's is called an NvestABLE account.
The Simply Money Point: is that An ABLE account is a fantastic way for those with disabilities to save for future expenses without hurting their government-assisted benefits. Have your granddaughter's parents or guardian look into opening one for her.

American peerage on display in extraordinary saga of wealth

Texto completo: Janny Scott's saga "The Beneficiary" scrutinizes prosperity, privilege, and pathos.
Scott's family is Philadelphia Main Line nobility, enjoying fortunes derived from finance and railroads. Great-great-grandfather Thomas Scott was President of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Great-grandfather Colonel Robert Montgomery was the great-grandson of a man who "invested in property in New Orleans, the value of which had skyrocketed after the Louisiana Purchase." The Colonel's financial acumen replenished the Montgomery fortune, which was waning by the time of his birth.
The Colonel built a baronial home, Ardrossan, and tied subsequent generations to it, through trusts and through imposing homes on the estate, available to family members at low cost. The Colonel thought that his intentions would cement cohesion instead of causing claustrophobia and creating dysfunctional heirs alongside others who could not escape quickly enough.
The extended family's wrestling with its legacy elicits laughs alongside sympathy for the pain occasioned by their constrained circumstances. Tropes of enduring Southern literature and drama endlessly evidence themselves: Aristocratic airs abound. Drinking and suicide surface. War dead intrude. William Faulkner and Tennessee Williams composed no more compelling narrative.
The family possesses the requisite family plantation, in South Carolina, for hunting, as well as a Belle Époque Summer "Cottage" in Bar Harbor, Maine. Novelists and playwrights have failed to realize such a treasure of rich material, not that no one has tried:
Philip Barry supposedly modeled Tracy Lord in "The Philadelphia Story" upon Scott's grandmother Helen Hope Montgomery Scott—played by Katharine Hepburn onscreen. The shadow side of the inheritance bequeathed suggests Mary Tyrone—portrayed by Hepburn—in Eugene O'Neill's "A Long Day's Journey Into Night." Other films in which class and caste create continuity include "Giant", "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof", "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?"—again featuring Hepburn—and "Crazy, Rich Asians".
F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous 1926 story "The Rich Boy" identified our fascination with the wealthy this way:
"Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves."
The reality is that wealth insulates only from consequences and deprivation and not from the trauma and travails of human existence. Largesse sometimes creates unreality, suggesting mistaken envy of what might entail greater cost than benefit.
Scott's story is riveting, because the shortcomings shown are actual human tragedy, rather than the invention of fiction. The cognoscenti who enthusiastically read "The Beneficiary" cannot sufficiently praise Scott for evaluating her extended family's exaggerated enthusiasms and eccentricities. Scott's years reporting for The New York Times allow for skillful dissection of details which might otherwise have been imponderable.
Much has been made of the demise of venerable English Manor Houses after World War II. Discussion of money, breeding, and blood in the United States—paralleling Debrett's Peerage in England—is more taboo than sex, given the country's refusal to reference economic inequality, historically. Scott's comfort in considering how Robber Barons' estates, fortunes, and families fared could be her signature achievement.
Anachronism is arguably the most authentically Southern Gothic element in "The Beneficiary": A family retainer recalled the family estate as "... the craziest place... Because there were so many people doing nothing. They kept a culture alive when it should have been dead and gone." Scott's father said of his mother, "She was 'trying to keep something so anachronistic alive because it was so beautiful.... She was treasuring something that was going, gone.'"

Texto completo: Each year like clockwork, my therapist leaves the city for three weeks and unlike clockwork, my life becomes that bit messier, a bit trickier to predict. As July comes to a close, the dread begins.
I worry that without my 45 straight minutes of blabbing each Friday, the bolts in my life will loosen and I'll come shuddering to a complete halt, blocking the tracks for everyone behind me. That kind of thinking is called "catastrophizing" and, not to boast, my therapist says I'm actually really good at it. Rationally, I'm sure I will be fine this month. I'll keep trudging on just as I did before I was lucky enough to get health insurance and the money for a co-pay. But it's a wobbly kind of month.
I find some comfort in knowing I'm not alone in being left alone. Lots of New Yorkers lose their therapists in this most grotesque of all the summer months. Perhaps all of the therapists travel together in a calm herd. Maybe they swim, silently gliding through the water, managing to stay in their lanes even in the ocean.
Once, my friend Abi confided in me that she wonders about her therapist's life and situation, and asked if I did the same about mine: "I mean, aren't you dying to know who she is? To find out anything at all about her?" I answered honestly that no, I'm not. I understand that my therapist is not a bot activated only by my presence, but her life is not really any of my business.
I'm telling you, in therapy I'm like the self-absorbed, peevish little boy in "The Secret Garden," fretful and whiny. My therapist is that big strong girl who wheels him around in a barrow and shows him the flowers. Besides, her office is the only place where the person I'm talking to isn't dying to jump in as soon as I stop for breath.
Now, if you do happen to know me and you're worried that I'm talking about you, well, look at that, you made it about you again.
That said, I've accidentally gleaned a couple of scraps of information about my therapist over the past four years: She both reads and watches the "Outlander" series, and her mother became a fashion model later in life. Should I wish to follow her, are those enough clues as to where she might vacation? The Scottish Highlands, or through time? Perhaps wherever stylish elderly people go, like that part of the Met way uptown. I don't know. I just know I'm on my own.
In order to navigate my own melancholy cliffs, flecked through with flints of anxiety, I've come up with a plan. First, I will talk to and listen to others. I've been practicing this. Just the other day, I chatted to the letter carrier, the traditional victim of the lonely, for almost a full minute. I told him I suspected there was either a rat in the building or a large army of roaches that moved together as one, shaped like a rat. He smiled along credibly enough before I saw that he was wearing those little earbuds with no wires.
My second line of defense is to avoid living in my head, since it's bound to be chaotic up there. I will instead live in my body, however overheated it gets. And if I really miss my therapist's concerned and kind eyes trained on my face, I'll simply sing along with the "Moana" soundtrack really loudly and my dog will fix me with the same expression.
I'm not going anywhere this month. As I explained to my therapist, some of us have to work. That statement was followed by a quick discussion of how well I'm unlearning my passive-aggressive style of communicating. In truth, I'm staying because want to see what will happen next.
After the heat waves and floods and blackouts, I am grimly determined to learn what horror will befall those of us who remain. A citywide shortage of cava? A mayor who continues to keep his eyes off the prize? An infestation of those horrible little scooters people use in Los Angeles?
"New York," I sigh up at the thundery sky. If you can make it here, particularly in August without a therapist, then you truly can make it anywhere. But if I can make it anywhere, then shouldn't I leave here at once?
Then, before I make any big decisions, I remember everything I've learned in therapy. All of that insight I've worked to illuminate, that won't go back to black. In the end, didn't the fresh air and midnight talks revive that weak little boy in the book? Yes. Surely I can hang on for another few weeks. And if I can, we all can.

Texto completo: With 66 weeks to go until the election, the Democrats tasked with saving a sinking ship of state have shown that they would rather drown in a sea of self-righteousness than steer the Donald Trump-rotted hulk to a fresh shore.
You know the presidential debates this week were a disaster for Democrats because Republican attack ads are already parroting the lines used by the leading candidates: Take away people's private health care, decriminalize the border, socialism!
And rather than effectively prosecute the easy case against the worst president ever, the Democrats went after one of the best: Barack Obama. This is a winning strategy only in a world where everyone gets a trophy, which is to say, much of the younger Democratic base.
Debates are supposed to refine and reduce a party's message. The unwinnable and unpopular are shown to be just that. Crazy falls away. Good ideas rise. A story emerges. A governing strategy is presented.
In savaging one another, all but a handful of the 20 Democrats on display this week ignored one of the best things the party has going for it: Trump is actively trying to take away health care from millions. His administration is litigating to kill all of Obamacare, which would gut cherished protections for preexisting conditions. The Democrats crushed the 2018 election on a message to save this enduring part of Obama's greatest legacy.
But progressive Democrats have replaced that winning message with a losing message of their own: eliminating the private health insurance of more than 150 million Americans. This is how Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders expect to win.
Perhaps in a world where Mitch McConnell would let a modern idea see a vote on the floor of the Senate, replacing all private health insurance with a government-run system would be worthy of vigorous debate. And maybe it's a debate the Democrats could even win. But as of now, it's wildly unpopular.
As Sen. Amy Klobuchar said, "We are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election." To which Warren has replied that someone should not go through all the trouble of running for president without big ideas. True. But nor should someone go through all the trouble of running for president and not have the right ideas needed to win.
Sanders, as wild-eyed, scowling and angry as an Old Testament prophet on the downside of the prediction racket, is a sloganeer. Like all sloganeers, he has simplistic ideas; they sound best when shouted through a bullhorn. He should run for president of the socialist party of his choosing, and leave the Democrats to fight for the American majority.
Two things are going on in a debate: There are the personal clashes, atmospherics and zingers, always the focus of the pundit class, which views politics as theater, and then there are the statements and projections of policy, which voters pay attention to. Warren may be the best debate athlete, but she's promoting unwinnable positions on health care, open borders and how to pay for all the trillion-dollar things she wants to make free.
Meanwhile, Obama, of all people, is now a target for cannibalistic candidates from the left. No Democrat is more popular. A Pew survey last year found that more people named him the greatest president of their lifetime than any other. He wasn't attacked directly by name this week, but his policies - the audacity of common sense - were.
"If you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back," said Joe Biden, espousing a position mocked by many Democrats. "It's a crime." This was Obama's position. Trump has taken it to a cruel and catastrophic new level, separating families and keeping children in cages. But because enough Democrats want to decriminalize border crossings, Trump can still get the edge on this issue.
The Beltway magpies projected a Biden collapse after the first debate. A month later, he still leads the field by a healthy margin. As long as Biden keeps defending the best of Obama's legacy, he will continue as the Democrat most likely to rid the world of Donald Trump.
But he may still falter on acuity and focus. And by rattling off a number at the end of the debate that sounded as if he were giving out his personal PIN code, Biden clearly had a senior moment.
That leaves room for Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The youngest candidate in the field shows the most wisdom of the ages. He's bright, articulate and forceful and projects a toughened American optimism. When he shamed Republicans for refusing to stand up to Trump, he showed that he's one of the few candidates rising to history's call - hearing the same clarion that guided Barack Obama.

Williamson knows how to beat Trump

Texto completo: If only 
If only Donald Trump were not president, we could have an interesting debate over whether private health insurance should be illegal. If only Trump were not president, we could have an interesting debate over who was softest on crime in the 1990s. If only Trump were not president, we could have a nice argument about the pros and cons of NAFTA.
But Trump is president, and this election is not about those things. This election is about who we are as a people, our national character. This election is about the moral atmosphere in which we raise our children.
Trump is a cultural revolutionary, not a policy revolutionary. He operates and is subtly changing America at a much deeper level. He's operating at the level of dominance and submission, at the level of the person where fear stalks and contempt emerges.
He's redefining what you can say and how a leader can act. He's reasserting an old version of what sort of masculinity deserves to be followed and obeyed. In Freudian terms, he's operating on the level of the id. In Thomistic terms, he is instigating a degradation of America's soul.
We are all subtly corrupted while this guy is our leader. And throughout this campaign he will make himself and his values the center of conversation. Every day he will stage a little drama that is meant to redefine who we are, what values we lift up and who we hate.
The Democrats have not risen to the largeness of this moment. They don't know how to speak on this level. They don't even have the language to articulate what Trump represents and what needs to be done.
Part of the problem is that the two leading Democratic idea generators are both materialistic wonks. Elizabeth Warren is a social scientist from Harvard Law School who has a plan for everything - except the central subject of this election, which is cultural and moral. Bernie Sanders has been a dialectical materialist all his life and is incapable of adjusting his economics-dominated mindset.
They are what Michael Dukakis would be if he emerged in an era when the party had swung left. This model has always had appeal to a certain sort of well-educated Democrat.
The bigger problem is simply the culture of the Democratic Party. The modern version of the party emerged during the Great Depression to solve one problem: material want. It is a secular party, trapped in a Lockean prison: Politics should be separate from faith. Politics should be separate from soulcraft. Democrats believe they can win votes by offering members of different groups economic benefits and are perpetually shocked when they lose those voters.
It is no accident that the Democratic candidate with the best grasp of this election is the one running a spiritual crusade, not an economic redistribution effort. Many of her ideas are wackadoodle, but Marianne Williamson is right about this: "This is part of the dark underbelly of American society: the racism, the bigotry and the entire conversation that we're having here tonight. If you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I'm afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days."
And she is right about this: "We've never dealt with a figure like this in American history before. This man, our president, is not just a politician; he's a phenomenon. And an insider political game will not be able to defeat it.  The only thing that will defeat him is if we have a phenomenon of equal force, and that phenomenon is a moral uprising of the American people."
They are unready for it, but it falls on the Democrats to rebuild the moral infrastructure of our country. That does not mean standing up and saying, "Donald Trump is a racist!" 500 times a day. It means reminding Americans of the values we still share and the damage done when people are not held accountable for trampling on them. The values are pretty basic and can be simply expressed:
Unity: We're one people. Our leader represents all the people. He doesn't go around attacking whole cities and regions.
Honesty: We can't have deliberative democracy without respect for the truth. None of us want congenital liars in our homes or our workplaces.
Pluralism: Human difference makes life richer and more interesting. We treasure members of all races and faiths for what they bring to the mosaic.
Sympathy: We want to be around people with good hearts, who feel for those who are suffering, who are faithful friends, whose daily lives are marked by kindness.
Opportunity: We want all children to have an open field and a fair chance in the great race of life.
Trump has put himself on the wrong side of all these values. So Democrats, go ahead and promote your plans. But also lead an uprising of decency. There must be one Democrat who, in word and deed, can do that.

Did Biden win debate? Reactions are split

Texto completo: The reviews are in.
Some news organizations said Joe Biden won last night's debate while others say anything but.
Here's a roundup of what people thought about Biden's performance.
The New York Times Matt Flegenheimer and Katie Glueck, political reporters:
"Far from perfect, and rarely exactly steady, Mr. Biden nonetheless achieved at least some of the goals that seemed to elude him last time."
"He has still struggled to communicate a detailed affirmative blueprint of what his presidency might look like and has yet to face Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has fashioned herself as the candidate with a policy plan for every occasion, on a debate stage.
"And his first debate performance was so rocky, and so alarmed even close allies and advisers, that he did not have a high bar to clear Wednesday night."
Frank Bruni, opinion columnist:
"Biden hardly put the doubts about his sturdiness and stamina to rest. I so hoped and I so want to say otherwise, because I believe him to be a decent man, because he's talking more sense than many of his starry-eyed adversaries, because it may well be that among the voters who will decide this election in the places where President Trump plans to fight hardest, Biden is a better — or at least safer — bet than any of the other candidates getting more than 2 percent in national polls right now."
The Washington Post Aaron Blake, a senior politico reporter:
"It wasn't as bad as the first debate, but it wasn't good, either. Even more so than last time, Biden was getting it from all sides, with candidates often deflecting attacks on themselves into attacks on him. He fumbled his own campaign text message number in his closing statement. Maybe his worst moment came when de Blasio challenged him on the deportations under Obama. He asked repeatedly whether Biden counseled against those deportations. Eventually, Biden responded, 'I was vice president. I am not the president. I keep my recommendation to him in private.' Not exactly an endorsement of the president whose legacy Biden has bear-hugged. Booker responded: 'Mr. Vice President, you can't have it both ways.'"
Jennifer Rubin, opinion writer:
"There was no knockout blow in the highly anticipated matchup between Biden and Harris, but Biden turned in a solid performance, going a long way to silencing critics and reassuring supporters."
"Biden took incoming fire but was adept at defending his plans with specifics, be it on climate change or health care. He turned the table on Gillibrand who challenged his support for working women, reminding her that he raised children on his own after his first wife was killed."
The Wall Street Journal "In the early segments of the debate in Detroit, the former vice president stammered several times. But his performance, which grew stronger throughout the night, may help silence some questions about his viability as a potential nominee and chief foil of Mr. Trump."
"The former vice president appeared better prepared this time, armed with his own attacks on the records of both Mr. Booker, the former Newark mayor, and Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor in California, in their previous offices."
Politico "Yes: Joe Biden for the most part was crisper, more engaged and engaging, in Detroit on Wednesday night than he had been in Miami a month ago.
"No: He did not summon a performance so commanding as to demand people view an old man in new light ...
"Though he was closer to the upper range this time — except for a funny fumbled line at the end when he tried to tell people to support his campaign with a text message — it still seems inconceivable that many undecided voters will move to Biden because they think he is a reliably good debater. It seems fully conceivable that people already leaning toward him will stay that way because they think he is good enough."
USA Today Rebecca Morin, USA Today:
"The former vice president struggled to take the heat directed at him as the frontrunner in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary field.
"Despite having a strong start, Biden was hit from all sides by many of the other nine Democrats on stage Wednesday night.
"He was criticized for his stance on criminal justice, on which he was accused of flip-flopping. He also took incoming fire for past views on women and the economy and fumbled through his stance on immigration when challenged by both Castro and De Blasio, New York City's mayor.
"And Biden struggled at times with how to utilize and make sense of the legacy of former President Barack Obama."
Susan Page, Washington Bureau chief:
"Biden was the victim of a thousand cuts, reminded of a hard truth. He argues that he is the candidate best able to defeat President Trump in 2020, a Democrat who can appeal to working-class voters in Pennsylvania and Michigan. The problem is that nomination is not yet his to claim. First he has to defeat a crowded field of challengers, some of them a generation or two younger than he is and all of them willing to take him on."
Huffington Post "Overall, though, Biden delivered a solid performance to the relief of his supporters, who, coming into Wednesday's event, said they wanted to see a more aggressive posture in order to demonstrate to voters that the 76-year-old has what it takes to challenge President Donald Trump.
"Though his opponents landed solid blows, Biden left few of them unanswered. On health care, for example, the former vice president went on the offense early, aiming his fire at Harris and her 'Medicare for All' plan that includes a 10-year transition period."
Fox News "Former Vice President Joe Biden dominated the debate stage and weathered the attacks of nine opponents for the Democratic presidential nomination Wednesday night, emerging the clear winner and standing by his promise to not be 'overly polite.'"
"The former vice president delivered his message compellingly and convincingly. Even during his less strong moments, Biden remained the focal point of the conversation, speaking for over 21 minutes – more than any other candidate on stage."

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
ANOTHER COUNTRY: OUTSIDER VISIONS OF AMERICA at Film at Lincoln Center (Aug. 2-14). Taking inspiration from Alexis de Tocqueville and other visiting chroniclers of the United States, this series spotlights their cinematic equivalents. Sergio Corbucci's spaghetti western "The Great Silence" (on Friday and Saturday) and Lars von Trier's soundstage experiment "Dogville" (on Aug. 13) conjure an imaginary country from fragments of found Americana, while directors like Michelangelo Antonioni (in "Zabriskie Point," on Saturday and Sunday) and John Woo (in "Face/Off," on Aug. 14) essentially transplanted their European and Asian styles to Southern California. There are many less well-known titles in the series, too. One of the rarest, according to the theater, is "Angela Davis: Portrait of a Revolutionary" (on Tuesday and Aug. 12), which Yolande du Luart made while she was a student at U.C.L.A., where Davis was teaching at the time.

'JOAN THE MAID' at the Quad Cinema (opens on Aug. 2). Jacques Rivette followed his great "La Belle Noiseuse" (1991) -- a late-career summary of his ideas about the collaborative nature of art -- with material that was (for him) less typical, even though the same subject had served as the basis of films by Carl Theodor Dreyer, Robert Bresson and many other auteurs. Rivette tells the story of Joan of Arc (played by Sandrine Bonnaire) in two parts, "The Battles" and "The Prisons," each running more than two and a half hours. In his review for The New York Times, Lawrence Van Gelder called the film "an act of patriotism, scholarship and reverence." The diptych will screen in a new digital refurbishment. Each half charges separate admission, but you can see both for $ 20.

'OLD BOYFRIENDS' at the Metrograph (Aug. 2-8). Showing in a new 35-millimeter print, "Old Boyfriends" is a strange mix of sensibilities: It's the only theatrical feature directed by Joan Tewkesbury, the screenwriter of "Nashville," from a script by Paul Schrader ("Taxi Driver") and his brother, Leonard. It stars Talia Shire in a role utterly unlike any she had ever been associated with. Her character embarks on a possibly mad road-trip odyssey around the country to confront her old boyfriends (played by Richard Jordan and John Belushi), to settle scores and to get a sense of what might have been. Tewkesbury will be present for the 7 p.m. screening on Friday.

A REAL YOUNG GIRL: COMING OF AGE at Anthology Film Archives (Aug. 2-18). For all these portraits of adolescence, going back to the 1930s, women sat in the director's chair. The pre-Code comedy "Finishing School" (on Saturday and Aug. 8) stars Frances Dee as a newcomer to a boarding school and Ginger Rogers as her troublemaking friend. The mischief continues in "The Trouble With Angels" (on Saturday, Wednesday and Aug. 9), the last theatrical feature from Ida Lupino, in which Hayley Mills and June Harding continually break the rules set by their Catholic school (headed by Rosalind Russell). Religion and coming of age are further intertwined into the Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's oblique and experimental "The Holy Girl" (on Monday and Aug. 9 and 11), in which a teenage girl mistakes being violated by a doctor as a divine signal.

SEE IT BIG! 70MM at the Museum of the Moving Image (Aug. 1-Sept. 8). One of the most gratifying revival-house trends in recent years -- kicked off by the release of "The Master" in 2012 -- has been the renewed interest in 70-millimeter film projection. The increased image area of the format relative to 35 millimeter yields a picture of startling richness and detail. The museum's annual fat-celluloid series begins with the "unrestored" version of "2001: A Space Odyssey" (from Thursday to Sunday and on Aug. 10 and 11). Later in the summer, the theater will present all 20 reels of Kenneth Branagh's four-hour "Hamlet" (on Aug. 18, 24 and 25), as well as Douglas Trumbull's "Brainstorm" (on Aug. 25 and Sept. 6), which uses the large format to contrast the sequences that unfold inside characters' minds with their everyday lives.

Texto completo: Chris Stapleton wth Margo Price and Marcus King at Merriweather Post Pavilion, Aug. 11 Chris Stapleton's 2015 solo debut, "Traveller," shook up country music's pop proclivities with its back-to-basics sound and a breakout rendition of the standard "Tennessee Whiskey." The album racked up awards and made Stapleton one of the genre's most reliable draws: He's since been packing amphitheaters and arenas with his "All-American Roadshow" tours. This summer's show is worth getting there early for, with Margo Price and the Marcus King Band sharing opening duties. Price, who like Stapleton played in bands and dive bars before Jack White helped her release her big break, "Midwest Farmer's Daughter" in 2016, recently gave birth to a daughter and is already back on the road, playing her funked-up fusion of country and rock. The Marcus King Band is led by 23-year-old guitar phenom Marcus King, whose soulful Southern voice and impressive improv chops have made the band a fixture on the jam-band festival circuit. 7 p.m. $170. - Rudi Greenberg
African Diaspora International Film Festival , Aug. 9-11
For 13 years, the African Diaspora International Film Festival has treated audiences to invaluable new releases and repertory films that capture the vast cultural reach of work by and about people of African descent. This year, ADIFF returns to Washington with a lineup that includes films from Djibouti, Brazil, Barbados, Panama, France, Guadeloupe, Cuba, Morocco and the United States. The festival's opening-night film, "Ali's Comeback: The Untold Story," chronicles how the unlikely team of a white businessman, an African American senator and a Jewish mayor helped Muhammad Ali reclaim his career after being marginalized for resisting the Vietnam draft. Fifteen more narrative features and documentaries will play throughout the weekend. At George Washington University's Marvin Center, 800 21st St. NW. Tickets are $13; $11 for students; $10 for groups of 10 or more. Day passes $40-$50; festival pass $120. - Ann Hornaday
County fair season , Aug. 9-18
Summertime brings almost all the county fair kitsch your heart could desire. Start the season in Prince William County with Virginia's largest fair (Aug. 9-17), where the sprawling list of activities for all ages includes ranch camel and pony rides, a petting zoo and a circus. Be sure to catch the more destructive standards, such as chain-saw art, monster trucks and a demolition derby. For those same nine days, Montgomery County hosts its own fair, which features a similar slate of vehicles flinging themselves at each other, but ramps up the action to include ATV and truck drag racing. Don't miss the Chesapeake DockDogs from Aug. 9-11, which showcases pups face off in big-air and speed-retrieval competitions. If auto mayhem isn't your speed, set your sights on the Arlington County fair (Aug. 14-18), a more charming affair that draws massive crowds every year. There will be carnival games and fried food galore. And while a full schedule of programming will be announced closer to the day, one of this year's marquee events will be the addition of goat yoga. Prices vary by fair. - Hau Chu
'My Iran: Six Women Photographers' at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery , Aug. 10
The Iranian photographer Newsha Tavakolian has recently been barred by Iranian authorities from working in her home country - along with her husband, New York Times correspondent Thomas Erdbrink - according to the Times. Tavakolian, an acclaimed artist who began as a photojournalist and who has work in several major museum collections, is one of six artists showcased in a new group show at the Smithsonian's Sackler Gallery, along with Gohar Dashti, Shadi Ghadirian, Hengameh Golestan, Malekeh Nayiny and Mitra Tabrizian. (You may remember Tavakolian's work from the 2016 show, "She Who Tells a Story," at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, which also featured images by Dashti and Ghadirian.) From the political to the personal, the artists in "My Iran" look at the struggles of life inside their home country and in its diaspora. Through Feb. 9, 2020. Free. - Michael O'Sullivan
Summer Restaurant Week , Aug. 12-18
Combat the summer doldrums with a three-course meal out during the summer edition of Restaurant Week, a semiannual tradition during which diners can score deals at restaurants in the District, Maryland and Northern Virginia. This time around, more than 200 restaurants will offer prix fixe menus for lunch, brunch and dinner. If you're indecisive about which array of small plates to choose from the regular menu at such hot spots as chef Erik Bruner-Yang's standing-room-only Spoken English at the Line Hotel, let the streamlined Restaurant Week menu make the choice for you. Or try out a pricey spot such as Nobu D.C. without busting your dining budget. $35 for dinner; $22 for lunch or brunch. - Adele Chapin
Washington Spirit vs. Orlando Pride at Audi Field , Aug. 24
Two weeks after the U.S. National Team retained the Women's World Cup, the Washington Spirit recorded its first capacity crowd of the three-month-old National Women's Soccer League season. Was that because of the World Cup spurring a greater appreciation of women's soccer? The chance to welcome home World Cup winners Mallory Pugh and Rose Lavelle? Probably a bit of both. The Spirit have two games at the Maryland SoccerPlex in Boyds, Md., this month, but the most eye-catching fixture finds the team on a bigger stage: Audi Field. DC United's stadium is more centrally located, and more importantly, its capacity is several times larger than the SoccerPlex, meaning more fans will be able to watch Lavelle, Pugh and company take on the Orlando Pride, led by U.S. striker Alex Morgan and Brazilian legend Marta. 7:30 p.m. $31-$158. - Fritz Hahn
Vampire Weekend at Merriweather Post Pavilion , Aug. 29
Vampire Weekend fans waited a long five years between the band's 2014 opus "Modern Vampires of the City" and this year's "Father of the Bride." By the time the band's fourth album arrived in May, fans were also met with a different band, most notably one missing producer, multi-instrumentalist and D.C. native Rostam Batmanglij. While Batmanglij still helps out on a few songs, singer-guitarist Ezra Koenig is fully running the show and lyrically is consumed by dread, both literal and existential. Koenig's writing is more direct than ever on the expansive 18-track album, which musically runs the gamut and finds the band channeling the Grateful Dead ("Harmony Hall," "Sunflower"); sampling film composer Hans Zimmer's "The Thin Red Line" score; and teaming with Haim's Danielle Haim for country-eqsue duets. 7:30 p.m. $39.50-$89.50 . - Rudi Greenberg
Library of Congress National Book Festival , Aug. 31
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, chef José Andrés, cartoonist Raina Telgemeie, and historians Henry Louis Gates Jr. and David McCullough will grace the National Book Festival's main stage at this year's free event. More than 200,000 readers walked through the Walter E. Washington Convention Center doors at last year's festival, and this year's packed schedule - featuring more than 140 authors - includes talks geared to book lovers of all ages. (The Washington Post is a charter sponsor of the festival.) 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Free. - Adele Chapin

Warren-Buttigieg 2020? New York Times columnist promises white wonk Democratic ticket

Texto completo: An opinion writer for the New York Times floated a fantasy 2020 presidential ticket of Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg in a Thursday article.
"It would be ridiculous to imagine running-mate pairings this early for Democrats in the 2020 presidential race," said Nicholas Kristof. "So let’s be ridiculous."
Kristof, a self-proclaimed progressive Democrat who often writes on topics such as human rights and women’s rights, further speculated what a 2020 race featuring Warren and Buttigieg, in either order, could look like. "While they are quite different on policy — Warren is far to the left of Buttigieg in worldview," Kristof ventured. "They each are outsiders with silver tongues and massive intellects, and each would embody the change that the electorate seems to yearn for."
Citing recent polling that shines a positive light on some aspects of the Massachusetts senator and South Bend, Indiana mayor, Kristof notes that the identity politics of Warren and Buttigieg could further work in their favor. "Warren would be the first woman president or vice president," he noted. "Buttigieg would be the first openly gay person in either office, as well as the youngest president."
Kristof, 60, who once penned a New York Times article titled, "A confession of liberal intolerance," further espoused the perceived worldliness and well-spoken nature of his dream ticket. "Buttigieg is also a masterful speaker, injecting nuance and thoughtfulness even into sound bites. He speaks not only Maltese and Norwegian, but also religion," Kristof praised, further commending Buttigieg for his scolding of Christian lawmakers who don't support an increased minimum wage.
"So-called conservative Christian senators right now in the Senate are blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage,” Buttigieg said earlier this week. “When Scripture says that 'whoever oppresses the poor taunts their maker.'" Kristof states in his biography on the New York Times website that he, too, is fluent in several languages and has lived in several countries.
Buttigieg and Warren, who both debated in Detroit on Tuesday night, are polling at 5.6% and 14.5%, respectively, according to RealClearPolitics. Buttigieg has raised the most money of any candidate in the last quarter but still trails front-runner Joe Biden by nearly 30 points.
"Both Warren and Buttigieg are unproven among national voters, and there’s a risk that their cerebral qualities will antagonize some voters," Kristof said in his only entry of skepticism.
"This entire reverie is, of course, ridiculous," the author concludes, "and Buttigieg and Warren still must demonstrate an ability to win over actual voters. But for brilliance, eloquence and the ability to embody change, they would constitute a historic partnership."

41st ArmadilloCon reminds Austin sci-fi fans the field is in great shape

Texto completo: Martha Wells is having a well-deserved moment.
The College Station-based writer has long toiled in the field of fantasy and science fiction, first in fandom during high school and college, then as a writer.
Wells published her first novel, “The Element of Fire,” in 1993. Her books, the majority of them fantasy, have been consistently well-reviewed and -regarded but never real breakouts.
Then, in 2017, something interesting happened. Wells published a 154-page novella called “All Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries),” a book that would come to kick off the “Murderbot” series.
It was her first foray into sci-fi in some time, a story about a slightly dysfunctional security android, the kind one is required to take on deep space missions. Said bot has pretty well had
it with humans but eventually needs to team up with them to Solve the Case.
It’s thoughtful, entertaining, smartly allegorical and imagination-firing with its level of world-building. And folks noticed.
“All Systems Red” managed to pick up Hugo, Nebula and Locus awards for best novella, an Alex award (given to YA fiction) and was a New York Times bestseller. Several sequels have followed.
No wonder Wells is a special guest at the 41st annual ArmadilloCon, the long-running (obviously) Austin science fiction convention for (and this is important) people who actually like to read science fiction and fantasy.
Wells grew up in Fort Worth. “I realized a few years ago that ArmadilloCon was actually the first convention I ever went to,” Wells says. “I got my parents to take me to a very early ArmadilloCon in Austin when I was in high school.”
Wells is also, by her own admission, “still kind of figuring out” why Murderbot resonated so strongly with fans. She is futzing around with a few theories.
“Some people think that the more general a character is, the more generic, the more people it will appeal to,” Wells says. “It's actually really the opposite. The more specific a character is and the more detail you give about their problems and their feelings is what allows more people to empathize with it. I think that I made Murderbot very specific.”
She used the character, who is figuring out its own way of being in the word, to talk about the nature of her own social anxiety. “There's just a lot of people who really identify with that, a lot of people who feel marginalized for different reasons. I just kind of wrote out my feelings and without really trying to specifically appeal to anybody in particular except myself.”
Indeed, that specificity resonated with a lot of people, which is why she is a special guest at the con, along with guest of honor Rebecca Roanhorse, an author of Indigenous heritage who was raised in Fort Worth and received the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 2018. Austinite author Marshall Ryan Maresca is this year’s Toastmaster.
Also look for fan guest Dan Tolliver, who has been chronicling the Central Texas fan community for decades; Texas-raised editor Patrice Caldwell, whose anthology "A Phoenix First Must Burn," a collection of 16 speculative fiction stories about African American girls and gender-nonconforming teens, is out in March 2020; and science guest and UT aerospace engineering professor Dr. Moriba K. Jah. (There are plenty of others; those are the biggest names.)
But as Wells notes, ArmadilloCon has thrived because it is not about the big names.
“The people who work on ArmadilloCon really care about science fiction and fantasy,” Wells says. “They really care about books informing a community. They care about the state of the field and try to get new authors and new guests and people who are really on the cusp of becoming a big deal and their career is taking off. You get a lot of new ideas and new opinions in the discussion.”
And there is no question that the field itself is having a moment. “A lot of people are saying this is kind of a new golden age of science fiction,” Wells says. “There's so many new authors, writers of color, women of color writing and publishing. It's just getting more open, I think, and that's really energized it.”

Texto completo: Though we've raised two sons, the last thing Betty wants me to do is to offer unsolicited advice to parents on how to bring up their own children.
Giving parental advice is often arrogant and stupid. Besides, she's right, it also upsets people.
Once I would tell new parents they just had to get their kids into soccer at a very young age and tie a ball to the left foot at the age of 2, because all the top teams want players with a good left foot.
"And what happened?" she said. "People would run away and roll their eyes."
They still do. So, I stopped, because in America, telling parents how to raise their kids is the job of the federal government.
But thanks to the idiosyncratic people of the Netherlands, also known as "The Dutch," there is plenty of parenting advice being tossed around lately and I can't be blamed.
It's based on one of those weird Dutch customs. They reportedly have many cultural idiosyncrasies, including drinking tiny beers, combining curse words with diseases and putting peanut sauce on fries.
But this one involves abandoning your preteen children in a scary forest alone at night. Then you wait for them to make it home alive.
They call it "dropping."
The New York Times wrote this story, and it started a "thing" among arrogant parental advice columnists on the internet.
"You just drop your kids in the world," novelist Pia de Jong, who raised her children in New Jersey, told the Times. "Of course, you make sure they don't die, but other than that, they have to find their own way."
Apparently, they do make their way home after being left alone out there in the creepy, dark forest with only a map and a flashlight. Sometimes a parent will hide in the bushes and make sounds like a wild Dutch boar to scare the kids for fun, but that's about it.
Naturally, this has triggered American helicopter moms and tiger moms -- I can't tell the difference between them, though I'm sure there is one, since tigers are animals and helicopters are not. The Dutch are naturally bragging that the Dutch way is the best way to raise kids, and they're probably correct.
My advice to American parents is to give your credit cards to the kids and see if they can survive at the mall.
Just don't do what my wife and I did -- abandon the children in the suburbs in the snow with only rude wooden spears with which the boys were expected to each kill a wolf and wear its pelt, Spartan style, as in the movie "300."
But don't try appropriating my culture, yo.
Naturally, some Dutch people were upset with the news stories, since who likes their weirdness on display? Others, though, were quite proud.
Ellen, at @EllenNGNG tweeted the kid dropping story was absolutely correct.
"True," said Ellen. "It's part of our beautiful Dutch culture. That's why I gave birth 8 times in the forest. 3 of them eventually made it home, the strong and independent ones."
Daan Koopen, @D_Koopen, said, "You miss the part where our children have to fight an angry cow at the age of four. Those that fail are sacrificed to the ocean so we may survive another year without being flooded."
What is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger.
My own experience with the Dutch -- I got drunk with a few after watching speedskating at the Sochi Olympics -- was that they were bluff folk of excellent manners and good humor.
We talked endlessly through the night about mayonnaise on fries and the great left-footed player Arjen Robben of the Dutch national team.
But I never saw them drink "tiny beers," although that is said to be the Dutch practice, at least according to a story "8 Customs Only the Dutch Will Understand" found on some site called The Culture Trip.
The writer looked as if he were an American habitue of the hash bars of Amsterdam, but I can't be sure.
Of the other (allegedly) weird Dutch customs, the use of diseases as curse words was truly weird:
"Whereas English speakers usually rely on bodily waste and sexual organs to insult one another, the Dutch have instead developed a whole lexicon of swear words that refer to life threatening illness such as typhus, cholera and cancer. Among the many disturbing insults in the Netherlands, common curses include pestpokke-tering (plague boils-tuberculosis), krijg de klere (catch cholera) and the particularly nasty tyfushond (typhus dog)."
One of their great accomplishments is the world-renowned soccer team FC Barcelona. Cultural philistines think Barca plays in the Spanish style, but in reality, their "Spanish style" was invented by the great Dutchman Johan Cruyff, the father of "totaalvoetbal."
Instead of Barcelona, they should call themselves Cruyff-a-lona.
Which forest he may have dropped his kids in and whether he opted for mayo or peanut sauce on his fries remains a mystery to this day.

Florida's back-to-school sales tax holiday - a costly gimmick commentary

Texto completo: This weekend is Florida's annual back-to-school sales tax holiday - and boy, is it stupid.
Seriously, I'm not sure anyone could dream up a more gimmicky, meaningless and misguided attempt at "tax relief" if they tried.
There's a reason policy analysts roundly pan it. (More from them in a moment.)
Among the beneficiaries of this alleged tax cut for Floridians are non-Floridians. They're tourists who just happen to be shopping this weekend, wandering out of the Golden Corral and into the premium outlets during the state's five-day tax holiday.
Bully for you, Brits and Brazilians. You saved 65 cents on that $10 T-shirt.
And Florida loses out on $42 million in revenue - in a state that claims to not have enough money to properly fund pre-K, pay teachers, and which keeps some special-needs kids on waiting lists for services until they die.
But hey, you saved a buck on your Crocs.
Oh, and if you are a Sunshine State resident who's out of town or just doesn't shop Friday through Tuesday, you miss your cut.
If we really wanted to provide a tax cut for Floridians, it'd be granted to people who can prove they're Florida residents. But that would just be another level of bureaucratic baloney in an already complicated shtick.
Seriously, just try to figure out what the heck is taxed and what isn't.
Want to buy poster paper? That's exempt. Computer paper? Not exempt.
Backpacks? Yes. Computer bags? No.
Staplers? Yes. Masking tape? No.
Wait ... yes on staplers, but no on tape?
Imagine the legislative meeting where that decision went down:
"The chair recognizes the distinguished gentleman from Opa-locka to rise in opposition to masking tape."
The lobbyists from Big Stapler win again.
Computers that cost less than $1,000 are also exempt from taxes - but only if you buy them for home use, not work. (As if the clerks at Best Buy will make you pinkie promise your intent.)
This whole scheme is just a gimmick to let politicians crow about cutting taxes.
Don't take it from me. Take it from tax policy experts all over America - hardcore fiscal watchdogs who say tax holidays are just PR stunts masquerading as fiscal policy.
The Tax Foundation call them "political gimmicks" that "distract policymakers and taxpayers from genuine, permanent tax relief."
A researcher at the Tax Policy Center told the New York Times: "The largest beneficiaries of sales tax holidays are politicians."
And an analyst with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said one of the alleged benefits - that the tax holidays stimulate spending - is bogus. Why? Because if your kid needs a backpack, your kid needs a backpack. Maybe you buy it this weekend. Maybe you buy it next weekend. Either way, you bought the same backpack you always planned on buying.
So there you have it: Three national tax foundations. Three thumbs down.
I found one state tax group OK with Florida's tax-holiday, Florida TaxWatch, which said it liked the idea of a break for middle-class shoppers (including those from Canada). But even TaxWatch conceded it was a gimmick.
Maybe that's why most states don't play this game. Florida is one of 16 that does.
Wisconsin ended its sales-tax holiday with the governor saying: "I just don't think the incentive actually worked."
Silly Wisconsin governor. He was actually looking at the efficacy of tax policy. Here, the politicians look at the efficacy of press releases.
They like to claim the 6 or 7% discount they're granting you is really 20 or 30% once you add in additional discounts retailers provide. (As if Macy's and Dillard's don't have sales any other weekend.)
Still, the holiday is free advertising for retailers. So they like it.
The Legislature approved this year's tax holiday as part of a bigger package, passed largely by Republicans along party lines, that also included tax breaks for Disney, cell-phone tower companies and businesses that rent property.
But none of those lobbyist-driven breaks play well in re-election campaigns. So that's why the sales tax "holiday" gets all the headlines.
That way, the politicians can crow about giving you $42 million in tax breaks ... while hoping you won't know that many Floridians never saw a dime of those savings. Even if the visiting T-shirt shoppers did.
A good man gone
Speaking of fiscal watchdogs, I wanted to pay tribute to one of Central Florida's best - Jim Moye.
Many of you probably never heard Jim's name. But I guarantee he saved you money.
Jim was a deputy comptroller to Martha Haynie in Orange County; a savvy guy who couldn't be swayed by slick-talking bond brokers or loudmouth politicians. He scrutinized spending and helped squash bad deals meant to benefit finance firms more than the public.
On a personal note, Jim also helped me navigate complex finances when politicians tried to obfuscate. He helped expose some of the shady deals at the former expressway authority.
Jim passed away Monday after a long and rough battle with cancer. He will be sorely missed. But his legacy of savings - and just being a standup guy - lives on.

Michigan's status as Midwestern state suddenly called into question

Texto completo: "By definition it's in the Eastern Time Zone. It's very difficult to say that any state in the Eastern Time Zone is Midwest."
Dennis Lennox
political consultant and travel writer
Michigan is part of the U.S. Midwest, most authorities agree, possibly laying to rest one major disagreement that emerged from Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate in Detroit.
Amid a discussion on Twitter about what sort of political promises "play well" in the Midwest, New York Times Deputy Washington Editor Jonathan Weisman sent a tweet that many interpreted as an assertion that neither Detroit nor Minneapolis are part of the Midwest.
He later deleted the tweet after a war of words erupted on Twitter.
Both the U.S. Census Bureau and National Geographic include Michigan in the Midwest in their maps showing the various geographic regions of the U.S. They also vouch for Minnesota.
"There is no confusion over that," Joe Darden, a professor of geography at Michigan State University in East Lansing, said Wednesday. "I don't know why there is any discussion about it."
But in fact there has been a quiet debate for decades over whether not only Michigan, but other states such as Ohio, should be counted as Midwest states. Some note that much earlier in America's history, Michigan was considered part of the Northwest. Others insist it is much more Northeast than Midwest.
Exactly how the geographic debate began within Tuesday's political debate is not precisely clear.
But at least two Democratic candidates — Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — referenced Michigan as a Midwest state at various points.
"I win in the Midwest," Klobuchar said at one point. "I can win in states like Wisconsin and Michigan and Iowa."
In his tweet, Weisman said that to say that U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, or U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., are from the Midwest is like saying that U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, is from Texas, or that U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Atlanta, is from the Deep South.
What appeared to get lost by many who read the tweet was that Austin is in fact the capital of Texas and Georgia is generally agreed to be part of the Deep South.
Weisman later deleted the tweet, saying he was trying "to make a point about regional differences in politics between urban and rural areas" that was misunderstood.
But by then, a fight was raging on Twitter, with FiveThirtyEight Editor-in-Chief (and Michigan native) Nate Silver accusing Weisman of saying "people from major cities in the Midwest are not really from the Midwest."
Since both Tlaib and Omar are part of the "squad" of congresswomen of color that President Donald Trump has said should go back where they came from, some saw the singling out of Tlaib and Omar in the context of the debate over where the Midwest is located as racist.
But even earlier in the evening, among those arguing that Michigan is not part of the Midwest was Michigan Republican political consultant and travel writer Dennis Lennox.
"Note to Klobuchar," Lennox tweeted less than 25 minutes into the debate at the Fox Theatre. "#Detroit (and #Michigan) is not Midwest."
Lennox pointed to a 2008 article in Hour Detroit that questioned whether Michigan should be considered part of the Midwest, said that the U.S. Census Bureau did not adopt the term "Midwest" until 1984, and quoted a history professor at Miami University in Ohio as saying the term is a "cultural construct" that can mean different things to different people.
A Google search also turned up an article titled, "Why are Ohio and Michigan considered part of the Midwest ..." among others questioning the classification.
Lennox said that he thinks Michigan historically and culturally has much more in common with northern Ohio, the northeast, and upper New York State than it does with the Midwest states of Kansas or Nebraska.
"By definition it's in the Eastern Time Zone," Lennox said. "It's very difficult to say that any state in the Eastern Time Zone is Midwest."
"We basically are like New York, politically," Lennox said.
But many appeared as flummoxed by the debate as Darden.
"Apparently a hot debate about whether Michigan is actually 'Midwestern' or not erupted on Twitter during the debates last night," tweeted Jordyn Hermani, a writer for the Lansing-based political newsletter Gongwer.
"I really gotta ask: If we're not Midwestern, what are we? South Canadians?"

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL ALLOW IMPORTS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS: The Trump administration has announced plans to allow the importation of drugs from other countries, a major part of President Trump's agenda for lowering the cost of prescriptions.
“This is the next important step in the Administration’s work to end foreign freeloading and put American patients first,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a call with reporters Wednesday.
The proposal, the Safe Importation Action Plan, calls for a rulemaking to authorize state, wholesaler, or pharmacy plans to try to set up drug importation programs that abide by FDA safety standards.
“We are open, there is a pathway,” Azar said. “We will lay out the criteria for states, wholesale retailers, and pharmacies to see that they have a workable plan to lower costs and protect American consumers. But they must work with us and convince us that you have a plan that works.”
Azar said he has spoken with Canada’s health minister, as Canada has been the country most frequently referenced for drug importation, about how the plan will be carried out. He reiterated that execution will rely on state-made plans.
“Those will be issues for states, pharmacies, and wholesale distributors to work out,” Azar said. “How to get tracing and tracking, get relabeling, maintain the supply chain. That is for them to work out.”
Azar said HHS and the FDA haven’t yet spoken to big pharmaceutical companies about the two proposals yet.

DEMOCRATS TO FORCE VOTE ON OBAMACARE WAIVERS: Senate Democrats are unveiling a resolution Wednesday that would undo guidance from the Trump administration to allow states to make changes to their Obamacare markets, through waivers known as 1332. Democrats can force a majority-threshold vote on the matter under the Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress the power to overrule a regulation. Tune in to the press conference at 12:30 p.m.
SEEMA VERMA TO SLAM ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Seema Verma is at the Heritage Foundation Wednesday morning to speak on Democrats’ “Medicare for All” proposals. You can tune in to the live stream here.
DEBATE SUM-UP: CENTRISTS POUND WARREN, SANDERS ON HEALTHCARE: Centrist Democratic presidential candidates fired shots at Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren during the second round of debates Tuesday over their defense of "Medicare for all." Sanders told former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, "You're wrong!" that support for his plan amounted to "political suicide."
Delaney, who has proposed giving everyone in the U.S. a basic healthcare plan while allowing private insurers to continue to operate, said it wasn't necessary to abolish private health insurance. "We don't have to be the party of subtraction, telling half the country that their private insurance is illegal," he said.
Warren dodged on whether middle class would see tax hikes: Warren promised that "giant corporations and billionaires" would pay more, and that the middle class would pay less out of pocket for their healthcare. She wouldn't commit, however, as to whether the middle class would pay higher taxes than they do now, even when pressed by moderators on the issue.
Trump campaign hits Democrats over healthcare for illegal immigrants: The ad, which aired Tuesday and is set to air again Wednesday, paints all the candidates as in favor of "giving illegal immigrants free healthcare at our expense" and for ending private insurance. It goes on to accuse the presidential candidates of "putting illegal immigrants before hardworking Americans."
Buttigieg credited Obamacare for saving his mother in law: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s mother in law, Sherri Glezman, has been treated for skin cancer, including through surgery and several rounds of chemotherapy. Glezman has spoken publicly about her treatment and warned others to wear sunscreen and avoid tanning beds.
ACLU, PLANNED PARENTHOOD FILE SUIT AGAINST MISSOURI OVER 8-WEEK ABORTION BAN: The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood filed suit Tuesday against Missouri over its 8-week abortion ban, which does not make exceptions for cases of rape or incest and was signed into law by Gov. Mike Parson in May.
PALLONE REQUESTS BRIEFING FROM CDC ABOUT CHANGING ‘CRITICAL’ PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS: Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone of New Jersey requested an explanation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the agency’s plans to reorganize the environmental health division which, Pallone says, is a part of the Trump administration’s agenda to discount climate science. He said the agency’s plans could upend efforts of the Climate and Health Program to prevent and adapt to the health effects of climate change.
E&C WANTS FDA BRIEFING ABOUT POSSIBLE BLOOD-THINNER SHORTAGE DUE TO OUTBREAK OF FLU KILLING PIGS IN CHINA: The Energy and Commerce Committee wrote to Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Ned Sharpless about a possible shortage of the essential blood-thinner heparin, which is derived from pig intestines. Almost half of the world’s pigs are in China, where about 60% of heparin comes from, but the African swine flu is killing pigs throughout the country. Because the U.S. is dependent on China and Chinese pigs for the critical medication, the committee is asking the FDA for a briefing about actions to take to prevent a possible shortage of heparin.
WAYS AND MEANS BLASTS MEDICARE HOSPICE PROGRAM FOR DEFICIENT CARE, DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM CMS: The Ways and Means Committee demanded answers from CMS about “alarming” and deficient hospice care, based on reports from the HHS Office of the Inspector General. The two most recent OIG studies reported that 87% of hospice centers had at least one care deficiency, including neglecting to treat wounds, resulting in gangrene and limb amputation, and maggots developing around a patient’s feeding tube. Ways and Means is demanding answers about the lacking hospice program “immediately,” though the committee did not give CMS a hard deadline.
SENATE BILL WOULD RETIRE ANIMALS AFTER EXPERIMENTATION: The bipartisan Animal Freedom from Testing, Experimentation, and Research Act introduced Tuesday would direct all federal labs to develop and carry out a plan for monkeys, dogs, cats, rabbits, and other animals to be adopted or retired once they’re no longer needed for research. Check out our recent feature on this topic.
CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION SENDING 80 SICK MIGRANTS TO HOSPITALS DAILY: Border Patrol Agents and Field Operations Officers transport about 80 sick migrants to hospitals daily, which CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan says is putting a strain on agents’ ability to keep an eye on ports of entry. "We are looking at $63 million for continued medical assets and high risk support across the southwest border," Morgan said during a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tuesday.

Texto completo: During Wednesday night’s Democratic primary debate, CNN’s Jake Tapper knew exactly what he was doing when he queued up a question for Tulsi Gabbard about her past criticisms of Kamala Harris’s approach to racial issues and her attack on Joe Biden.
Gabbard went off.
Tweet
Tweet
Clearly, Gabbard had done her homework, and she absolutely dragged Harris for her abysmal record as California attorney general. During her time in office, Harris took draconian stances on issues of criminal justice, enforcing such merciless policies and displaying such ruthless ambition that “Kamala the cop” has become a common criticism of the candidate.
Gabbard attacked Harris for having locked up thousands of people for mere marijuana possession and laughing about it when asked whether she had smoked pot herself. The congresswoman piled onto Harris, adding on a reference to her office’s shameful move to keep people locked up to preserve "cheap labor for the state of California."
This is all true, and here are the receipts. But Gabbard didn’t stop there.
The Hawaii congresswoman also called out Harris for the fact that while attorney general, she fought to keep people incarcerated despite exonerating evidence and fought to preserve the unfair system of cash bail.
True and true.
And according to the New York Times, “Ms. Harris also championed state legislation under which parents whose children were found to be habitually truant in elementary school could be prosecuted, despite concerns that it would disproportionately affect low-income people of color.”
So Gabbard was spot-on when she said, to Harris’ face, that “when you were in a position to make a difference, you did not. The people who suffered under your reign as a prosecutor, you owe them an apology.”
As the Washington Examiner’s own Tiana Lowe summed it up blogging in real time, “Tulsi just stabbed Kamala where it hurts, focusing on the California Senator's history of threatening the mothers of truant children, sex workers, and a disproportionately crew of color. Shots fired.”
Shots fired, indeed.

Sharing the joy of new brews in Fort Myers

Texto completo: At 6:25 on a Friday evening, every bar stool was full at The Southland Taproom.
A low hum of conviviality filled the space, which seemed to hold a mix of everybody — young men with beards who talked about craft beers the way sommeliers discuss fine wines; families with babies in strollers; the just-off-work crowd, decompressing over goses and IPAs; retired couples relaxing and laughing with the gentleman behind the bar.
That would be Tommy Johnson, who launched this taproom and bottle shop in November in the same plaza as LYNQ and Five Guys near HealthPark Medical Center in south Fort Myers. Johnson opened Southland to spread his appreciation for craft beer across Southwest Florida.
The bar keeps 24 craft beers on tap, some local and some from across the U.S. It also offers wines, ciders, spiked seltzers and craft brews in bottles and cans. Johnson's taps rotate regularly. When a keg is done, he orders something new.
Johnson said Southland honestly welcomes everybody, that this mixed Friday-evening crowd wasn't a fluke.
"Twenty-five percent are truly craft beer people," he said of his clientele. These are the people who follow his rotating tap lineup online, who come seeking out beers from hard-to-source breweries and who track their beer consumption on apps like Untappd.
"I've got a good group of regulars like that."
Around 50% of his customers are beer drinkers who are interested in craft beer but not obsessed.
"I'm helping them along, saying, 'What do you like to drink?'" Johnson said.
And the last 25% have no idea about craft beer. They'll ask for something like a Budweiser or Miller Light, and Johnson is happy to steer them in a more interesting direction.
"They just want something easy drinking and smooth," he said, "so I'll point them to a light lager, which I keep on tap."
Johnson is often asked if Southland is a brewery or a bar.
He says it's neither.
Johnson doesn't brew his own beer and he's not affiliated with any one specific brewery, so he can carry whatever he likes. Southland also doesn't serve hard liquor.
Though the breweries where Johnson sources his craft beers change, he likes to keep familiar styles on tap. He always has a red ale, stouts, a double IPA, a session IPA, a basic lager and a couple of blond ales.
"I make sure my major styles are checked off," he said, "and then I throw in some other styles, like a triple IPA made with 100 percent African hops or a helles bock from a well-known brewery in Louisiana."
Johnson offers samples of everything on draft, and he encourages his patrons to try a flight of four beers if they're not sure what to order.
Though the taproom doesn't have a kitchen, customers are welcome to bring in food. Southland's plaza has Five Guys, Tropical Smoothie and Jimmy John's, as well as LYNQ, and sometimes guests have pizza or Chinese food delivered.
On this particular Friday night, Southland was hosting a tap takeover with the Vero Beach-based Walking Tree Brewery. A rep from the brewery socialized with patrons and explained some of the brewery's beers on tap, like the Peach Candyman, made with Florida peaches and aged in white-wine barrels.
Southland regularly hosts such tap-takeover events. On August 16 it's hosting a kick-off to the college football season featuring beers from craft breweries in Gainesville, Tallahassee and Miami, the homes to Florida's big-three universities.
Johnson, who has a background in healthcare consulting, offers healthcare workers a dollar off every drink every day. Friday is education-appreciation day with a dollar off every drink for educators.
His goal is to create a diverse community centered around a love of craft beer.
"I want to be your neighborhood craft-beer taproom," he said, "a place where everyone can come and kick back."

Do Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders Like You? Beyond the radical agenda, they also share a contempt for many of their fellow citizens.

Texto completo: Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate offered voters a chance to understand the revolutionary changes that Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders seek to impose on American society. Beyond policy, the event in Detroit also confirmed that a win for either candidate would guarantee four years of bitter public discourse. Voters hoping for a kinder, gentler politics will need to look elsewhere.
The sight of Sen. Warren happily rubbing her hands together at the prospect of illegally seizing wealth from rival John Delaney was worth more than a thousand words about her unconstitutional tax scheme. But Sen. Warren and the author of her health care plan, Sen. Sanders, made it clear that highly successful entrepreneurs aren't the only targets of their ire.
Ms. Warren dismissed moderate candidates in her own party as people offering "small ideas and spinelessness." This was her latest suggestion that Democratic colleagues who oppose her agenda do so not because of honest disagreements but because of character flaws. CNN noted her comments at last month's debate in Miami promoting a government-run health system and a ban on private insurance:
"There are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it's just not possible, we just can't do it, have a lot of political reasons for this. What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it," Warren said from her podium in the middle of the stage. "Well, health care is a basic human right, and I will fight for basic human rights."
Perhaps some of her moderate colleagues have noticed how often governments declaring health care a basic human right end up providing horrible health care .
The comments about her Democratic colleagues were downright pleasant compared to Sen. Warren's commentary about our President. Among other Tuesday insults she claimed that his enforcement of immigration law was merely a tool to achieve the larger goal of breaking up families.
Ms. Warren's harsh rhetoric didn't spare our former President, either. The Massachusetts senator alleged a "corrupt, rigged system" in the United States and implicitly included our 44th President, Barack Obama, among its administrators:
Right now, for decades, we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful. It has been on the side of the wealthy. And that means it has not been on the side of everyone else, not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations, people living in inner cities, people living in small farms, and small communities across this country.
Yes, the white lawyer who claimed to be "American Indian" and then snagged an Ivy League professorship is now complaining about the impact of a "corrupt, rigged system" on Native Americans.
On Tuesday night in Detroit, Sen. Warren and Sen. Sanders condemned entire industries which employ millions of Americans. Sen. Sanders had this to say about energy producers:
We've got to ask ourselves a simple question: What do you do with an industry that knowingly, for billions of dollars in short-term profits, is destroying this planet? I say that is criminal activity that cannot be allowed to continue.
Will Mr. Sanders consider the possibility that many people in the energy industry simply don't agree with his climate assessment or think that imposing huge economic costs now is not the best way to respond to a potential threat? Certainly such opinions are held by tens of millions of Americans who don't work in the energy industry.
Of course for the socialist Mr. Sanders the real problem is not with the energy industry but with industry, period. He said that when it comes to health care, companies inventing medicines and operating health plans "are going to war against the American people." Ms. Warren offered similarly outrageous smears.
"Fight, fight, fight, fight. There is no syllable more central to Warren's campaign," writes Frank Bruni in the New York Times. He's among those skeptical that most voters "want a government at bitter war with all of corporate America."
Given the vitriol Sen. Warren has directed even at her own colleagues—and the many businesses condemned by both Sens. Warren and Sanders—voters may wonder how hard it will be to stay off Washington's enemies list come 2021.

Trump's criticism of Baltimore was fair

Texto completo: President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), a man widely respected by Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore "dangerous," "filthy" and "rodent infested" - that is, if you can believe what you read in the "failing New York Times."
In March, the Times Sunday magazine published a heart-rending story titled "The Tragedy of Baltimore," which chronicled the precipitous decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of southeast Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered, uncollected garbage piled up and a liquor store allowed drunks to congregate while pretending to wait for the bus. " 'Watch your step,' someone called out as the group neared a dead rat," the Times reported.
The city's "regression has been swift and demoralizing," the Times wrote, adding that officials have "struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge." One resident contrasted the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor with her West Baltimore neighborhood, where, she said, "we're all bolted in our homes, we're locked down."
Residents are locked down with good reason. In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita - more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore's population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 - up from 147 homicides at the same time last year. Baltimore is quite literally experiencing "American carnage."
While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8 percent to 12.3 percent since 2014, Baltimore's remains virtually unchanged at 22.4 percent. Children are trapped in failing schools that can't teach them to read or do math at grade level. No wonder Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) once compared Baltimore to "a Third World country" and said it is "a community in which half of the people don't have jobs [and] in which there are hundreds of buildings that are uninhabitable." This is happening in Maryland, the richest state in the country. Talk about income inequality!
Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions - we should all agree that no one should have to. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore's leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule. Democrats have held a lock on the Baltimore mayor's office since 1967. They run the city council, the school system, the sanitation system, the housing authority and police department, and they represent the city in Washington. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), only the second Republican governor of Maryland since 1969, does bear some responsibility. But Baltimore is a deep-blue city in a deep-blue state; its plight is almost entirely a Democrat- created disaster.
Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those, including Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who outrageously compare those facilities to "concentration camps") but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.
The irony is that Democrats are in large part responsible for both situations. For months they refused to provide the emergency funds Trump requested to address the surge in border crossings, which left U.S. facilities on the border under- resourced and overwhelmed. And for years they have ruled Baltimore as a one-party fiefdom as the city turned into an island of despair amid a sea of prosperity.
The tragedy of Trump's presidency is that he should be championing the people of Baltimore rather than using their plight to attack one of his critics. In 2016, Trump visited a black church in Detroit and gave a major speech in Charlotte in which he promised black Americans, "Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion." Last year, he was supposed to visit Baltimore to deliver a similar message but canceled. That would have been a lot more effective than a tweetstorm that only prompts Baltimore's beleaguered residents to rally around their incompetent Democratic leaders.

Texto completo: HILLSBOROUGH, N.C. – In the summer of 1976, I first drove through the town of Smithfield, North Carolina. I was 19 and had just finished my sophomore year in college. The following day I planned to start a summer internship bringing health and legal services to the migrant farm workers – mostly African Americans – who traveled the East Coast each season to pick sweet potatoes, cucumbers and tobacco. As I approached the town, a giant and frightening billboard suddenly appeared roadside.
"This is Klan Country," it said. 'LOVE IT or LEAVE IT. Help fight communism and integration. Welcome to Smithfield"
For those unfamiliar with the highways and byways of North Carolina, Smithfield is but 70 miles from Greenville, North Carolina, the site of President Donald Trump's rally where chants of "send her back" echoed last week. More than 40 years later, the refrain really hasn't changed. Substitute "socialism" for "communism" and "immigration" for "integration."
The past is never really past Like many other white people coming of age in the 1970s, I had heard terrifying stories of the Ku Klux Klan's violence. But I was unaware that this hate group had for the most part remained active and powerful in many parts of the Tar Heel state, especially in the mid-1960s. Chalk that up to my naiveté – and outsider status (I grew up in New York City).
Upon graduation, I took a job in another isolated North Carolina county, just a few miles from Mount Airy, the birth place of Andy Griffith and the model for the town of Mayberry, the fictional and pastoral home to "The Andy Griffith Show." With a small state salary, I rented a trailer home from a white couple who showed me every courtesy but, fortunately, never asked me about my job – to ferry Hispanic farm workers from the migrant camps to health clinics. In retrospect, I'm sure my whiteness made my approval pro forma.
In a few short weeks, having paid my weekly rent on time, the talkative landlord began to confide in me. Not quite mano a mano. More like blanco a blanco.
Among the revelations: His membership in the local KKK chapter. Soon enough, he invited me to a Klan gathering, again my white skin appeared to tell my story. A foolhardy (to put it mildly) young man, I agreed to go along. Out in an open field, I witnessed a cross burning, the wearing of robes and a sea of Confederate flags in support of white nationalism. The rabid hatefulness of that dark night shocked me. It also terrified me: There was more to me than my skin color. I was of Jewish blood and then a closeted gay man, both disqualifying marks in the eyes of the Klan.
I left North Carolina the following year, never expecting to return. But I did in 2006 when my husband and I moved to Chapel Hill from the Bay Area to be nearer our ailing parents. All too soon the DNA of hate manifested itself, notably with the passage in 2016 of House Bill 2, what's known as the "bathroom bill," that mercilessly targeted transgender people for using the wrong restroom.
The law (yes, it was passed and signed into law, in the after hours of darkness) was mean-spirited and fear-based – and some of the surrounding rhetoric reminded me of what I had witnessed decades before.
That's the same reason I wasn't shocked by the chants of "send her back" at Trump's rally in Greenville on Wednesday.
I wish I could attribute it all to Donald Trump – a man who thrives on race hate, the fear of difference, and the disruption of social mores and manners. But I can't. I wish I could say North Carolina is an exception to the rule in these United States, but it is not. If I've learned anything in my two residencies in North Carolina, it's as William Shakespeare wrote, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump again succeeded in turning back bipartisan congressional efforts to rebuke his lock-step support for Saudi Arabia after the Senate on Monday failed to override his veto on a series of measures that would have blocked billions of dollars of arms sales to the Persian Gulf region.
The failure is the second time in recent months that the Senate has been unable to muster enough opposition to beat a veto on a rebuke to the administration's relationship with Saudi Arabia. That underscored that legislators' simmering anger over both the kingdom's murder of a dissident columnist and its bloody war in Yemen has its limits.
The measures, introduced by Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, sought to stymie the administration's effort to circumvent Congress to sell munitions to the gulf nations by declaring an emergency over Iran. Mr. Menendez and other lawmakers had blocked some of those sales, but by declaring an emergency, the administration was able to blow through the blockades.
Mr. Trump, in his veto message, said the legislation "would weaken America's global competitiveness and damage the important relationships we share with our allies and partners." He vetoed a separate measure in April that would have forced an end to American military involvement in the Yemen war.
The defeat on Monday left lawmakers who are intent on penalizing the administration's relationship with the kingdom pledging to redouble their efforts. Democratic senators and a handful of Republicans -- unwilling to let the issue go but seemingly unable to expand their ranks of supporters -- are pressing on, bitterly dividing the Foreign Relations Committee.
"It's difficult to accept Saudi Arabia as a trusted ally of the United States right now," said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. "Instead of holding the Saudis accountable, this administration instead continues to provide them a blank check."
The committee advanced legislation last week, led by Mr. Menendez and Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, that would impose mandatory sanctions on those found responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Virginia-based Washington Post columnist. The bill would also prohibit American refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft engaged in the civil war in Yemen and ban certain weapons sales to the kingdom. It is unlikely that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will bring the legislation up for a vote.
But the passage of the legislation through committee over the chairman's wishes was remarkable. It was the culmination of a bitter internal fight between Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the chairman and a Trump ally, and Mr. Menendez, who offered competing bills outlining a starkly different vision of how Congress should address the American relationship with Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Risch's legislation would have directed the secretary of state to conduct a review of the relationship and deny or revoke visas to some members of the Saudi royal family as punishment for the kingdom's human rights violations. The legislation would give Riyadh a chance to reset the kingdom's ties with the United States, Mr. Risch argued, and because it was developed in consultation with the White House and the State Department, it would have a chance at winning the president's signature.
"We can either send a messaging bill to the president for a veto or we can send legislation that will drive and, more important, form foreign policy," he said.
In the end, three Republicans on the panel, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mr. Young, broke ranks to support Mr. Menendez's more punitive bill, and Mr. Risch withdrew his legislation from consideration.
"No hard feelings to anyone, it's not sour grapes," Mr. Risch said, "but I'm interested in spending time on something we can actually do."
House Democrats on the Oversight and Reform Committee, however, have made clear that they will continue their investigation into the administration's support of Riyadh despite the White House's refusal to cooperate. In a report released on Monday, they focused on Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a top campaign fund-raiser, inaugural chairman and close friend of Mr. Trump, and concluded that he pushed a proposal to circumvent the normal policymaking process and build dozens of nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia that experts worried could spread nuclear weapons technology in the volatile Middle East.
The New York Times reported this week that federal prosecutors were investigating whether Mr. Barrack violated the law requiring people who try to influence American policy or opinion at the direction of foreign governments or entities to disclose their activities to the Justice Department.
The committee also concluded that IP3, a private company lobbying the White House to transfer United States nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, has had "unprecedented access to the highest levels" of the administration, including meeting directly with Mr. Trump. It also said the company had lobbied the administration not to require Saudi Arabia to agree to the "gold standard," a commitment not to use American nuclear technology to make nuclear weapons.

Uber Cuts Third of Marketing Staff; Lyft Chief Operating Officer Exits; The two ride-hailing companies have been under pressure from Wall Street

Texto completo: Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. went through separate staff shake-ups Monday, as Uber cut about 400 jobs in its marketing department and Lyft eliminated the role of chief operating officer.
The two ride-hailing companies have been under pressure from Wall Street amid heavy losses and disappointing market debuts, with both stocks still sagging below their initial public offering prices.
Uber cut about a third of its marketing arm in a reorganization of a division that had grown to around 1,200 employees, an Uber spokesman said. Less than two months ago, marketing was put under the portfolio of Jill Hazelbaker, who previously ran communications and policy.
In an email to staff, Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi wrote that the cuts are part of an effort to become more agile amid concerns about slowing growth.
"Put simply, we need to get our edge back. Being fast wins," he wrote. "Many of our teams are too big, which creates overlapping work."
The Uber staff cuts were reported earlier by the New York Times.
Lyft said in an email to staff Monday that Jon McNeill—a former Tesla Inc. executive who was hired in early 2018 as chief operating officer—is leaving the company and that his roles will be distributed to other executives.
Lyft Chief Executive Logan Green and President John Zimmer said in the email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that it was "with gratitude that we say goodbye" to Mr. McNeill. The message didn't offer further detail on the reason for his departure.
Mr. McNeill's focus at Lyft included increasing driver supply and retention, a critical issue for ride-sharing companies. He received compensation valued at $32.8 million in 2018, including a $420,000 bonus "in recognition of his outstanding leadership and contributions to our 2018 performance," according to regulatory filings.
The move by Lyft mirrors the decision of its larger rival last month to eliminate the operating chief role as it announced the departure of Barney Harford. Uber said at the time that Mr. Khosrowshahi wanted to take a more direct role in operations.
The role of operating chief generally has been on the wane at large public companies. In 2018, 32% of 673 companies examined by search firm Crist|Kolder Associates had a COO, down from 48% in 2000.
Mr. McNeill's departure was reported earlier Monday by Bloomberg News.

DoorDash’s about-face on tipping shows customers have more clout than workers

Texto completo: Since at least February, DoorDash drivers have known the company was at times dipping into their tips to cover their base pay. But it wasn’t until Tuesday night that the on-demand meal delivery service said it would stop.
What changed? More customers finally got wise to how their tips were being used. And they didn’t like it.
Announcing plans to rethink the controversial pay structure on Twitter, Chief Executive Tony Xu indicated it was backlash from the people placing all those takeout orders – not the ones delivering them – that forced the concession.
“It’s clear from recent feedback that we didn’t strike the right balance,” Xu tweeted. “We thought we were doing the right thing by making Dashers whole when a customer left no tip. What we missed was that some customers who did tip would feel like their tip did not matter.”
The practice first came to light earlier this year when couriers, confused about what and how they were being paid, began piecing together what little information they had as independent contractors and realized customers’ tips were sometimes helping DoorDash pay them the guaranteed base pay, not just supplementing their earnings.
But it wasn’t until a recent New York Times report renewed attention to the practice and sparked outrage among customers and the public that Xu decided to change the policy.
“Going forward, we’re changing our model – the new model will ensure that Dashers’ earnings will increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order,” Xu tweeted, saying “customer obsession” was one of the company’s “core values.” “We’ll have specific details in the coming days.”
The company’s acknowledgment is a stark about-face from when driver and tech worker backlash prompted San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin to ask the Office of Labor Standards Enforcement to investigate DoorDash for a potential labor violation in February. In an interview with Fast Company at the time, DoorDash said “we believe our model best serves both Dashers and customers. … Since implementing this pay model in 2017, Dasher retention and overall satisfaction have increased significantly while average delivery times have decreased.”
Gig Workers Rising, a San Francisco group that represents on-demand laborers, tweeted it was “remarkable” Xu attributed the reason for the policy change to customers and not to the drivers who first complained about misuse of their tips.
“It was highly disrespectful of (Xu) to dismiss drivers when he announced this policy change,” Shona Clarkson, an organizer with Gig Workers Rising, said in a statement. “He should have proactively said he would repay the wages taken from their workers. Instead, DoorDash will have pocketed millions of dollars taken from customer tips.”
“DoorDash has shown time and time again they don’t care about treating drivers with dignity and respect,” she continued. “Drivers are the backbone of their service.”
DoorDash isn’t alone in the practice. As the Los Angeles Times first revealed in February, Amazon was in some cases using customer tips to guarantee Flex drivers’ base pay. Amazon did not respond to questions about whether the company is considering changing its policy. Another company making use of this practice, Instacart, gave in to pressure and quickly changed its policy when it was called out by drivers in February, as BuzzFeed News first reported.
As is often the case, independent contractors who work for gig economy companies like DoorDash, Instacart, Amazon Flex and others are left to do the extra work of cobbling together the meager information these companies give them to understand how they operate. While DoorDash said it indicated in its FAQ that tips were sometimes added to meet pay guarantees, the language is confusing and ambiguous enough that it’s not immediately clear how tips are used.
“For each delivery, you will earn at least $1 plus customer tip, but DoorDash will ensure that your total earnings (including tips) are never less than the amount you’re guaranteed when you’re offered a delivery,” the FAQ reads.
It later says: “When base pay plus tip is more than the guaranteed minimum, you keep that larger amount.”
Workers across the gig economy demanding answers have long had to settle for templated responses from customer support representatives.
Responding to questions about tips from Flex drivers, Amazon, in emails obtained by The Times, repeatedly stated that drivers received 100% of tips but also that they “add any supplemental earnings required to meet our commitment that delivery partners earn $18-$25 per hour.”
“They just hide behind the fact that they guarantee $18” an hour, driver Jeff Lee told The Times in February. “Sounds great, but that $18 (an hour) guarantee could be all from customer tips while Amazon chips in zero.”
In lieu of clear and direct communications from companies, many gig workers turn to online forums and groups, looking for others who might have more information and banding together to trade documents and tips to ensure they are receiving what they have been promised. Some turn to creative sleuthing to get clear answers.
The asymmetry in information, fragmented nature of the workforce and fear of retaliation make it possible for companies like DoorDash and Amazon to implement questionable labor practices like these, often without significant pushback. Every so often, however, the same decentralized network dynamics can put companies in the midst of a bad PR blizzard they can’t control – as DoorDash learned this week.

Texto completo: Taking a back seat to the Apollo 11 moon landing in our coverage of things celebrating a 50th anniversary this year leaves Morris the Cat in uncharted territory.
"He was a TV star," says Tom Van Winkle, executive director of the Hinsdale Humane Society, where the advertising feline was discovered. Morris became a household name in 1969 by strutting his stuff in the first of 58 commercials for 9Lives. "It’s pretty amazing how it still resonates with people," Van Winkle says.
It’s likely that Morris was surrendered by his owner or possibly rescued off the street in 1968. But the orange-striped Tabby won over animal trainer and handler Bob Martwick of Lombard, who stopped by the shelter in Hinsdale looking for a cat to appear in commercials for 9Lives cat food. Martwick brought the calm, some would say aloof, stray cat to a meeting with the creative team at the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago, and Morris made an unforgettable impression.
"He jumped on the table … and he walked right up to the art director, the big cheese, and bumped him in the head. And then Morris just sat back," Martwick said during his many media interviews about the cat. "The art director said, ‘This is the Clark Gable of cats.’" Voiced by actor John Erwin, who also provided the voice for the popular He-Man cartoon character in the 1980s, Morris was the wisecracking, sardonic, finicky cat, who had little tolerance for anything except 9Lives cat food.
"Oh, I remember the Morris commercials. He definitely had a special personality that most cats don’t have," says Van Winkle, who now has enough Morris goodies at the Hinsdale Humane Society for a Morris shrine.
"This is a portrait from 1974," Van Winkle says of a large framed photograph of Morris that was taken in the photo studio at the L.S. Ayres department store in Indianapolis during one of the cat’s celebrity appearances.
"This was made by the company that makes the Emmy," he says, showing off a golden trophy in the image of Morris.
That trophy was given to one of nine cats from around the nation competing to be the 9Lives cat of the year in a lavish competition held in the famed Beverly Hills Hotel. Celebrity judges included Betty White and Ed Asner, remembers Jennifer Petterson, who started her public relations career in the 1980s with the third generation of Morris the Cat as part of her work with the Edelman communications firm of Chicago. Petterson and her staff flew in coach and carried the director’s chair with "Morris" written across the back, while Martwick and Morris, in a carrier tucked under the seat, flew first-class.
"You could see tufts of his fur through the carrier," remembers Petterson, who now lives in La Grange. "You didn’t dare say who he was because people would go gaga."
Petterson, who now runs her pettersonpr.com consulting firm, was one of a select few who got to hold Morris, aside from Martwick. A no-nonsense guy who still kept the crew cut he wore as a Navy pilot during World War II, Martwick also helped discover Spuds MacKenzie, the beer-selling dog of Anheuser-Busch.
"He was a lovely man, but was quiet and looked stern," says Petterson, who also worked with dog stars such as Beethoven, Lassie and the dog on "Frasier."
The original Morris died in July of 1978 at the age of 17, and his obituary in The New York Times noted Morris was "laid to rest near Mr. Martwick’s home," apparently in a backyard ceremony befitting his unpretentious roots. Martwick died in 2001 at age 75.
All subsequent replacement look-alike Morrises have been rescue cats, and the current Morris can be found on Twitter at @MorrisApproved, on Facebook, and on YouTube with his "Cat’s Eye View" on the 9Lives Cat Food channel, which notes that "America’s choosiest cat gives back" in an effort to "Live Well & Prospurr."
In 2015, Morris was one of 10 brand mascots alongside the Green Giant, Ronald McDonald, Mr. Clean and others to be honored with "A Salute to Advertising’s Greatest Icons" at the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.
During his half-century career, Morris has received thousands of fan letters, and included his paw print on his responses. He endured countless puns about his purrfect life and his catapulting to stardom. He traveled the nation, promoting feline health and animal shelters, and visiting hospitals and schools. A later Morris launched his "Morris for President" campaign in 1988 by stumping with Eleanor Mondale, took a second shot at the White House in 2012, and might actually win if he joins the 2020 race.
The original Morris had a part in Robert Altman’s 1973 film, "The Long Goodbye," and appeared alongside Burt Reynolds and Dyan Cannon in "Shamus." Morris also is listed as the author of three books.
In addition to selling cat food, later versions of Morris worked with the American Veterinary Medical Association in Schaumburg in establishing February as Cat Health Month, and led the Morris Million Cat Rescue adoption campaign in 2006.
That activism for less fortunate cats helps explain why Morris is so fondly remembered today.
"It’s still a sense of pride for the shelter and the community that this famous cat came from us," Van Winkle says. "It’s pride for the whole community because a rescue animal made it big."

REVIEW --- Editor at Large: The Best Friends of Trump and Boris? Their Foes

Texto completo: A wise old man was once asked how he'd like to be judged. "I've made a lot of friends and a few enemies in my life," he replied. "On the whole, I'm proud of my enemies."
I was reminded of that fine rule for living as I watched the unfolding political spectacles on both sides of the Atlantic this week. On Wednesday, in Washington, Robert Mueller, the special counsel in whose work the enemies of President Trump have invested so much hope, testified about his investigation before a brace of congressional committees. At exactly the same time in London, Boris Johnson, to the dismay of his many foes, finally reached the top of the greasy pole, as Benjamin Disraeli called it, and entered 10 Downing Street for the first time as prime minister.
For both leaders, the occasions were -- in different ways -- a victory over their adversaries, a long-awaited coda to a political melodrama that has played out in a very public way for the last few years.
Mr. Mueller's seven hours of faltering, flat, occasionally bafflingly underprepared testimony probably just about killed off any remaining prospect that President Trump would be impeached. Sure, the special counsel's report documents many instances of some highly reprehensible behavior by the president; the cynicism, chicanery and mendacity it describes are eye-opening.
But the appetite for impeaching Mr. Trump -- on the basis of a report that uncovered no collusion with Russia but some (mostly risibly ham-fisted and ultimately unexecuted) efforts by the president to curtail the investigation -- has more or less vanished. As Mr. Mueller fumbled and mumbled his way through his brief, you could almost hear the air going out of the balloon of indignation that has been floating over Washington for the last two and a half years. Only a few diehard Democrats, such as Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, vowed to plow onward after the hearing.
In London, Mr. Johnson's elevation similarly left the dual armies of political opponents and mass media in thinly disguised anguish. While his enemies have been trying to remove Mr. Trump from office, in Mr. Johnson's case they've been spending the same amount of time and energy trying to prevent him from entering it. Since he led the successful campaign to take Britain out of the European Union in 2016, he has been the target of all those who want to undo the referendum result and restore the glorious status quo. He's mostly avoided the quasi-legal tangle in which Mr. Trump has found himself, but the political hammering has been no less fierce.
For both men, though, it's their enemies who are in reality turning out to be their best friends.
I've written before about the hysteria these two iconoclastic figures seem to induce in the supposedly sane. It's become clear that the more certain parts of the press and TV scream Trump and Boris headlines, the more inclined it makes their supporters to come to their aid -- and the more it makes others, who don't share these passions, simply tune it all out.
This week, the loony quotient was way up there, with certain pundits and politicians ranting ever more loudly about the unfitness of the two men for office. "Boris Johnson Is How Britain Ends," said an opinion piece in the New York Times, a news organization that has, by the way, been deep into Britain's eschatology ever since the Brexit vote three years ago.
The issue is not that the two men are above reproach or that critics don't have a case.
The problem is that what really animates so many of their more deranged enemies is an absolute refusal even to come to terms with the political context that produced the Trump-Boris condominium.
It remains a constant source of astonishment to me that, three years on from the Brexit-Trump shock, the people who control most of our public dialogue seem to refuse to accept that there is any legitimacy to the political sentiments that caused it. Both phenomena are ascribed to the Neanderthal brains of racists and fools. There's never been a serious effort to understand why so many voters have found the existing political order in need of a radical change.
The irony, of course -- still entirely lost on those who oppose them -- is that both Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson are where they are largely because, given a choice, voters decided they disliked their enemies even more.

Is a billionaire populist the right choice for Democrats?

Texto completo: These are strange times, as Democratic voters consider whether the best way to take on a billionaire populist is to nominate their own inexperienced billionaire populist.
The Democratic presidential primary now has its 25th candidate, with the late entry of Bay Area billionaire Tom Steyer, a climate-change and impeachment activist.
Steyer hasn’t made a dent in the polls, but his money could shake up the race given his intent to spend $100 million.
So far, Steyer’s entry has gone over like a lead balloon. “Interviews with Democratic senators and representatives revealed significant resentment toward Steyer for his practice of using his wealth to pressure lawmakers that have not advocated for impeaching President Trump,” reported the Free Beacon.
His ads targeting anti-impeachment Democrats, and slams against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, haven’t made him many friends on the Left.
His personal wealth is an obstacle in a party that views billionaire financiers as a scourge. And his big-spending plans would find resistance with the broader electorate.
Steyer’s “Justice-Centered Climate Plan” might not go as far as the “Green New Deal,” but it’s estimated to boost government spending by $2.3 trillion — at a time when federal debt has soared to $22 trillion and both parties have agreed to obliterate spending caps.
Most observers view Steyer’s long-time environmental advocacy as sincere, but he has to deal with allegations of hypocrisy. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Steyer’s fund had “pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China, records and interviews show.” He has expressed regret for fossil-fuel investments, but it makes for bad optics among Democrats.
Other Democratic candidates are peeved at a billionaire buying his way into the presidential fray. “All campaigns should be grassroots funded in a primary,” said U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who is polling in the top tier.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, has likewise criticized the role of billionaires in the election process. Several left-leaning commentators have rolled their eyes at Steyer’s entry and have asked him to just go away.
On the good side, Steyer has taken shots at the socialistic ethic that is emerging on the Democratic left.
“Should we put a limit on what Beyoncé makes?” he asked the Guardian. “I don’t see why. I don’t think in the United States of America we should put a ceiling on how far people can go.”
He even took aim at Karl Marx. We’re dismayed that it’s even necessary to point out the flaws of Marxism in 2019, but we’ll take small victories when we get them.
In our view, the Democrats have their best chance of unseating Donald Trump by running mainstream moderate-to-liberal candidates who campaign on national unity rather than progressives who are intent on remaking the economy and ratcheting up federal spending. But that’s ultimately for their voters to decide.
Based on Democratic Party rules, however, Steyer needs a large base of small donors or decent poll numbers to make it onto the stage.
Despite our misgivings about Steyer’s candidacy, there’s nothing wrong with having a freewheeling election where the largest number of candidates pitch their ideas.
We wish Steyer and the other candidates were discussing better ideas, but that’s a discussion for another day.

Texto completo: Some years ago, when the world was young, my sainted wife took advantage of my accepting a decent-paying job to take a year off work. She envisioned happy hours reading novels, puttering in her flower garden and taking picnics in the park with our two sons, aged 10 and 7.
Alas, those outings weren't at all what she'd anticipated. Instead of enjoying the playground or playing catch, the brothers devoted much of their time in the park to bickering, throwing things at each other, and calling each other ugly names they certainly hadn't learned from her.
Also climbing trees, daring each other to jump from dangerous heights, and disappearing altogether seemingly every time she turned her head.
In short, they were nothing like she and her kid sister had been. Frustrated and sad, she turned to a clever neighbor who was finishing up his doctorate in psychology. Was there anything she should be doing differently to civilize the little brutes? After listening to her tale of woe, he made a suggestion.
"You might try thinking of them as a couple of male mammal cubs," he said. As long as they weren't actually hurting each other, he added, she should ignore the snapping and growling as she would with a litter of puppies. Motherly refereeing would only succeed in setting the terms of the next battle.
She laughed out loud, and her tension and sadness went away. A baseball coach's daughter, she'd spent much of her childhood riding in school buses with teenaged boys and recognized common sense when she heard it.
So the other day, I read her the following astonishing passage from a New York Times column by Farhad Manjoo, an advanced thinker on the gender front. Manjoo was arguing that we should purge the hurtful pronouns "he" and "she" from the language in favor of the gender-neutral "they."
What he wants us to say is: "Did you read Farhad's latest column? They've really gone off the deep end this time!"
Actually, English already has a gender-neutral pronoun: "it." That's what we call a dog or cat when we're uncertain of its sex. Problem is, Manjoo's byline photo shows a luxuriant, neatly trimmed beard, so that won't work. Dude looks like a lady not at all.
"It" is also singular, while "they" is plural.
Anyway, that's not the remarkable passage I read to my wife. Instead, it was the following meditation on Manjoo's own children:
"But it was only when I had a son and a daughter of my own that I recognized how powerfully gendered constructs shape our development. From their very earliest days, my kids, fed by marketing and entertainment and (surely) their parents' modeling, seemed to hem themselves into silly gender norms. They gravitated to boy toys and girl toys, boy colors and girl colors, boy TV shows and girl TV shows. This was all so sad to me: I see them limiting their thoughts and their ambitions, their preferences and their identity, their very liberty, only to satisfy some collective abstraction. And there's little prospect for escape: Gender is a ubiquitous prison for the mind, reinforced everywhere, by everyone, and only rarely questioned."
So Manjoo's son goes in for toy trucks, his daughter plays Barbies, and he thinks they're in prison.
Poor things.
"So what kind of professor is he?" my wife wanted to know. Only an academic, in her experience, could peddle such flagrant nonsense and earn a living. I explained that Manjoo is a columnist for the Times, a newspaper seemingly committed to LGTBQ advocacy of every imaginable description. He's also frequently heard on NPR.
Only days before, Michelle Goldberg, a Times columnist I admire, praised "Drag Queen Story Hour" -- men dressed as women reading to second-graders. The column was illustrated by a photo of a female impersonator looking like a member of Insane Clown Posse reading "It's OK To Be Different" to kids.
OK, sure. But can't we please leave second-graders out of it?
But then, I've been living on a farm, and I'm here to tell you it's not pronouns that make bulls different from cows. Or stallions different from mares or roosters a whole lot noisier than hens.
Culture is one thing; biology, quite another.
Which is not to deny that we hairless primates are more complicated than barnyard animals, nor the almost infinite complexity of human sexual expression. Nor to mitigate one's empathy for individuals living on the boundaries of sexual identity, God bless them every one.
People don't choose gender; gender chooses them.
However, no form of grammatical pretense will change anything important. Language is itself organic to culture and can't be altered by fiat. Indeed, the very effort has about it a distinct odor of fakery: the kind of thing that would make a man describe his own children as prisoners of their own individual choices.

Texto completo: Manuel Gámez, el hombre hondureño cuya hija, Heydi Gámez García, murió luego de intentar suicidarse, podrá permanecer 30 días mas en Nueva York con su familia antes de detener que volver a un centro de detención , ha reportado la cadena de noticias CNN.
Gámez fue detenido por las autoridades de inmigración en junio cuando intentó cruzar la frontera, lo que sumió a su hija de 13 años en un delicado estado emocional.
El migrante hondureño fue llevado a un centro de detención de migrantes en Houston, Texas, pero recibió un permiso especial el pasado 13 de julio para darle el ultimo adiós a su hija, quien había sido declarada con muerte cerebral luego de que intentara quitarse la vida en Nueva York, donde vivía con unos familiares.
El permiso que las autoridades le habían concedió a Gámez iba a expirar este sábado, no obstante, las autoridades le han dado 30 días mas para que permanezca con su familia luego de que la menor fuera desconectada del soporte vital la semana pasada.
Aníbal Romero, abogado de Manuel Gámez, ha dicho que la extensión de 30 días le permitirá a su equipo legal ganar tiempo para buscar la manera con la que el migrante pueda quedarse en Estados Unidos.
Gámez, de 34 años, había vivido previamente en Nueva York por ocho años, pero tuvo que volver a Honduras en 2014 para encargarse de su hija, a quien había dejado con los abuelos.
El hombre ha dicho que tuvo que retornar a su país de origen porque miembros de la MS-13 mataron a su padre luego de que este se negara a pagarles al ser extorsionado.
Gámez envió a su hija a Estados Unidos en 2015 para protegerla de la violencia en Honduras pero decidió quedarse en el país centroamericano en caso de que deportaran a la menor.
En septiembre de 2015, luego de pasar casi dos meses en centros de acojo de menores, la niña, de 9 años en ese entonces, pudo llegar a Nueva York, donde la recibieron unos familiares. Su tía, Zoila Gámez, quien también decidió dejar Honduras, logró reunirse con ella meses después, ha reportado el diario The New York Times.
El padre emprendió el camino de vuelta a Estados Unidos en 2016, luego de que a la menor le concedieran el asilo debido a las amenazas por parte de pandillas en contra de su familia.
A diferencia de la travesía en la que se había embarcado nueve años atrás, Gámez terminó detenido en McAllen, Texas.
Gámez le dijo a los agentes de inmigración que temía por su vida. Sin embargo, las autoridades le respondieron que su miedo no era creíble y lo deportaron en noviembre de 2016.
El migrante hondureño fue detenido una vez más en septiembre de 2017 cerca a Santa Teresa, Nuevo México. Fue deportado después de pasar 45 días bajo custodia .
Con cada intento fallido, la menor empezó a perder la esperanza de reunirse con su padre y a presentar síntomas de estrés emocional.
En junio de este año, Gámez fue arrestado por la Patrulla Fronteriza luego de entrar ilegalmente al país. Según los familiares de la menor, la noticia de la detención le causó gran impacto, al punto que perdió el apetito y no quiso salir de su habitación por varios días.
No obstante, la situación se tornó aun mas complicada el pasado 3 de julio, cuando trató de quitarse la vida. Fue una de sus tías, preocupada por su estado emocional, quien entró a la habitación para ofrecerle algo de comer y se encontró con la aterradora escena: la niña colgada de un cable.
Según los médicos, la menor estaba “neurológicamente devastada”. La adolescente ha sido declarada con muerte cerebral. Su padre, quien emprendió el viaje a Estados Unidos varias veces sin éxito, recibió el 13 de julio un permiso especial de 14 días para poder despedirse de su hija moribunda.
Cuando Gámez aterrizó en el aeropuerto de Newark desconocía el estado de la niña.
Al enterarse del grave estado de salud de la menor, el padre hondureño decidió desconectarla luego de darle el ultimo adiós.
Los órganos de la menor fueron donados por la familia Gámez.
“Como padre no tienes esperanzas ni sueños para ti mismo, todos tus sueños son para tus hijos,” le dijo Gámez a The New York Times antes de la muerte de la niña.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – On Thursday, member of Congress and Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard launched a lawsuit against Google claiming "serious and continuing violations of Tulsi’s right to free speech" because of Google's suspension of the Gabbard campaign's advertising account during the first Democratic presidential debate.
The campaign asks for an immediate court injunction to stop further meddling from Google and payment of financial damages.
According to the lawsuit, filed by lawyers representing Gabbard's campaign Tulsi Now Inc. , Google suspended the Gabbard campaign's advertising account for several hours during the first Democratic debate, when Gabbard was briefly the most-searched candidate on Google.

"On June 28, 2019, millions of Americans asked Google about Tulsi Gabbard," the lawsuit says. "Tulsi sought to answer them. But Google silenced her. "
In response, Google says "automated systems that flag unusual activity on all advertiser accounts -- including large spending changes" were to blame for the suspension of Gabbard's account. Google says their automated systems aim to "prevent fraud and protect our customers. "
"In this case, our system triggered a suspension and the account was reinstated shortly thereafter," said Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto. "We are proud to offer ad products that help campaigns connect directly with voters, and we do so without bias toward any party or political ideology. "
The New York Times first reported the lawsuit. Warning of the "dominance of big tech companies," Gabbard told the Times, "This is a threat to free speech, fair elections and to our democracy, and I intend to fight back on behalf of all Americans. ”
Gabbard's campaign website took a more aggressive tone.
"Tulsi Takes Google to Court Over Election Interference," said a banner at the top of Gabbard's campaign website, mirroring language about Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Republicans have long attacked tech giants like Google for what they see as an ideological bias. Last month, President Donald Trump held a "Social Media Summit" at the White House, where he hosted prominent conservative detractors of tech companies.
Ahead of the summit, Trump railed on Twitter against the "tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression" of the tech companies and said they would not be able to do so for much longer.
"if Google can do this to Tulsi, a combat veteran and four term Congresswoman who is running for the nation’s highest office, Google can do this to any candidate, from any party, running for any office in the United States," says a statement on Gabbard's website.

'The Summer of Try'; Unlikely foursome racks up hits while taking show on the road

Texto completo: It's been almost five years since four BuzzFeed employees filmed an experiment in which they tried on ladies' underwear from Victoria's Secret. From this simple premise, an empire would be born as the onetime strangers would come to be known as the popular comedy troupe the Try Guys, launching a series of video challenges that included attempting UFC Fighting, swimming with sharks and undergoing labor pain simulation.
A year after splitting amicably from BuzzFeed and launching their own company, 2nd Try, the Try Guys just hit 6 million subscribers on YouTube, but they aren't limiting themselves to viral videos. Entering a phase they've dubbed "The Summer of Try," the creators have launched a podcast, released a bestselling book and have embarked on a national live tour of 20 cities.
For the uninitiated, the Try Guys comprise four millennials who work seamlessly as a team but also bring their own skill sets to the proceedings. Keith Habersberger, Ned Fulmer, Zach Kornfeld and Eugene Lee Yang were all producers behind the camera at BuzzFeed when they were thrown together to make the original video with ladies' underwear. None of them had met previously - though Habersberger and Fulmer came from improv backgrounds and estimate they had about 200 mutual Facebook friends.
The casting was mainly out of necessity.
"At some point we had to use each other for videos and I started popping up," says Yang, who originally had no performance aspirations. "I thought it was just something to pay the rent so I could make my indie feature."
The group agrees that if someone had set out to cast an ensemble, things would not have worked out for them. "No one would cast us," Kornfeld says. "And in another world, I don't know if we'd be friends. But we have a shared brain at this point."
Their first collaboration was an instant hit with viewers. "We like to say we came up in the world's largest and fastest focus group," Kornfeld says. "The audience said, 'Hey, this is a thing.' It took on a life of its own."
Because they began as producers, they had studied what connected with audiences; they could even tell what jokes people were going back and rewatching. The audience also became an important part of the feedback.
"We've listened to little things, like they said, 'Oh, Zach is like a little turtle,' " recalls Habersberger, which prompted them to launch a series called "Game Time" where they play various games, all dressed as different animals. "It was an idea they gave us."
While they flourished at BuzzFeed for four years, the choice was made to branch off on their own in June 2018, and now they find themselves leading a company that includes a staff of 14 employees, themselves included. ("With health care and a 401(k) plan!" Kornfeld notes.)
As viewers got to know them organically, personalities emerged and their audience became invested in their lives. Fulmer was the first of the group to get married and have a child, and the others began teasing him over how much he talks about his wife. Habersberger, who at one time was best-known for being the tallest member of the group, became known as a foodie who was open to trying experiences including eating the entire Taco Bell menu. Kornfeld has been open about his health struggles with Ankylosing spondylitis, an autoimmune disease that causes chronic pain, and has found that his openness with his struggle has inspired and empowered viewers.
Yang, who is Asian and recently came out as gay in a powerful performance video, says that audiences first got to know him as someone who doesn't like babies.
"One of the big benefits of having sort of been discovered in an online environment is that people get to know you because of the sheer fact of repetition," Yang says. "What the internet got to know about me first, or very quickly, was that I wasn't just the Asian guy or the gay guy, I was the guy who disliked babies. That was a great learning curve; they could see me as a friend or someone that they knew. I think the beauty of a lot of the stuff we do is, we transcended what people would first say. I think that's where Try Guys really started shining, giving a full breadth of human experience."
For their touring show, "Legends of the Internet," they've boiled the internet down to four facets that they each address: Habersberger is "food," Fulmer is "love," Kornfeld is "fun" and Yang is "gay." The show, which Fulmer calls "a full-length rock-and-roll comedy extravaganza," opened in June in Los Angeles and will tour the U.S. through July before heading to Australia.
In addition to audience interaction and bringing some of their favorite games to the stage, the show is a full-on performance, complete with choreographed musical numbers and pyrotechnics.
"We've found we really enjoy performing live and we have this really great cast dynamic and we found that it extends beyond the screen," Habersberger says. "And when we meet our fans we don't want it to be something simple, we want to be bringing a show and creating entertainment."
In May they launched "The TryPod," a weekly podcast that gives listeners a look behind the scenes of their adventures.
Their book, "The Hidden Power of F*cking Up," was released June 18 and went to No. 1 on The New York Times bestseller list under advice, how-to and miscellaneous. A blend of genuine self-help and humor, the book tasked each of them to do something outside their comfort zones.
"We challenged ourselves to do things that were opposite of us," Habersberger says. "I led the health section and went vegan for two months and started exercising."
Fulmer took on fashion. "We each attacked the thing we were worst at," he says.
As for the inevitable question if there's anything they won't try, nothing seems to be off the table.
"We brainstorm and look at trending topics," Fulmer says. "But in general we try to make content that relates to people's passions and identities. So there's never going to be enough ideas."

Texto completo: You have likely, by now, seen or heard news of the tweets.
In the latest episode of the President's endless Twitter lunacy, Trump rolled out one of the stalest and crudest lines from the library of American racism, shrieking that four Democratic congresswomen of color collectively known as the "Squad"-Alexandria Oca-sio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley- should "go back" to the "places from which they came."
Their crime is a scandalous one: these women of color, elected to more humanely wield American power and policy, have dared to criticize the inner-workings and consequences of American power and policy.
The ordeal has swallowed an entire week of press attention. Trump has gone on to level up his attack by inexplicably labeling the congresswomen, who have called for a more inclusive and egalitarian future, "a very racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart." Trump whom, prior to taking office was caught on tape saying he could grab women by their [privates], asserts that the congresswomen should "apologize" for their "foul language." Trump then glowingly watched over a North Carolina crowd as they chanted "send her back," with "her" being Somali-born congress-woman Ilhan Omar. Trump initially tried to distance himself from the outburst of white nationalism before U-turning to call the crowd "incredible patriots." Omar, meanwhile, hasn't flinched, embracing her role as an adversary and "nightmare to this president" whose "policies are a nightmare to us."
Detroit's own Rep. Rashida Tlaib has similarly shaken many corners of elite media and Washington politics with her unbending support for Palestinian self-determination and calls to dismantle racial and economic inequality. She responded to the president's tirade in her address at the annual NAACP convention held in Detroit this week: "I'm not going nowhere, not until I impeach this president."
Of the many things worth considering about this moment, I'm most curious about two intertwined threads. Firstly, when Trump blatantly suggests that the United States belongs to white men, he is merely taking his place in a long tradition in American politics.
A second and related point comes from Rep. Ocasio-Cor-tez. At a press conference held by the full "Squad" of congress-women, the Bronx native cut to the heart of Trump's fear and paranoia: his baldly racist tweets were a way to "avoid...debating the policy" because the president can't defend the indefensible, such as a healthcare agenda that basically amounts to a policy of "Americans do not deserve healthcare."
On the first point, it's worth highlighting that when Trump cranked out those tweets, he violated what was, until recently, a core principle of modern political decorum.
The principle isn't that people who serve in the nation's most powerful institutions shouldn't hold racist beliefs or craft policies that are sure to have racist consequences. It's that they should be stealth about it. Since the popular movements of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, which made significant strides toward civilizing this country, the rule has been that the things white supremacists used to say out loud must now be smuggled in through less obviously racist dog-whistles that water racist hostilities all the same.
So instead of breaking with some noble tradition, as centrist figureheads like Joe Biden continue to imply, Trump's brand of racism is in powerful company that stretches back to the country's founding.
Twelve U.S. presidents, after all, owned black human beings. Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's Vice President and successor, spoke venomously of black incompetence while tearing at the thin fabric of Reconstruction, and with it the first shot black Americans had at political life. Woodrow Wilson segregated the federal government and screened the racist film "Birth of A Nation" in the White House, gushing afterward about its KKK-loving delusions. This legacy sweeps all the way to the present.
Except, again, it now comes camouflaged. It is Nixon's War on Drugs. Reagan's Welfare Queen. Bill and Hillary Clinton's Superpredators.
Trump has reversed that by stripping away the camouflage. And that reversal, it must be said, is simply a return to a path that many powerful Americans have driven enthusiastically down.
But the path may also be narrowing. It was during the 2016 campaign that Corey Robin, a political science professor and author of the book "The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump," spotted a strange historical wrinkle to Trump's racism.
As he put it in the weeks after Trump's inauguration: "... Trump's [campaign] rhetoric was a sign of the weakening of the conservative cause: a racist or nativist dog whistle used to be enough to mobilize majorities. No more: now the party needs a megaphone..."
And as New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie points out, "Trump's popularity has taken its sharpest dips whenever he goes full racist" hitting new lows after white nationalist violence in Charlottesville and dipping "again into the 30s after 'shithole countries.'" So, while Trump's sloppy racism was certainly key to his election, it may also be the spasms of a movement that is both dying and desperately clinging to power.
There's no doubt about one thing: the forces that swept Trump into the White House still sit at the absolute peak of political power. But all signs suggest they aren't enjoying the view. Instead, they appear to be scared stiff by a radically different movement, one that's inclusive and egalitarian in nature and whose champions in Congress are four progressive women of color. Their agenda is loaded with widely popular policy ideas, like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and a jobs guarantee that stand to improve the material lives of millions.
Trump and his backers in both private and public halls of power are rightly shaken by what 'The Squad' collectively represents-a movement that could someday dethrone them and potentially distribute power and wealth more evenly across society.

Texto completo: You’d be forgiven for assuming the new Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction has had the most riders of any Disneyland attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened — but you’d be off by a long shot.
Disneyland announced last week that 1 million riders have ridden the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge debuted. That statistical peek behind the curtain tells us a lot about the ride capacity of the E-Ticket attraction and the number of people visiting the new themed land .
The Ridgeway family of Ocean Springs, Miss. were recognized as the 1 millionth riders of Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run on July 16, according to Disneyland.
Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily crowd sizes and ride wait times at theme parks, says that based on the available information Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has averaged about 27,000 riders per day since May 31, approximately 76% of the attraction’s ride capacity.
That pales in comparison to It’s a Small World (57,000 riders per day) and Pirates of the Carribbean (55,000) during the same period and is just short of Big Thunder Mountain (35,000), Hyperspace Mountain (31,000) and Indiana Jones Adventure (31,000), according to Touring Plans estimates.
You read that right: The half century-old Small World has had way more riders than the 2-month-old Smugglers Run.
But of course, Small World and Pirates are high-capacity people-eater rides that vacuum up visitors and often still manage to maintain relatively short wait times.
Disneyland officials said Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has performed extremely well with very little downtime during the million-rider run thanks to the hard work and dedication of cast members and Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative arm of the company.
“Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is among our highest rated attractions and we are thrilled by the guest reviews we have received since opening,” Disneyland officials said in a statement.

Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge officially debuted on May 31 after a series of employee and media previews. Disneyland instituted a reservation-only period for Galaxy’s Edge that ran through June 23. Beginning June 24, the new Star Wars land was opened to all visitors. A virtual queue boarding pass system put in place to manage crowds has been rarely used.
While the million-rider mark sounds impressive, other Disneyland attractions likely outpaced Smugglers Run during the same period.
During Smugglers million-rider run, Small World and Pirates could have hit the same mark operating at approximately 45% of their hourly capacity while Big Thunder could have done it at 70% capacity and Hyperspace Mountain at 80%, according to Touring Plans.
Smuggler’s Run can accommodate up to 1,800 riders per hour, according to the New York Times.
The average wait time for Smugglers Run dropped from 47 minutes on opening day to 22 minutes on June 23, according to Touring Plans data. The average Smugglers Run wait time spiked to 59 minutes on June 24 — the first day guests could enter the land without a reservation — and reached a high of 89 minutes over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
Using Smugglers Run ridership as a guide, Touring Plans estimates that Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge has attracted between 2.7 million and 5 million visitors since opening day.
“My strong suspicion is that the number is toward the bottom end of that range based on the low wait times we saw throughout June,” said Len Testa, president of Touring Plans, an online subscription service that lets users create custom theme park itineraries.
Disneyland rarely if ever talks about attendance numbers or ridership figures.
Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is the lone anchor attraction in Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge until the Rise of the Resistance dark ride debuts on Jan. 17, six months behind schedule.
To the surprise of many theme park observers, Disneyland has experienced lighter than usual summertime traffic since Galaxy’s Edge opened May 31.

Texto completo: A discussion of the New York Times best-selling book, “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,” will be held Wednesday evening at the Lantana branch of the Palm Beach County Library.
Sponsored by the county Criminal Justice Commission and the library, the free event will begin at 6:30 p.m. at the library at 4020 Lantana Road.
Criminal justice experts will lead a discussion of Michelle Alexander’s book that examines the caste-like system that led to the incarceration of millions of black Americans. Once incarcerated, they were “relegated to a permanent second-class status,” Alexander said of the conclusions of her widely acclaimed book.
The discussion is one of a series of programs designed to give county residents greater understanding of the criminal justice system, sponsors said. The series, “Informed and Engaged: Criminal Justice,” is funded by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundations’ Safety and Justice Challenge.

Texto completo: Megan Rapinoe scored big in Sonoma Valley earlier this week.
The fleet and outspoken soccer superstar spoke and posed with fans during and outside an invitation-only conference on mobile marketing that was headquartered at the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa.
Rapinoe, co-captain of the U.S. national team that on July 7 won the Women’s World Cup in France, was the “Inspirational Speaker” at the elite summit of the Mobile Marketing Association. Appearing in a post-dinner talk Sunday at Hanson of Sonoma Distillery, she engaged in conversation with interviewer Kara Swisher, the New York Times contributor and co-founder of Recode, the tech news website that earlier this year joined with Vox Media.
“It was phenomenal,” the Carneros distillery’s Scott Hanson said of the Rapinoe-Swisher talk before about 250 guests of the marketing group’s summit for chief executives and chief marketing officers. “They talked about a little of everything.”
The stage conversation followed a dinner held at Ceja Vineyards.
Hanson said Rapinoe did address her widely publicized spat with the Trump White House, which she famously declared her soccer team would not visit were it invited upon winning the World Cup.
The vodka-from-grapes distiller said Rapinoe told the crowd Sunday the conflict was old news when it broke, as she’d made the remark about the unlikelihood of a White House visit last January, months before the tournament.
After her remarks went viral, but still before the U.S. team’s triumph, Trump tweeted in response, “Megan should WIN first before she TALKS!”
Sunday night at the Burndale Road distillery, Rapinoe also said something to the assembled tech company executives that she repeated to ESPN FC on Monday.
Recalled event host Hanson, “She said the publicity around it (the White House controversy) was a little bit disruptive but it also inspired them and it charged her up.”
In the interview with ESPN on Monday, the chameleon-haired soccer forward said, “If anything, it kind of united everyone around us and united the team sort of around itself.
“And it was kind of emboldening in a way.”
In the distillery talk to invitees, Rapinoe also touched on the quest to resolve the inequity between what professional male soccer players are paid — including those for the men’s national team — and what she and her teammates are paid.
Hanson said it impressed him that Rapinoe spoke without anger or bitterness.
“We were taken by her groundedness, and candor, and honesty,” he said. He added that he and his wife, Judy, spent some time with Rapinoe and found her delightfully personable.
“I enjoyed talking to her,” he said.
The soccer star made a big splash also when she dropped in hours before the talk at El Molino Central, the acclaimed Mexican restaurant in Boyes Hot Springs.

Texto completo: En un operativo llamado “Cross Check” (“Verificación Cruzada”) , la oficina de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) logró la captura de 899 inmigrantes en dos meses, afirmó el director interino de la agencia Matt Albence .
El funcionario especificó a The New York Times que esa movilización ocurrió entre el 13 de mayo y el 11 de julio, es decir antes de las llamadas “grandes redadas” anunciadas por el presidente Donald Trump .
“Lo que descubrimos es que la mayoría ni siquiera se presentó a su primera audiencia” , dijo Albence. “Además les enviamos cartas para que tuvieran la oportunidad de entregarse y organizar un proceso de salida más ordenado, lo que incluía el tiempo para organizar sus asuntos y programar vuelos en aerolíneas comerciales”.

Texto completo: Melania y Donald Trump anunciaron el lunes que celebrarán su segunda Cena de Estado en septiembre, celebrando su tercer año en la Casa Blanca. Para ese momento, los Obama ya habían celebrado cinco .
La primera dama Melania Trump, a última hora de la tarde del lunes, no había tuiteado sobre el evento, pero el anuncio de la Casa Blanca decía: “El Presidente y la Primera Dama darán la bienvenida al Primer Ministro de Australia y a la señora Morrison a la Casa Blanca el 20 de septiembre de 2019 para una visita oficial, que incluirá una cena de estado”.
Se espera que Melania Trump, quien recibió algunas críticas sobre cómo planeó la primera Cena de Eestado para el presidente francés, Emmanuel Macron , y su esposa, siga la tradición y se haga cargo de la segunda cena de estado también.
“La Primera Dama y su personal son responsables de la elaborada planificación de la ceremonia de la cena estatal” , afirma un artículo de la Asociación Histórica de la Casa Blanca. “Estas cenas formales implican la creación de invitaciones y listas de invitados, menús, flores, mesas, asientos y entretenimiento para la noche. La Primera Dama trabaja estrechamente con su secretaria social, el personal de la residencia ejecutiva y el Departamento de Estado para coordinar cada detalle. de este evento muy especial”.
“La visita celebrará la estrecha amistad y la historia compartida de nuestros dos países y reafirmará nuestra visión común para la paz mundial, la seguridad y la prosperidad”, indica la publicación de la Casa Blanca.
Melania Trump fue criticada en abril de 2018 por la corta lista de invitados de la primera Cena de Estado, que no incluía miembros demócratas del Congreso.
La entonces vocera de la primera dama, Stephanie Grisham, desmintió las posibles dudas sobre el éxito de Melania Trump en la planificación del evento.
“Probablemente no vamos a obtener el crédito que merecemos, pero sé que este equipo es excelente y ella sabe que este equipo es excelente”, dijo Grisham a The New York Times. “No hemos fallado, y ella no ha fallado”.

RCA's 100th anniversary: How a Russian immigrant changed our communication methods forever

Resumen: Why's the RCA story relevant 100 years later? It's the story of a Russian immigrant who came to America and changed our communication methods forever.

Texto completo: Tech fans of a certain age will remember the letters RCA and how dominant the company once was.
RCA, originally known as the Radio Corp. of America, was the firm that 100 years ago helped give birth to radio, and later paved the way for television, broadcasting, and recorded music. Back in the day it also popularized VCRs.
And while today RCA is a shell of its former self, alive only as a trademark that's available for licensing, it's good to remember that "the technology invented back then still exists today," says Tim Sarnoff. He's the grandson of the founder, David Sarnoff, a Russian immigrant who came to America in 1900 and changed our communication methods forever.

Today we live in a different world from David Sarnoff's era where television is all about on-demand programming, via streaming or time-shifted viewing.
Tom Sarnoff, David's 92 year-old son, says David would "be impressed," with the changes, "How the world is now all together was his dream. He wanted to connect everyone, particularly on the news and information side. "
Tom tells of how news was delivered during David's childhood. Either by newspapers, or by walking to the nearby town to spread the word. "So by the time you got there, the news was a day old. " Radio, he adds, "brought the world to everyone's living room. "
GE went on to sell off the various divisions, including RCA Records, which had been home to Elvis Presley, David Bowie and the Jefferson Airplane, as well as TV and radio manufacturing.
RCA Records today is currently owned by Sony, and features such artists as Christina Aguilera and Alicia Keys. NBC is today owned by the Comcast Corporation, home to the largest cable TV operation, Universal Studios and the theme park.
Unlike the internet millionaires of today, the Sarnoff family "lived comfortably, but we weren't billionaires," says Tim Sarnoff. "We didn't lack for anything. "
According to a 1971 New York Times obit, David Sarnoff was paid a $200,000 a year salary during his reign, and was a large stockholder. , He apparently didn't have enough stock to endow his heirs with internet like multi millions.
Today, many people don't realize how important RCA was to the music we listen to, TV shows we watch and radio stations we call into.
"It's kind of depressing," admits Tom. "When I was growing up, RCA dominated TV and radio. Everybody knew what RCA was. Today you'd find very few people who knew what RCA was. "

How He Escaped From His Own Private Krypton

Texto completo: If anything sums up J. Michael Straczynski's memoir, it is "Doesn't matter, get up, keep fighting," a mantra that appears seven times in the epilogue.
The preceding pages of the book, "Becoming Superman: My Journey From Poverty to Hollywood," out on Tuesday from Harper Voyager, make it clear why. Straczynski, a writer of screenplays and comic books best known for creating the television series "Babylon 5," chronicles a life that in his childhood was dominated by dysfunction -- his father was a physically abusive Nazi sympathizer, his mother was distant and frequently institutionalized -- and as an adult by professional success that came with its own tensions and crises.
Superman, whom Straczynski discovers through the 1950s TV series starring George Reeves, shows him that life can be different. Unlike his father, Straczynski writes, Superman "was kind and honest and fair, and he never hit anybody who didn't hit him first."
The idea that people can escape their circumstances inspired Straczynski, 65, to write "Becoming Superman." "For years I've been saying at conventions, if I can do it, anybody can do it," he said during an interview this month. "But that doesn't mean anything if you don't know the context."
The context that he describes in his book is upsetting. Straczynski was born in Paterson, N.J., but his family moved frequently (21 times in 19 years). His father beats him with a belt and his fists, at one point shredding his beloved comic book collection as punishment. His mother, who Straczynski writes was beaten and raped by his father, suffered from depression and was emotionally absent.
"Once when she was petting her cat, her hand accidentally brushed mine. It's the only time I can remember her touching me with affection," he writes. Both of his parents died years ago, but the book includes corroboration from relatives, including one of his sisters.
Straczynski said he had not previously discussed his past because he was afraid of what people would think of him. "It's hard when you tell someone, yeah, I was conceived in a brothel. Where do you go from there in the conversation?" (His mother, he writes, was working there during one of her attempts to flee his father.) "I just got tired of running. I got tired of living a lie."
As he has begun to promote the book at comic book conventions, Straczynski has discovered that his fraught upbringing strikes a chord with some fans. Adam-Troy Castro, who is reviewing the book for Sci Fi Magazine, emailed the author about his own father. "Clearly, if this is a terrible childhood contest, you 'win.' But nevertheless, there were enough things in your account that resonated with my memories."
Straczynski develops a love of storytelling through comic books. As a boy, he reads each issue at least twice: once as a fan and again to study how the action and dialogue is presented. "It never occurred to me that I might one day want to write comics for a living," he writes. "I just wanted to peek under the hood and figure out how the engine worked."
He later discovers science fiction and meets Rod Serling, the creator of "The Twilight Zone," who advises him on his writing: "First, cut every third adjective. Second, never let them stop you from telling the story you want to tell." He comes across and later befriends Harlan Ellison, who advises him on his writing in more colorful language.
When Straczynski recounts his career, each job seems to head toward a breaking point. In the 1980s, he wrote a spec script for the cartoon "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe," which grabbed the attention of a producer and led to a staff job. Straczynski then worked on a spinoff series, "She-Ra: Princess of Power," but quit when the animation studio didn't credit him as a story editor.
He continued to land and quit jobs in television, including work on the cartoon "The Real Ghostbusters" and the live-action series "Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future" and "Jake and the Fatman," repeatedly leaving over creative differences. Asked whether he regretted any of his career decisions, he answered, "Yes and no."
"Would my life be easier if I didn't do those things? Absolutely," Straczynski said. As any kind of artist, he added, "you have to decide what you will stand for and what you will not."
His TV credits include shows ranging from "Murder, She Wrote" to "Babylon 5" and the Netflix series "Sense8." In comics, he worked on the Amazing Spider-Man for six years, including an issue responding to Sept. 11, as well as Superman: Earth One, which revisited the hero's origin for modern times.
Now Straczynski, who lives in Los Angeles, is developing a pilot for a USA Networks fantasy series; writing the origin story for the superheroes of AWA, a new comics publisher; and working on a feature adaptation of his comic book series, Rising Stars, for MGM. He also has a novel coming from Simon & Schuster.
"He's the most versatile and complete writer I've ever worked with," said Axel Alonso, the chief creative officer of AWA, who began working with Straczynski nearly 20 years ago at Marvel. "His ability to find unexplored nooks and crannies in characters who have been around for decades and mine them is unparalleled."
At some point, when he slows down enough to make room, Straczynski hopes to teach writing. "I think it is important, if you reach any level of success, to send the elevator down for the next guy," he said. But he isn't looking for an elite perch.
"If you can afford U.S.C. or U.C.L.A., you don't need me," he said. "The guys at the junior college who can't afford those resources -- that's where I can do the most good."

An earlier version of this article incorrectly described "Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future." It was a live-action series, not a cartoon.

Texto completo: When it was announced last week that President Trump had given the green light for Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, which the senator has reportedly done at least once, it was another example of how President Trump is willing to think outside the box.
It also freaked out right-wing hawks.
Conservative talk host Mark Levin had a complete meltdown, calling Paul “reckless.” Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain tweeted, derisively, “Is this really the guy you want to send over to talk to Iran?” linking to a post that called Paul a “pacifist.”
There were smarter critiques. The Washington Free Beacon’s Adam Kredo, Washington Examiner’s Philip Klein, and Bloomberg’s Eli Lake all wondered if Paul was an Iran dupe who might become the new John Kerry in his quest for diplomacy. Kredo reported, “Multiple U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter told the Free Beacon that Paul is allowing himself to be used by this pro-Iran echo chamber in its last-ditch effort to rescue (Obama’s) nuclear deal … ”
“Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, played John Kerry like a fiddle,” wrote Klein, believing the same fate awaits Paul.
Their chorus is clear: The U.S. can’t trust Iran. They will never comply. America would show weakness. We’re empowering Iran. These are fair concerns.
But this is also how hawks reacted when President Ronald Reagan broke bread with Mikhail Gorbachev over three decades ago.
When Reagan first met with Gorbachev in 1985, Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich described it as “the most dangerous summit for the West since Adolf Hitler met with Neville Chamberlain in 1938 in Munich.”
Instead of igniting another World War, Reagan’s diplomacy efforts actually quickened the end of the Cold War, something Gingrich would later praise him for.
In 1986, neoconservative godfather Norman Podhoretz slammed Reagan’s Russia efforts as “appeasement” and accused him of having "shamed himself and the country" in his "craven eagerness" to give the Soviets a nuclear advantage. Podhoretz accused Reagan of “following a strategy of helping the Soviet Union stabilize its empire.”
Worries that diplomacy might unintentionally strengthen a dangerous regime were rampant on the Right during Reagan’s Russia outreach. Similarly, Klein wrote of Trump and Paul’s willingness to reach out to Iran, “there is also a risk of understating the seriousness of the threat from Iran and overestimating the earnest chances for a peace deal.”
Reagan’s hawkish critics didn’t believe he took the Soviet threat seriously in his second term. Virtually every hawk mad at Paul right now believes he is aiding the Iranians more than the U.S.
Any nuclear deal must include legitimate inspections, and hawks today are suspicious those will ever occur in any serious way. It is a reasonable worry.
It was also a concern during Reagan’s time. In the January 1988 article “The Right Against Reagan,” the New York Times reported, “While conceding that the on-site inspection provisions are unprecedented, the Senators will argue that the treaty's verification is still far from airtight.”
Trump, with Paul’s help, could negotiate the best deal imaginable, but hawks will always say it isn’t good enough. Any deal will always be “far from airtight.” For hawks, the very notion of a deal is a bad deal.
Dialogue is unwelcome. But bombing? They are less hesitant about that.
Those who would support a military strike on Iran also seem to believe Paul and others on the Right who want to avoid war are tools for that regime. Kredo writes, "[Iran] seem to have updated their disinformation propaganda playbook by making outreach to Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson.”
This is an old canard. In the 1980s, conservative activist and independent presidential candidate Howard Phillips, who would later become an anti-war paleoconservative, excoriated Reagan in his second term by saying the president was “fronting as a useful idiot for Soviet propaganda.” The late Charles Krauthammer even called Russia ‘dupe’ Reagan “ignorant and pathetic.”
Hawks did not mince words.
When Reagan met Gorbachev in Geneva in November 1985, the American president whispered to the Soviet leader, “I bet the hard-liners in both our countries are bleeding when we shake hands.”
They still bleed. What Trump or Paul might achieve, despite their hawkish critics, remains to be seen.
But Ronald Reagan proved his haters wrong. Every last one of them.

Texto completo: Dropping the F-bomb on a hot mic would be an embarrassing gaffe for any television journalist. But Phoenix anchor Kari Lake of Fox 10 (KSAZ) got more than the usual good-natured raspberries when she was caught saying what she really thinks in a botched Facebook Live appearance.
The controversy isn't about the profanity, it's about politics. Of course it is.
Specifically, it's about Lake's participation on a social media site called Parler, which was launched last year as a "free speech alternative" to Twitter. But the F-bomb certainly helped the story "blow up."
After Lake's candid exchange with co-anchor John Hook was reposted July 15 on an industry blog site, Lake was replaced with a backup anchor for the 9 p.m. newscast, and again the next afternoon at 4. By the 4 p.m. Friday broadcast, she still wasn't on; Fox 10 hasn't explained her absence or responded to repeated requests for comment.
Could Kari Lake lose her job over one accidental "Candid Camera" moment? Probably not. But even if you think all of this is a tempest in a teapot, it does raise difficult questions about journalistic ethics in the 21st century. And it's also a great case study for how a social media storm develops in the chaotic climate of digital media.
What exactly is Parler? If you haven't heard of Parler before, don't worry, it doesn't mean you're out of the loop ... yet. Less than a year old, it is one of several sites aiming to become a sort of right-wing Twitter or Facebook in the wake of recent crackdowns on fringe figures like conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
Parler functions very much like Twitter, though it allows longer posts (1,000 characters) and doesn't visibly identify the source of headline links and photos that appear in your feed, so you don't know whether a particular story is from Fox News, Breitbart or Info Wars.
Parler's main selling point is that its terms of service don't ban offensive language or fake news. In other words, no "PC police" to spoil all the ranting in a right-wing echo chamber.
Prominent figures to join Parler include alt-right firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos, Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes, former NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch (the one who told journalists "your time is running out"). Also, Scott Baio — although Parler hasn't had nearly as much time as Twitter to work on its verification system.
It recently surged to more than 300,000 users (compared with Twitter's 330 million), tripling its footprint thanks to 200,000 new Twitter refugees in Saudi Arabia.
Did Kari Lake compromise her journalistic objectivity? Lake has gotten into trouble with social media before. Last year she was forced to apologize after tweeting that the #RedForEd protests for education funding were actually a push to legalize marijuana. That's the kind of political opinion — or editorializing, if you've been to journalism school — that a news anchor is supposed to avoid, both on the air and on social media.
Pot seems to be a sore spot for Lake. At least, she referenced it again in her Facebook Live outburst. She was apparently unhappy that she had been asked to remove any reference to Parler from her official Fox 10 Twitter page, and Hook was explaining the company line.
"They don't want you tied into anything like that where you're going to get blowback from the (Phoenix) New Times," he said.
"(Expletive) them," she replied. "They're 20-year-old dopes. That's a rag for selling marijuana ads."
Should journalists be on Parler? But the latest mini-controversy isn't about anything Lake has said on Parler. Her posts there are mostly story links, often with the usual "what do you think" chatter to encouragement engagement — much like what she, and countless other journalists, do on Twitter every day.
Yes, Parler's terms of service mean you can find some very ugly stuff there, if you look for it or if you follow the wrong people. But that's still true on Twitter and Facebook, no matter how much they scramble to pull it down.
Does Lake's mere presence on the site reveal a political bias that disqualifies her from the job of objective anchor?
This may or may not be a legitimate question inside the Fox 10 newsroom this morning, but it is now being debated outside the small pond of Phoenix media — at least in an Andy Warhol, 15-minutes-of-fame kind of way.
How Kari Lake became a minor cause célèbre After both azcentral and the New Times wrote about Lake's hot-mic moment, driving thousands of people to watch the video, the story got picked up by media outlets as far away as the U.K.'s Daily Mail. The conservative RedState.com came to Lake's defense, although writer Brandon Morse seems to have skimmed the original reporting and misidentified the direct target of her F-bomb.
"It's ridiculous that Lake should have to hide her Parler account out of fear that someone like the New York Times would see it and make her or the station answer for it," Morse writes. "The entire reason that Lake was told to hide her Parler account in the first place is because of fears that the mainstream media would swoop in and label her or the station as alt-right sympathizers, showing the fear the mainstream media puts into people when it comes to expressing themselves, or even associating with certain people."
Within the conservative bubble, accusing the media of being the left's tool to silence the right is just knee-jerk instinct. But the hot water Lake finds herself in is actually the result of the democratization of digital media, not the monopolistic power of the "mainstream," whether you're talking about the New York Times, the Phoenix New Times or The Arizona Republic/azcentral.com.
Meet Scott Jones, self-appointed TV news watchdog That's because the real culprit behind Kari Lake's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day wasn't the New Times or "the mainstream media." It was an industry blog site, FTVLive.com. Which is basically one guy.
His name is Scott Jones, and he's a former TV reporter and news director. He launched FTVLive.com 19 years ago and still runs it as a one-man show, posting upward of two dozen items a day. The line between news and opinion is blurry, but it all has a "who's watching the watchers" feel to it.
Jones has been writing about what he calls Lake's clear right-wing bias for a while now.
"I was tipped off that she was on the (Parler) site, which was not a surprise, and I saw she linked to it on her branded station Twitter account," Jones said in response to an email from azcentral. "I figured the bosses would not like that given the fact of Parler's reputation."
Jones' background in TV news doesn't make his website "the mainstream media." Indeed, his posts are packed with the kind of editorializing journalists are trained to keep out of news stories, like calling Lake "big headed" and quoting an anonymous source saying bad things about her. So, pot, meet kettle, or something like that.
Could a hot-mic moment cost Kari Lake her job? Jones' posts were a minor annoyance until the Facebook Live snafu. But that one was juicy enough to go viral, and news sites (including this one) simply followed the clicks. Sorry not sorry.
In the end, it was just another minor skirmish in the narrative wars, characterized by typical overreactions. It's hard to make a case that Lake's activities on Parler — barring, say, the uncovering of deleted posts — add up to a firing offense. As long as she hasn't written, reposted ("echoed," in Parler parlance), voted up or commented on anything problematic, it would smack of guilt by association.
On the other hand, conservative defenders who say Lake is being "censored" are simply wrong. Fox 10 doesn't just have the right, it has a business and ethical imperative to define what is appropriate online behavior for its on-air representatives. In the journalism business, it's called protecting your credibility.
Also, last we checked, Lake still has a Parler account. Apparently she wasn't ordered to leave the site, just to drop it from her work-verified Twitter profile. And she still has a job.
We won't really know the size of this teapot tempest until the station puts her back on the air ... or doesn't.

Policies kept black Americans from getting home finance, author says

Texto completo: "Every place I go, people try to convince me that their community is worse than anyplace else in this regard. For some reason people need to believe (that). ... It's so much easier to focus on the small differences, but what's important is the larger pattern."
Author Richard Rothstein
Author Richard Rothstein was in Rochester Friday to speak about what he called the United States' "national myth."
That story, he said, is that deep racial segregation happened in every metropolitan area in the community through a confluence of individual decisions. Black people preferred to live with other black people, and the same for other races. Some real estate agents and bankers were prejudiced. The free market did its work.
The problem with that account, he said: "It didn't happen by accident. It's a myth. There's no factual basis for to it whatsoever."
Instead, Rothstein's book, The Color of Law, lays out decades of explicit local, state and federal policies that barred black Americans from large swaths of the real estate market at the very time the government was providing unprecedented subsidies for homeowners.
Neighborhoods with black residents were explicitly excluded from government-backed financing opportunities. New public housing units were racially segregated, with the black-designated ones doomed to danger and chaos from the outset. State courts enforced racially discriminatory restrictive covenants and local police stood by as black would-be renters and homeowners were beaten and killed.
"It's as much a civil rights violation as segregated water fountains or buses or lunch counters," he said.
In Rochester, that meant neighborhoods such as Corn Hill were excluded from investment programs. "Negroes have come into the area and today it is the poorest section of the entire city," an appraiser wrote.
Policies needed to address historical segregation Among the speakers at Friday's event was Alice Young, the first black person to serve as a principal in the Rochester City School District and a founding trustee of Monroe Community College.
She and her husband bought a house on a previously all-white street in the 19th Ward in the 1950s, using a white friend, Harper Sibley, as a straw purchaser.
In a 2018 interview, Young recalled the note she received in the mailbox once the neighbors realized the actual occupant: "'You God-damned (n-word)s" have two weeks to move out of this neighborhood or else the house will be destroyed by fire." It was signed, "the Ku Klux Klan of Millbank Street."
Rothstein's appearance was sponsored by Pathstone, a nonprofit community development organization. More than 500 tickets were sold, organizers said.
In an interview before his presentation, Rothstein, a former New York Times columnist and a longtime fellow at the Economic Policy Institute, said he didn't come to talk about Rochester in particular and cautioned against overly narrow focus on the particulars in one community versus another.
"Every place I go, people try to convince me that their community is worse than anyplace else in this regard," he said. "For some reason people need to believe (that). ... It's so much easier to focus on the small differences, but what's important is the larger pattern."
Though the most explicit mechanisms of housing discrimination were outlawed in the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the ongoing consequences are plain to see. In fact, Rothstein said, his project began with a focus on educational segregation, as that is where the effects are perhaps most visible.
As for solutions, he mentioned inclusionary zoning — where new housing developments are required to set a certain portion aside for low- or moderate-income people — and a repeal of exclusionary zoning laws such as minimum lot sizes and restrictions on multifamily units.
"Policies to redress segregation — it's not a mystery," he said. "We're just not doing it."

Taffy Brodesser-Akner will discuss her debut novel, "Fleishman Is in Trouble," about a doctor who expected an unburdened life when his marriage fails, but winds up a full-time father with unforeseen obligations. Brodesser-Akner is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and has written for GQ, ESPN the Magazine, and other publications. Lisa Taddeo, journalist and author of "Three Women," will discuss her nonfiction book about the sex lives of three women, based on her reporting. They are a suburban wife who begins an affair when her husband rejects her; a teenager involved with her teacher; and a woman whose husband likes to watch her have sex with others. Taddeo has contributed to New York magazine, Esquire, Elle, Glamour and Best American anthologies. She lives in Connecticut.
On July 25 at 7 p.m., former executive editor of The New York Times Jill Abramson will talk about her book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts." It compares how two venerable newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post, and two upstarts, BuzzFeed and VICE, handle the revolution pitting old against new media. Abramson is a senior lecturer at Harvard University and writes a biweekly column for The Guardian about U.S. politics. She was the first woman to be the Times' Washington bureau chief, managing editor and executive editor.
On July 26 at 7 p.m., Laurie Gelman will talk about her comic novel, "You've Been Volunteered: A Class Mom Novel," which explores the ups and downs of being a room parent or school volunteer, through the eyes of one overburdened but smart and sassy mother.

Texto completo: "If your kids see one tear come down your face, game over."
That's per Helene Drobenare, the executive director of Camp Young Judaea Sprout Lake, in Dutchess County, New York.
We have been dropping off our children at camp since the 19th century -- when Americans started worrying about pampering, cosseting and "indoor-ness" -- so you would think by now we would have gotten good at it. And yet, Ms. Drobenare has seen enough parents made misty-eyed by the experience that she has a speech prepared for the perennial June ritual.
"When you say goodbye to John, Jim, Sally, whoever you say goodbye to, you're going to keep those sunglasses down, you're going to hold back those tears as much as you can, and you're going to smile with those teeth out," said Ms. Drobenare, reciting her speech to parents. "The most important thing you're going to do is give your kids the message that you believe in them. I'm going to hand you all a box of Kleenex. When you turn around and you're rolling out of the gate, you can cry all the way down the road -- and there's a liquor store where you can stop and get your first bottle of wine. But your kids need to know that you really believe that this is the best place in the world for them."
Several of the photographs here, which were taken from The New York Times's archives, show sunny, brochure-ready partings. One, originally printed in June 1959, empathically does not. Instead, it finds a 4-year-old named Claudia Watkins having a moment in Grand Central Terminal.
Claudia is so upset about her brothers leaving for camp that you're reminded that if you want to cry properly, you've really got to put your whole body into it. She has her tiny hand around her brother Miles's arm. Her mother has bent over, pearls swinging, to reassure her. The fact that Claudia's hair is identical to her mother's is moving, as is the relative size of the hatbox that Claudia is clutching, as is the fact that Miles is holding a toy dog. And the expression on the girl's face? It's devastating, unless your heart is a Ziploc bag full of sawdust.
One of the chief salves for homesickness has remained constant over the decades: mail from home. "On the first day of camp, before the parents leave, they have to sit at a table and write at least five letters so we're covered for the first week," Ms. Drobenare said. "Kids don't want long letters, they just want something to open. If you email, they still get it like a letter, meaning we fold it up and staple it. I tell parents, 'Don't write that pets died, don't write that relatives died, don't write that you're on vacation without them.' Every summer, somebody says, 'By mistake, we broke your Nintendo Switch.' Those are things you never write a child when they're at camp."
Asked if there were parents who neglected to send mail, Ms. Drobenare became touchingly stern. "Oh, no, we get to you," she said. "If two days go by and we haven't gotten a letter for your kids, we'll call you, we'll call your husband, we'll call the grandparents. We will get a letter for that child. Their kid's going to get mail. It's really important."
Parents, of course, also email camps frequently with concerns. Sally Buttinger runs Camp Hillcroft in Dutchess County with her husband, Greg. (The camp has been in Mr. Buttinger's family since 1950.) Fifteen years ago, Ms. Buttinger said, she would receive a few emails a day. Now she gets about 100, on all manner of subjects, like diabetes and swimming in the deep end of the pool. Because Ms. Buttinger wants to be out with the campers during camp hours, she and her husband answer emails -- very thoughtfully, from the sound of it -- at night. "Our day usually ends at about 12:30 or 1:00 in the morning," she said. "And then I'm normally up with the birds at 5:00, when the garbage truck comes."
She sounds a lot sunnier about this schedule than one might expect.
"When you love what you do it's not work," she said. "Opening day -- when the children rush out of their cars -- is my Christmas Day."
Both Ms. Buttinger and Ms. Drobenare are proud that children keep coming back to their camps, first as campers and later as counselors. They're there to oversee what can be a profound moment in the children's lives, not just to keep the canoes running on time.
"Camp communities are intense," Ms. Drobenare said. "It's the 24/7, the community, the sense of purpose, the sense of -- in many camps -- building a better world together and the deep, deep friendships that extend for years and years. I mean, I had a staff member that stayed with me until she was 27 and finally I was like, 'O.K., you need to go try working somewhere else."'

Texto completo: NPR in May changed the long-familiar theme music to its “Morning Edition” newscast.
After 40 years of hearing B.J. Leiderman’s original score every weekday, you were either sick of it, or, for sticks in the mud such as yours truly, flummoxed at the very idea of messing with a good thing.
But I’ll get over it. Especially ‘cause the new, poppy, synthy thing is just a rewrite of the old tune anyway. Same chord progression; a few tweaks.
The reason for the move by the public radio commissars in D.C.?
It was, as Josh Benton wrote for Nieman Lab, “for the kids.”
Meaning, trying to get a few listeners under 60 to listen to the show.
The New York Times wrote: “The new theme is intended to attract a younger and more diverse audience, while also aligning with the evolution of ‘Morning Edition’ into a newsier program, said Kenya Young, the executive producer. ‘I wanted a sound and a mood and a tone and a feel and a vibe all mixed in one,’ she said.”
Actual young people seem to consume as much radio news as they do daily print newspapers. Meaning, none. The only reason I know at least one 20something has ever listened to a second of NPR is that Clementine Creevy’s great L.A. rock band Cherry Glazerr takes its name from KCRW’s morning host Chery Glaser, who Clem used to hear in her parents’ car as they drove her to school.
So where do young people get their news? I know, I know, Instagram, fool.
But it’s not just Millennials who don’t follow the old-fashioned definition of what’s going on in the world. Academics who study the subject say that, at a time when it is far easier than ever to get an enormous amount of information about everything by clicking on the screen of that telephone in your pocket, many are simply opting out.
Josh Benton, again, for Nieman: “News, you may have noticed, isn’t that great at generating happiness these days. So lots of people are happy to stick to Keanu and avoid Trump/Iran/Putin/climate change/mass shootings/Brexit/racism entirely.”
Yes, of course, there have been plenty of times as terrifying as these, and people still followed — hungered for — the news. When the Third Reich was bombing London and on the brink of ruling Europe, that didn’t stop people from listening to Edward Murrow broadcasting from the rooftops. So mere logic won’t do here. Something else is going on.
As someone who learned to read at age 4 out of fascination with the morning newspaper, and haven’t stopped since, it doesn’t matter that this makes no sense to me. It’s a thing. Benton cites data from Digital News Report: “In 2017, 29 percent of those surveyed worldwide said they ‘often or sometimes avoid the news,’ including 38 percent in the United States and 24 percent in the U.K. By 2019, those numbers had increased to 32 percent worldwide (+3), 41 percent in the U.S. (+3) and 35 percent in the U.K. (+11). (Even the Japanese — the world’s most devoted news consumers — saw news avoidance increase from 6 to 11 percent.)”
Harshing their vibe is the major reason for news avoidance, 57 percent of the avoiders said: “It can have a negative effect on my mood.”
Second, yes, is the more than a third of us who have concocted a conspiracy theory about the press: “I can’t rely on news to be true,” say 35 percent. You want real untruthiness? Try the internet.
“I haven’t read a newspaper in years,” said one respondent. “It was all too depressing.”
I hear you, dude. But you want real depressing? Try a future in which the creeps and crooks we report on win the day because you decided to just tune out.

Texto completo: La campaña del presidente Donald Trump para la reelección 2020 está en pleno apogeo y toca arremeter contra todo lo que suene progresista. Al fin y al cabo, incluso los análisis del prestigioso diario The New York Times -poco sospechoso de ser trumpista- le auguran mejores resultados que en 2016, en parte por el tono beligerante del mandatario hacia sus rivales políticos.
En esta batalla discursiva, la nueva enemiga del candidato a la reelección es la lucha por la reducción de pláticos . El equipo de campaña del presidente sacó una serie de popotes (pajitas, pitillos, bombillas) “100% estadounidenses” para plantar cara a lo que considera una idea “progresista”: los popotes de papel .
Liberal paper straws don’t work.
STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP and buy your pack of recyclable straws today!https://t.co/nanyEFK938
— Team Trump (@TeamTrump) July 18, 2019
“Las pajitas de papel son solo otro ejemplo de los fallidos excesos regulatorios liberales. Pero no temas, ¡el presidente Trump tiene la solución perfecta!”, escribió el director de la campaña de Trump, Brad Parscale, en un comunicado divulgado este viernes.
El asesor dijo que las de papel son “como las ideas liberales, que no funcionan y se vienen abajo al instante” e invitó a los usuarios a hacerse con ellas “hoy mismo”. Y le hicieron caso. Los “popotes Trump”, un pack de diez unidades a 15 dólares, se agotaron este mismo viernes.
Con esta campaña el mandatario insiste en su negacionismo ante el alarmante cambio climático y se burla del tremendo impacto que estos artículos tienen sobre el medio ambiente .
Las pajitas solo suponen el 4% de los desechos plásticos pero -según el diario El País- su pequeño tamaño dificulta que las instalaciones de reciclaje las puedan atrapar y la mayoría termina en ríos y océanos. Solo en Estados Unidos, estiman los sitios web de los Parques Nacionales del país, cada día se utilizan más de 500 millones de absorbentes. Una situación que recientemente llevó a ciudades como Washington o Seattle a prohibirlos.

Texto completo: The president of The Family Leader, a prominent conservative Iowa organization, endorsed Rep. Steve King's primary opponent Thursday.
Bob Vander Plaats, president and CEO for the evangelical group, announced his support for Iowa Sen. Randy Feenstra in the 4th District Republican primary. Vander Plaats' endorsement is personal and not on behalf of the organization.
"Randy is a man of integrity who is guided by his faith and someone Iowans can trust to faithfully represent them in Congress," Vander Plaats said in a news release. "As a state senator he has defended Christian values, protected the unborn and stood tall against the progressive agenda in Des Moines that would undermine religious liberty, sanctity of human life, and our constitutional freedoms."
Vander Plaats has been a long-time supporter of King, but his position changed after seeing the Kiron Republican's comments in the New York Times on white nationalism and white supremacy.
In January, he tweeted that King's comments were "a bridge too far."
Feenstra is the highest-profile opponent to the incumbent King in the Republican primary, raising significantly more money in the first half of 2019 and gaining support from several national conservatives.
The Family Leader CEO complimented the Hull Republican's track record in the Iowa Senate.
"Randy is a proven conservative who has a long record of delivering results for Iowa," Vander Plaats said. "He'll do the same in Washington as our next Congressman and that's why I encourage voters across the 4th District to vote for Randy Feenstra in the 2020 Republican primary."

Texto completo: Her latest book 'Madame Fourcade's Secret War' will be discussed.
DAMARISCOTTA — New York Times bestselling author Lynne Olson is scheduled to speak at 10 a.m. Tuesday on the Chats with Champions stage at Skidompha Public Library’s Porter Hall, 184 Main St. Olson will discuss her latest book, “Madame Fourcade’s Secret War,” according to a news release from the library.
Olson’s book tells the true story of Madame Fourcade: the daring and glamorous young woman who led France’s largest spy network against Hitler. Fourcade worked in a network of agents spread across occupied France, known as “Alliance.” They collected critical intelligence on everything from the movements of German U-boats to explosives on the bridges of Paris.
The Nazis pursued Alliance spies relentlessly, yet Fourcade evaded capture and even escaped from their clutches — twice. “Because she was a woman,” Olson writes, she knew she would be underestimated, “a miscalculation on which she was determined to capitalize,” according to the release.
Olson’s body of work on Britain and America before and during World War II has earned her international praise. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright deemed her “our era’s foremost chronicler of World War II politics and diplomacy,” according to the release.
Olson is the author of the national bestseller “Citizens of London,” “Last Hope Island,” “Troublesome Young Men” and “Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh and America’s Fight Over World War II, 1939–1941,” an instant New York Times bestseller and a New York Times Notable Book.
Born in Hawaii, Olson graduated magna cum laude from the University of Arizona. Before her days of novels, she worked as a journalist with the Associated Press as a national feature writer in New York, a foreign correspondent in AP’s Moscow bureau, and a political reporter in Washington. She left the AP to join the Washington bureau of the Baltimore Sun, where she covered national politics and the White House.
Chats with Champions is a free community offering. This program is sponsored by Sherman’s Maine Coast Book Shop.

'Cats' trailer unites the Internet in abject terror

Texto completo: Where were you when “Cats" destroyed the best minds of our generation?
The first trailer for Universal's big-budget adaptation of the Broadway musical arrived Thursday, so collectively traumatizing Twitter that actor-comedian Seth MacFarlane may have summed it up best by posting a gif of Stewie from “Family Guy" rocking back and forth in silent horror.
Most negative reactions to the first look at “Les Misérables" director Tom Hooper 's latest movie-musical focused on its use of so-called “digital fur technology" to create uncanny cat-human hybrids.
In the trailer, actors like Jennifer Hudson , Taylor Swift , and James Corden are covered head-to-toe in a weirdly form-fitting layer of fur and given pointy ears. The results, as many were quick to note online, are unnerving while begging more questions than they answer.
Among the most pertinent: Why? What? How? Who did this to Dame Judi Dench ? Are some cats wearing the fur of other cats? If so, did they kill those other cats to wear their skin like ghoulish trophies? Does this mean, unlike “The Lion King," “Cats" will be brutally accurate in its depiction of feline societal dynamics? Also, wait a minute, why do they have visible breasts? Why are their tails coming out of their rear ends? Are the cats all that small? How much did this thing cost?
“I don't know what I expected from 'Cats' ' 'digital fur technology' but the short answer is NOT this," entertainment journalist Kristy Puchko wrote on Twitter. “My brain has melted. My eyes are bleeding. There is no god."
Some compared the trailer to Mike Myers 's ill-fated 2003 “Cat in the Hat" movie, while others referenced the upcoming “Sonic the Hedgehog" film so roundly castigated after its first trailer that director Jeff Fowler later went online to announce producers were pushing back the release date to “fix" the character design.
Other savvy Twitter users decided to provide their own soundtracks to the “Cats" trailer. Comedian Ian Abramson discovered one song that perfectly synched up: the remix of '90s hip-hop classic “I Got 5 on It" used in Jordan Peele 's doppelganger freakout “Us."
Peele himself approved the dub, retweeting it while simply writing, “Yes."
Another popular edit, from MTV News social director Bob Marshall , saw a discordant theme from last year's sci-fi pic “Annihilation" play over the trailer, with ominous results.
Not all responses to the trailer were as damning.
“It's not 'Cats' if it's not tacky," wrote critic K. Austin Collins on Twitter. “Frankly I could use more kitsch!! This is Andrew Lloyd Webber baby."
Added filmmaker Josh Raby : “Listen, that CATS trailer is bonkers, and we need more bonkers, I regret to inform you: I dug it."
“ 'Cats' had better be 3-D," offered New York Times writer Kyle Buchanan . “I want to fear them."
Louis Virtel , cohost of the “Keep It" podcast, voiced his (tongue-in-cheek) confusion on Twitter, writing, “I don't know why you're all freaking out over miniature yet huge cats with human celebrity faces and sexy breasts performing a demented dream ballet for kids."
It's true that the plot of “Cats" doesn't exactly lend itself to a “normal" film adaptation.
“Please stop saying the plot of Cats is confusing," tweeted Buzzfeed's Louis Peitzman. “The plot of Cats is that they're cats and they introduce themselves until one of them gets permission to die."
Take a look at some other online reactions below. “Cats" opens Dec. 20.

NY TIMES PUMMELED OVER JOB POSTING CALLED OFFENSIVE BY AFRICANS

Texto completo: (GIN)-'The New York Times is still recovering from the verbal bashing it received from Kenyan writers shocked and angered by the paper's outdated references to Africa in a recent ad for the job of Nairobi bureau chief.
How far has Africa come, wondered educator Alice Wairimu Nderitu, since the day when posters portrayed wild animals with the title "The Highlands of British East Africa as a Winter Home for Aristocrats"?
The Times job opening is described as an exotic African assignment-"from the deserts of Sudan and the pirate seas of the Horn of Africa, down through the forests of Congo and the shores of Tanzania.
"It is an enormous patch of vibrant, intense and strategically important territory with many vital story lines," the ad continues, "including terrorism, the scramble for resources, the global contest with China and the constant push-and-pull of democracy versus authoritarianism."
At this point, Wairimu Nderitu said the Times job description sounded like a call for a colonial settler, not a professional journalist.
Twitter buzzed with reactions: "If you are rearing to apply for this Bureau Chief job you should know what kind of stories New York Times is looking for. The darkness of Africa!" declared computer forensic guru George Njororge.
"Hard to distinguish this nytimes ad from a call to join a 19th Century expedition with Livingstone & Stanley," proclaimed Travis L. Adkins, lecturer on African & Security Studies at Georgetown Universit/.
"A reminder that the NYTimes already has a dubious reputation in Kenya, ' stated Professor Ken Opalo, recalling the furious debate over the Times printing a photo of two dead men slumped over their seats at a cafe.
"The biggest losers from this sort of madness," Opalo said, "would not be Eastern Africans," but the American audience who "continue to be fed [and believe myths and as a result are increasingly economically [and] geopolitically uncompetitive in the region."
"When someone sent me tais New York Times ad, I had to read it twice just to confirm that the kind of jo urnalist they are looking for is one who would just focus on the negative news in this region," added Oliver Mathenge, digital editor at Radio Africa.
Kayode Ogundamisi, anticorruption campaigner, said, "Requirements to work as @ nytimes journalist in Africa. You have the ability to focus on the negativs and 'occas.onal good news.' Unexpected stories of hope. That is how much @nytimes despise Africa."
In a belated response, international editor Michael Slackman owned up to approving the ad that v/as full of clichéd descriptions of the continent.
The ad was the result of taking a shortcut, he said. Rather than write a new job description, a posting from about 18 menths ago went cut. Still, he insisted, the Times was 'committed to covering Africa, not as if it were some stereotype, but because it matters."

I Can't Let It Go: The Aging Crisis That's Not Being Addressed

Texto completo: I'M OLD-SCHOOL: I still get the newspaper delivered - primarily, because it's our therapy dog Lacey's morning routine to get the paper and bring it to me. How could I interfere with her sense of purpose? Besides, I like turning pages and I don't really mind a little smudgy newsprint on my fingers.
But I'm not out of step with news delivered electronically either, and I'm a big fan of podcasts. I really love the segment "Can't Let It Go" from the NPR Politics Podcast. Once a week, usually three or four of the correspondents talk about something from the current week that they "just can't let go, politics or otherwise."
I have my own list of things I caii't let go, and my hope is that it they'll become yours as well.
The year 2030 marks an important demographic turning point in U.S. history, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2017 National Population Projections. By 2030, all baby boomers will be older than age 65. This will expand the size of the older population so that one in every five residents will be of retirement age. By the year 2030, there will be twice as many people over 80 as there were in 2016.
So why haven't any of the 2020 presidential candidates addressed the aging crisis?
This rapid growth of the older population contrasts with an almost flat youth population (under age 20) and moderate increase in the working-age (2064) population projected over the same period. In a nutshell: The potential pool of family caregivers will not sustain the growing demand for care.
Family caregivers make up a silent support army - without them, health and social systems within our aging societies would be absolutely overwhelmed. Compounding pressure on this unpaid labor force is a shortage of paid caregivers. These unsung heroes who tenderly care for our aging population with skill and compassion perform an important job that our society does not sufficiently value.
It is time to move issues of longevity and aging to the political mainstage. Congress and the White House have continuously kicked the can down the road, effectively waiting for the issue to become a crisis before they deal with it. We need to ask our candidates how they are going to affect change. Addressing health care is not the only facet to addressing the needs of our aging population.
Normal aging increases the incidence of disabilities. Nearly 40% of people age 65 and older had at least one disability and need daily assistance, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report that covered 2008-2012. Of those 15.7 million people, two-thirds of them say they had difficulty with walking or climbing.
Difficulty with independent living, such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping, was the second-most cited disability, followed by serious difficulty in hearing, cognitive difficulty, difficulty bathing or dressing, and serious difficulty seeing.
Do you know that less than 2% of our housing stock is built to be safe and accessible for elders? One-third of our elderly population fall each year and falls are the leading cause of death in people over 65. Seventy-five percent of all emergency room and urgent care visits for people over 65 are the result of falls.
Question to the candidates: How can our communities become more aging-friendly? Routes of public transportation were created, with young workers, not retirees, in mind. How can we remedy social isolation due to lack of transportation options? Speaking of social isolation, one-third of our population 65 and older lives home alone. It is projected that this number could climb to close to 50% by 2030.
The pro-life/pro-choice debate appears in the news daily. The caregiving crisis is a woman's issue that faces women during and beyond their childbearing years. The caregiving crisis disproportionately affects women. More than 88% of family caregivers are women. And a startling new statistic is that nearly two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women. Half of the family caregivers work full-time in addition to their family responsibilities for caregiving, with 18% of caregivers leaving their full-time job to care for a family member.
Is aging not tweet-worthy, Washington? Where is the Aging Pride Parade? Mr./Ms. Candidate, what is your biggest idea for what America's 68 million retirees could be doing to contribute to our society?
In 1961, JFK committed to landing on the moon. We need the commitment to proclaim a bold goal of stopping Alzheimer's as our moonshot.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — In the foyer of Representative Ayanna Pressley's Capitol Hill office, interns answered constantly ringing phones Wednesday as calls flowed in from around the country.
Behind a closed door in her personal office, Pressley was taking a break from the chaos, drinking a Gatorade and spending a few moments with her husband.
All week, Pressley said, she's been battling a headache — a real one.
It's no wonder.
For the fourth day in a row, President Trump was launching vicious personal attacks on the Massachusetts Democrat and three fellow first-term lawmakers.
Pressley acknowledged that trying to ignore his insults is a bit like trying not to look at a car wreck.
“The entire country is emotionally rubbernecking every day," she said. “You have to pay attention to a certain extent because it's through these Twitter storms that he unleashes vitriol and venom and hateful policies."
After all the controversy — the tweets and the news conferences and bitter House debate — it's easy to forget how this all started. But Pressley remembers, and as far as she is concerned, it all could have been easily avoided.
“I quite honestly feel that it's much ado about nothing," she said.
She was referring to the House vote three weeks ago in which the four lawmakers known as “the Squad" — Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota —were the only House Democrats to oppose a bill to provide funding to address the humanitarian crisis at the border.
Since even before they were elected, the four have drawn attention and controversy for their progressive stances on issues and use of social media to cultivate massive followings. Their votes on the border bill angered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called them out in remarks to a New York Times columnist.
Then Trump waded into the controversy by telling the four representatives, three of whom were born in the United States and all of whom are US citizens, that if they do not like this country they could leave.
“Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done," he tweeted. “These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough."
But as far as Pressley is concerned, the fact that she and her three colleagues decided to vote against the bill shouldn't be cause for outcry from her own party, which led to the criticism from Trump.
“I think what people have to appreciate is that this is a deliberative body," she said. “We are a large Democratic caucus. This is the first time in a long time that we've been in the majority and this is the most representative class in the history of Congress — in ideology, in race and ethnicity, in gender, in lived experience."
She continued: “When you have that diversity of perspective, opinion, and thought around the table, it means you are going to do exactly what people would expect you to do in a deliberative legislative body and that is to debate."
Pressley said that also sometimes means different tactics on how to act on those values.
“This is the most representative Democratic caucus in the history of Congress, we are building new muscle and I think we are still figuring out how to flex that muscle," she said.
Pressley said she and the three others voted against the border bill because they did not believe it included enough language to specify how the money would be used.
“I won't pretend it isn't hurtful, I won't pretend it doesn't even endanger people's lives, but what I'm most focused on are hateful, racist policies that are threatening the preservation of families, people's peace of mind," she said.
As she spoke, the phone in the foyer continued to ring. Her office got more than 100 calls during the news conference the Squad held on Monday to rebuke the president's remarks.
Pressley said she has received death threats (on this issue, but also just in general). But she has also received support from her district. She said she consulted with Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins, and also immigrant advocates before taking her border vote.
“Ultimately I don't work for Washington. I work with Washington but I answer to my district, and this is a representative democracy so there is nothing radical about my keeping the promises that I made to the people who sent me here," she said.
Her district includes parts of Boston, Cambridge, and Milton as well as all of Chelsea, Everett, Randolph, and Somerville.
About half the district is white, a quarter is black, and a quarter latino. A third of all residents were born outside the United States, according to the latest census data.
Pelosi, meanwhile, is focused on keeping the party unified in the face of Republicans in Congress who want to take back the House majority in 2020. And she believes that a fractured party could help Trump win reelection.
“You have to give him credit, he's a great distractor and that's what this is about," Pelosi told reporters Wednesday about the controversy over Trump's remarks.
Indeed, at a rally in Greenville, N.C. Wednesday night, Trump again targeted the four Democratic lawmakers.
“So these congresswomen, their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left," Trump said. “And tonight I have a suggestion for the hate-filled extremists, who are constantly trying to tear our country down. They never have anything good to say. That's why I say, hey if they don't like it let 'em leave, let 'em leave, let 'em leave."
Earlier in the day, Pressley said she is eager for this all to be over. She wants to work on things she came here to do such as reduce gun violence, build more affordable housing, and make sure everyone has health care and good public transportation. But she said there is at least one silver lining — her party is united by Trump's comments.
“We are centering ourselves on who the real enemy is," she said on Wednesday. “That's the best thing that can come out of this."

Texto completo: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Pakistan has arrested the founder of the terrorist group that carried out the deadly 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, seizing him on Wednesday just days before the Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, heads to Washington to meet President Trump.
Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the terrorism suspect, has been arrested before and then released. Critics of Pakistan's government said his arrest on Wednesday was yet another superficial tactic to placate the United States and others who have grown frustrated with Pakistan's halfhearted efforts to crack down on militant groups.
"Arrest. Free. Repeat," Taha Siddiqui, a Pakistani journalist living in exile, wrote on Twitter.
On Tuesday, Pakistan decided to reopen its airspace, which had been closed since hostilities flared with India in February. The closure of the airspace had caused difficulties for many international airlines, including American ones, which canceled many long-haul flights because of the complications of flying around Pakistan.
This, too, was seen as a good-will gesture by Pakistan before Mr. Khan sits down with Mr. Trump next week.
Their discussions are likely to center on the Afghan peace talks between the United States and the Taliban that have been moving forward, in fits and starts, in Doha, Qatar. Pakistan plays a pivotal role in Afghanistan. Its military and spy agencies helped bring the Taliban to power there in the late 1990s. American officials complain that Pakistan still shelters Taliban leaders and wanted terrorists from American airstrikes.
Mr. Khan has tried to walk a fine line, seeking to avoid alienating his own military while trying to present an image of a new and reformed Pakistan. On this trip, he has said he will save his country a lot of money by staying at the Pakistan ambassador's residence in Washington, not in an expensive hotel like his predecessors.
But Mr. Trump hasn't been exactly warm toward Pakistan.

"We no longer pay Pakistan the $ Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us," Mr. Trump said last year in a Twitter message. "They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return. That's ENDING!"
With its economy nearing meltdown, Pakistan is desperate to find new sources of money and burnish its image. The Financial Action Task Force, an international terrorism-financing watchdog, has threatened to blacklist Pakistan if it does not take action against militant groups and their leaders, such as Mr. Saeed.
Mr. Saeed was charged this month with financing terrorism following investigations into two charities that prosecutors say act as fronts for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the banned Islamist group that he founded. Counterterrorism officials said the two charities were involved in raising money for terrorism and that Mr. Saeed had been accused of accepting a 544-square-yard piece of land from one of his supporters in Punjab Province.
Donating or accepting land for a banned group is illegal, officials said. Mr. Saeed was presented before a judge in court in the city of Gujranwala on Wednesday, under strict security. He will remain in judicial custody for at least a week before his next appearance.
Mr. Saeed is facing several terrorism-financing cases; special counterterrorism police officers arrested him while he was on his way to court to ask for bail in one of these cases.
The United States and India accuse Mr. Saeed of being the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, but Pakistani courts have dismissed several previous cases against him, citing a lack of evidence. More than 160 people, including scores of civilians, were killed in multiple locations around Mumbai.
While Pakistan has been accused by Western countries of continuing to nurture extremist groups, Mr. Khan said in an interview with The New York Times in April, "We have decided, for the future of our country -- forget the outside pressure -- we will not allow armed militias to operate anymore." He also admitted in that interview: "We can't afford to be blacklisted."

Texto completo: Corrections & Clarifications: This column, which originally misattributed a ruling written by Justice Antonin Scalia to Justice Stevens, has been updated.
The last time I spoke with former Justice John Paul Stevens was in 2017 at a reception for Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch after his investiture on the Supreme Court. Stevens was sitting near a corner looking frail and alone. I went over and immediately teased him over my seething jealousy over his scoring tickets to Game 4 of the 2016 World Series. Both Stevens and I grew up ardent Chicago Cubs fans and Stevens just gave his signature smile, shrugged, and said, when you pass 90, “people are in a hurry to give you stuff. ”
When Stevens passed last night at 99, most of us felt that we had not given him nearly enough. Stevens transformed this country in decades of decisions, but most people only have a passing knowledge of who he was. That is how he wanted it. No, he is not the “real RBG” or Scalia. He was not a rock star. He was a jurist who spoke entirely through his opinions and what he said has helped shape the lives of every American.
Stevens' shaped American law
Few justices have left a footprint on American jurisprudence to match John Paul Stevens. It was not simply because he served 35 years — the third-longest in Supreme Court history. It was way that Stevens ruled. He wrote opinions that were anchored in simple, coherent values that he saw in the Constitution. Stevens changed on the court from a conservative to one of the most liberal justices in history. Along the way, he found his voice as a strong defender of individual rights and an advocate for a Constitution that must evolve with society — a living document capable of securing the guarantees of the Framers in a new and changing world.
SCOTUS must end gerrymandering: Hogan and Schwarzenegger: It's time to 'terminate' gerrymandering
His decisions remain the foundation for whole areas of law. He is the author of Chevron U. S. A. , Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , — a decision that controls how agency decisions are reviewed and enforced by the courts. He wrote core cases under the First Amendment, the commerce clause and the Fourth Amendment that still define core rights for all Americans.
He had confidence in the underlying values of the Constitution that served as his guiding beacon. Thus, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Stevens would write the opinion supporting an enemy combatant who was stripped of all due process rights by being sent to Guantanamo Bay. Even such individuals warranted judicial review under the Constitution.
Passing of an anti-public figure
Yet, it is not just Stevens’ wisdom that should be missed. It is his style of judging. What is most remarkable about Stevens is that he resisted efforts to turn him into a public figure. Years ago, I wrote about the advent of the “celebrity justice” as members of the court became more active in speaking publicly to adorning crowds. These events often had strong ideological identifications. Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia were the most active and often created controversies over statements about pending cases or issues. The notion of judicial constituents did not sit well with some of us.
As justices actively sought public acclaim, the concern was that their public personas might influence their judicial perspective. Stevens never liked being pigeonholed by advocates. In 2007, Stevens told the New York Times “I don't think of myself as a liberal at all. ”
There was a time when public speaking was frowned upon by the court. Justices were supposed to speak entirely through their opinions and avoid the public spotlight. I have long favored that model and Stevens was the ultimate example of the traditional approach.
Stevens rarely spoke publicly and never craved the public acclaim. One time, Stevens and I were flying to Milwaukee on the same plane to speak at the Seventh Circuit Judicial Conference. A lawyer walked up and said that he was a big fan. To my surprise, he shook my hand. I then introduced him to Justice Stevens. The lawyer turned an ashen white and made a quick retreat. Stevens was so unknown by sight that when we were on the plane, I saw a woman hit Stevens in the head with her bag — not knowing that she was putting the future of Roe v. Wade one carry-on away from extinction.
Stevens to be missed in divided nation
Stevens was not without regrets. He regretted voting to restore the death penalty and would become one of its more fervent critics. He wrote in simple prose that was direct and clear. For example, Stevens wrote the opinion in Reno v. ACLU that the federal Communications Decency Act (CDA) was unconstitutional, noting that “the interest in encouraging freedom of expression in a democratic society outweighs any theoretical but unproven benefit of censorship. ” There was nothing pretentious about his writing style. Yet, his opinions spoke clearly about rights that needed no embellishment or added flourish.
Trump defying SCOTUS: Trump defies Supreme Court and Constitution in census citizenship fight: DNC Chair Perez
Stevens often spoke of our rights like a shared covenant of faith; a Constitution that bonds us all to core values. At a time of deepening divisions in this country, I will truly miss that voice. I will truly miss John Paul Stevens.

Texto completo: Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan met with federal employees in El Paso Thursday and visited a Border Patrol station in nearby Clint where immigrant children have been held, sometimes hungry, sick, and without cots to sleep on.
McAleenan also met with members of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which includes El Paso Mayor Dee Margo and Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima, to discuss immigration-related hardships facing their communities.
While in El Paso, McAleenan was scheduled to host a town hall with DHS personnel, tour other U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities, and meet with volunteers with the DHS Surge Capacity Force — a program that allows DHS to reassign volunteers from the department and other federal agencies to help with situations identified as an emergency by the DHS secretary.
At the town hall, he spoke about interdepartmental cooperation with employees from CBP, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the U.S. Coast Guard, according to a DHS news release.
He toured the U.S. Border Patrol's El Paso Station and received a briefing about the El Paso Sector, which covers West Texas and all of New Mexico, and heard about what actions the CBP, which oversees the U.S. Border Patrol, has taken to improve conditions for immigrants and adjust to the changing flow of immigrants.
During his visit to the Clint holding facility, he was to be briefed on the medical services and accommodations provided at the site.
A report by the El Paso Times and the New York Times this weekend detailed allegations of poor conditions in which migrant children were being held at a Border Patrol facility in Clint, as well as the concerns of current and former Border Patrol agents over the conditions.
The Border Patrol previously had given the media a tour of the facility and denied the allegations, while saying the increase in migrant numbers was taxing the system.
Protesters from as far as Washington state joined local activists to object to the conditions in the Clint facility.
Peggy Hinkle of El Paso said she was glad to see people form other communities speak out on the alleged conditions where migrant children were kept.
"It's heartbreaking," she said.
Amy Sommers of Seattle said she came to Clint after reading the El Paso Times-New York Times story.
"I felt like I was going to be sick to my stomach," she said.
Miyagishima: 'It smelled too clean' Members of the United States Conference of Mayors also met in El Paso on Thursday and were able to see border facilities and processes for themselves. They also met with McAleenan. The eight mayors, mostly from border cities, were able to see the Downtown bridge and processing facility, as well as the El Paso Border Patrol Station.
Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima told the Las Cruces Sun-News on Friday that he went to El Paso seeking a better understanding of the surge this year in families seeking asylum.The explanation he received from a DHS official at the conference was that families with legitimate asylum claims were being aided and exploited by human traffickers.
Miyagishima said he was expecting to receive a tour of the Clint facility, but instead toured a tent facility in El Paso he described as "pretty clean," with ample food and water, as well as showers.
He remarked, however, DHS officials eagerly told the mayors that "we didn't clean this up for you," and yet did not permit the mayors to speak with detainees.
"It smelled too clean," Miyagishima said.
Their experience was much different than that of the agents' who had been working in the facilities months ago. The facilities did not shelter many migrants, the mayors said.
What the mayors did stress to McAleenan was that more resources and support were needed on the border to maintain a steady flow for economic commerce. They also said that they told the DHS secretary that their communities need to be reimbursed for the expenses local organizations and cities are spending on providing assistance to immigrants.
Miyagishima told the Sun-News that Las Cruces has seen decreased numbers of asylum applicants being released in the city by the Border Patrol, but is still assisting an average of 125 per day. The city has been leasing a former U.S. Army Reserve training center as a center for processing and assisting the asylees.
Immigration raids set for Sunday In another immigration-related development, the New York Times reported that migrant raids are set for Sunday in U.S. cities, although federal officials have not disclosed which cities will be affected.
In an emailed statement Thursday, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson said: "Due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations. As always, ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security. In fact, 90 percent of aliens arrested by ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations component in FY2018 had either a criminal conviction(s), pending criminal charge(s), were an ICE fugitive, or illegally reentered the country after previously being removed. However, all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and — if found removable by final order — removal from the United States."
Miyagishima said he was unaware of any ICE operations planned in Las Cruces or the region, but said local law enforcement would only assist the agency in the event of an emergency. "They will not be enforcing federal immigration law," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that Iran appeared willing to negotiate over its missile program "for the first time," in what he and President Trump presented as evidence that sanctions and military pressure were working, less than a month after the president halted a planned military strike against Iran.
But within hours of the statement to reporters, delivered before a cabinet meeting at the White House, the idea was shot down by Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was in New York for a meeting at the United Nations. His spokesman said that the two men had misinterpreted Mr. Zarif's public statements, in which he repeated past demands that if the United States "wants to talk about missiles, it should stop selling weapons, including missiles, to regional states."
It was a clear reference to American weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iran's other Arab adversaries.
The odd exchange, and the apparent misconstruing of Mr. Zarif's comments, seemed to underscore the eagerness of the White House to turn weeks of confrontation with Iran into some kind of negotiating opportunity -- and a reminder of how hard that will be to accomplish. Iranian officials have repeatedly said they would engage with Mr. Trump only after he rejoined the 2015 nuclear accord, which he withdrew from last year.
Mr. Trump appeared to ignore that demand, backing up his top diplomat's assessment that American restrictions on Iranian oil exports had left the regime "struggling to figure out what they're going to do with their economy."
"They'd like to talk, and we'll see what happens," Mr. Trump said.
But the Iranians say their position is unchanged.
"I think the administration is desperately looking for any sign that this is working and that Iran is willing to talk," said Philip Gordon, a Middle East official in the Obama administration who helped to negotiate the 2015 accord.
But Mr. Gordon, now at the Council on Foreign Relations, added that "even if both sides overcame the obstacles to talks, there's no sign that Iran is remotely willing to accept the sort of deal the administration has said would be its bottom line."
The exchange between officials of the two countries followed a string of private messages and efforts at outreach that seemed intended to de-escalate a series of confrontations that many feared could lead to war, either accidentally or deliberately.
A visit a month ago to Iran by Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, went badly, with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declaring that he would never speak with Mr. Trump and had no intention of repeating the "bitter experience" of negotiating a hard-fought agreement with the United States, only to see a new president renounce it.
But over the weekend France sent an emissary to Tehran, seeking a modest short-term agreement to calm tensions. And Mr. Pompeo, at the last moment, approved a visa for Mr. Zarif, though the State Department stipulated that he was being admitted to the United States "for the sole purpose of attending U.N. meetings" and "should restrict his activities to U.N. business only," according to a letter obtained by The New York Times.
Then, after Mr. Zarif gave an interview with Lester Holt of NBC on Sunday, the administration seemed eager to find any opening. Missiles provided that basis.
But Mr. Zarif's spokesman declared on Tuesday that Iran's missiles "are absolutely and under no condition negotiable with anyone or any country, period."
That was "not a new position by the Iranians," said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director of the nonprofit Crisis Group. "They have been saying this for many, many years now."
For years Iran ignored a United Nations resolution that effectively barred it from conducting missile launches, and it developed a sophisticated arsenal, capable of reaching the edge of Europe. Missiles were not covered in the 2015 nuclear agreement, but the secretary of state at the time, John Kerry, negotiated language with Mr. Zarif that watered down the restriction.
The United Nations resolution passed alongside the embrace of the nuclear accord said that "Iran is called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology." Iran said that the "called upon" language did not bar it from such tests, and that none of its missiles were designed to be nuclear capable.
The rebuff to Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo came a day after European foreign ministers meeting in Brussels agreed that Iran's recent, carefully calibrated breach of its obligations under the 2015 nuclear deal were not serious enough to warrant "snapback" sanctions. In the European view, it is Mr. Trump who is primarily responsible for the current standoff.
Nonetheless, Iran has begun to exceed the deal's limits on its stockpile of nuclear material and is enriching uranium to slightly higher levels of purity than the agreement sanctioned.
Yet most experts agree that so far the Iranian actions have not pushed the country over the key measurement: that it remain at least a year away from enriching enough uranium to fashion a single nuclear weapon. Mr. Zarif said on Monday that if Iran wanted nuclear arms, it would have already produced them.
In a televised speech on Sunday, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said that his country would hold talks with the United States if Washington lifted economic sanctions and returned to the nuclear deal. But on Tuesday, Mr. Khamenei, struck a more hostile tone, railing against the United States and Europe in a speech on Iranian state television. On his English-language Twitter account, he said that Iran "will continue the process of cutting down on its #JCPOA commitments," a reference to the 2015 nuclear deal, which is officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
Mr. Khamenei was particularly angry over the impoundment by British forces of an Iranian tanker suspected of transporting oil to Syria in defiance of European sanctions.
Mr. Vaez said France's government was trying to encourage dialogue by proposing that the United States refrain from imposing new sanctions on Iran and possibly grant waivers from sanctions against nations that import Iranian oil. In return, Iran would return to its commitments under the nuclear deal, refrain from further attacks on oil tankers and potentially even release American citizens imprisoned in the country.
President Emmanuel Macron of France told reporters on Monday that he hoped to speak with Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Trump, as well as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, in pursuit of de-escalating tensions. But Mr. Vaez believes that Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo are, for now, engaged in a form of wishful thinking.
"For the administration to jump on this as a sign of 'maximum pressure' softening the Iranian position and opening up the door over negotiations over the missile program is at best a sign of desperation, and at worst a complete misreading of the dynamics in Iran," Mr. Vaez said.

Texto completo: CAPE TOWN, South Africa - Jacob Zuma, the former president of South Africa whose tenure was marred by scandals, told a high-profile corruption inquiry Monday that he was the victim of a long-running smear campaign, and had been "vilified" and "alleged to be the king of corrupt people."
"There has been a drive to remove me from the scene, a wish that I should disappear," he said in his first appearance before the commission, which is looking into accusations that he enabled the plundering and misuse of state resources.
Under Zuma's leadership, the governing African National Congress became embroiled in what South Africans have come to know as "state capture" - corruption at the highest levels of government, for the benefit of wealthy private interests and ANC officials.
In a long, meandering opening statement Monday, Zuma, 77, invoked what he said were multiple conspiracies against him, and argued that the entire concept of state capture had been exaggerated in a campaign to oust him from power.
He went on to claim that spies from the former apartheid government and two unnamed foreign intelligence agencies had begun plotting against him in the early 1990s, when he was serving as the ANC's head of intelligence. And he said he had survived multiple assassination attempts, including a suicide bombing.
The commission, chaired by Judge Raymond Zondo, has brought to light stupefying accusations of graft, including multimillion-dollar cash bribes being paid "like monopoly money" to senior ANC leaders.
Aubrey Matshiqi, a political analyst, said Zuma's testimony showed that he was willing to jeopardize the ANC to protect himself.
"The claims he's making will divide the party further, perhaps even paralyze it," Matshiqi said.
South Africans had keenly awaited the testimony in Johannesburg of Zuma, who had not yet given a public account of his conduct while president from 2009 to 2018.
There was a risk that Zuma would instead use the public platform to embarrass his rivals in the ANC, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, who ousted Zuma in 2018 while promising to stamp out corruption.
Political allies of Ramaphosa, including his deputy, David Mabuza, have been linked to corruption scandals of their own, and Ramaphosa has himself been accused of receiving bribes from Bosasa, a company that has featured heavily in the commission's inquiry.
In his remarks Monday, Zuma accused Ngoako Ramatlhodi - a former government minister and ally - of having been a spy for the former apartheid government. Ramatlhodi testified earlier that Zuma had "auctioned" his executive authority to an Indian business family, the Guptas.

Trump's tweets prove he is racist

Texto completo: Donald Trump keeps trying to convince any disbelieving holdouts that he is a raging racist. At least, that's how I imagine his motives. In truth, it is more likely that his truest nature is simply being revealed, again and again, and he is using his own racism to appeal to the racism in the people who support him.
On Sunday morning, the same day the Trump administration earlier announced it would conduct raids to round up undocumented immigrants, Trump weighed in again on the conflict between four female freshmen congresswomen and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, tweeting a series of three of the most racist tweets he could produce:
So interesting to see "Progressive" Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly ...
... and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how. ...
... it is done. These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!
Those progressive congresswomen are Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts.
First, the facts: The country Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Pressley "originally came from" is this one. They were born in America. Omar was a refugee from Somalia.
But, this is the most important fact: They aren't white, and they are women. They are "other" in the framing of the white nationalists. They are descendants of Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.
The central framing of this kind of thinking is that this is a white country, founded and built by white men, and destined to be maintained as a white country. For anyone to be accepted as truly American they must assimilate and acquiesce to that narrative, to bow to that heritage and bend to those customs.
It sees a country from which black and brown people come as deficient - "a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world" - because, at its base, it sees black and brown people as deficient.
It is a form of white identitarianism, which opposes multiculturalism, but refuses to deem that opposition racist.
And so, it chafes when these black and brown women from exotic-sounding places with exotic-sounding names would dare to challenge the white patriarchy in this country. Why do they not know their place? Why do they not genuflect to the gentry? Why do they not recognize - and honor - the white man's superiority?
Start here: because the entire white supremacist ideology and ethos is a lie. America expanded much of its territory through the shedding of blood and breaking of treaties with Native Americans. It established much of its wealth through 250 years of exploiting black bodies for free labor.
And, for the entire history of this country, some degree of anti-blackness has existed. Now, there is an intensifying anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant xenophobia.
America was born with a congenital illness and it has been in need of active rehabilitation ever since, although it has often rejected the curative treatments and regressed.
Challenging America to own its sins and live up to its ideals isn't a vicious attack, it's an act of patriotism. As James Baldwin once put it, "I love America more than any other country in this world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually."
And, who better to lead the charge than four women who represent the future face of America - by 2055, the majority of Americans will be nonwhite, according to the Pew Research Center.
But, Trump - and many of his supporters and defenders - spew their racism and tell themselves that it is perfectly acceptable when it is read back to them, in much the same way that a dog will eat its own vomit.
There can be no more discussion or debate about whether or not Trump is a racist. He is. There can be no more rhetorical juggling about not knowing what's in his heart. We see what flows out of it.
White people and whiteness are the center of the Trump presidency. His primary concern is to defend, protect and promote it. All that threatens it must be attacked and assaulted. Trump is bringing the force of the American presidency to the rescue of white supremacy. And, self-identified Republicans absolutely love him for it.
We are watching a very dark chapter in this nation's history unfold in real time. We are watching as a president returns naked racism to the White House. And we are watching as fellow citizens - possibly a third of them - reveal to us their open animus for us through their continued support of him.

Facebook Confronts Broad Resistance to Crypto Plans

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration raised national security concerns about Facebook Inc.'s plans to launch a cryptocurrency as a growing chorus of U.S. and international officials voiced resistance to the tech giant operating its own digital money.
"Many players have attempted to use cryptocurrencies to fund their malign behavior. This is indeed a national security issue," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in remarks at a Monday news briefing. Should Facebook develop its digital coin, called Libra, to "have a payments system correctly with proper [anti-money-laundering safeguards], that's fine," Mr. Mnuchin said.
But, he cautioned, "They've got a lot of work to do to convince us to get to that place."
Mr. Mnuchin's remarks came one day before Facebook executive David Marcus is set to take the hot seat in a Senate Banking Committee hearing. Testimony Mr. Marcus prepared for the panel sought to quell worries -- similar to those already voiced by President Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell -- about Facebook's foray into crypto and its potential impact on global currencies and central banks.
Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), the chairwoman of a powerful House committee, separately drafted legislation that would block the social-media giant from operating Libra, which Facebook has said it hopes to make available by next year.
Mr. Marcus said Monday that Switzerland's financial watchdog would supervise Libra's governing body, adding that the digital money would never replace national currencies or undermine the role of central banks.
But the bipartisan firewall Washington has swiftly erected since Facebook announced its cryptocurrency plans threatens the sweeping vision Mr. Marcus described last month to the New York Times, when he said: "It feels like it is time for a better system. This is something that could be a profound change for the entire world."
On Monday, U.S. regulators and policy makers indicated to the social-media giant that to move forward it would need to adapt to the old system -- a panoply of regulations governing risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing and evasions of sanctions.
That pushback was echoed overseas, as the Group of Seven industrialized nations -- which includes European governments already wary of the U.S.'s tech giants -- plans this week to discuss risks posed by Libra and other cryptocurrencies in Chantilly, France, a French official said. Benoit Coeure, an executive board member of the European Central Bank, is expected to deliver a report on the topic during the meeting, the official added.
Some European officials have worried that Libra could undermine sovereign currencies and the power of the European Central Bank, potentially creating financial instability in a crisis. Germany's finance ministry, in an internal paper, said the government should work on ways to prevent Libra from becoming a full alternative to the euro, according to a senior government official.
Mr. Marcus faces on Tuesday the challenge of easing concerns that Facebook -- already embroiled in policy fights over digital advertising and customer data -- is primed to disrupt finance, one of the world's most highly regulated sectors.
Some Democratic lawmakers have called on Facebook to suspend work on Libra until Washington is satisfied with the oversight regime. Ms. Waters is prepared on Wednesday, when Mr. Marcus separately appears before the House Financial Services Committee, to unveil proposed legislation barring Facebook and other social-media companies from entering the world of banking and digital assets.
It isn't clear whether such legislation would pass Congress. But, so far, Democrats and Republicans have united around worries about Libra, adding to the broad misgivings Messrs. Trump and Powell have voiced about the company's crypto plans.
"We know we need to take the time to get this right," Mr. Marcus said in his written Senate testimony. "Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals."
Mr. Marcus said Facebook and its partners can devise effective ways to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, citing their "considerable technical expertise." Facebook publicized Libra early to ensure coordination with central banks, regulators and lawmakers, he said.
Libra's top regulator would be the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority, Mr. Marcus said, because the group in charge of the project will be based in Geneva. The group includes 28 companies, including Mastercard Inc. and eBay Inc., showing that Facebook wouldn't control Libra after it is off the ground.
The cryptocurrency's main purpose is to enable people to use and transfer money around the globe more cheaply than current options allow, Facebook said. The Silicon Valley giant added Libra would be most useful in countries where banking options are scant and the home currency is volatile.
Facebook has said Libra would be a "stablecoin" pegged to a basket of developed-world currencies. The coins will be backed by a reserve of financial assets that include bank deposits and government bonds.

Texto completo: Denver Riggleman married two men who volunteered for him
Anthony LeCounte and Alex Pisciarino promised their guests a "fabulous gay summer wedding." The setting was a vineyard in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The dress code, a seersucker-linen-chiffon homage to the Kentucky Derby.
And the officiant was a Republican congressman from a conservative district in the rural South.
Rep. Denver Riggleman (Va.) did the honors for LeCounte and Pisciarino on Sunday evening at King Family Vineyards in Crozet, west of Charlottesville.
Just a few years ago, it was unusual even for socially liberal elected officials to preside over same-sex weddings. Terry McAuliffe (D) was the first Southern governor to do so when he helped two women tie the knot in October 2014, just days after the Supreme Court effectively legalized same-sex marriage by declining to take up a lower-court ruling overturning the state's ban.
At the time, the New York Times noted a few officials who'd beaten McAuliffe to it, all from deeply blue territory: New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, then an independent, as well as Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R).
Among Southern Republicans, that sort of thing remains a rarity. Officials at several national gay rights groups contacted could recall just one case: a Texas judge who officiated at a 2016 wedding and then quit the party soon after.
Riggleman represents Virginia's 5th Congressional District, largely rural territory that varies widely in character and politics, from blue-blood polo country to cattle farms, with a few liberal college communities in the mix. Donald Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election.
Riggleman, a former Air Force intelligence officer who owns a distillery in Nelson County with his wife, ran for the seat in 2018 as a conservative Republican with a libertarian streak. As a "liberty Republican," he wanted Planned Parenthood defunded, government shrunk - and marijuana decriminalized. As for marriage, he said the government needed to treat straight and gay the same out of basic fairness.
"My real belief is that government shouldn't be involved in marriage at all, but if it is, everybody has to be treated equally before the law," Riggleman said in an interview Monday. "And that is part of our Republican creed. And it also comes down to love is love. I'm happy to join two people together who obviously love each other."
Still, as a lawmaker, Riggleman opposed the Equality Act, legislation that would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. And he voted against a resolution opposing President Trump's ban on transgender service members.
"A clear way to show his support for LGBT Virginians would be to support the Equality Act," said James Parrish, executive director of Equality Virginia.
Riggleman said he thought the legislation infringed on parental rights. And he said the issue of transgender service members needs more study. "I thought it went too far, as far as condemning something that we're still studying," he said.
The conservative Family Foundation declined to comment on his role at the wedding, as did the Republican Party of Virginia.
The couple moved to Charlottesville a year ago when Pisciarino, 27, began studies at the University of Virginia's law school. They met one of Riggleman's volunteers at a Target store, attended a few campaign events, hit it off with Riggleman and soon began volunteering for his campaign. LeCounte, 30, will begin a graduate degree at the university's Darden School of Business next month.
When they decided to get hitched, the said they wanted Riggleman to preside - both as a friend and as someone whose politics they respect.
Riggleman is hardly the only Republican to come down on the side of gay rights. Even in Virginia, a handful have supported state legislation to ban anti-LGBTQ discrimination in housing and public employment. But the Republican-controlled General Assembly has defeated those measures.
"In general, a lot of Republicans in Virginia have not been very good on that issue," LeCounte said.
But this year, the legislature did pass a bill to make it easier for same-sex couples to have children through surrogacy - a measure that got an assist from former Republican governor George Allen. The measure was inspired by a costly year-long legal battle endured by Allen's longtime chief of staff, Jay Timmons, and his husband, Rick Olson.
The couple Riggleman married met at a Log Cabin Republicans event in the District. And like Riggleman, they consider themselves conservatives, not moderates. They support gun rights, for example. Pisciarino's first job was for the tax-and-spending hawk Club for Growth. LeCounte, an Army brat, wants a strong national defense.
"We're not moderate," LeCounte said. "We're both pretty staunchly conservative."
The moderate Republicans who are more likely to embrace gay rights tend to be "squishy on issues we care about," he said.
"He's a conservative Republican," Pisciarino said of Riggleman. "He's just accepting."

For no-sweat cooking, do it sous vide

Texto completo: Jake Springfield considers himself a pretty average home cook. Yet when he has a few dozen friends over for a summer barbecue, he doesn't hesitate to pull out his sous-vide machine.
You know, just to make sure his beef tenderloins are cooked to a perfectly medium-rare 132 degrees before he sears them on the grill.
"I'm not a gourmet," he said. "I used to struggle to get that exact shade of pink on my meat. With sous vide, it's very hard to mess up. Even my friends who are better cooks than I am ask me how I do it."
Once considered high-tech pieces of laboratory equipment, sous-vide machines have entered the mainstream in the past three years.
With prices falling from $1,000 to as little as $45, the devices are in reach for home cooks like Springfield, a New Orleans cine-matographer who simply wants to serve some nicely cooked steak to his friends without stressing.
And as summer burns on, I think they deserve an even wider audience, because when used in combination with a grill, sous vide takes the sweat out of cooking.
Your kitchen won't heat up, and you'll never have to worry about whether your food is done. Whether you're making a couple of chicken breasts for your picky tweens or half a dozen beef tenderloins for 30 of your most beloved friends, you know whatever you cook is going to come out perfectly.
Sous-vide wands (also called sous-vide machines and thermal immersion circulators) work by heating pots of water to a precise temperature, then circulating that water around the pot, keeping the temperature constant.
Although the term "sous vide" means "under vacuum" in French, the food doesn't need to cook in a vacuum-sealed container; putting it in a plastic or silicone bag, squeezing out the air and immersing the bag in water will do the trick.
For chefs, sous vide has become indispensable for cooking food evenly, consistently and in volume - say, 180 runny-yolked "ramen" eggs for a busy weekend brunch service.
But the method can be just as much a boon for home cooks by eliminating any guesswork about when dinner is done. Instead of throwing an expensive rib steak on the grill and trying to ascertain doneness by poking it (rare meat should feel like the soft flesh between your pointer finger and thumb) or by using an only semi-accurate instant-read thermometer, sous vide guarantees precision.
This is because if you want rare steak, you just set the sous-vide wand to 122 degrees; the meat cannot overcook, because the water will never exceed that temperature. Then all you have to do is give the meat a sear on the grill to brown the exterior, and dinner is done. You get the most gorgeously cooked steaks without any of that preslicing anxiety that used to be as much a part of summer as mosquito bites and sunburns.
When it comes to cooking fish, particularly salmon, sous vide is one of the best methods I know, with fillets emerging buttery-fleshed and more deeply flavored than with poaching. I like to season the fish with fistfuls of fresh herbs, then drizzle it with a tangy caper-laced vinaigrette. It's terrific served right out of the sous-vide bag, while still soft and silky, and even better after a quick sear, so the skin bubbles, browns and crisps.
Another benefit of sous vide is flexibility. You can cook dinner several hours in advance and let it hang out in the bag, still in the hot water.
A downside to sous vide is that it's not for the spur-of-the-moment cook. Most ingredients will take longer to cook than they would with just plain old grilling (or roasting or pan-frying).
One way to offset this is to use smaller pieces of food, which cook more quickly than fat chunks. Think slim pork chops (30 minutes) rather than an entire pork shoulder (24 hours). And if you start with hot tap water, you won't have to wait for a large pot to heat up. (The water doesn't actually touch the food, which is sealed in a bag.)
But no one is turning to sous vide when they're in a hurry. "That's what the microwave was supposed to be for," Acheson said. "Now all we use that for is reheating coffee and making popcorn."

Texto completo: On the morning of the launch that sent the first men to the moon, Deke Slayton knocked on the doors of Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin and Michael Collins at quarter past 4 a.m.
"It's a beautiful day. You're GO," said Slayton, NASA's director of flight crew operations.
Slayton, a self-described "stick and rudder jockey" from outside Sparta, was one of the Mercury 7, NASA's first group of astronauts to make the cut. In fact, Slayton had been in line to be the fourth American in space until a slight heart condition grounded him before his first flight.
Now, Slayton drafted the roster for who would fly each mission. He picked Armstrong to command Apollo 11, Aldrin to pilot the lunar module and Collins to fly the command module. He unruffled feathers when astronauts came to him over mission assignments, including who would take the first step on the moon. And he was the liaison between the astronauts and the top brass who were deciding whether Apollo 11 should launch as scheduled.
After the Apollo 11 crew had their pre-flight medicals, Slayton joined them for the traditional pre-launch breakfast of steak and eggs. He rode with them for part of the eight miles to the launch pad before getting off at the control center.
"I've been to that pad some 20 times," he later told The New York Times in 1973. "Every time I wished I was going all the way, I really did."
Even as he helped guide his fellow astronauts into space and then the moon, Slayton never lost the itch to travel beyond the skies himself.
After all, Slayton, who died in 1993, had been one of the chosen few at the dawn of the space age. He had had a hand in every Mercury, Gemini and Apollo mission during the race to the moon.
It wasn't until 13 years later that Slayton got the chance to fly on a mission that ended the U.S.-Soviet space race with a figurative and literal handshake.
From Donald to Deke
Donald Slayton was born March 1, 1924, and grew up on a dairy farm a mile north of Leon, in Monroe County. As the oldest son from his father's second marriage, Slayton was expected to inherit the family farm. But when planes started gathering over Camp McCoy, the Army base nearby, ahead of the United States' entry into World War II, Slayton swapped his ag classes for physics, chemistry and math.
Slayton joined the Army Air Corps after graduating high school and flew 56 combat missions in Europe and seven over Japan. After the war, Slayton got a degree in aeronautical engineering and became a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base.
It was at Edwards that Slayton picked up his nickname Deke short for DK to avoid confusion with another pilot named Don.
While Slayton tested planes, the Soviet Union propelled Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, into orbit in 1957. That kicked off the space race.
In January 1959, Slayton was summoned to Washington, D.C., for a classified briefing. He had been winnowed from a pool of 110 military test pilots that met NASA's space-flight qualifications. After a second briefing and a barrage of medical and psychological tests, Slayton became one of the Mercury 7.
Grounded
When Mercury 7 member Alan Shepard skimmed the rim of outer space aboard the Freedom 7 on May 5, 1961, he was not the first earthling in space. Shepard had made the trip behind a pack of Soviet test dogs, a NASA chimpanzee named Ham and Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.
But his 15-minute flight was enough to inspire a generation of children to dream of space exploration, including eight-year-old Mark Lee from rural Wisconsin.
The Mercury 7 had that effect.
"If an astronaut could come from Sparta, Wisconsin, why not Viroqua?" said Lee, who watched the launch on a blackand- white TV with a coat hanger for an antenna in a one-room schoolhouse. Lee went on to become a NASA astronaut and flew four space flights.
Not long after Shepard landed from his sub-orbital flight and received congratulations from President Kennedy did the president announce a more ambitious goal: Put a man on the moon by the end of the decade.
While America's entry in the space race cranked into gear, Slayton's chances of making a flight slowly sank.
Two years before Shepard's flight, doctors noticed an irregular heartbeat during one of Slayton's training sessions in the centrifuge, a spinning machine that allows test pilots to experience forces several times that of gravity. Slayton was a pro at the centrifuge, which mimicked the forces of being propelled by an accelerating rocket.
When the doctors realized Slayton had atrial fibrillation, a flutter in his heartbeat that didn't affect his physical performance, his condition made some people in Washington anxious, Slayton recounted in his book, "Deke!," written with Michael Cassutt.
Slayton was officially pulled from the fourth manned Mercury flight and replaced by colleague Scott Carpenter.
"I know he had his heart set on this, and it is difficult to come so close and not make it," his mother Victoria told The Associated Press in March 1962.
Slayton's father Charles said he was relieved, but told his son, "don't let it get you down."
A few months later, after Slayton was barred not only from solo flights but from future two-person Gemini missions, he returned home to Wisconsin to get away and fish, the AP reported.
After Slayton's permanent grounding, the Mercury astronauts pulled together to make Slayton chief astronaut.
"We've got to pull for Deke and help him," said John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, according to "Moon Shot," a book by Shepard and Slayton, written with the help of two space correspondents.
"Gotta give Deke back his pride," said Shepard, the first American in space.
Glenn delivered this message to NASA admin-istrator James Webb, according to Neil Armstrong's eponymous biography by Jay Barbree. "We have three recommendations for chief astronaut. Deke Slayton, Deke Slayton and Deke Slayton."
Choosing the crew
Slayton's first task in his new role was choosing the second group of astronauts, "probably the best all-around group ever put together," Slayton said in his book. That group, the Gemini 9, included Neil Armstrong.
It was also Slayton's job to put together the crews for each mission. There's still speculation as to how he chose these teams.
"I never sorted that out," said astronaut Charles Duke, capsule communicator during the Apollo 11 moon landing, during a NASA interview in 1999. "Even to this day, I'm not sure how the crews were selected."
Astronaut William Anders, who snapped the iconic "earthrise" photo during Apollo 8, later said he even read "Deke!" to try to demystify the process.
"My operating rule was to have a pool of guys trained so that anyone could handle anything, and then make selections based on that," Slayton said. His first choice would have been Mercury astronaut and close friend Gus Grissom had Grissom not died in a fire during Apollo 1 testing.
When slotting missions, he always had a back-up team that would take part alongside the prime team on simulations and debriefs, Slayton explained in "Moon Shot." They would become "a great snowball rolling down a mountain, gathering data all the way for their own flight," Slayton said.
Then Slayton would assign them the third mission after the one they trained for as backup. Since Armstrong shadowed as the commander for Apollo 8, he was right in line.
In fact, it was during Apollo 8's journey to lunar orbit that Slayton told Armstrong that Apollo 11 was his. Slayton also ran by Armstrong two names for his crew: Collins as command module pilot and Aldrin as lunar module pilot. He also offered Jim Lovell, Apollo 8 crew member and future Apollo 13 commander, as an alternative to Aldrin. Armstrong took a day to think it over. He told Slayton on Christmas Eve that he was fine with the team as is.
The trio was announced to the world Jan. 9, 1969.
The crew was set, but there was no guarantee that Apollo 11 would be their ticket to the moon. That distinction could have gone to Apollo 10 or Apollo 12, depending on the lunar module's performance.
First, Apollo 9 had to show the Saturn V rocket could haul all the lunar equipment into space and that the lunar module could rendezvous and dock with the command module. Apollo 10 was a dry run of everything but the landing itself.
And there was intense speculation over who would take the historic first step.
An older flight plan had called for the pilot to exit first. NASA said the matter hadn't been decided. Aldrin began asking other astronauts for their opinion, which some viewed as lobbying.
When Slayton heard this, he told Aldrin that Armstrong had seniority, which settled the matter, according to "Shoot for the Moon."
Slayton also gave Aldrin another reason why Armstrong should be first: Armstrong stood closer to the exit hatch, which opened inward.
"Shoot for the Moon" author James Donovan suggests it was a way to appease Aldrin. Four NASA officials, including Slayton, had already decided the privilege should go to Armstrong.
Did that make things awkward?
Collins later described their relationship as that of "amiable strangers." The three men would never be close, but they were focused on the mission and trusted each other to get the job done.
While they sometimes trained together, Armstrong and Aldrin spent most of their time practicing in the lunar module. Collins, who would be orbiting the moon in the command module, trained alone, rehearsing scenarios including ones where he had to abort and abandon his crew-mates on the moon.
It was a real possibility. Frank Borman, retired from the Astronaut Corps, even suggested to Nixon's speech-writer that the president prepare some words in case of that outcome, according to "Shoot for the Moon."
"Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace," the speech began.
When it came time for a flight-readiness review that decided whether the mission would proceed, Slayton gave the top brass his opinions.
"We're in better shape than with 9, but not so good as 10," Slayton said, who had already consulted the crew. "I have no reservations about the crew being adequately trained."
Asked what difference a month's delay would make, Slayton answered, "Honest to say, I don't think we'd be all that much better off."
Blast off
Apollo 11 launched July 16, 1969, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida without a hitch.
"Hey, Houston, Apollo 11," Armstrong said, as they left Earth's orbit for the moon. "That Saturn gave us a magnificent ride."
Slayton returned to Houston to track the crew's progress from Mission Control.
Three days later, the crew reached lunar orbit.
On July 20, 1969, the Eagle lunar module undocked from Columbia and began its lunar descent. There was a tense moment when an unfamiliar alarm sounded, indicating an information overload that could have prompted an abort. However, MIT computer scientist Margaret Hamilton's software allowed the computer to prioritize key tasks, and Armstrong and Aldrin to continue their mission. The Eagle landed in the Sea of Tranquility with less than a minute of fuel to spare.
The first moonwalkers collected lunar samples, took photographs and video, and planted and saluted an American flag. They set up a seismometer, a solar radiation monitor, and a mirrored contraption to measure the exact distance from the Earth to the moon. Then they spent the night in the Eagle before rejoining Collins in the Columbia the next day.
"This is the original CapCom," Slayton said, as Apollo 11 traveled homeward. "Congratulations on an outstanding job. I look forward to seeing you when you get back here. Don't fraternize with any of those bugs en route, except for the (USS) Hornet."
Deke's moon shot
Kennedy's moon directive achieved, Slayton never lost the drive to fly. After his initial atrial fibrillation diagnosis, he gave up smoking, coffee and alcohol. His cardiac episodes continued.
Slayton began dosing himself with vitamins after he noticed a correlation between a bad cold during the Apollo 13 mission and a lack of heart arrhythmias after he upped his vitamin intake.
NASA flight surgeon Charles Berry arranged for Slayton to meet cardiologist Hal Mankin at the Mayo Clinic for tests. The all-clear from Mankin and seven other doctors, as well as NASA administrators, returned Slayton to full flight status in 1972. He would miss the tail end of the Apollo moon missions and Skylab, but he had a shot at the upcoming joint space mission with the Soviet Union.
Incidentally, NASA administrator Thomas Paine broached the idea for an international space venture with President Nixon in 1969 while en route to greet the newly returned Apollo 11 astronauts. Such a project would improve U.S.-Soviet relations, save both countries money and make international rescues possible should there be a space emergency. Docking the two countries' spacecrafts would be the first step.
Slayton started learning Russian to increase his chances.
"I've been the last 11 years getting back to where I am now," Slayton told The New York Times in January 1973, after he was selected for the Apollo-Soyuz mission.
On July 15, 1975, Slayton ate the traditional pre-launch breakfast of steak and eggs, not as a NASA director but as an astronaut about to enter space. The two spacecrafts launched on the same day.
The Soviet crew called their approach to Apollo in English. The Americans responded to Soyuz in Russian. When the two ships docked July 17, Soyuz cosmonaut Alexei Leonov said, "Soyuz and Apollo are shaking hands now."
President Ford asked Slayton what advice "the world's oldest space rookie" had for aspiring astronauts in a post-docking teleconference.
"Decide what you want to do," Slayton said, "and then never give up until you've done it."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — An all-out racially charged fight within the House Democratic caucus escalated Saturday when a black freshman lawmaker said the party doesn’t need "any more black voices that don’t want to be a black voice."
Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts made those comments during a speech at the liberal Netroots Nation conference where she, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan appeared after a weeklong clash with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her allies.
The feud started last month, when the three freshmen women of color, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, criticized Democrats who supported an emergency funding bill to send more money to the border. The measure passed, but liberal House Democrats said the bill didn’t do enough to protect migrant children held in federal detention centers amid reports of poor conditions. Omar said a vote for it amounted to a vote "to keep kids in cages."
In response, Pelosi tried to downplay their influence in an interview with The New York Times. "All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," the California Democrat told columnist Maureen Dowd. "But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people, and that’s how many votes they got."
Ocasio-Cortez accused the speaker of "singling out" the four women of color, calling it "outright disrespectful."
Things further escalated Friday night when the official Twitter account for the House Democratic caucus singled out a tweet Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, wrote June 27 criticizing Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas, one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress, for supporting the border bill.
"I don’t think people have to be personally racist to enable a racist system," Chakrabarti wrote. "And the same could even be said of the Southern Democrats. I don’t believe Sharice is a racist person, but her voters are showing her to enable a racist system."
The House Democratic caucus shared that 2-week-old tweet Friday night and offered its own commentary.
"Who is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color? Her name is Congresswoman Davids, not Sharice. She is a phenomenal new member who flipped a red seat blue. Keep Her Name Out Of Your Mouth," the @HouseDemocrats account tweeted.
Pelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, retweeted it.
Earlier in the week, Pelosi scolded her members in a closed-door meeting, telling them not to tweet their grievances and instead to come to her if they have a problem.
Hammill, though, defended his retweet, saying he wasn’t defying his boss’s wishes because Pelosi had been referring to public attacks on Democratic lawmakers, and this was about taking a fellow staffer to task. He said he retweeted the House Democrats’ account defending Davids, who is a lesbian, "in my personal capacity as a gay man who was bullied and beaten in high school."

Texto completo: Ahora resulta que otra persona reclama ser quien presentó al presidente Donald Trump y a la primera dama Melania Trump .
En el libro “El método de la locura: el ascenso de Donald Trump según lo dicho por aquellos que fueron contratados, despedidos, inspirados e investidos” , escrito por Allen Salkin y Aaron Short se afirma que el empresario italiano Paolo Zampolli fue quien a la pareja presidencia.
La información fue revelada en Page Six y desmiente los reportes The New York Times de que supuestamente Jeffrey Epstein –acusado de tráfico sexual de menores– afirmó haber presentado al presidente Trump y a su ahora esposa en 1998.
Según el relato de Salkin y Short preguntaron al empresario Zampolli, si Epstein había asistido a la fiesta donde supuestamente se conoció la pareja presidencial.
“¡De ninguna manera!” , fue su respuesta. Agregó que la noticia de que Epstein había presentado al mandatario y la exmodelo fueron calificadas de falsas.
De esa afirmación, lo único que no cambió fue que la pareja se conoció durante una fiesta en la Semana de la Moda.
La Primera Dama ha contado que conoció a Trump en el Kit Kat Club en Nueva York en 1998 .
Reportes indican que en aquel entonces, la exmodelo no tenía suficiente dinero, por lo que conocer al empresario neoyorquino fue “su salvación”.

Texto completo: Federal judges are supposed to be neutral decision-makers. But any pretense of neutrality has slipped away as the appointment process for Supreme Court justices and prominent lower-court judges has become mired in political partisanship.
President Donald Trump seems to expect his appointees to automatically side with him, just as he expects judges selected by President Barack Obama to be against him. His administration has allowed conservative advocates to play an outsize role in picking nominees. And the Senate, with its power to confirm or reject those choices, has sunk deeper into partisan score-settling.
Republicans and Democrats alike have contributed to today's hyper-politicized process. But nothing approaches the muscle that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell exerts. McConnell thwarted Obama's opportunity to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia in 2016 and, once Trump took office in 2017, began directing the swift approval of a record number of appeals court judges, as well as two Supreme Court justices.
In his new book, "Confirmation Bias," journalist Carl Hulse delves deeply into recent confirmation battles, describing the Senate's advice-and-consent power as "corrupted to what appears to be the point of no return."
The book is an absorbing, if dispiriting, look at the maneuverings of inside players like McConnell and Donald McGahn, Trump's first White House counsel, and outside advocates like Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, who appears to have steered judicial selection as much as anyone at the White House.
Hulse, a New York Times correspondent and Illinois native, probes moments of escalation over the years and the backroom machinations of the Trump strategy now transforming the courts and the law. Inevitably, he covers previously reported ground, but "Confirmation Bias" is an important guide at this crucial time for the stature of America's judiciary.
Chief Justice John Roberts, himself a Republican appointee, has lamented the current state of affairs. In November Roberts pushed back on Trump. Roberts issued a statement saying: "We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."
Yet individual judges have sometimes reinforced the notion that they are bent on favoring the president who appointed them. Of equal concern, the selection process appears patently designed to produce men and women who will do just that.
Tracing the origins of the Trump plan for the federal bench, Hulse recounts McGahn's early interaction with the candidate. They were introduced by David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United. Trump inscribed a copy of "The Art of the Deal" to McGahn's young son, Don III, writing, "You've got a great dad." McGahn then helped draw up Trump's spring 2016 list of possible Supreme Court nominees.
Once Trump became president, McConnell and McGahn formed an early partnership to place ideological soul mates on the bench. McGahn engineered the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. In 2018 he managed the resignation of Justice Anthony Kennedy and his replacement by Brett Kavanaugh.
Back in 2008, Kavanaugh, then an appeals court judge, swore in McGahn after his confirmation to the Federal Election Commission. "That guy's going to be on the Supreme Court someday," McGahn said privately. Nearly a decade later, in 2017, Hulse writes, McGahn confided to Trump strategist Steve Bannon his continued interest in Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court choice.
During the televised Kavanaugh confirmation hearings last year, McGahn coached the nominee on his response to Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegation. As Ford testified before senators, Hulse reveals, McGahn received "worried texts from his circle" and then urged Kavanaugh to respond aggressively: "He wanted to see the nominee push back, cut off his interrogators, and turn their questions back on them." Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegations dating back to their teen years in suburban Maryland, chalked them up to partisan critics and challenged senators about their drinking habits after they suggested that Kavanaugh drank to excess as a young man.
For decades, Republicans in Washington, dismayed at the judicial liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s, have made judicial appointments a higher priority than Democrats have. There have been exceptions, of course, when Democrats went on the offensive. In 1987 the Democratically controlled Senate rejected Robert Bork, and in 2013 Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid instigated a change in filibuster rules to win confirmation of stalled Obama nominations. A decade earlier, Reid helped block several nominees of President George W. Bush.
Yet Republicans such as McConnell have more recently been in control and ready to play hardball, partly as retribution. On Feb. 13, 2016, when Scalia died, McConnell received early word. When the death became public, McConnell was ready with his statement that an appointment to the seat should be saved for the next president, to be elected in November. On that same Feb. 13 McGahn called Trump to advise him on addressing the vacancy and offering names of possible successors.
Hulse writes of the ensuing angst among some on Obama's team that the president moved too slowly on a successor. Ron Klain, then chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, wanted the president to quickly name presumptive nominee Merrick Garland, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit. The well-regarded moderate's name had been kept in reserve for just such a moment.
Within a few days of Scalia's death, Hulse reports, Klain told White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough: "The president ought to go to the Rose Garden tomorrow and name Merrick Garland. Tomorrow. Not a month from now. Tomorrow. Every day that ticks by is a day that you are letting McConnell consolidate his position."
Obama announced the Garland choice a month later. Senators never held a hearing.

Texto completo: Journalist found the draft, by William Safire, decades after the Apollo 11 landing
America's landing on the moon now stands as such a stunning success that, 50 years later, we have trouble imagining that it could have gone terribly, tragically wrong.
But in the days before the landing, on July 20, 1969, there were acute fears of a mishap. Officials in the White House and at NASA laid out lugubrious contingency plans in case astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon, but then were unable to get off the surface and back to the space capsule. If that had happened, they would have been doomed to die there, either by slow asphyxiation or perhaps by suicide.
The White House chief of staff instructed William Safire, then a White House speechwriter (and later a New York Times columnist), to draft a remarkable speech for President Richard Nixon to deliver to the nation if the astronauts were stranded on the moon. Along with the speech, Safire included instructions for other actions that should be taken. In particular, he wrote, Nixon should telephone the wives of the astronauts, whom he chillingly referred to as the "widows-to-be." At a certain point, NASA would "end communications" with the astronauts, Safire wrote, and a clergyman should then conduct the equivalent of a burial at sea, ending with the Lord's Prayer.
Safire's undelivered speech lay hidden for nearly three decades before I found it. In the late 1990s, researching a book on America's opening to China, I was rummaging through the archives of the Nixon administration (then in College Park, Md.) when my eyes suddenly fell on something I wasn't looking for. It was a memo from Safire to White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman titled, "In event of moon disaster."
The short text still brings tears to the eyes. It begins, "Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace." It ends with the words, "For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind."
What Safire wrote would have qualified as the most eloquent speech Nixon ever gave - and one of the most poignant by any American president. Thankfully, it never had to be delivered.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Grupos proinmigrantes denunciaron este sábado que las redadas anunciadas por el Gobierno del presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, contra indocumentados “aterrorizarán a menores y separarán familias”.
La presidenta de la organización Families Belong Together, Jess Morales Rocketto, señaló en un comunicado que “la crueldad es el punto: las redadas masivas aterrorizarán a menores, separarán familias y creará el caos por el país”.
“La Administración (de Trump) está ejecutando una agenda cruel, supremacista blanca para traumatizar a familias en vez de tomar acciones para abordar las condiciones horribles que están matando a menores migrantes bajo custodia de EEUU”, dijo Morales Rocketto.
Por su parte, Mary Bauer, responsable de Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC, en inglés), hizo hincapié en un comunicado en que el Gobierno actual “está aterrorizando deliberadamente” a familias y comunidades de inmigrantes.
“El maltrato continuado de los menores en instalaciones de detención, los ataques a nuestro sistema de asilo y los asaltos a comunidades de inmigrantes mediante la amenaza de redadas muestran que la prioridad de esta Administración es aterrorizar a comunidades y no resolver los problemas migratorios de nuestra nación”, consideró.
Bauer indicó que “con la reciente aprobación de fondos adicionales para esas agencias (migratorias) sin salvaguardas adicionales, el Congreso también asume ahora la responsabilidad de estas tácticas continuas”.
“Estas agencias, que están maltratando intencionadamente a hombres, mujeres y menores y separando a familias, se han envalentonado por las acciones de los legisladores”, lamentó.
El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, confirmó este viernes que su Gobierno iniciará el domingo redadas masivas en unas 10 ciudades para deportar a “miles” de indocumentados.
En declaraciones a los periodistas en la Casa Blanca, Trump respondió afirmativamente cuando le preguntaron si es cierto que el Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) empezará sus redadas este domingo, como adelantaron el jueves varios medios de comunicación.
La operación se centrará en las ciudades de Nueva York, Miami (Florida), Houston (Texas), Los Ángeles y San Francisco (California), Chicago (Illinois), Atlanta (Georgia), Baltimore (Maryland) y Denver (Colorado), de acuerdo con fuentes oficiales citadas por la cadena de televisión CNN.
Estaba previsto que también hubiera redadas en Nueva Orleans (Luisiana), pero el ICE comunicó a las autoridades de la ciudad que suspenderá temporalmente la operación debido a la tormenta tropical Barry, transformada ya en huracán.
Según funcionarios consultados por el diario The New York Times, ICE buscará primero a unos 2,000 inmigrantes que ya han recibido órdenes de deportación y que, en algunos casos, no se presentaron a las audiencias en los tribunales de inmigración.
En las últimas horas, grupos y ciudadanos opuestos a las redadas, han realizado manifestaciones en contra de Trump y sus políticas en estados como California, Washington, Utah, entre otros.

REVIEW --- Liberty Island's Hidden History --- Before the statue and long before the brand-new museum, there were pirates, real-estate ventures and public executions.

Texto completo: As a rule, a museum tells more by what it leaves out than by what it includes. It's akin to framing a photo to show the patriarch and the favorite son but exclude the black sheep who's brought this family nothing but trouble.
Take, for example, the Statue of Liberty Museum on Liberty Island, the 15-acre rock at the mouth of New York harbor. Since 1886, the island has been home to the 305-foot statue, with gown, torch and tablet, standing amid broken chains -- the first glimpse of America seen by generations of immigrants, symbolizing the nation's best sentiments.
The museum, which cost $100 million to build, opened in May in a celebrity-packed ceremony, featuring photos and films of the statue and the original copper torch, which was replaced by a gold-leafed replica in 1985 after it was damaged by leaks. But there is another story that the museum doesn't tell: the deep history of Liberty Island, what it meant to those who lived and died in eras before the statue arrived.
The saga is still there, of course, only papered over, forgotten: a site of military strategy, land speculation, piratical pursuits and, most notoriously, public executions. In this, Liberty Island epitomizes the telling of all history -- each generation overwrites the past. You discover it with a thrill, as when at around age 10, you ask your mother, "Did someone live in this house before us?"
To Europeans who sailed through the Narrows in the 17th century, the island was a cork that stoppered the mouth of the greatest natural harbor in the New World, teeming with seagulls and shellfish when the tide ebbed. On Dutch maps, it was marked as Great Oyster Island, a Lenape hunting ground. With the coming of the British, it entered the only history that counts: commercial.
Its views of town and sea -- they would call it a double exposure now -- marked it as a choice piece of real estate. A Captain Robert Needham, given the island by the British governor of New York in the way of swag, sold it to a merchant named Isaac Bedloe (also recorded as Bedlow and Bedloo) on Dec. 23, 1667. Until being renamed for the statue in 1956, it was usually known as Bedloe's Island, awash in Manhattan's property churn, sold and resold, gussied up, sold again. At one point, it rented as a vacation property called Love Island. At another, it was a quarantine hospital where the stricken looked longingly at the bustling port across the bay.
It was turned into a military base in the run-up to the War of 1812 and became the site of a star-shaped fort, cannons facing the sea, whose distinctive walls would later support the statue. The fort was ultimately named for Lt. Col. Eleazer Derby Wood, killed in the 1814 British siege of Fort Erie.
All the while, the island was being put to a grisly use that still haunts it. For hundreds of years, Liberty Island was a place for hangings. Dozens of pirates met their fate there, including one Cornelius Wilhelms, a Dutch sailor who, along with confederates, killed the captain of his ship and its officers, killed the male passengers and then, according to a 1860 New York Times article, went after the women: "After a series of indignities, one lady was killed and thrown overboard, and the other was tossed overboard alive." Wilhelms was executed on Bedloe's Island on June 21, 1839. By then, the island had long been associated with buccaneers. According to some legends, Captain William Kidd, a famous New World pirate and an early resident of Manhattan, buried part of his lost treasure there.
New York's final public execution also took place on the island. Albert Hicks was an infamous killer, both the city's last pirate and its first gangster. He worked on whaling ships all over the world but lived on Cedar Street in Manhattan, lingering around the waterfront dives where the ships were so thick that their bowsprits came together to form a canopy above the East River docks. In March 1860, Hicks, a first mate on an oyster sloop, killed his entire crew in the lower bay, made off with money in a dinghy, landed on Staten Island and lighted out.
What followed was one of the most intense manhunts in city history. The trial became a sensation. More than 12,000 people gathered in ships in the harbor on July 13, 1860, to watch Hicks die.
From the gallows, he would see the upper bay, the lower bay and the red-brick front of the seaport, the entire theater of his crime. The execution became a carnival, a debauch, which is one of the reasons it was the last of its kind. Public executions, which had already been discontinued by the city -- Hicks had been convicted of piracy, a federal crime -- had become an embarrassment.
When the statue was dedicated on the same site just 26 years later, on Oct. 28, 1886, more than a million came out for a ceremony and New York's first-ever ticker-tape parade. That day, the statue stood for American greatness. Six years later, with the opening of the immigration inspection station on nearby Ellis Island -- formerly Gibbet Island; pirates were hung there too -- it also came to stand for human inflow and American promise. Annie Moore was the first of 12 million immigrants to land on Ellis Island, a 17-year-old from Ireland who had traveled in steerage.
But the life of America is short: Many of those alive to see the statue's dedication would have remembered the island's other history, and thus remembered a different kind of symbol. To them, the place would stand for the lawless old New York, a settlement on the edge of an unknown continent.
That was another city, from another time, New York as it had been when pirates anchored off 14th Street. That wild, freewheeling town had to make way for the modern metropolis. None of which changes the fact: When you are looking at the Statue of Liberty, you are seeing the site of the last gallows to claim an American pirate.

Texto completo: For over 100 years starting around the early 1900s, many workers throughout France toiled away in a veste de travail, a marine-blue cotton work coat with three front pockets to secure their nails, seeds, lures or whatever supplies they needed. The purpose of this jacket -- now known in stylish circles as a chore coat -- was to last "for 10, 20 years, 30 years if necessary," said Alexandre Milan, the president of Le Mont Saint Michel, a company in the bucolic Brittany region that has produced moleskin versions, originally for local farmers and craftsmen, since 1913.
"It was not a fashion garment back in the day," explained Laurent Bourven, the co-owner of French clothing label Arpenteur, an 8-year-old brand that produces durable versions. But in the 1980s, the chore coat was embraced by intellectuals and creatives. Perhaps charitably, Mr. Milan suggests this could have been a way to show workers solidarity. For Bill Cunningham, the late street-style photographer for the New York Times, the appeal was all functional. Mr. Cunningham began buying the jackets at a Parisian department store for the meager sum of $20. "They were the ones that the street sweepers wore," he said in a 2010 documentary on his life. "The jacket is functional 'cause it has the pockets and you can launder it, and I thought the color was nice."
In the years since that documentary's release, plenty of other non-blue-collar folks have reached similar conclusions. Especially relative to a blazer, the coats have a casualness and a versatility that "speaks to a lot of people," ventured Somsack Sikhounmuong, the co-founder and creative director of Alex Mill, a young New York-based label that produces an archetypal three-pocket chore coat. For the modern man who relies on phones, chargers and other digital doodads to get through the day, what might seem like an excess of pockets soon justifies itself. Aesthetically, the jacket is winningly Frankensteinian -- mashing-up the crisp lines of a sport coat with the rough-it-up ruggedness of a flannel shirt. Make a chore coat cubicle-ready by layering it over a pressed shirt and knit tie. On weekends, toss one lazily over a T-shirt to appear marginally more presentable.
Men are not starved for chore coat options. RRL offers a lovingly distressed version, seemingly ripped off the back of a 1920s factory worker. Prada makes one in whisper-quiet navy with tone-on-tone stitching and a non-proletariat $1,220 price tag. And for the eco-conscious guy, Patagonia cuts its from hemp canvas. Still popular are the authentic French iterations by labels like Vetra, Le Mont Saint Michel, Arpenteur and Le Laboureur. Each of these options meets the chore-coat criteria: a traditional three pocket shape; flapped collar; and a straight hem.
The work jacket offers an interesting design challenge because it's a "blank canvas," explained Marc Asseily, the other co-founder of Arpenteur, which renders chore coats in collaboration with the brand C'H'C'M in irreverent colors like tomato red and sunflower yellow. Other labels similarly deviate from the norm with their colors, fabrications and fits. See: lavender tie-dye (California streetwear label Stussy); a refreshing mint-green with four pockets (New York's Childs); and an airy and understated black linen (Sweden's Our Legacy).
Such tweaks don't compromise the chore coat's enduring appeal as a trusty layer. But you can't go wrong with a classic. Brent MacKinnon, 29, a marketer in Halifax, Nova Scotia, recently purchased a durable Gap chore coat to get him through spring. "Denim jackets and bombers can be a bit boxy if your torso is shorter," said Mr. MacKinnon, "but a chore coat is a couple inches longer, I find, so it's a nice layer." If you deal with more heat, consider Alex Mill's light cotton creation or Our Legacy's linen version. It may be called a chore coat, but it shouldn't be a chore to wear.

It’s time to check NASA’s astronomical spending

Texto completo: For a government website, NASA’s homepage is an exciting place. Americans can read news releases brimming with all sorts of interesting announcements. For example, on June 3, Pennsylvania students had “an opportunity to speak live with a NASA astronaut aboard the International Space Station.” The agency also lets taxpayers know that NASA is pro-small business, and willing to hand out dollars to startups to develop solar panels. But NASA is less than forthcoming about its mounting cost overruns and schedule delays — which are costing taxpayers billions of dollars and jeopardizing future missions. Taxpayers deserve better.
You wouldn’t know it unless you checked it out for yourself, but NASA has a serious spending problem. According to a report released in May by the Government Accountability Office, NASA’s major projects have veered nearly thirty percent over budget, as average launches are typically delayed by over a year. One of the chief culprits behind exploding cost figures is the James Webb Space Telescope, which was originally supposed to cost upward of $3.5 billion and launch by 2011. The latest estimates (but probably not the last) have the telescope launching in 2021 and costing $9.7 billion — a 177 percent increase.
In a 2018 report, NASA’s inspector general pointed out that NASA has a persistent, reckless culture of misplaced optimism, which prevents it from soberly assessing costs on the novel technologies it dreams up. After proposing the project, NASA had to invent 10 technologies in order to even make the JWST viable. In popular discourse, a proposal that precedes available technology is called a “pipe dream” — these are fun to have, but shouldn’t be dependent on the taxpayer’s dollar.
The JWST is not a one-off. The Hubble Space Telescope itself followed a similar fiscal path. NASA’s go-to star searcher was supposed to cost $200 million when it was proposed, but, by the end, costs ballooned to more than $1 billion. In 2008, former NASA science chief Alan Stern warned in a New York Times op-ed that “A CANCER is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects.”
At the very least, taxpayers can take solace in the fact that these expenditures aren’t that big compared to the rest of federal budget. But, still — NASA’s 2019 budget of $21.5 billion is one of the highest since the Apollo Program (after adjusting for inflation). And its spending is even about to surge “bigly.” The Trump administration is determined to bring the U.S. back to the moon, and, right now, NASA doesn’t have enough funding for that. Depending on the report cited, another voyage to the moon could cost taxpayers anywhere from $53 billion to $86 billion (after adjusting for inflation from initial reports). Again, the mission is delayed — the Space Launch System tasked with bringing humans to the moon is roughly three years behind schedule. Too, it’ll cost double the originally-projected amount. The next trip to the moon seems to be more of a silly competition with China or Russia rather than a quest for scientific knowledge.
Robotic probes exploring new worlds would be a much better idea. Besides, robotic exploration can be done at a fraction of the cost, and without the risk of radiation to astronauts devoid of Earth’s atmospheric protections. Regardless of the future missions that NASA chooses to undertake, the agency should work with lawmakers, watchdogs and independent auditors to ensure that initial budget estimates are not too rosy. For taxpayers’ sake, America’s space agency should stop shooting for the moon and try getting its spending under control.

Texto completo: EAGLEHAWK NECK, Tasmania -- By the time Matt Zurbo plopped on the couch to write his 282nd children's story, he'd worked all day at an oyster farm, laughed with his daughter on the beach, gone for a swim in the frigid waves and cooked a vegetarian feast.
It was just after 10 p.m., and his eyes were drooping. But not for long. Assisted by whiskey and a Venezuelan ballad, he finished the tale of a girl who loved to dance and published it online at 1 a.m., leaving just 83 stories to go before completing his 365-day challenge.
"The more kids love stories and love books, the better the world will be for my daughter," Zurbo said. "Imagination trumps violence and ignorance, and always will."
Many of us who are parents experience a similar flush of love for stories with the arrival of our firstborn. Some people (Hoda Kotb, Kelly Clarkson) even produce books inspired by their offspring. But Zurbo's challenge, named after his 20-month-old daughter, Cielo, is a case study in creativity.
He's not just a writer with four published novels, an oral history of Australian-rules football and eight children's books. He's also a hard-living adventurer with hands he can't close into fists after 30 years clearing trails and replanting forests in the Australian bush.
Oystering at sunrise is his form of settling down. As for marriage and fatherhood? "Never expected it," Zurbo told me. "I was waiting around to die."
His book project, then, is best read as a burst of daily celebration -- what might happen if an Australian Jack Kerouac had the child he'd always wanted, at age 50, with a Venezuelan architect who showed up at a logger's pub one night.
Zurbo's stories range from the joyous (Day 168: "Bare Feet") to the absurd (Day 144: "Backwards With Billy Hanging") to the lyrical (Day 7: "The World's Smallest Sound") and the personal (Day 133: "For Cielo"). None of them have been published, nor is there any marketing behind the project.
"That's what's so beautiful about it," said Matt Ottley, who has illustrated award-winning children's books such as "Luke's Way of Looking." "It's generally just floating there in the net. It's like coming across a really rich secret garden that nobody knew existed."

That it comes from a bloke without a college degree, with a reputation for wilderness forestry and the occasional fistfight on the footy pitch, makes it all the more astounding.
"The sensitivity and poetic beauty of some of his texts is hard to fathom," said Helen Chamberlin, a retired Australian children's books editor who worked with Zurbo on his 2015 picture book "Moon." "He'd strike anyone who meets him as a rough diamond."
I spent a few days in rural Tasmania with Zurbo, who usually goes by Salty (at work) or Old Dog (a football nickname). He is 52 but looks younger, with the slightly hunched walk of an athlete perpetually leaning forward.
When we arrived at his wood-slat home, a neighbor's chickens running free in the yard, he carried his Macbook in one hand and oyster-stained pants in the other. Inside, he eyed the shiny sea-blue linoleum, the orderly kid's room, and apologized for the lack of a lived-in vibe.
"It's not normally like this," he said.
Leaning against the kitchen table was a black-and-white photo of a crowded pub. His sister, a music photographer who goes by Zo Damage, shot it at the Tote, a Melbourne venue for raucous bands ignored by pop charts.
"It's a beautiful mess," Zurbo said. "A place where people who believe in things go."
His first novel, "Idiot Pride," published by Penguin in 1997, was born in grotty places like that. Written for young adults but full of sex, marijuana and alienation, it was shortlisted as book of the year by the Children's Book Council of Australia. "It was about trying to find pride in going nowhere -- idiot pride," Zurbo said as he chopped a sweet potato for dinner.
The front door creaked open. Cielo burst in with a squeal and Zurbo spun her around while singing "Cecilia." Over vegetables and rice, while Cielo played with a book, Zurbo and his wife, Elena, explained their unexpected domesticity.
They met three years ago, when he was on a break from the forest and she was on vacation after splitting with her husband. Having fled Caracas and an architecture job where she was pressured to support the government, Elena, 38, was trying out interior design and working on a novel. He was frustrated with his last book and had given up on love.
"I was in the mountains just living a hard life," he said. "Everyone said this is going to change everything, and I said, 'Thank Christ."'
Their daughter arrived after a scary trip down Tasmania's country roads, Elena having gone into labor three weeks early with pre-eclampsia. They got engaged that night. A golden-haired extrovert, Cielo ("heaven" in Spanish) is their surprise beginning.

Zurbo said the 365-day story project is meant to be a gift to her, though he also wouldn't mind a publisher picking a tale or two to add to the family's meager income. Ultimately, he said, he's trying to be a good parent, building on what his father, an illustrator, and mother, a doyenne of Melbourne's avant-garde theater the Pram Factory, did for him: inspire a love of creativity.
"My mum and dad split up when I was 2. So what?" he said. "Mostly, they cut me loose, which was great for my imagination. I was free to roam."
His own urges, Zurbo admitted, still push in the same direction. With everything, he seems to work fast, as if wasted time and energy are evil.
Four hours after publishing the story about the dancing girl, he was in the kitchen mixing dinner's leftovers with eggs to carry to work for lunch. By sunrise, we were out on Boomers Bay and he was in the muddy shallows, guiding a boat alongside a Pacific gull he'd named Sphincter.
Oystering is mostly lugging baskets from one place to another. Zurbo admitted he didn't love it as much as the forest, and he worried that the wages of around 23 Australian dollars an hour ( $ 16) were not enough for a family, but he attacked every task.
"As a worker, he's great," said Phil Glover, his manager at Blue Lagoon Oysters.
Stories, even at work, seemed to rise like tides. At one point, Zurbo told me he had an idea for one inspired by the previous day's tale of the dancing girl.
"She's dancing with a monster no one can see," he said. "And her brother, he doesn't know it, but he's making the monster laugh."
Some of the stories in "Cielo" come from these kinds of iterations. But a lot of them start with people he's met and what they tell him about their children.
Day 102: "The Best Skier in the World" is drawn from a friend whose son broke his leg skiing and needed cheering up. Day 209: "Austin's First Game" is for Dave "Wally" Cusic, the club captain of his Aussie-rules football club, the Dodges Ferry Sharks.
"He had his first child recently, loves his footy, obviously," Zurbo told me. "I did this the day Austin was born, as a present."
And that dancing girl? She's my daughter. The first night I met Zurbo, he asked me what my two kids were into. Thinking nothing of it, I told him.
When I showed the story to Amelia, who is 8, she was thrilled, insisting we get a copy of the book when it published. I didn't have the heart to tell her that might never happen.
That's the thing with "Cielo." It's free. Online. Stories for the love of stories, a project as impractical and relentless as its creator.
"We're jumping from rock to rock," Zurbo said the last night I stayed with him, "just trying to get across the stream."

An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the Melbourne pub whose photo is in Zurbo's home. It is the Tote, not the Tate.

Democrats smeared all opposition to Obama as racist; now AOC is playing the race card against Pelosi

Texto completo: Nancy Pelosi tried to scold the "Four Horsewomen of the Apocalypse" this week, and boy, did it escalate quickly.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has responded by accusing the speaker of — what else? — racism. Considering Democrats spent the entire Obama era claiming that all opposition to their agenda constituted racism, it really could not have happened to a nicer party.
Pelosi spoke privately with members of her caucus this week, admonishing specifically those who had been broadcasting House Democrats' family disputes all over social media rather than seeking guidance and resolution from leadership. Unsurprisingly, Pelosi zeroed in on the freshman New York representative, who has yet to let a thought go untweeted, and her progressive colleagues, including Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
"So, again, you got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it," the speaker reportedly told Democrats. "But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK."
This is basic party discipline, but Ocasio-Cortez’s takeaway from this closed-door meeting was not, “be a team player and expect a ruckus if you besmirch your fellow Democrats in public.” Rather, the message that the freshman congresswoman came away with is: Nancy Pelosi is a racist.
“When these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm’s distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood,” Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post, referring to not just the closed-door meeting but other critical remarks that the speaker has had for herself and the other freshman progressives.
She added, “But the persistent singling out . . . it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful . . . the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.”
Uh-oh.
I do not know which is funnier: Ocasio-Cortez falling back on her predictable “woman of color" card to defend her conduct, or the fact that Pelosi, whose party spent all eight years of the Obama administration using bad faith allegations of racism, has now herself become the target of the same kind of transparently absurd accusations. I guess it was only a matter of time before the Monster turned on Frankenstein.
I would be lying if I said it has not been entertaining to watch the escalation of hostilities between Pelosi and the progressives, including when the speaker said of the Four Horsewomen in a New York Times interview that published Saturday, “All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. They didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”
This clearly got under AOC's skin. She responded with a tweet that read: "That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country."
TweetEarlier than that, Pelosi had remarked publicly that Ocasio-Cortez’s electoral victory against incumbent former Rep. Joe Crowley was not that impressive, considering New York’s 14th Congressional District is overwhelmingly liberal.
"[T]hose are districts that are solidly Democratic. This glass of water would win with a D next to its name in those districts," the speaker said, motioning to a glass near a table.
John Boehner, who also faced an insurrection led by over-eager, under-prepared, and inexperienced freshman lawmakers when he served as speaker, must be enjoying the spectacle.Story URLPhoto Caption:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi.

McCarthy mocks Pelosi-AOC fight: From the cover of Rolling Stone to throwing stones

Texto completo: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy took multiple swings at House Democrats as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi struggles to wrangle with the more liberal elements of party.
"The majority has reached a new low," McCarthy, a California Republican, told reporters Thursday. "I watch the news. A lot of the talk is about the war within this new 'socialist Democratic Party.' It's interesting. In a few short months, I watched the speaker and a lot of those freshmen smile on the cover of the Rolling Stone magazine. And now I'm just watching stones being thrown at one another."
McCarthy added the dysfunction was impeding legislative and policy business of Congress, alluding to comments from New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, who publicly questioned Pelosi's leadership on social media.
"Now I understand within this new 'Democratic socialist party,' they've got a big fight going on in their conference. They have real challenges to bring up the most basic things," McCarthy said. "I understand that it's not just a family feud, it's now become a war."
Chakrabarti's tweets were provoked by an interview Pelosi gave the New York Times last weekend in which she criticized "the Squad," a quartet of freshman lawmakers including Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts.
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got."
"All these articles want to claim what a legislative mastermind Pelosi is, but I'm seeing way more strategic smarts from freshman members," Chakrabarti wrote on Twitter in response. "Pelosi is just mad that she got outmaneuvered (again) by Republicans."
Tensions between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez have been souring since April, when the speaker spoke to several news outlets and downplayed the influence of the liberal firebrands. The relationship, however, went further south when Pelosi agreed to a $4.6 billion emergency funding bill for border security and to improve conditions at migrant detention centers, which liberals did not support.
Pelosi has refused to walk back her remarks on numerous occasions.
"I have no regrets about anything,” she told reporters this week. “Regret is not what I do."
Ocasio-Cortez, for her part, has continued the feud.
“When these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm’s distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood,” she told the Washington Post. “But the persistent singling out ... it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful ... the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.”Story URLPhoto Caption:House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, is seen in an office.

Texto completo: Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she would not be addressing her recent spat with the more left-leaning freshmen members of the Democratic Party anymore during her press conference Thursday morning.
Her refusal to comment comes as she has feuded with Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley.
"I’ve said what I’m going to say in the caucus. That’s where this is appropriate, and I said what I’m going to say in the caucus. They took offense because I addressed, at the request of my members, an offensive tweet that came out of one of the member’s offices that referenced our Blue Dogs and our New Dems essentially as segregationists," Pelosi stated at the press conference. "Our members took offense at that. I addressed that. How they’re interpreting and carrying it to another place is up to them. But I’m not going to be discussing it any further."
Then, when a reporter asked her a follow-up question on the matter, she added, "We respect the value of every member of our caucus. The diversity of it all is a wonderful thing. Diversity is our strength. Unity is our power. And we have a big fight, and we’re in the arena, and that’s all I’m going to say on the subject. If you want to waste your question, you can waste your question."
Nancy Pelosi on party fighting
The spat within the party began last weekend when Pelosi told New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd that the vocal freshmen had little actual power in Congress.
“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” she said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”
The freshmen members of Congress pushed back on Pelosi, with Ocasio-Cortez saying she doesn't have a relationship with the speaker.

The fight continued when Pelosi said she doesn't regret any of the comments she made.
In turn, Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post Wednesday that, "The persistent singling out ... it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful ... the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.”Story URLPhoto Caption:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California meets with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Texto completo: El diario The New York Times publicó este jueves que las tan anunciadas redadas comenzarán finalmente el próximo domingo. El operativo se desplegará previsiblemente en diez grandes ciudades (entre ellas Nueva York, Chicago o Los Ángeles) y estará destinado a todos los extranjeros “que violen las leyes de inmigración” , según dijo a Univision el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, por sus siglas en inglés).
Aunque la agencia federal rechazó ofrecer “detalles específicos relacionados con las operaciones”, si adelantó que el 90% de los extranjeros arrestados en 2018 “ tenían una o más condenas criminales pendientes o eran fugitivos” . Matthew Bourke, vocero de ICE, insitió en que la prioridad de la agencia migratoria es arrestar y deportar a quienes constituyan “una amenaza para la seguridad nacional, la seguridad pública y la seguridad fronteriza”.
ICE considera fugitivos a los extranjeros que permanecen en el país a pesar de tener una orden de deportación y a quienes firmaron una salida voluntaria del país pero no se fueron en la fecha acordada con las autoridades migratorias. Por su parte, volver a entrar a Estados Unidos sin autorización después de haber sido deportado en el pasado ( reentry ) implica un delito criminal, que se castiga incluso con cárcel.
Las redadas que Donald Trump ha anunciado ampliamente desde principios de junio ya son “inminentes”, tal como aseguro una fuente anónima del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) a Univision y como confirmó más tarde The New York Times.
Cinco días después de llegar a la Casa Blanca, Trump firmó una orden ejecutiva con la que declaró la permanencia indocumentada como una amenaza para la seguridad pública y nacional . En este sentido, el objetivo del presidente es deportar a los inmigrantes que se encuentren en alguno de los siguientes casos :
1. Condena por cualquier delito.
2. Acusación no resuelta por cualquier delito.
3. Comisión de actos que constituyen delito penal imputable.
4. Fraude o tergiversación deliberada de cualquier asunto oficial.
5. Sujeción a orden penal de deportación.
6. Riesgo para la seguridad pública o nacional (según un funcionario de migración).
7. M igrantes legales que perdieron sus derechos de permanencia y que continúan en el país.

Texto completo: Monica A. Johnson, vice president of Sistahfriends Book Club of Shreveport, was heading out on a 10-day vacation when she emailed me about her summer reading. She had four novels lined up to read, "just to get me started." (Don't you love readers who are thinking about what's up next on their reading lists?)
Johnson's vacation reads included: "Rebel" by Beverly Jenkins, "His To Claim" by Brenda Jackson, "Banking On Love by Iris Bolling, and "Greed" by Victoria Christopher Murray. Each of these is a romance novel by a bestselling African-American author.
The topic of diversity in romance writing comes up frequently in writing and reading circles and has brought much discussion in the national Romance Writers of America organization, particularly in the past couple of years. When RWA meets later this month for its national conference, there will be a special session on diversity, equity and inclusion.
Jenkins, the author of one of the books on Johnson's lists, is a leader in multiculturalism in the romance genre and has been awarded top honors in the industry. Her new book, "Rebel," is the first in a series following a Northern woman south in the chaotic aftermath of the Civil War. The protagonist is trying to help the newly emancipated survive and flourish, but thugs destroy the school she has set up and then target her, sending her into the arms of a special man.
As Publishers Weekly says in its review, "Jenkins addresses sensitive, serious issues in a tactful, realistic manner, and she brilliantly balances the real sorrows of history with a shimmering romance. This is a grand tale of finding happiness in hard times." For more: www.BeverlyJenkins.net.
A science fiction recommendation
When my husband, Paul, saw the books on my summer reading list, he was not the least bit interested in reading any of them. So there. A reminder that readers are different, and a book I love might leave you bored. Paul's current summer book is "Seveneves" by Neal Stephenson, a New York Times bestseller released in 2015 by HarperCollins. Paul picked the novel up after seeing it on favorites lists from Bill Gates and Barack Obama, and he has loved it.
The premise: What would happen if the world were ending? A catastrophic event renders the Earth a ticking time bomb, and nations around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the survival of humanity in outer space.
Stephenson's newest book, "Fall; or, Dodge in Hell: A Novel," was released last month from William Morrow. For more: www.NealStephenson.com.
More on audiobooks
My column about the popularity of audiobooks brought emails and book recommendations from area readers.
"I just started listening to audiobooks (outside of travelling) when I started commuting to work, 40 minutes each way," Melinda Hollander, of Greenwood, said. "I've listened to well over 12 books in 10 months. By far, the best book I've listened to is "Then She Was Gone" by Lisa Jewell. I will probably listen to it again soon, it was so good. I listen using Hoopla and Libby from my local library."
This suspense novel, released last year by Simon and Schuster, is about Ellie Mack, 15, the perfect daughter and youngest of three. She is beloved by her parents, friends, and teachers and happy with her boyfriend — and then she disappears. Ten years pass, and her mother, Laurel, is trying to put her life back together after a divorce, with clues trickling in about Ellie's case. Then she meets an unexpectedly charming man in a café, and, as their relationship develops, meets his daughters — one of whom looks like Ellie. The questions arise all over again: Where did Ellie go? Did she really run away from home, as the police suspected, or was there a more sinister reason for her disappearance? Why does this young woman remind Laurel so viscerally of her own missing girl?
From another book lover
Avid reader Glenda Erwin of Shreveport mentioned a new angle to audiobooks in a note: "I am a huge fan of Audible books and especially love their partnership with Kindle books allowing the reader to listen and read a book simultaneously. Like you, I listen during the day while driving or cooking and read at night in bed. Road trips are now greatly enhanced by selecting and saving a special book for the adventure, making the hours and miles pass quickly."
Erwin enjoys historical fiction and appreciates talented narrators who pronounce the names and places in the story, a benefit and learning experiences from audiobooks.
New audiobook discount service from BookBub
BookBub, the discount e-book service used by millions (including me), has started Chirp, a site that offers limited-time deals on select audiobooks. There's no subscription fee, and all books you purchase through the service are yours to keep. You don't have to listen during a certain time frame or return them. See www.ChirpBooks.com or www.BookBub.com.
Happy Birthday to my reading inspiration
My father, Charlie Ross Pace, was born on this day (July 11) in 1914. Although he died in 1975, he left me the legacy of reading. Every morning he sat in his wooden rocking chair and read The Shreveport Times. At other times of the day, he read "Reader's Digest," frequently recounting an anecdote or story he particularly liked.
He is the first person in my life who I saw sitting and reading every day — and who made me realize that stories were enticing. Thanks, Daddy.

Lancaster Safety Coalition wants to replace its fleet of cameras with 360-degree ones

Texto completo: A Lancaster Safety Coalition video placed accused shooter Wilberto Melendez at the scene of the homicide.
The camera also captured William Earl Cooper Jr. lying on the South Marshall Street sidewalk after being shot Oct. 27, 2017.
The camera missed the moments when someone fired at the 31-year-old man.
If it had not, the progression of the case could have been quite different.
David Greiner, the coalition’s director of monitoring and evidence, testified at Melendez’s trial in May to how the cameras make 3½- to 4-minute “tours” around and down the roads at an intersection.
Greiner also mentioned the coalition’s hope to get better cameras that would capture more of a scene. The trial ended in a mistrial for a reason unrelated to the surveillance.
Lancaster Safety Coalition, which operates city camera network, names executive director after 2-year gap
On Tuesday, coalition Executive Director Tim Miller said in a phone interview the organization soon will release information on a plan to replace its 170 pan, tilt and zoom cameras with 360-degree models.
“If you have a single camera lens moving around all the time, you are going to miss some things. We are helpful in police cases, but we are not able to provide a full story of what happened,” Miller said.

‘Encouraging’ news
The coalition, which earned its nonprofit status in 2005, is not affiliated with municipal or law enforcement parties. The organization relies on donations to maintain and operate the camera system.
The cameras have been heralded by Lancaster city leaders and law enforcement as helpful tools in preventing and solving crimes.

Jess King
“Residents and police alike have come to rely on them to solve crimes.”
------------
“The Lancaster Safety Coalition cameras have proven themselves to be very valuable as it relates to criminal investigations,” said Jess King, Lancaster Mayor Danene Sorace’s chief of staff, in an email. “Residents and police alike have come to rely on them to solve crimes.”
Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman said the news was “very encouraging.”
“A 360-degree lens would greatly expand the value and provide additional evidence in even more cases,” Stedman said in an email.
From Jan. 1 to July 8, the coalition was able to find and provide video for 414 of 676 requests made by law enforcement, according to Jessica Falk, director of operations.
680 views of Lancaster
The new cameras would include four lenses, simultaneously capturing the full, surrounding scene.
Multiply the 170 camera locations by four lenses per camera, and that’s 680 views of Lancaster city at once, Miller said.
Miller said a few of the new cameras have been set up for testing, including one at Lemon and Charlotte streets and one at Lime and Walnut streets.
The plans are still being developed, and more information — including cost — will be released soon, Miller said.
The fundraising effort is likely to be costly. Installation of the 165 camera set up through 2009 cost nearly $3 million, according to LNP records. The project was funded by hundreds of public and private donors.
------------
Facial recognition
San Francisco in May became the first U.S. city to ban the use of facial recognition technology by police and other departments.
Lancaster city does not have such a ban, but the nonprofit that runs its 170 surveillance cameras says they don’t use the technology.
“As a 501(c)3, it’s incredibly important for us to preserve the public’s trust,” Executive Director Tim Miller said.
For an extra cost, the coalition could add facial recognition technology to their software.
But the board has determined “for many years” that it would not use the technology and has stuck with it, Miller said.
Other cities have been grappling with facial recognition issues.
Sommerville, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb, followed San Francisco’s move earlier this month.
In Detroit, a public outcry is ongoing against the technology in thousands of cameras around the city, according to a Monday report from the New York Times.
On Tuesday, the Worcester, Mass.-based nonprofit Fight for the Future launched what it calls the first national campaign calling for a federal prohibition on all uses of facial recognition technology by governments.

Joe Biden taught me about loss and love. Now, he can teach us how to make a graceful exit.

Texto completo: Joe Biden and I go back a long way — more than four decades. In that time, he has taught me two crucial life lessons. Now, I’m hoping he will provide a third one.
As a 15-year-old in 1972, I read about the tragic deaths of his first wife, Neilia, and their 1-year-old daughter. Only a few years before they were killed in a car wreck, my mother had bought us matching stationery sets. Hers read “Mrs. Margot Petrow” and mine “Steve Petrow. ” Already a veteran letter writer, I took pen to paper and wrote Joe Biden a note of condolence.
I kept no copy of my missive, but I’ve held onto Biden’s response for 47 years now. His letter came in a heavy, cream-colored envelope with the return address, "United States Senate, Washington, D. C. ," engraved in dark blue in the left corner. He addressed it to "Mr. Petrow," probably the first time anyone had called me that:
"I offer a belated thank-you for your kind words of condolence. I deeply appreciate your sentiments. I owed so very much to Neilia. She had a talent for making not only her own life worthwhile but also the lives of those around her. She was both a loving mother and a loving wife. In addition, she was my political confidant, in whose judgment I had implicit and utmost trust. Neilia looked forward to our coming to Washington. Now our life has been completely torn apart by an event I shall never completely comprehend. Neilia deserved better.
"Best wishes, Joe Biden"
Joe Biden, the role model
Back then, I knew nothing about illness, much less death — but Joe Biden’s family tragedy taught me about the random hands of the fates that can appear in no time from nowhere. In time, too soon in fact, I’d learn these lessons more fully, especially when I was diagnosed with cancer.
I had only a glimmer that in life, to borrow from mystery writer Dashiell Hammett, men die “at haphazard like that” and live “only while blind chance” spares them. The vice president himself put it even more simply in his 2015 graduation speech at Yale: “Reality has a way of intruding” into one’s life. That was Biden Lesson No. 1.
She would have done the same: Dear Kamala Harris, here's why Joe Biden worked with segregationists in the Senate
Since then, which adds up to much of my adult life, I’ve looked to Joe Biden as a role model — as a father, a spouse, a politician and simply as a man. Along the way, “Uncle Joe” (just one of his many nicknames) has made any number of gaffes (calling fellow presidential candidate Barack Obama “the first sort of mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean”) and misstatements (asking a state senator who is paralyzed to stand up) and “sleepy creepy” moments (President Donald Trump’s nod to Biden’s longtime disposition to be too touchy-feely with women). Call them whatever you want, I believed his heart was always in the right place even when his mouth — or hands — indicated otherwise.
In the sad spring of 2015, I, like many Americans, followed Joe and Jill Biden’s public embrace of their son Beau, who died of brain cancer. Again, I wrote Biden. Like Beau, I, too, had had cancer at an early age. Unlike Beau, I survived. Joe Biden’s open expression of his heart, his pain and his public anguish reminded me of the depth of this man’s feelings and his ability to connect to others, especially those who had endured personal loss.
“Dear Mr. Vice President,
"I am very sorry to hear about the loss of your son, Beau. Forty-three years ago you wrote to thank me for a condolence note I had sent you as a teenager on the passing of your wife and daughter. If anything your letter taught me that life’s complexities can’t always be understood and that they must be accepted, with the prayer that something good will follow. ”
I did not hear back from the vice president, but that was OK. I believed that Biden might be able to translate this new loss into major advances for cancer treatment, especially when he spearheaded President Obama’s cancer moonshot program, which the vice president promised would “double the rate of progress in preventing, diagnosing and treating cancer. ”
When overpromising become lying: Joe Biden says he'll cure cancer. Sounds like the kind of lie Donald Trump would tell.
In a speech days before leaving office in 2017, the vice president, as he often had throughout his life, brought the personal to the political, in this case the medical. “Like many of you," Biden said, "I decided to become acquainted with this after someone close to me in my family was diagnosed. You tend to try to learn everything you possibly can once that occurs. And I knew little about the discipline. And like I said, what impressed me was that so much of this is really very brand new in terms of the collaboration. ”
And there it was, Biden Lesson No. 2: Resilience in the face of adversity.
I hadn’t realized at the time how much such a lesson would mean. My mother had died 10 days earlier, and my father would pass 90 days later. A half-year later my little sister, a wife and mother of two girls, would be diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. With Julie’s diagnosis, if anyone now needed a moonshot — or just a plain shot in the arm — it was our family. Joe Biden gave me hope.
Not the man for this moment
In recent months, I’ve watched Biden with anticipation, only to find my enthusiasm curbed. He has rightfully been criticized for his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 1991 Anita Hill hearings, and he recently told the hosts of ABC's "The View": "Look at what I said and didn’t say; I don’t think I treated her badly. ”
His record speaks for itself: I was with Joe Biden when no one was looking, and he was always a champion for women
When it comes to his history of inappropriately touching women, the former veep — despite a video statement declaring “I get it” — continues to make jokes about this topic.
Then, in the first presidential debates late last month, I watched Biden — my teenage hero and midlife role model — lose his footing in front of more than 18 million viewers.
The details of his exchange with Sen. Kamala Harris of California are well known: She accused him of cozying up to two segregationist senators under the guise of civility, and he then gave a states rights defense of his opposition to busing as a means to achieve integration. Suffice it to say, Joe Biden showed us that when it comes to gender and race, he’s out of step with these times. Instead, I wish he had given me a third life lesson: Don’t confuse a mea culpa or a real, genuine apology with weakness. It’s about being human.
Over the weekend, Biden asked a South Carolina crowd rhetorically whether he was “wrong a few weeks ago to somehow give the impression to folks that I was praising those people who I opposed time and again?” “Yes, I was,” he answered. His quasi apology for the "pain and misconception it may have caused" was both a day late and a dollar short — actually more like nine days late.
Biden has taught me so much in my lifetime — about loss, about love, about virtue. I now wish the former vice president would extend a final lesson as a public servant and show us how to make a graceful exit before his accomplishments of the past are erased by this new day. We, too, owe him that.
Joe Biden means too much to me and to so many other Americans for his next — and final political chapter — to be one of missteps and gaffes, but most of all a tone-deafness that reveals a man whose time has come and is now over.

Speaking of Harvard and Kyle Kashuv: Let's talk about black kids and forgiveness.

Texto completo: Not getting into Harvard is not the end of Kyle Kashuv's life.
Kashuv is the Parkland school shooting survivor who was admitted to Harvard University. His offer was revoked after leaked documents showed him using anti-Semitic and racist slurs, including the N-word, and saying all Jewish people should be killed, in texts, Skype conversations and Google documents when he was 16.
He apologized to the admissions dean, William Fitzsimmons. He distanced himself from the language. "I see the world through different eyes and am embarrassed by the petty, flippant kid represented in those screenshots," he wrote in an apology, which he posted on Twitter.
When Harvard rescinded his admission anyway, many people were outraged, arguing that youthful mistakes shouldn't follow us into adulthood. In The Washington Examiner, Tom Rogan says the decision "illustrates Harvard's intellectual rot." In The New York Times, David Brooks says Harvard's decision reflects "a misunderstanding of how moral character develops."
"In a sin-drenched world it's precisely through the sins and the ensuing repentance that moral formation happens," Brooks writes. "That's why we try not to judge people by what they did in their worst moment, but rather by how they respond to their worst moment. That's why we are forgiving of 16-year-olds, because they haven't disgraced themselves enough to have earned maturity."
Here is where I hope we can pause and have an honest discussion.
We live in a country in which young people of color are threatened with death, or outright killed, for their mistakes, even perceived mistakes.
Maybe you saw the video earlier this month of Phoenix police officers drawing their guns on a family whose 4-year-old daughter allegedly took a doll from a Family Dollar Store.
You probably know the story of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old who was fatally shot by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman. Whispers of Martin's past indiscretions - he skipped school, he had a trace amount of THC, the chemical linked to pot, in his system - started to circulate, as if his death would be justified had he made a few mistakes.
"Trayvon was the victim in this case," his father, Tracy Martin, said to NPR. "They tried to make him the villain in this case."
Maybe you remember Brennan Walker, the 14-year-old black boy from Michigan who was chased and shot at by a man whose door he knocked on, asking for directions. Brennan's mistake? He overslept and missed his school bus, and he didn't know his way to school.
By now you know the story of Laquan McDonald, 17, shot 16 times and killed while walking away from police after failing to respond to their commands.
Kashuv will likely grow into a successful, productive, thoughtful adult. Even without a Harvard education. I hope, for his sake and ours, he does. The world doesn't need another person whose intellectual and moral maturity peaked in high school.
But if we're going to use his life as a conversation starter, if we're going to talk about forgiving children for their youthful indiscretions, about allowing moral formation to happen, about leaving space and time for maturity to develop, we need to talk about the role that race plays in our collective willingness to offer that grace. We need to include Trayvon Martin in those conversations. We need to include Laquan McDonald in those conversations. We need to include Brennan Walker in those conversations.
Otherwise they're disingenuous. Otherwise the outrage is lopsided and riddled with blind spots. And that gets us nowhere.

Texto completo: "It's all about Ashlyn. She's worked hard; she's done it all. And it is remarkable, especially being from a small town like this."
Mike Harris
Father of Ashlyn Harris, of Satellite Beach and the No. 2 goalkeeper for the World Cup champion U.S. women's national soccer team
Mike Harris looked around at the packed red, white and blue-clad crowd that had gathered around him Sunday morning in Satellite Beach, and was impressed.
"They're not here to see me," he laughed. "They're here to support the USA."
Indeed they were. But in a small town of 10,000, it's easy to be a celebrity when you're the father of one of soccer's most recognizable faces, goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris.
Bloody Marys and Buds were the order of the day in a cheery watering hole known as the "Whiskey Beach Pub," where everyone really does know your name. Mike was the one greeting guests, family members and well-wishers as the USA triumphed 2-0 against the Netherlands for its second straight World Cup title.
"It's all about Ashlyn," Mike said. "She's worked hard; she's done it all. And it is remarkable, especially being from a small town like this."
Ashlyn was the No. 2 goalkeeper behind Alyssa Naeher, similar to her role in 2015 as the backup to Hope Solo. And although Ashlyn's services weren't required this time around, her role was important.
"All 23 players have to be ready," Mike said, "because you never know. ... Hey, it's not all bad being No. 2 on the best team in the world."
Many accomplishments It's been quite a career for Ashlyn, who started playing soccer as a 5-year-old, even excelling in boys leagues by the age of 10.
Mike doesn't recall buying Ashlyn her first soccer soccer ball but does remember "there usually were soccer balls all around the house."
"When I was in high school (at Satellite), I don't even remember seeing anything about soccer," Mike said. "So I'm not sure when it started up, but glad it did as it turned out."
Ashlyn's accolades could fill an encyclopedia. Among her achievements:
Two Women's World Cup titles (2015 and 2019)
Two FIFA Under-19 World Cup appearances (one title in 2002 at age 16)
Three NCAA championships at North Carolina (2006, 2008, 2009)
Two state high school titles at Satellite High
Gatorade National High School Player of the Year award
Four-time Parade magazine high school All-American
Twice named Goalkeeper of the Year as a pro (2011 in WPS and 2016 in NWSL)
Ashlyn, 33, has played in seven pro leagues (including Germany and Sweden), weathering shutdowns and name changes (Women's United Soccer Association, Women's Professional Soccer, National Women's Soccer League) in America's top level of play.
Her athletic abilities, however, aren't necessarily a reflection of legendary sports genes.
"My claim to fame was bowling a perfect game," laughed Mike, a longtime Atlanta Braves fan who was a pretty good recreational athlete from baseball to tennis.
Mom Tammye, of Indian Harbour Beach, played competitive softball in her late teens.
"Ash is just a really good overall athlete, but this is what her passion was," Mike said.
While Tammye was in France watching Ashlyn, other family members hovered in the Whiskey Beach Pub, including brother Chris Harris; uncle Jimbo Habovick, and cousins, Kyle, Corey (and Brittany Edwards) and Cassidy; and one of Ashlyn's best friends, Jessica Andre, who was with her in Canada in 2015 to see her play.
Grandparents Curt and Eunice, and Mike's sister, Tina and her family, were watching from Palm Bay.
Mike offered praise to the late Fidgi Haig, who provided an early influence on Ashlyn as her high school coach.
And it's the sacrifices, not only from the family's perspective, but to Ashlyn herself.
"In between seasons, or games, there's really no off-time," Mike said. "You have to stay in shape."
Ashlyn has battled back from a fractured thumb, a broken wrist, tears in both ACLs in both knees, and a torn labrium in her hip and her shoulder.
"Knock on wood, nothing major the last few years," Mike said.
Cashing in So, what was the World Cup victory worth?
First, LUNA Bar offered each player a $31,250 bonus just to make the final World Cup roster spot, according to reports. That was designed to make up the difference between the women's $37,500 set bonus and the men's total.
There also was another $37,500 bonus for women's roster players who had qualified to play in the World Cup.
Plus, there were $3,000 bonuses for each qualification win ($15,000 total).
The World Cup winning team divides $4 million (double the total from 2015) from FIFA, the governing body; according to a Guardian analysis, that leaves each player with about a $110,000 bonus (with a maximum of $200,000 each).
And there is a four-city victory tour, including a New York ticker-tape parade Wednesday morning, which is worth an extra $60,869 to each player, the Guardian report revealed.
So, at most, US Soccer would pay the women $260,869 each, the Guardian reported.
However, a victory tour could call for players to earn $15,000 a game, a New York Times report shows.
What's next? After the parades, the autograph signings and TV appearances, Harris will head home to Satellite Beach, eventually.
First, there are commitments with the Orlando Pride.
There also are wedding plans to teammate and fiancee Ali Krieger, reportedly set for December in the Miami area.
"It's been a long road," Mike said. "We've been texting back and forth when we can because of the time difference; she says she's having fun over there.
"But I think they're all ready to get home."
Time for the real celebration to begin.

Russian cyberthreats are a 'blinking red light'

Texto completo: National Security Adviser John Bolton recently declared that "we're now opening the aperture, broadening the areas we're prepared to act" in cyberspace to meet a Russian threat that extends far beyond the ballot box, costing American companies billions of dollars and posing unacceptable risks to our citizens' safety and the American way of life.
It's about time.
For years, the Russians have been preparing the digital battlefield, treating our critical infrastructure as if it were their own cyber weapons range.
Overseas they've gone even further. In 2015 and 2016, the Kremlin planted malware in Ukraine's electric grid, disrupting power for hundreds of thousands of residents in the middle of winter. Keenly aware of its capabilities and motivations, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has said that "the warning lights are blinking red again" – an allusion to CIA Director George Tenet's warning to Congress just months before 9/11.
The federal government has a fundamental responsibility to deter Russia and other state actors from holding civilian infrastructure at risk. This is precisely why reports from The New York Times that the United States is embedding "potentially crippling malware" in Russia's power grid should concern all Americans. Cyber weapons are horrible deterrents – and mimicking targeting civilian infrastructure sets a dangerous precedent for America.
Fear of punishment or retribution is a fundamental tenet of deterrence theory. And it's true, as the head of U.S. Cyber Command, Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, told a Senate panel last year, the Russians "don't fear us." But to think that Vladimir Putin fears cyber-induced power outages in Moscow is a naive and dangerous miscalculation. To the contrary, an American cyberattack against Russia's power grid would play right into the Kremlin's strategic playbook.
First, the costs to the Kremlin would pale in comparison with the benefits. The vast scale of Russia's power grids, which include a total power generation capacity of 236 gigawatts, would render the military effects of any cyberattack relatively limited while granting the Kremlin its long-awaited case study of American cyber aggression, which it would use to consolidate domestic support for more censorship policies under the guise of cybersecurity.
Furthermore, an American cyberattack against civilian infrastructure – especially a preventative one aimed at deterring Russian hackers – would erode the United States' international credibility as a champion of a free and open internet governed by universal norms of acceptable behavior. Far more than sporadic blackouts – something that isn't uncommon anyway in Russia – Putin fears a digital age in which the West writes the rules.
We cannot fall into the trap of applying nuclear rules of deterrence to today's Cold War of digital proportions. Cyber weapons can be a tremendous military asset, especially if used as a proportionate means of neutralizing conventional weapons. But they are not conducive to threatening punishment. You can't parade them through public squares or test them in the desert – indeed the very knowledge of their existence by your adversaries renders them obsolete.
President Donald Trump says it's "NOT TRUE" that the United States is increasing cyberattacks on Russia's power grid. I hope he's right.

Troy entrepreneur strikes gold in marijuana industry

Texto completo: Nick Tennant spent eight months hunched over his dining room table learning how to assemble steel parts into a machine he saw as the future of the marijuana industry.
The first trial run produced exactly what the young entrepreneur wanted: lustrous gold CBD oil.
It's been seven years, and Tennant is still making equipment modeled after that first prototype. But the founder and chief technology officer of Precision Extraction Solutions has since swapped his dining room for a swanky office and a large warehouse nearly overflowing with wooden crates containing customer orders.
Tennant and his business partner Marc Beginin, co-founder and chief executive officer, own the Troy-based business that they say "shot out like a cannon" in 2014 to become an international leader in a niche corner of the ever-evolving and rapidly growing marijuana industry.
It sold more than $1 million in equipment in the first 90 days of business, Beginin said, and now hits that number in equipment sales every week to the industry's top brands.
"We didn't really know, you know?" Tennant said. "We were just two guys, we were like 'OK, we're going to try this out.' And then all of a sudden it just —" he motions upward like a plane taking off.
The company manufactures equipment that extracts compounds called CBD, or cannabidiol, and THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, from hemp and marijuana into oil that can then be processed into a variety of consumable products thought to have health benefits.
"We don't touch the leaf," Beginin said. "So if this was the gold rush, we would be selling the picks and shovels."
The Wild West of marijuana In a way, it is like the gold rush: a new frontier flush with possibility and high profits beset by a kind of a Wild West feeling of uncertainty and regulatory confusion.
The federal government legalized hemp in the 2018 Farm Bill, and since, products including lotions and tinctures made from hemp extracts are flooding the mainstream market on shelves of stores like Walgreens and CVS while farmers gear up to grow more of the multipurpose crop.
Kroger announced in June it would begin selling CBD-infused topicals at stores in several states, including 92 in Michigan.
It's the trend Tennant predicted. When he first jumped into business, extraction products made up about 30% of the market, he said. That number has since more than doubled to 60%-70%.
"I saw the trend starting to go toward extracts," Tenant said. "And I just thought that it was the future of everything."
Marijuana and hemp are two kinds of cannabis plant, each containing more than 80 chemical compounds. THC is the compound in marijuana that makes a user feel high. It is found in trace amounts, less than 0.3%, in hemp.
CBD's supposed benefits CBD lacks the psychoactive effects but is thought to have numerous health benefits. Several studies show CBD could be used to treat chronic pain, epilepsy, anxiety, depression and other disorders.
People in Michigan can buy CBD oil without a medical marijuana license. A state law passed in December 2018 said CBD and other hemp products are not regulated like medical marijuana because they contain little to none of the psychoactive chemical THC.
Despite his blue-eyed, blond-haired youthful looks, Tennant is not a new face in the industry. Before Precision, Tennant and Beginin, an attorney, owned a private consulting firm that advised marijuana growers and dispensaries.
At 24, he landed on the front page of The New York Times after founding Med Grow Cannabis College, which specialized in schooling people about marijuana at a time before anyone had heard of CBD oil, much less seen it at CVS. Few sources in the stories that splashed across national media outlets would even reveal their names.
The 33-year-old attributes his past endeavors to an expert-level knowledge of the complexities of the plant and the industry.
A booming business His company is certainly a far cry from the taboo classroom setting. The single-story black brick building blends in with surrounding nondescript businesses. But inside, a team huddles around a conference table in a room that is the picture of modern tech: glass office walls, gray hardwood floors, whiteboards and doughnuts in the break room.
Precision has 50 employees, from engineers to project managers to architects, and boasts more than a dozen open job postings. Some new hires are relocating from places like Chicago and California. The new chief financial officer is a former Microsoft executive out of Seattle, Beginin said.
In the warehouse, which has a production line straight out of a Henry Ford plant, Tennant stands beside a newly assembled X10 extraction machine.
The steel contraption is made up of connected pressurized, temperature-controlled vessels. The marijuana plant is soaked in a solution, usually ethanol or butane, which works to extract the desired compound from the plant like a "lock and key," Tennant said.
Precision is unique because it is not solely an equipment manufacturer. The business provides consultant services, architectural lab design, training and postproduction support in order to walk its customers from "dirt to a finished product." It helps customers navigate the complicated set of regulatory codes that differ per city, state and country.
In an industry with a steady stream of newcomers hoping to carve out a chunk of the market, this hand-holding is valued, and has, in part, contributed to the company's success.
"We have a unique competitive advantage because not only are we an equipment manufacturer, but we're the people that stand by you, help you run the equipment, standardize it, integrate it, make sure that it's right for your process," Tennant said. "Because the technical process is varied and it's complex."
Precision has more than 1,000 installations around the world, including in South America and Europe.
In February, Precision was named the sole equipment supplier for a facility in Sicily, run by Canapar, a company associated with Canopy Growth Co., recognized as the largest marijuana company in the world.
"We chose Precision as our extraction technology partner because they are the most recognized and innovative extraction equipment company in the world," Canapar's CEO said in a news release after the announcement.
Precision is a company built on forward thinking, and it's still doing exactly that.
Beginin said Precision is considering an initial public offering soon. Neither of the company's leaders see the industry, or business, slowing down any time soon.
"The industry just keeps growing," Beginin said.

Texto completo: There has almost never been a better time to look for a job in America. But while rising wages and a tight labor market are great news for workers, the people who run U.S. businesses are lately feeling rather pessimistic. Can an economy continue to make employees happy if their bosses aren't?
One very happy foreign boss is the emir of Qatar. He showed up at the White House today bearing, among other things, a new order for Boeing airplanes. According to the official White House transcript, the emir expressed to President Trump his general optimism about the U.S. economy during an Oval Office meeting:
Mr. President, I am very happy and honored to be here. And thank you very much for your hospitality. As you mentioned, we enjoy a very great relationship between Qatar and the United States of America.
We're doing a lot together. As you mentioned, President, we're signing a few documents today. And our economic partnership has been more than $185 billion, and we're planning to double this number. We have a lot of investments in the U.S. We trust the economy here. We do a lot in the infrastructure, and we're planning to do more investments.
Unfortunately chief executives who are merely running U.S. corporations rather than Middle Eastern countries have lately been signalling caution about new investments. Concerns about trade disputes seem to be making them reluctant to pull the trigger on new plants and equipment. The Journal's Lev Borodovsky notes that recent measurements of capital expenditures "continue to point to slower business investment in the US."
Today the Conference Board reports that its measurement of confidence among U.S. CEOs, "was unchanged at 43 in the second quarter of 2019 (a reading of more than 50 points reflects more positive than negative responses)." The Conference Board's Lynn Franco adds:
CEOs' expectations for growth prospects in mature and emerging economies remain subdued, with no pickup anticipated in the short-term. CEOs' profit expectations have weakened compared to last year, with trade and tariff uncertainties and signs of a slowing global economy the likely causes of the deterioration.
The owners of small firms tracked by the National Federation of Independent Business are still expressing a very positive outlook but this week NFIB reports :
America's small business owners' optimism took a modest downturn in June, according to the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index, slipping 1.7 points to 103.3. While optimism remains at historically high levels, the June figure reverses the gain posted in May...
"Last month, small business owners curbed spending, sales expectations and profits both fell, and the outlook for expansion dampened. When you add difficulty finding qualified workers and harmful state level laws and regulations, you're left with a volatile mix where uncertainty has increased to levels not seen in more than two years," said NFIB President and CEO Juanita D. Duggan.
Executives hoping for an immediate reduction in policy uncertainty, at least when it comes to trade, may have to wait a bit longer. Reuters reports that Larry Kudlow, director of the White House's National Economic Council, had this to say about negotiations with China: "No timeline. Quality not speed."
If the negotiations are going to continue indefinitely, the White House could at least help accelerate the speed of U.S. business investment by cutting tariff barriers with countries other than China.

Texto completo: The day after his dismal showing in the first Democratic debates, former Vice President Joe Biden said in Chicago: "Folks, the discussion in this race shouldn’t be about the past."
He’s right, of course. American politics is always about the future. But Biden doesn’t take his own advice. The candidate and his surrogates seem obsessed with talking about his resume: 36 years in the Senate, eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president. The effect is to reinforce his advanced age — he’ll be 78 on Inauguration Day 2021 — and his disconnection from current trends and topics.
Even as a younger and more vigorous figure, Biden was a deeply flawed presidential candidate in 1988 and 2008. And all his weaknesses, aggravated by age, were on full display during the debate in Miami. A post-debate poll by CNN saw him dropping 10 points, from 32% to 22%, while two younger female senators, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, surged upward.
Here’s the huge and growing problem staring Democrats in the face: Biden might be a miscast messenger, but his political position as a pragmatic progressive gives the party its best chance of defeating Donald Trump. If the Democrats abandon the middle ground and veer too far to the left, they are doomed to four more years of Trump in the White House and a generation of conservative justices dominating the Supreme Court.
The debates in Miami showed that’s exactly where the party is headed. On a range of issues from immigration and health care to tax rates and climate change, the loudest voices espoused policies far outside the American mainstream. For example, many of the leading candidates embraced proposals for universal health care that would eliminate private insurance — a position endorsed by only 21% of Americans in the CNN poll. Just about every candidate agreed that undocumented immigrants should qualify for health insurance, but 3 in 5 voters reject that idea.
And then there’s busing, the least effective and most unpopular method of achieving school integration. There’s no recent polling on the issue, but 20 years ago, Gallup found only 15% of Americans favored "transferring students to other schools to create more integration." Busing as an issue tore communities apart and helped elect Ronald Reagan in 1980. A Democratic Party that embraces that idea — no matter what Kamala Harris preaches about its virtues — is committing suicide.
Rick Tyler, a conservative Republican strategist, accurately summed up the main lesson coming out of the Democratic debates for The Washington Post: "They are not talking to the blue-collar workers that I understand that vote in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Are they seriously capable of choosing a nominee who is going to beat Donald Trump? Right now I have my doubts."
The Wall Street Journal editorial page was even pithier when they wrote: "President Donald Trump is a lucky man."
That judgment is reinforced by the facts, not the fantasies feeding liberal dreams of glory. The exit polls in 2016 and a recent Gallup survey came to the exact same conclusion: Only 26% of Americans call themselves liberals. And their voting power is even less than that, because they tend to cluster in urban areas and coastal states like New York and California, where many of their votes are wasted.
Trump’s base remains fervently loyal, but stuck at about 35% to 37%. And his apparent strategy, maximizing the votes of his loyal followers while not reaching beyond his core support, makes little sense.
But the Democrats seem determined to make the same mistake, rushing to extremes and abandoning the moderate middle. And their liberal base, about 1 in 4 voters, is even smaller than Trump’s tribe of true believers. As James Carville, a key architect of Bill Clinton’s 1992 victory, told The New York Times, "This is an election that Trump can’t win but Democrats can lose."
Democratic voters understand this. By 2 to 1, they told CNN that they prefer a candidate who can defeat Trump, as opposed to someone who shares their views on issues. And 43% still see Biden as their best hope for a victory — 30 points ahead of anybody else.
But after Miami, the party faces many questions. Can Biden pull it together and reinvigorate his campaign? Is there another moderate who can effectively take up that banner? If the answer to both questions is no, the party is in deep trouble. And Trump is indeed a lucky man.

NIKE'S FREE SPEECH PEECH ISSUES ARE RARELY CUT-AND-DRY

Texto completo: Now that the Fourth of July has slipped past, let's take a quick look at a trio of controversies over history and tradition that erupted just as the holiday was creeping up on us.
The most prominent was the uproar over Nike's decision to withdraw a version of its Air Max 1 Quick Strike honoring Betsy Ross, which was to go on sale around Independence Day. The shoe displayed on its heel the original U.S. flag with its 13 stars - which Ross either did or didn't create - and was pulled after former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick pointed out to the company "that the Betsy Ross flag had been co-opted by groups espousing racist ideologies."
I have two observations.
First: White supremacists shouldn't get to decide for the rest of us the meaning of our historical symbols. I'm old enough to remember the Ku Klux Klan - not today's pale shadow, but the Klan to which many Southern politicians of the 1960s still pledged open allegiance. The group's rallies always featured American flags in abundance - you know, the 50-star kind - and nobody thought the rest of us had to give up on the symbol by letting the bad guys control its significance. In that sense, Nike's action might be seen not as a strike against the white supremacists but as a surrender to them.
True, it's not just the supremacists. The New York Times notes that some find the 13-star flag an offensive reminder of our nation's "painful history of oppression and racism." Fair point. But I'm a great believer in confronting rather than avoiding the burdens of history. And besides, if the 13-star flag must be hidden away as a symbol of racism, what about the 13 stripes on the 50-star flag?
Second observation: Furious about Nike's decision, the governor of Arizona has canceled the $1 million in subsidies that the company was promised in return for opening a $184 million factory in the state. OK, this sort of political tit-for-tat happens all the time - but the Supreme Court has recently made things interesting. At the end of its most recent term, the justices ruled in Iancu v. Brunetti that the federal government cannot refuse to register a trademark for being "scandalous" - which the court defined as giving offense - because such a power would amount to viewpoint discrimination, which the First Amendment forbids.
Hmm. You get the Arizona subsidy if you sell the shoe with the 13-star flag but not otherwise? Sure sounds like viewpoint discrimination to me. I don't expect Nike to sue Arizona for violating the company's First Amendment rights, but goodness that would be a fun case.
* * *
Now let's travel to St. Louis Park, Minn., where the city council voted in June to end the practice of reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to open its meetings. At least part of the motivation seems to have been to emphasize that the town is "very welcoming and increasingly diverse." This decision has led to predictable fury - and not just from the right. The editorial board of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, no bastion of conservatism, weighed in against the city, which in turn has promised to revisit its position later this month.
Although a government institution can certainly do the people's business without regularly pledging allegiance, the U.S. Congress opens its sessions with the Pledge of Allegiance. So does the town council in the Connecticut hamlet where my wife and I live. Since St. Louis Park is in Minnesota, let's add this: The Minnesota legislature begins its meetings with the pledge. Minnesota public school students are required by law to recite it at least once a week unless they opt out.
Moreover, the claim that the pledge is anti-diversity seems rather obscure. Wherever people might have come from originally, whatever the state of their documentation, whatever their religion or creed, most of those who live in the U.S. are here because they want to be. In its aspirational language, the Pledge of Allegiance arguably promotes rather than hampers diversity. Certainly there are threats to diversity; but the pledge isn't high on the list.
Besides, as the Star-Tribune editorial pointed out, people who object to the pledge needn't recite it; and they can even register their protests. I've long argued that a respect for vigorous dissent is at the heart of the American idea. The recital of the pledge to open a meeting signals only that those in positions of authority believe in what the flag stands for. The rest of us are free to do as we like.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Adm. William F. Moran, who was nominated to be the Navy's next chief, abruptly announced his retirement in a statement on Sunday, citing an ongoing ethics investigation into his relationship with a subordinate who was "held accountable over allegations of inappropriate behavior."
Admiral Moran's decision to decline his appointment to be chief of naval operations and instead retire has sent the Navy scrambling to find a new candidate as the Pentagon operates with officials in acting roles in top jobs and without a confirmed secretary of defense.
Though Admiral Moran did not mention him by name in the statement, two Defense Department officials identified the unnamed subordinate as Cmdr. Chris Servello, a former Navy public affairs officer who was accused of harassing female colleagues at a Christmas party in 2016. The incident was first reported by USA Today in 2017.
Both department officials spoke on the condition of anonymity. Additionally, one said that a Freedom of Information Act request for email exchanges revealed the depth of Admiral Moran's relationship with Commander Servello over the last two weeks.
Commander Servello, who has since left the Navy, was close to Admiral Moran throughout his career. He served as a public affairs officer for Admiral Moran in 2014, when the senior officer was chief of Naval Personnel.
Commander Servello said their relationship was that of "mentor to mentee" and told The New York Times on Monday that the admiral's announcement was a "sad day for the Navy."
In his statement, Admiral Moran said his retirement sought to avoid any "impediment whatsoever to the important service" by Navy personnel and their families. He called it a "painful" decision to step down.
"To be clear, my decision to maintain this relationship was in no way an endorsement or tacit approval of this kind of conduct," Admiral Moran said, referring to the accusations against Commander Servello.
Commander Servello also served as the public affairs officer for the current chief of Naval Operations, Adm. John M. Richardson.
Admiral Moran's decision has put Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer in a difficult position of finding a new candidate for the job while keeping Admiral Richardson in the top role likely longer than was originally expected.
In a statement, Mr. Spencer said Admiral Moran's decision to maintain a relationship with Commander Servello "has caused me to call his judgment into question."
"Adm. Bill Moran has served this country honorably for decades. I am grateful for the years of dedicated service by him and his family," Mr. Spencer said.

Prosecutors should stop the scare tactics. Reforming felony murder rule improves our justice system

Texto completo: In January, California ended a decades-old legal doctrine that put numerous people behind bars for murders they did not commit.
Yet six months after the new state law—Senate Bill 1437—took effect, some prosecutors are trying to overturn it, resorting to scare tactics and false distortions.
We are the legislators who wrote and supported this critical reform, and we need to set the record straight about it.
SB 1437 passed the Legislature last year with bipartisan support and was signed into law by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. It reformed California’s outdated and unfair felony murder rule, which had allowed people who did not kill to nonetheless be charged, convicted, and sentenced as murderers.
The old felony murder doctrine allowed prosecutors to charge all accomplices to a crime with first degree murder. It did not matter if there was no intention to kill, if the death was accidental, or if the accomplice had no knowledge that someone else would kill. Everyone was just as responsible, as if they had planned and committed the murder themselves.
The California Supreme Court, in a 1983 ruling, termed the state’s felony murder rule “barbaric.” And yet it remained on the books, and people were unfairly sentenced to long prison terms under this law.
We studied this issue for over a year before passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 48 in 2017. That measure recognized “the need for statutory changes to more equitably sentence offenders in accordance with their involvement in a crime.”
Then in the following legislative session we introduced SB1437 to correct what we concluded was a grave and needless injustice.
As SB1437 moved through the legislative process, we made significant improvements to ensure it was fair and that our reform did not let people who are responsible for a murder off the hook.
Based on input from district attorneys and other public safety advocates, we amended SB1437 to ensure that a criminal was held accountable for murder if they:
* Are the actual killer.
* Aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer with the intent to kill.
* Were a major participant in the underlying crime and acted with reckless indifference to life.
And so it’s been disappointing to see some of California’s district attorneys now working to block the law’s implementation. They remain intent on pursuing murder convictions for people not guilty of that crime, despite the fact that it’s not in the interest of public safety nor is it just.
Yet they have challenged SB1437 in court arguing it’s unconstitutional on the grounds that it’s allegedly inconsistent with two ballot initiatives California voters passed decades ago.
Before introducing SB1437, we spent over a year carefully reviewing past statutes, court decisions, and, yes, voter-approved ballot initiatives, to ensure that the provisions in SB1437 did not overstep our role.
SB1437 falls squarely within the Legislature’s broad authority to make policy.
Prosecutors have also challenged SB1437 in the press with mischaracterizations. The president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County, for example, recently told The New York Times that under SB1437, “We’re literally talking about letting murderers go free.”
That’s a false claim designed to stoke fear.
Thankfully, many prosecutors have properly applied the law, and courts around the state have upheld the reform as constitutional. As a result, many deserving people have been able to go home—some after serving decades in prison for murders they did not commit.
It’s not just those newly freed and their families who have recognized the justice served in these cases. In San Luis Obispo County, after a judge found SB1437 constitutional, a reporter went to the parents of the victim.
They said that while they still endure the pain of their son’s death, it did not justify an unfair sentence: “It certainly wouldn’t bring closure to me to see him punished as if he were the murderer,” the parent of one murder victim was quoted as saying
SB1437 is a just and overdue reform. We’re confident that California’s courts will uphold it.

Alertan que ICE tiene acceso a datos de licencias para inmigrantes

Texto completo: Sin el conocimiento los automovilistas, los funcionarios de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) utilizan las bases de datos de licencias de conducir estatales para aplicar tecnología de reconocimiento facial.
Al menos en Utah , Vermont y Washington –que ofrecen licencias de conducir a inmigrantes indocumentados– los oficiales de ICE han solicitado revisar la información de los automovilistas.
En Utah y Vermont se hicieron las búsquedas requeridas para encontrar a un número no indeterminado de personas, indicó The New York Times.
En el tercer estado, Washington, los agentes autorizaron citaciones administrativas del Departamento de Licencias para realizar un escaneo de reconocimiento facial de todas las fotos, pero se desconoce si logró contretarse la búsqueda.
Los documentos que exponen estos tipos de búsqueda fueron obtenidos a través de solicitudes de registros públicos por el Centro de Privacidad y Tecnología de Georgetown Law y reportados por primera vez por The Washington Post.
Es la primera vez que se confirma que ICE utiliza tecnología de reconocimiento facial para escanear las bases de datos de licencias de conducir estatale s, incluidas fotos de residentes legales y ciudadanos.
“Esto es un escándalo”, dijo Harrison Rudolph , un experto en privacidad. “Los estados nunca han aprobado leyes que autoricen a ICE a sumergirse en las bases de datos de licencias de conducir que utilizan el reconocimiento facial para buscar personas” .
Agregó que las entidades no alertan a los indocumentados sobre esa posibilidad.
“Estos estados nunca le han dicho a las personas indocumentadas que cuando solicitan una licencia de conducir también están entregando su rostro a ICE. Eso es un enorme cebo” , consideró.
El Post destaca que la Policía siempre ha tenido acceso a huellas dactilares, ADN y otros “datos biométricos” tomados de sospechosos criminales, pero los registros del DMV contienen las fotos de una gran mayoría de los residentes de cada entidad, la mayoría de los cuales nunca han sido acusados ​​de un delito.
Esto se desarrolla sin autorización de las legislaturas estatales, por lo que un creciente número de legisladores demócratas y republicanos están criticando la tecnología como una herramienta de vigilancia peligrosa, generalizada y propensa a terribles errores.
“El acceso de las agencias de la ley a las bases de datos estatales, especialmente las bases de datos del DMV, a menudo se realiza sin consentimiento” , dijo el presidente del Comité de Supervisión de la Cámara de Representantes, Elh Cummings al Post.
Cuando firmó la reforma que permite otorgar licencias a indocumentados, el gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, dijo que estos datos no se compartirían con agencias como ICE.

Texto completo: It appears the Patriots will not be visiting the White House this offseason, according to ESPN.
All but one of their previous five visits after winning a Super Bowl have come in April, with the latest they've visited coming on May 10, 2004, after winning Super Bowl XXXVIII.
A visit now would be a logistical challenge, ESPN reported, because players and coaches are taking their final vacations before training camp starts.

California quake a reminder: The Big One lurks

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - For those near the epicenter of the earthquake that struck Southern California on Thursday, the ground jolted so violently that it bounced them off their feet.
But such is the potential devastation of earthquakes in California that seismologists described it as only a moderate one that would not have any bearing on the inevitable arrival of a giant earthquake, which could unleash at least 30 times more seismic energy.
Californians woke early Friday to a 5.4 magnitude aftershock, a day after the 6.4 magnitude earthquake in the Mojave Desert shook the small desert city of Ridgecrest, causing minor injuries but heralding the end of a period of seismic quiet in California. Thursday's earthquake was the strongest in California in two decades.
Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, i said Thursday's earthquake did not change the agency's calculations of when the big one might strike.
"We are not changing our forecast for the San Andreas," Caruso said. "We still believe there's a 70% chance of a magnitude 7 or greater in Southern California before 2030."
The faults around Ridgecrest are part of the larger San Andreas system that runs from the Gulf of California to Mendocino, north of San Francisco.
The San Andreas fault, which runs near heavily populated areas and defines the boundary between the North American and Pacific tectonic plates, is considered the biggest seismic threat to California. Related cracks in the earth, like the Hayward fault that runs through Oakland and Berkeley in the San Francisco Bay Area, are also considered major threats. *
Tom Heaton, an earthquake expert at the California Institute of Technology, said the region where Thursday's earthquake struck seems to be characterized by a complex set of faults that have helped form geological features called basin and ranges.
"These basin and range earthquakes often come in clusters of events," Heaton said.
Susan Hough, a seismologist with the USGS, said Friday's 4:07 a.m. tremor, 9 miles northeast of Ridgecrest near where Thursday's earthquake took place, would likely be the strongest aftershock, although more powerful ones could follow. There have been about 200 aftershocks since Thursday's earthquake.
Seismologists have puzzled over why California's biggest faults have been relatively quiet in recent decades. At the same time, experts have warned that California remains unprepared for a big quake in many keys areas. Few people have bought earthquake insurance, and the state has many buildings that are likely to suffer major damage because of the way they are constructed.
Even though it occurred on minor faults, Thursday's earthquake could be felt as far away as San Francisco and Phoenix.

Texto completo: This week's question: We're up to 1,743 stories at our 'UI at 150 Years & Beyond' website (uofi150.news-gazette.com), with fresh content added daily. Here's a new batch of 10 former Illini sharing memories about the people and places on campus and around Campustown that they won't soon forget.
CRAIG TILEY
Australian Open director coached Illini men's tennis team to 2003 national title
"On a recruiting trip in September one year, I picked up (future NCAA champ) Amer Delic from the airport. We had the weekend to really impress him.
"However, on this particular day, the South Farms were really playing up. Together with a warm wind, the smell was nauseating.
"At the airport, I noticed Amer scrunch up his nose but I did not say anything. We quickly got into the car and I turned on the music and air-conditioning to distract him.
"When we arrived at the Atkins Tennis Center, I knew I had to come up with something. Amer got out of the car, scrunched up his nose again and asked what that smell was.
"I sniffed into the air and said, 'I'm not sure, it is unusual and really bad.'
"A month later, Amer committed to Illinois and a year later at his first practice, that smell was back. Only then did he find out the South Farms smell was synonymous with that part of campus."
DAVID McCRAW ('76)
Monticello native, New York Times' newsroom attorney
"If you happened to be a kid from a small town, Record Service was everything you were not.
"To climb to the store's upstairs space on Green Street was to enter a veritable den of cool -- the kind of cool you had zero shot of attaining. Which was pretty much the reason for going.
"There was nothing about the place that didn't say cool -- the music that was playing, all those tables filled with records, customers drifting by in bell bottoms and peasant blouses. The place even had a cool smell.
"Mainly, though, it was the guys who worked there. They met the world with a pitch-perfect indifference, knowing smiles and ironic commentary. You would go from table to table, flipping through the albums and reading the liner notes, carried along by some vague hope that whatever you were buying for four dollars and change would earn a half-nod of approval from the guy at the register.
"It left me with an astonishing collection of unlistenable music. Of course, good was never the point. Cool was. And for a few minutes each week, you got to stand close to it at Record Service.
"There was nothing better than when you were 19 and unshakably unhip and still believed that music could change the world and maybe even you."
EMMA DORANTES ('03)
Champaign attorney/advocate
"Having started as 'undeclared' at UIUC in the fall of 1999, I was just old enough to vote in the 2000 elections, and a year later, aware enough to be traumatized by the images of the second plane hitting the Towers on 9/11.
"Professor Joseph T. 'Joe' Miller helped me find my peace, and my place, in all of it. Joe taught me International Politics and Policy, as well as Politics of the Vietnam War, in a small room in Allen Hall in the spring of 2002. A Vietnam veteran himself, Joe's clear, matter-of-fact style resonated deeply with me, and offered insight into wartime politics that helped me find solace as I tried to make sense of my rapidly changing world.
"While he never made his personal experiences the focus of our classes, his lessons stuck with me in ways beyond anything my more 'academic' political science professors could teach, and I am ever grateful for having had a teacher like him around at that time in my own history."
STANLEY EISENSTEIN ('68)
Chicago attorney
"Apartment living now is de rigueur on campus. However, long ago, undergrads had to live in approved university housing such as dorms, frats, sororities or a handful of boarding houses.
"This occurred because, back then, there was a shortage of apartments near campus and they were needed for married or grad students.
"However, Jewish students could get an apartment by using the 'kosher' excuse. All that was needed was a note from a rabbi, who immediately knew the charade, that he/she needed to live in an apartment in order to keep kosher. It was a widespread scam used by many Jewish undergrads back then, including my two roommates on White Street."
JESSICA PITCHER ('00)
Robeson Elementary principal
"Bill Testory was the assistant director of the Materials Research Lab and my boss for four years as I worked and went to school.
"He trusted me with more responsibilities than just running errands and making coffee.
"His example and faith in my work is one reason I think I am good at building capacity in others today. I can remember skipping class to go work because I enjoyed the office so much -- and needed to hustle to pay for college.
"One year for Christmas, he gave me a Craftsman drill. That may seem odd, but I was always working on some home improvement or mechanical project, and this was encouragement to learn new things and be a problem solver.
"I have added a few tools to my collection over the years, but still have and use that old Craftsman."
MIKE LINKSVAYER ('92)
Tech bigwig co-founded Bitzi
"I liked taking late night walks on country roads south of campus, crisscrossing the Embarras River and listening to WEFT shows on my Walkman or just thinking.
"At the time, I identified the area as the South Farms, but apart from the northernmost bits along Saint Mary's Road it was probably just farms.
"In retrospect, I'm glad I wasn't attacked by dogs or run over by a driver."
TODD SALEN ('79)
Champaign County 2018 Realtor of Year
"In my first venture as a producer, I spent over 18 months planning and preparing a benefit concert featuring singer/songwriter Harry Chapin, only to be told by a university administrator, 'It was against university policy for an independent student to produce a fundraiser of this nature.'
"After multiple appeals, I found myself sitting at the desk of Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Stan Levy, who after listening to my story declared, 'If university policy prevents a student from doing something so worthy, we need to change the policy.'
"Levy taught me no matter the roadblock, we should find a way to accomplish our goals, a lesson I have tried to pass on to the hundreds of students I have mentored myself over the years."
DOROTHY CAPERS ('84)
General counsel, National Express
"When I first arrived trying to find my way, I stumbled upon the African American Cultural Center, where Bruce Nesbitt was the executive director. Bruce and his wife showed me the ropes, helped me with everything from the best grocery store to where to buy books, and later on, their thoughts on an off-campus apartment.
"They also fed us. There was always food being prepared at the Nesbitt house.
"He really became a father to me during my four years there."
JOHN GROCE
95-75 as basketball coach (2012-17)
"(Kids) Conner and Camden still talk to this day about Jarling's Custard Cup and always go when they come back to visit.
"Camden still calls the Brownie Snowstorm 'The Jimmy Fitzgerald' in honor of one of our great neighbors who shared the treat with him."
BELA GANDHI ('93)
Founder, Smart Dating Academy of Chicago
"One of my favorite places on campus was my first dorm, Illini Tower. I lived on the 16th floor, the top floor of Champaign's skyscraper back in the day.
"I fondly remember studying in the hall downstairs, and my best friend would routinely come and tempt me to go for pizza instead of studying.
"I also became great friends with my future husband at IT -- many late nights watching 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'About Last Night.'"

Texto completo: Disturbing images pop up with spooky regularity in "Late Migrations," Nashville author and New York Times opinion writer Margaret Renkl's collection of linked essays about family and nature. In one, a rat snake "slowly, almost mechanically," swallows a nest of newborn rabbits, one by one. Elsewhere, a fanatically territorial Carolina wren, beloved for its gorgeous waterfall-like song, pierces the eggs of other birds in nearby nests to kill their young. In yet another, Renkl lies in a bed next to her beloved father as he dies of cancer, watching him take one ragged, long breath after another, willing him to end the agony, to die, please die.
And yet all told, "Late Migrations" is a lovely book, made up of short essays that alternate unexpected observations about nature with brief but telling stories about Renkl's great-grandparents, grandparents and parents. Renkl's elders created a tight braid of family in which she grew up somewhat confined, but also protected and loved. Her heritage is that of the American South -- Alabama and Tennessee -- and the backyard nature dramas she witnesses are different from those we might see in the North. Yet this is a relatable and resonant book across geographies and traditions.
Loss and grief are Renkl's core subjects. She mourns after miscarriages for ghost children, for a cedar waxwing that dies after hitting a shiny window, for a kind mother-in-law savaged by Parkinson's disease, for landscapes and creatures snuffed out by invasive fauna and flora, for her beloved father, for whom the latest advances in medicine do nothing to stop the invasion of metastatic cancer. Most prominently, she mourns for her mother, a complicated figure who during her childhood was wracked with depression that led to Renkl's most frequent memory, of her being driven away toward medical care in unending tears. As an older woman, her mother is healthier but often cranky, a hoarder who lives across the street from her daughter's family and creates complications and irritations that are swept away by her sudden death, when Renkl realizes how much she loved her.
The juxtaposition of family histories with observations from the natural world seems designed to remind us how biological we humans are, and how much our days and fates are shaped by forces beyond our control. It's an effective construct, and the sparse simplicity with which Renkl records her observations and emotions belies the profound truths she is presenting.
"Every day the world is teaching me what I need to know to be in the world," Renkl writes. "In the stir of too much emotion: Hold still. Be quiet. Listen."
"Late Migrations" is a book that will be treasured most by middle-age readers who are losing, or have lost, beloved parents; who are looking back across their own lives and their family circles being broken by death; and who are pondering how the past shaped the people they are today. Sooner or later, most of us will grieve for beloved lost parents. It's a transformative time in the life of an adult child, a time when one lurches to self-understanding and greater strength.
Renkl captures it well and lifts her examination of loss to a higher and somehow buoying plane by showing that it is no more or less than what happens every day in our backyards, gardens, pastures and forests. But it is our uniquely human gift to love so hard that we are doomed to grief when loss occurs. "The shadow side to love is always loss," Renkl writes. And yet, what fully functioning human would want it otherwise?

Texto completo: Readers of Mark Bowden's "Hue 1968: A Turning Point of the American War in Vietnam" may recall its last-chapter discussion of an unconscious Marine lying wounded on a tank, and photographed by John Olson.
That classic image appeared in Life magazine early in 1968. The man, Bowden wrote, was Pfc. Alvin Grantham, who survived.
Though People magazine in 1985 published that identity, Bowden's book, a bestseller in 2017, devoted a chapter to the scene and the young Marine.
But other evidence, including interviews with platoon members who aided the man, argues that the Marine was someone else - a young man who did not survive: Pfc. James Blaine. The evidence included photographs made at the same time as Olson's, by a Briton named Don McCullin.
The tale - of the ferocious battle, how the men were wounded, the photographers, and varying efforts over time to identify the Marine - is told in a New York Times magazine piece by Michael Shaw. Worth reading. Search for it at NYTimes.com.

'Miracle baby' from New Freedom promotes compassion

Texto completo: Valerie Kosson doesn't have a memory of her birth, but she knows the story well:
"It was a life-threatening situation."
"I was holding onto life by a thread."
"I was truly considered a miracle baby."
Her story was chronicled by the New York Times and Huffpost. Her own mother, Robin Spielberg, gave a talk about it to a TEDx audience five years ago.
This time, Kosson took the stage in Lancaster to tell her own story - the tale of a little baby born too early and so tiny that her mother's wedding ring fit around her hand. It's what happens after the miracle, when that micro-preemie grows up to navigate a world of people who don't know about her fragile start and don't understand that the challenges didn't end when she survived.
"They said she wouldn't walk or talk," Spielberg said. She could get cerebral palsy and would never be able to attend a public school, her parents were told.
She shattered all those theories. She learned to walk and talk and thrive so well that she eventually graduated magna cum laude from Susquehannock High School two years ago and played in the York Junior Symphony. At 20, she's going into her junior year as a music performance major at Lebanon Valley College, where she plays the marimba and sings in the choir.
But that's what can be seen and measured. She also carries lifelong challenges that aren't apparent to her classmates, teachers, casual friends or complete strangers. They're called invisible disabilities.
Her fragile beginning Spielberg and her husband, Larry Kosson, hadn't even considered names for the twin girls they were expecting in 1998. Spielberg wasn't six months pregnant when she went into labor, she said.
One of their daughters, Clara Kosson, didn't survive, but Valerie did. To ensure that, a nurse put her finger on the scale to make Val 17 ounces, rather than 12. Babies at that time weren't given life-saving measures when they weighed less than 1 pound, Spielberg said.
Their newborn lived in an intensive care unit with beeping monitors and bright lights. Spielberg, an author, composer and pianist, asked if she could play recorded music to her baby. When the music played, they watched her vital signs improve along with the babies in earshot of the sound, said Spielberg, who is now a spokesperson for the American Music Therapy Association.
Kosson's premature birth caused a number of issues to be revealed: epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, ADHD, problems with short-term memory, an inability to understand the passage of time, and no nerve endings in her stomach, which has meant no hunger signals, Spielberg said.
She has now grown out of the epilepsy, but her brain remains challenged. She sometimes doesn't understand a statement or a question, almost like a foreign language is being spoken. It doesn't make sense to her on first pass, which has been a handicap, on occasion, in school.
"You think I'm fine, but I'm not," Kosson said.
Invisible disabilities Kosson held in her tears recently as she and her mom visited the newborn intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins Children's Hospital.
She looked at the tiny babies and knew that life beyond the hospital has great shining moments when gracious, kind, compassionate people lift you up, but she also knows what might await those fragile lives: There are dark moments, when the world occasionally feels like it's pushing you down instead.
In high school, Kosson went dark on social media for two years because she often felt left out, she said.
"My classmates laughed at me, dismissed me. They didn't care," she said. "They didn't include me in their groups."
For any teenager, those feelings of exclusion are hurtful. For a young girl with disabilities, they are just one more burden.
To enter Lebanon Valley College, Kosson had to take the SATs, where strangely worded questions didn't compute in her head. She wrote a letter to the College Boards about the poorly phrased questions that left her with a low SAT score; she didn't receive a response, but she got into college anyway.
"Fortunately, the admissions staff at LVC could see past my test scores," Kosson said.
'Have compassion' It was sophomore year at LVC when Kosson felt the sting of a classmate's laughter. She had raised her hand to answer a question, eager to join the banter with her professor.
The answer was incorrect. No big deal for Kosson, but a classmate beside her laughed.
"I was dazed for the rest of the class," she said. Then, there were tears, a call to Mom, a talk with the professor; then, too defeated by the unkindness, she didn't want to participate in class.
So, when she was asked to participate in TEDxYouth in Lancaster June 30, she knew what she wanted to say.
"Give more of yourself than you're used to," she wanted to tell her audience. "How do you know if someone you know has invisible disabilities? You don't. ... That's why it's important we have compassion."
Compassion. Like her music teacher from Southern York County Schools, James McGarvey. He built a platform for Kosson as a young girl, so she could play the marimba with ease. He is patient and kind to her, so she has invited him to hear her speech.
And there's her best friend and college roommate, Chloe Kline, who lifts her spirit in the toughest moments. "She takes the time to hear me and understand me," Kosson said.
Kosson notices each kindness.
She doesn't wish to tell every person she meets that she carries disabilities. She just wants to be heard and seen for the person she is: Valerie, the miracle baby whose name came from the word valor: courage.
Valerie Kosson, left, looks on while her mother Robin Spielberg flips through a photo album that tells the story of her premature birth. When Kosson's parents sifted through the $1.1 million in hospital bills for her care, they had taken out two mortgages on their New Jersey home. Both parents had been working in New York City. They moved to New Freedom when they found the Southern York School District had programs that would fit their daughter's needs for school.

When Valerie Kosson was born nearly 21 years ago, she weighed 12 ounces at 23 weeks and 5 days of gestation.

Texto completo: So. Much. Sweetness.
From the pink sign out front to the pink walls to its owner and baker, Yvonne Schumacher, in a pink T-shirt and pink Crocs, everything at Sweety's has a sweet touch. And that's before the rows of cupcakes, mini-bundt cakes, apple-crumb cakes and German cheesecakes. Plus books filled with custom wedding and birthday cakes.
"We have cookies too," Schumacher said "And I have, at the moment, mountain peaks — a homemade cream on a cookie covered with milk chocolate and white chocolate."
Yet, despite the name of her shop, Schumacher pointed out her treats are sweet — but not too sweet.
"I use the German recipes," she said, "so it's not too, too sweet. It's different from a cake at Publix."
Schumacher uses no mixes, no pre-made frostings. She draws from old recipes that date back to her mother and grandmother, though she's had to make some changes since setting up shop in the U.S.
"When I got here, I must test every recipe because the ingredients are different here," Schumacher said. "The butter is different, the milk is different."
She uses a light Swiss buttercream frosting on most of her cakes instead of a cream cheese frosting, and she bakes a mix of German and American favorites.
"I have a snow white cake that's a recipe from my grandmother and it is so good," she said.
"It's a vanilla cake on the bottom with cherries on top of that, then chocolate cake, then vanilla cream, then you have a thick chocolate cover."
Some of the American specialties she's mastered? Carrot cake and oatmeal-raisin cookies. Her selection changes all the time.
"Every time you come in, there are new things," Schumacher said.
"We test a little bit in the kitchen with new treats and different cookies. At the moment I have the oatmeal-raisin cookies and butter buttons, and next week I bake two other cookies or we design new cupcakes."
Schumacher and her husband, Andreas, opened the bakery at the end of March, and Schumacher splits her time between baking cakes and helping at Hart & Soul Cafe, which the couple bought last year south of Sweety's on Del Prado Boulevard.
She bakes all the sweets for Hart & Soul, including the apple-crumb cake, which is a customer favorite.
At Sweety's, Schumacher sells cakes by the slice, plus individual cupcakes, cookies or mini-cakes. She has a section of coffee drinks — lattes, espressos, cappuccinos — as well as teas to go with the treats. She also takes orders for custom cakes, cupcakes and treats.
Baking is a familiar business to Schumacher, who is originally from southern Germany, near Munich. In her hometown, she ran a custom-cake business, turning out astonishing creations for her customers — towering, six-tier wedding cakes; knee-high Minions and even a life-sized ALF (yes, the ALF of '80s sitcom fame).
"I can do everything as a cake" Schumacher said, laughing.
But she's not joking. Her photo books of past custom-cake orders are filled with her customer's wildest imaginings, like a cake that looks like a fresh watermelon on the outside and, inside, each slice reveals a red velvet interior dotted with chocolate chips.
An elaborate custom cake can take several days for her to put together.
"I'm a perfectionist," she said. "When I do cakes, it's the same. I love the details and it must be perfect."
Today, her workload is divided between those same custom cakes, special order treats and sweets for the shop where everything is homemade and handmade.
"I love to bake," Schumacher said.
One look around this sweet shop, and customers know it's true.

Texto completo: Stephen Bronfman, the Montreal point man in the deal to split home games with the Tampa Bay Rays, comes from the family that turned Seagram into one of the worlds top liquor distillers.

The Bronfman name may not ring familiar in the Tampa Bay area, but the clan survived pogroms, prohibition and one colossally bad business decision. Here are 10 things to help you get to know the illustrious family.

1. Chased out of Europe

In 1898, Yechiel and Mindel Bronfman were prosperous tobacco farmers in Moldova when the czarist-Russia pogroms forced them to flee, along with their sons Abe, Harry and Samuel. They ended up in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, where the Jewish Colonization Association helped immigrants with homesteading dreams to settle. Depending on whos doing the telling, they arrived with one or two servants and a rabbi or a Hebrew teacher. The climate was not good for growing tobacco, so they moved to Manitoba, where they sold whitefish, firewood and wild horses they had captured and trained to pull carts. Family lore says it was 11-year-old Sam who, while accompanying his father on his rounds, observed how much alcohol was sold in the hotels where they met clients. Acting on that, (Yechiel) went ahead and bought one, the Anglo-American Hotel in Emerson, Manitoba, in 1903, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.

2. Selling booze as medicine

In the 1910s, the temperance movement swept through the Canadian prairies, cutting into lucrative liquor sales at the family hotels. Samuel and his brothers took to selling mail-order liquor, until the government eventually cracked down. It was still legal to sell alcohol as medicine, so the brothers rebranded their concoctions using names like Liver & Kidney Cure, Dandy BracerLiver and Rock-A-Bye Cough Cure.

3. Bootlegging legacy

Several books have been written about the Bronfmans, including Peter C. Newmans bestseller, Bronfman Dynasty, and Nicholas Faiths The Bronfmans: The Rise and Fall of the House of Seagram. During prohibition, the Bronfmans liquor business was linked to gangster Meyer Lansky. There were also rumors (never proven) about a connection to Al Capone. Mordecai Richlers novel Solomon Gursky Was Here has been described as a thinly disguised account of the family. In it Richler wrote: In prohibitions whoopee days, American bootleggers loaded up at one or another of Sams export houses and then took to dirt roads in their Hudson Sixes, trailing

thirty-foot chains to throw dust in the face of pursuers.

4. Mr. Sam, Mr. Whiskey

Samuel took control of the business after prohibition came to an end in the United States. Known as Mr. Sam, he expanded the alcohol business, building Seagram into the largest distiller in the United States and Canada. He also commissioned the Seagram Building. While no longer owned by the Bronfmans, the tower remains a landmark in New York City. What motivated Mr. Sam to create a liquor behemoth? Entrepreneur.com put it this way: The force that drove Samuel Bronfman to build a small-town distillery into an international liquor empire was the burning desire to be socially accepted. Although he seemed to have it all  wealth, prestige and a loving family  Bronfman (whose name in Yiddish literally means whisky man) always felt he was an outsider, whom upper-class society looked down upon because he was born poor and Jewish, and because booze and bootleggers were the foundation of his fortune.

5. A funeral for the ages

Mr. Sam died in 1971 at age 82. His funeral drew 1,500 people, including diplomats and Canadian cabinet ministers, several newspapers reported at the time. Honorary pallbearers included former Ontario premier Leslie Frost, former Manitoba premier Duff Roblin, U.S. Sen. Jacob Javits of New York and Ephraim Evron, Israeli ambassador to Canada. There were reports that the Montreal airport was temporarily closed to regular traffic to accommodate the stream of private jets shuttling in dignitaries from around the world to pay their respects, Entrepreneur.com reported. It was perhaps in death that Samuel Bronfman finally achieved the acceptance he so craved.

6. The kidnapping. Or was it?

In August 1975, Edgar Bronfman Sr.s son Samuel Bronfman II was rescued by dozens of law officers from a Brooklyn apartment nine days after he reportedly was kidnapped. Edgar Bronfman Sr., who had risen to the top job at Seagram, paid a $2.5 million ransom, which was recovered from under a bed in an unoccupied apartment in the Brooklyn neighborhood, the New York Times reported. The next year, a jury convicted two men of grand larceny for extorting the ransom but acquitted them on kidnapping charges. Two jurors told reporters that they believed the defense attorneys contention that Samuel Bronfman II had masterminded his own abduction. Its a pretty sad system when a guy gets kidnapped, the kidnappers are caught red-handed and they get off, Bronfman II said at a news conference after the trial. The best thing you can do is laugh about it and put it behind you and go on.

7. Winning big: The DuPont deal

In 1981, Edgar Bronfman Sr. pulled off one of the biggest deals in the companys history. Seagram battled to take over Conoco, the oil company, eventually losing out to DuPont. But what seemed like a loss came with a huge financial victory. Edgar Sr. threw his support behind DuPonts bid, and Seagram ended up with 20 percent of the chemical empire, valued at $308 million, Fortune magazine wrote in 2002. By the time he retired (in 1994), that stake was worth $8 billion. The dividends from DuPont contributed $289 million a year to Seagrams earnings. I did a very good job, if I do say so myself, Edgar Sr. told Fortune.

8. David Addison sings the wine-cooler blues

Actor Bruce Willis played a role in helping Seagram rise to the top of the distilling business. In the mid 1980s, the star of the television show Moonlighting appeared in commercials for Seagrams Golden wine coolers. Hey, big fellas, look here, he sang. Its wet and its dry  my, my, my. Me and the boys love, love, love it all the time. In 2010, Time called it one of the 10 most embarrassing celebrity ads ever. The magazine said: The television ads were reportedly wildly popular, helping to both make Seagrams the worlds largest distilled-spirits company and launch Willis short-lived singing career. In an ironic twist, Willis lost his position as Seagrams spokesman after being caught drunk driving.

9. A $3.5 billion mistake

Edgar Bronfman Jr. took the reins at Seagram in 1994, after his father stepped aside. In 2000, he made a ruinous move selling the liquor business to French communications and water company Vivendi to increase his companys stake in the entertainment industry. The deal went sour and the Bronfman family fortune plunged from $6.5 billion to below $3 billion. That paper loss is among the largest sustained by a single family, ever, Fortune magazine reported a couple years later. Charles Bronfman, who is Edgar Sr.s brother, had warned against selling the companys stake in DuPont, which Edgar Jr. had spearheaded a few years earlier. He was also wary of going into the entertainment business. In a 2013 interview with the Globe and Mail newspaper, he described Seagrams downfall: It was a disaster, it is a disaster, it will be a disaster.  It was a family tragedy.

10. An unwanted World Series ring

In 2002, Expos owner Jeffrey Loria swapped the Expos for the Florida Marlins, and paved the way for the Montreal team to move to Washington, D.C., a few years later. The deal, orchestrated with baseball commissioner Bud Selig, ticked off a lot of Expos fans, including Stephen Bronfman. He ended up with a very small ownership share in the Marlins and received a World Series ring after the team won the 2003 World Series. In 2006, he told Forbes: We had two thoughts with the ring. One was to put it up for auction for charity. The other was to blow it up in a public ceremony. He ended up keeping it, Forbes said.

Texto completo: Al menos 20 trabajadores inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron despedidos de los clubes de golf del presidente Donald Trump a principios de este año están solicitando una reunión en la Casa Blanca.
A través de una carta firmada por 21 de las mucamas, jardineros, personal de cocina y otros exempleados de cinco de los clubes se pide al presidente que “haga lo correcto” y les dé la oportunidad, para explicar las razones por las cuales no deberían ser deportados.
“Somos personas modestas que representan los sueños de los 11 millones de hombres, mujeres y niños indocumentados que viven y trabajan en este país”, dice la carta. “Sabe que somos trabajadores y que no somos delincuentes ni buscamos un viaje gratis a Estados Unidos. Todos pagamos nuestros impuestos, amamos a nuestra fe y a nuestra familia, y simplemente queremos encontrar un lugar para que nosotros podamos mejorar a Estados Unidos”.
Según Associated Press, la misiva ya tuvo respuesta de la Casa Blanca, resumida en que fue recibida la notificación y que se estaba “revisando” la solicitud.
Los exempleados enfatizaron sus años de servicio a la familia Trump, señalando que su labor permitió a los clubes que “sean un éxito y para mantener felices a sus miembros y visitantes”.
La Organización Trump ha despedido a cerca de 20 trabajadores indocumentados de sus clubes de golf en los últimos meses, como resultado de una auditoría realizada, después de que The New York Times informara en diciembre sobre indocumentadas que trabajaban como empleadas domésticas en la propiedad Bedminster, en New Jersey.

Do President's Properties Employ Undocumented Workers? 'I Don't Know,' He Says

Texto completo: After months of silence, President Trump responded on Friday to reports that the Trump Organization has employed dozens of undocumented immigrants by saying that he doesn't know whether the organization does or not.
"I don't know because I don't run it," Mr. Trump said when asked if he was confident that undocumented immigrants were no longer working at his golf courses. "But I would say this: Probably every club in the United States has that because it seems to be, from what I understand, a way that people did business."
The New York Times first reported in December that Victorina Morales, a Guatemalan undocumented immigrant, and several others living in the country unlawfully, had been employed at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., where Mr. Trump was heading on Friday.
[Read more about an undocumented immigrant who worked as a maid since 2013 at a Trump golf course.]
Many undocumented workers at other Trump properties, including resorts in Philadelphia, Westchester County, N.Y., and Jupiter, Fla., have come forward since then and said they were also employed using phony Social Security numbers and green cards.
After the revelations, the Trump Organization said that it had begun to use E-Verify, an electronic verification system that checks documents provided by new hires against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records to identify fakes, at all properties. The same month, dozens of undocumented workers were fired at clubs in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., Pine Hill, N.J., and at the Bedminster club.
As he was about to step onto Marine One to head to the Bedminster club on Friday, Mr. Trump seemed to indicate that the Trump Organization had strengthened its hiring processes to ensure that they were no longer employing undocumented immigrants.
"But we've ended -- whatever they did, we have a very strict rule that, those rules are very strict," Mr. Trump said, standing on the South Lawn.
The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Eric Trump, who along with his brother, Don Jr., took over management of the organization, said in January that hiring undocumented immigrants was a sign of the United States immigration system's failures and that firing the employees was distressing.
"I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking," Eric Trump said. "Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice."
Ms. Morales, 47, worked as a housekeeper at Bedminster for five years, dusting the president's golf trophies, swabbing his toilet and changing his bedsheets. "How can the president profess to not know we were undocumented workers if we have all been fired?" she said.
"I cleaned his house. I cleaned Ivanka's house. He saw me all the time. I'm sure he figured I didn't have papers," she added.
Anibal Romero, a lawyer representing Ms. Morales and several other former Trump workers who are undocumented, said: "The immigrants didn't hire themselves." He added, "It is time for those American employers to now tell the president to legalize, not demonize and deport these hardworking people."

Why have suicides among Black youths skyrocketed?

Texto completo: ATLANTA - In a sunlit room, an African-American mother talks about the moment she learned her then-9-year-old son tried to kill himself.
That isn't anything you ever want to hear, but at the same time, Charlena E. Jackson realizes how lucky, no, how blessed her family is that Elijah's attempt wasn't successful.
A lot of other moms can't say the same.
For the first time in history, suicides among Black children are skyrocketing, especially here in Georgia. The only thing worse than that is no one seems to know for sure why.
According to "The Changing Characteristics of African-American Adolescent Suicides," published recently in the Journal of Community Health, suicide rates among Black boys ages 13-19 rose 60% between 2001 and 2017. For females, rates increased 182% during that same period.
"There is no definite reason known, and we cannot definitively prove or establish cause-and-effect relationships," said Jagdish Khubchandani, a health science professor at Ball State University and one of the authors of the study. "In general, educational investment, state child poverty and crime, and mental health resources need to be looked at in Georgia as they are predictors of suicide over a large geographic area."
In 2017, 68,528 African-American males and 94,760 females made suicide attempts serious enough that they had to be treated by health professionals, the study found. Males were most likely to use firearms (52%) or to hang/suffocate themselves (34%) to commit suicide. Females used hanging/suffocation (56%) or firearms (21%) to commit suicides.
"Earlier, suicide rates for African-American youth were lower than white youth, but higher than Hispanics and Asians," said Khubchandani. "Now, the rates are highest for African-American youth both regionally and nationally."
Georgia topped the list of states with the greatest number of African-American adolescent suicides - 64 - between 2015 and 2017, but it was hardly alone. Nine other states - Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York and Missouri - also made the list.
Khubchandani said the total suicide numbers in the United States have been creeping up since the beginning of the 21st century, rising to more than 45,000 deaths and more than 1 million attempts just last year. Fortunately, in Georgia, that number seems to be dropping. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the state's youth suicides dropped from 48 to 41 from 2017 to 2018.
Still, the general trend has been disturbing. "This is an overall indicator of our culture, social and psychological well-being, especially for children," he said.
So why the focus on African-American youths?
Khubchandani said that while it is well known for many Black children, early life disadvantages play a role in survival rates. It's not well known if survival rates have changed for teenagers, especially considering violent risk behaviors and associated death rates.
"We independently assessed suicide rates only for Black kids to see if trends are changing irrespective of what happens to youth of other races," he said.
Jackson, 39, of Atlanta said the rise in suicide doesn't surprise her.
"They are not being heard," she said. "People don't take what they go through seriously. They are just a number that doesn't matter."
Jackson blames her son's attempt on years of bullying he suffered while in elementary school.
Almost from the moment he started school, Jackson said students poked fun at Elijah, criticizing the way he talked, how he looked, the clothes he wore. They, called him ugly. They called him stupid. They hit and kicked him.
When she complained about a student hitting Elijah, one teacher asked her if she knew the difference between someone bullying and someone who simply made a mistake.
Even complaints to school administrators went unanswered, Jackson said.
Two years ago, at age 9, she said Elijah swallowed a bottle of allergy medicine that belonged to his older brother. He was lucky. He lived to see another day.
"I had no idea he was even thinking about suicide," Jackson said.
For weeks after, she said the family went through therapy, and Elijah, now 11, will head to sixth grade soon.
According to Khubchandani, bullying is consistently and strongly associated with suicides across all youths, especially in African-American youths.
"That's why suicide prevention is a complex effort requiring interdisciplinary approaches to mental health, bullying prevention, and academic enrichment programs," he said.
But firearms in the home remain the greatest risk for teens and must be the greatest focus for intervention.
Khubchandani said that research has shown that 75% of elementary school students know where their parents keep their handguns and children as young as 2 years of age have the strength to pull the trigger of handguns.
"A second form of protection against suicides in adolescents is having ready access to mental health care. African-American adolescents are at higher risk than the general population to encounter serious forms of violence.
"Schools are the leading provider of mental health services for youth. Thus, there needs to be a greater emphasis on urban public schools providing adequate screening, treatment and referral services for adolescents with mental health disorders."

BURT & HAL at Alamo Drafthouse (July 8-22). Yes, there was a period when Coors was sold only in the West and beer drinkers with terrible taste paid a mint for smuggled cases. That explains the premise of "Smokey and the Bandit" (on July 14), though it's not clear whether the real-life bootlegging ever gave rise to multistate pursuits or vehicular pileups of the magnitude seen in the film. Car chases were a specialty of Burt Reynolds and his frequent director and stunt coordinator Hal Needham, whose collaborations are the subject of this series. If you've ever wanted to see "The Cannonball Run" -- surprisingly unavailable on streaming services -- on a print with Dutch subtitles, the Drafthouse has you covered on Monday.

IMAGENATION OUTDOORS FESTIVAL: 8 NIGHTS OF SOUL CINEMA AND MUSIC UNDER THE STARS at various locations (July 10-Sept. 20). Focused on African-American cinema and music, this free outdoor series in a handful of Harlem parks begins with a tribute to Jackie Robinson, who would have turned 100 this year. The Robinson biopic "42" screens on Wednesday in the park that bears the ballplayer's name. Later in the summer, the program will honor Aretha Franklin with a screening of "Amazing Grace" and an effort to make the world's longest "Soul Train" line on Aug. 22.

PIER PAOLO PASOLINI: A FUTURE LIFE, PART 2 at the Metrograph (opens on July 5). Even though the career of this Italian director was cut short by his murder in 1975, Pasolini, also an author, poet and public intellectual, was too prolific and varied to be distilled in a single survey. Part 1 of the Metrograph's retrospective, held in January, focused on his later films. Part 2 captures the tumult of his movies from the 1960s, a period that found the director refracting his earthy style and Marxist worldview through the prisms of Italian neorealism, timeless texts ("Medea," on Saturday and Sunday, casts Maria Callas in a freehanded riff on Euripides) and cryptic symbolism. "Teorema" (on Friday, Saturday and Wednesday), with Terence Stamp as an ethereal outsider who seduces the residents of a bourgeois household from the maid on up, might come the closest to an encapsulation of Pasolini's obsessions.

'THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE' at the Quad Cinema (opens on July 5). Clearly modeled on 16th- and 17th-century paintings, the imagery of this 1983 French film -- remade as "Sommersby" and as a West End musical -- shines in a new digital spruce-up. Daniel Vigne's movie, from a screenplay that counts Jean-Claude Carrière among its writers, elegantly unfolds in flashbacks as a wife (Nathalie Baye) answers questions about her husband. When they married, he was callous and impotent. Upon his apparent return from many years away, including time served in war, he is a better spouse and father (and looks like Gérard Depardieu). Has he changed, or is he an impostor?

SCUM IN THE SUN, PART 1: JON MORITSUGU at Spectacle Theater (through July 31). This micro-cinema in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, presents a retrospective of this underground filmmaker, whose punk-inflected experimental features have -- as his biography states -- "scorched eyeballs worldwide" while also challenging stereotypes. Writing in The New York Times in 2015, Mike Hale credited Moritsugu's television movie "Terminal USA" (on Monday, July 20, July 26 and, in an original rough cut, on July 31) with gleefully trashing "the notion of Asian-Americans as a 'model minority."' Additional features, shorts, and merchandise apparently too scandalous to describe round out the series.

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA — Lily was the name of the park ranger who led us through Independence Hall. She wasn’t a theater major like some tour guides. She wasn’t very theatrical at all. In fact, she was a mix of wry and blunt.
Her job was to tell us the story of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution in a concise and compelling fashion: no easy task, given her 30-minute time window.
By the end of the tour, I was choked up and teary-eyed, welling up with gratitude and patriotism.
When I told a Spanish friend of this, she said, "In Spain, that reaction would make you a fascist.”
It turns out that, in America, that reaction could make me a racist, in the eyes of some of our major corporate spokesmen and activists.
Love of country is not a popular thing these days. As the elites worry more and more about the evils of “nationalism,” expressions of patriotism are becoming officially insensitive. And from Western Europe to the U.S., nothing will brand you as an unsophisticated jingo more than believing a “founding myth” that sounds like a sappy morality tale.
Nike, the sneaker giant (who is happy to bow to the political bullying of Communist-run China), agreed just before Independence Day to pull off the shelves a new line of shoes because they included the 13-star American flag from 1776. Nike publicist Colin Kaepernick objected to that image. Why? Because a symbol of America’s founding is an embrace of slavery, as told in press reports.
“For lots of people, it’s quite similar to, say, the Confederate flag,” one professor told the New York Times.
At the same time, Charlottesville, Virginia, decided to abolish its traditional birthday celebration for Thomas Jefferson, who founded the University of Virginia.
This national self-loathing is en vogue in the West these days. Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote about the Irish version of this in his book, My Father Left Me Ireland. Dougherty noted a deep desire among the Irish “to be unsentimental and undeluded about their history.” This manifested itself in obsessing on the impure motives, real or imagined, of Ireland’s rebels. “My boyhood understanding of Irish history,” he writes, “a people coming out of captivity, now got a chuckle from serious historians.”
Of course, there were real flaws among the rebels of both 1916 and 1776. America’s Constitution explicitly accepted and explicitly protected slavery. The question isn’t whether we should ignore those flaws. It’s whether we will let those flaws define the men and their project of building an independent nation.
Kaepernick and his colleagues at Nike say yes.
Lily, the park ranger, said no.
She pointed out that the Founders were all white men. She mentioned slavery repeatedly. But none of these men’s failings detracted from their bravery and the magnitude of their task.
“To us,” Lily told me, my three oldest children, and two dozen other visitors to Independence Hall, “the Declaration is a birth certificate. Had the rebellion failed, it would have been a death warrant for these men.”
And the heroes in this story weren’t merely the famous men.
“This Declaration, which took our Founding Fathers nearly a decade to get to — now it was time for ordinary people like you and I in the 18th Century to do something really important: You kind of have to pick a side,” she said in her understated way. “Will you stay loyal to the British, who have protected you for decades, or do you take this chance and fight for your independence?”
On Jefferson, whose sins were grave and now well-known, Lily still spoke a plain truth that didn’t diminish his flaws. “He had a pretty daunting task ahead of him,” in the summer of 1776: Expression of the American mind ... How one man could get his hands on the American mind, boil it down, and fit it all on one page — that is remarkable.”
As a writer, I was overwhelmed with the idea of Jefferson’s task. As a father, I asked myself if was raising my children so that they would stand up to power and for what is right, as the rebels of 1776 did.
The story of our founding can be told a thousand ways. And we shouldn’t hide the sins and flaws. But we also must avoid that very modern hatred of sentimentality and contemporary conceit that causes us to disdain every generation before us.
Lily painted the American Revolution the same way Dougherty as a kid saw the Ireland of 1916: a people coming out of captivity. The work done in Independence Hall was incomplete, as reflected by the visits Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony would make to that same building over the next 100 years. It's still incomplete. But the imperfection of the revolution doesn't mean we should "cancel" Betsy Ross' flag and Thomas Jefferson, to use the parlance of today.
We should understand their flaws, and then celebrate them. Perhaps with a cup of tea.Story URLPhoto Caption:Independence Hall in Philadelphia is seen.

Texto completo: With your American citizenship on the line, could you answer the following question? Take a moment. Because, according to a 2011 study, this is the hardest of the 100 possible questions asked on the United States citizenship test. 1. How many amendments does
the Constitution have?
A. 14
B. 21
C. 25
D. 27 In the weeks around July 4, thousands of people convene at courthouses, parks and stadiums from Tucson to Pawtucket, R.I., to Hagatna, Guam, to be sworn in as American citizens at Independence Day-themed ceremonies.
Before taking the oath of allegiance, however, would-be citizens must pass a civics examination, covering America's history, principles and system of government. For the test, a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services officer randomly selects a set of 10 questions from a list of 100, and reads them in English to the applicant, who must verbally answer at least six correctly.
Some, like "Name the president" or "What is the U.S. capital?" are easier than others, raising concerns about whether all applicants have the same shot at passing.
Here we're testing you on the questions that the volunteer test-takers most often flubbed, with an exception: We've omitted one -- "Name your U.S. Representative" -- because the correct answer depends on where you live.
And we've converted them to multiple-choice format. Read the questions carefully, and good luck. 2. Which of these is something Benjamin Franklin is known for?
A. He was the first person to sign
the Constitution
B. He discovered electricity
C. He was the nation's first
postmaster general
D. He was the nation's second president
3. Who was President during
World War I?
A. Woodrow Wilson
B. Warren Harding
C. Calvin Coolidge
D. Franklin D. Roosevelt
4. Which statement correctly describes the "rule of law"?
A. The law is what the president says it is
B. The people who enforce the laws
do not have to follow them
C. No one is above the law
D. Judges can rewrite laws they
disagree with
5. Under the Constitution, which of these powers does not belong to the federal government?
A. Ratify amendments to
the Constitution
B. Print money
C. Declare war
D. Make treaties with foreign powers
6. We elect a U.S. Senator for how many years?
A. Four years
B. Six years
C. Eight years
D. Twelve years
7. Who is the Chief Justice of the United States now?
A. John G. Roberts Jr.
B. Ruth Bader Ginsburg
C. William P. Barr
D. Brett M. Kavanaugh
8. The House of Representatives has how many voting members?
A. 100
B. 435
C. 535
D. 538
9. The Federalist Papers supported the passage of the U.S. Constitution. Which of these men was not one of the authors?
A. James Madison
B. Alexander Hamilton
C. John Jay
D. John Adams
10. When was the Constitution written?
A. 1492
B. 1776
C. 1787
D. 1865 You might be wondering how we determined which questions are the hardest.
Paula Winke, a professor at Michigan State University who studies language and language testing, conducted the 2011 study of the questions by administering them to volunteer participants in East Lansing, Mich., and then ranking them based on how many of the test-takers got each one right.
Citizenship officials have not made public how they determine which questions are hardest.
"Perhaps the greatest problem with the civics test is that it is possible that not everyone takes an equally difficult test," Dr. Winke wrote in the study.
How did you do?
One survey found that 64 percent of American citizens would fail the test (by not answering at least six questions correctly), even in multiple-choice format, as we have here.
Immigrants taking the exam as part of their citizenship application tend to fare much better. The combined pass rate for the civics exam, and an English evaluation performed in the same interview, is 91 percent, U.S.C.I.S. reported in December.
Of course, immigrants generally study for the test before taking it, while some New York Times readers may not have cracked a history or civics book in decades.
One tough question can make all the difference.
Dr. Winke said her study found that the difference between a failing score of five and a passing score of six may have more to do with the choice of questions than with knowledge of the answers.
In the 2011 study, nearly all test-takers knew why the American flag has 50 stars, but fewer than one in 10 knew the date when the Constitution was written, and only about one in 8 could name one of the writers of the Federalist Papers.
Immigrants applying for citizenship are given only two chances to pass the test before they must restart the application process from scratch -- and pay the filing fee of at least $ 640 again. If they fail at their first interview, they must retake the civics exam at another interview between 60 and 90 days later.

Dairy Queen’s Blizzard freezes the good times in an upside-down world

Texto completo: I don’t ask much of my desserts. Just that they’re sweet, and that they break at least one law of physics.
The Dairy Queen Blizzard holds a special place in the hearts of Texans, myself included. At its face, the concept seems simple: soft serve ice cream mixed together with candy or other delights. But don’t be fooled. The Blizzard contains multitudes, bound by a little butterfat. It is the long-awaited prize at the end of a Hill Country highway’s vanishing point. It’s a frosty fix for the overheated. It’s a personality test for all who tarry at a so-called Texas stop sign. Just think of its endless flavor iterations. Oreo, and Heath, and choices upon choices.
And importantly, it doesn’t fall out of the cup when you flip it upside down. If your ice cream is tethered to Earth’s gravitational field, my friend, it’s not a Blizzard.
The fast food chain introduced the ice cream concoction to its menu in 1985. Much like Dairy Queen itself, the Blizzard Treat (its government name) isn’t a Lone Star creation, even if it has swirled into the fabric of what we love about Texas. St. Louis Dairy Queen operator Samuel J. Temperato, inspired by the success of a rival frozen custard stand, pitched the idea for the Blizzard to the company’s higher-ups, according to a 1986 New York Times story. They liked it, and its popularity soared.
Dairy Queen boasts on its website about 175 million sold that year. A 12-ounce Blizzard cost a $1.29 then, according to the Times, and the “deafening whine” of the new Blizzard Blender machines in stores across the country drove employees a little batty. Dairy
Queen’s president and CEO at the time, Harris Cooper, told the Times that the Blizzard was the biggest thing to happen to the company in a quarter-century. The headline on that Times article: “Dairy Queen’s Blizzard Is Hot.”
Compared to messy sundaes and staid cones, slurpable shakes and fluid floats, it’s easy to see the appeal of a hearty Blizzard. The whipped soft serve ice cream goes down light but holds itself, and the candy it contains, with integrity. I don’t think a Dairy Queen employee has ever handed me a Blizzard without first flipping it over — a sugary stalactite and its spoon of Damocles.
The options for mix-ins are kaleidoscopic. You can stick to a single classic accouterment: Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup or M&Ms, perhaps. Then there are the hacks. Mint syrup, with its alluringly artificial green hue, can usually be added as you see fit. Extra mix-ins are advisable, if you’re prone to disappointment when the red plastic spoon hits the bottom.
A “royal” Blizzard is the provenance of the truly decadent dairy devotee, with liquid sweets like peanut butter or strawberry filling injected into the core. Every new dig, then, proves to be a Texas-size gusher.
There are special, seasonal flavors, too. To consider the many ways to spin a Blizzard is to peer into a tasty prism of possibility.
Whipped into the soft serve with the motorized whir of the blender, too, are the good times. As a child, my dad always wanted a chocolate-dipped cone from the Dairy Queen on South Lamar Boulevard, but I couldn’t wait to order a Blizzard with Butterfinger. I have always been and will forever be a Butterfinger boy.
After summer drama club retreats at Crockett High School, my friends and I might walk over to the Dairy Queen on Stassney Lane and get into some Blizzards. And once temperatures started to warm up this year, I got into the habit of parking at the Burnet Road location on Sunday nights with a Blizzard, the streaks of passing tail lights and whatever was on KUT at the moment.
Of course, Dairy Queens are synonymous with the open road. What cross-state drive hasn’t been made better with the punctuation of a Blizzard to break up the mile markers? Just off the top of my head, I can recall what I ordered on the way back from Davy Crockett National Forest over Memorial Day weekend this year (Oreo Cookie Jar Blizzard, add Reese’s), in July of last year in Archer City (a classic Oreo) or in June 2017, at a Dripping Springs Dairy Queen on the way back from Marfa (a special peanut butter cookie flavor).
Granted, this might speak to a peculiarly obsessive mental catalog of Blizzard purchases on my part. My point is that for every road traveled in Texas, there’s a Blizzard to mark the moment.
So great is my love for Blizzards that, when I was about to move to Lynchburg, Va., for my first job out of college, I made an Austin bucket list prominently featuring Dairy Queen. I was under the impression at the time that Dairy Queen was an only-in-Texas kind of thing. Don’t pretend their jingle couldn’t convince you of the same.
The thought of not once having a Blizzard that summer genuinely bummed me out. Moreso, I was sad to leave Austin, the only home I’d ever known, to move to a small town surrounded by unfamiliar trees in a strange state. I don’t cry about my own circumstances in life very often, though I’m a soft touch when it comes to movies. I cried as I pulled out of my college apartment parking lot for the last time, though.
The drive was long. My car pulled into Lynchburg in the dead of night. The first sign I remember seeing in my new home was for a Stripes gas station. (“What’s a Stripes?” I asked myself.) The second sign I remember seeing: Dairy Queen.
I ate many Butterfinger Blizzards that summer. I was far from home, but still not one slid out of its cup when flipped over. Feeling a little upside-down myself, it was nice to know that some things are the same wherever you go.

Texto completo: It is one thing for the president to criticize sloppy, inaccurate and biased reporting by the media, including the New York Times. It is quite another to use such an incendiary word as "treason," whose definition does not fit what the president sees as a crime: "the offense of acting to overthrow one's government or to harm or kill its sovereign; a violation of allegiance to one's sovereign or to one's state; the betrayal of a trust or confidence; breach of faith; treachery."
Before becoming a columnist, I was a reporter for local TV stations and one network. In the early '70s, during a pro-Vietnam War demonstration in Washington, I was called a communist by one of the demonstrators, simply because I had an NBC News logo on my microphone.
Hostility toward the press for failing to report what many conservatives believe to be true (but isn't always) has been around for some time. It has grown worse during the Trump administration. It might help lower the temperature if what is collectively known as "the media" engaged in serious introspection. Why is public distrust of journalists so high?
Columbia Journalism Review reports on results of a new Knight Foundation and Gallup poll: "A majority of those who were surveyed said they had lost trust in the media in recent years, and more than 30 percent of those who identified themselves as being on the conservative end of the spectrum said they had not only lost faith in the media, but they 'expect that change to be permanent.' According to a separate Gallup poll from earlier this year that tracked trust in major institutions, newspapers and television news were among the lowest, exceeded only by Congress."
This is dangerous, not only for journalism, which is seeing the decline of newspapers and an increase in staff layoffs, but also because a vibrant press is crucial to a strong nation.
The response to this and similar surveys over decades has been a collective shrug. There is no self-examination by the media and no change. Campaigns for "diversity" are about hiring more women and minorities, not ideological balance. Consumers of media - especially religious and conservative people - view the press as hostile to their core values.
Journalism is a business. Think of it this way. If you owned a gas station and were losing customers because gas prices were too high, the lighting was so poor that people felt unsafe at night and the restrooms were dirty, would you allow these conditions to persist? Would you even if a competitor opened a station across the street with lower prices, cleaner restrooms and better lighting? Not if you wanted to stay in business, you wouldn't.
Too many in the media are like the guy who owns the substandard gas station, ignoring complaints about their performance. The predictable results are fewer readers of newspapers and lower ratings for television news programs. What should frighten all of us in this latest survey is the number of people who say they expect their loss of faith in the media to be permanent.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — The lineup of offerings for the inaugural Four Corners Film Festival in September continues to grow.
The festival, which will take place Sept. 10-15 at the Totah Theater and the Farmington Civic Center, will feature film screenings, panel discussions, workshops, an awards ceremony, a fashion show and parties. It is being organized by local independent filmmaker Brent Garcia.
Garcia said last week that nearly 270 films had been submitted for inclusion in the festival.
"So we're going to have a really good offering of films this year," he said.
A recent addition to the festival's offerings is a music production panel that will include some industry heavyweights discussing the licensing of music for films. Garcia said the panel will feature TJ Chapman, industry executive, artist manager and tastemaker; Issy Sanchez, a 40-year music industry veteran and president of Music IS Entertainment; Soren Baker, a journalist who writes about hip hop and sports, and whose work has been featured in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune; and Steve Migliore, a.k.a, Mr. Mig, a producer, composer and DJ who has worked with artists ranging from Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Britney Spears to Adele, LeAnn Rimes and Usher.
"That panel's going to be exceptional," Garcia said.
Also taking part in the festival will be Farmington native John Austin, a.k.a. Poppin John, an internationally known dancer who recently advanced to the division finals on the NBC-TV series "World of Dance" before being eliminated. Austin will perform during a fashion show that Garcia promises will be a full theatrical production.
The reception to the festival has been very encouraging, he said, explaining he is very pleased with the quality of industry professionals who have agreed to take part and the sponsorship it has drawn from local businesses.
"For our first year, it's massive," he said. "We have an overwhelming amount of support from the businesses in the community to the city and the county."
Garcia acknowledged that the recent media attention and social media buzz that developed when two large film productions — a sequel to "Jumanji" starring Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart, and "Bios," a sci-fi drama starring Tom Hanks — shot footage in the Shiprock area may have helped his cause considerably.
"Certainly, the bigger productions coming in helped validate (the idea that the film industry can have a significant impact on San Juan County)," he said, adding that his film production company has been in communication with producers of a handful of smaller-budget projects — somewhere in the low seven figures — who are interested in shooting in San Juan County next spring.
A committee of nearly three dozen people has been planning the festival, Garcia said, and several subcommittees are focusing on specific areas. Garcia said that has allowed his full-time team from the Film Four Corners organization to avoid becoming overwhelmed as the festival approaches.
"A lot of businesses are throwing people at us," he said, describing offers of free manpower. "There's been a ton of support, so it's made it much more manageable for me and my team."
Garcia said he has been pleasantly surprised at how local businesses and residents have responded to the festival, given the fact that many of them have no familiarity with such events.
"It's more than I expected for our first year," he said of the financial and volunteer support. "It really took us four and a half or five months just to properly present it to people."
The preparations for the festival have gone so smoothly that Garcia said it has led to plans for another major event in Farmington early in 2020. When Civic Center supervisor Randy West approached Garcia with the idea of holding a comic convention at the facility, Garcia jumped on the idea. Plans for the event are being formalized, with an eye toward staging it in early January.
"We're anticipating 1,000 or more people for the film festival," Garcia said. "And we'll probably have more for the comic con. Between those, we'll have a couple of good events that will drive business to downtown."
Garcia said he has spoken to filmmakers from as far away as Boston and Atlanta who already are making plans to attend the film festival. He believes the event will be an even easier sell next year when organizers have the inaugural event under their belt.
"I think next year we'll have people calling us and asking how to get involved," he said.

It's Summer. Go Outside!

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
I've always felt that to seize the day is to go outside. In school, I would routinely push to hold class outdoors; as an adult, I've been known to read in the park for hours in January. This attraction to the open air presents something of a problem for a working person in New York, given the strictures of desk jobs.
So my interest was piqued in February 2018 when Elisabeth Goodridge, the former editorial director of newsletters at The New York Times, emailed me something to the effect of: "I have an idea. Are you free this summer?"
Her idea, I would learn, was Summer in the City, a pop-up newsletter about what to do each warm-weather week, and where to eat and drink nearby. I was, indeed, free, and by the end of last summer, the newsletter had amassed more than 80,000 enthusiastic subscribers. So now, for a second year, I'm on the fun beat at The Times, embarking on adventures around the city and documenting my experiences -- you know, in the name of service journalism.
Each week, I find myself digging into the layers of community life in a different neighborhood. On my day at the Queens County Farm Museum, for example, I started out at the original farmhouse built by Dutch settlers, then hiked through Alley Pond Park, which looks much as it did when the Matinecock tribe lived nearby, and went hunting for eats at the restaurants and groceries that serve the area's sizable South Asian community. How's that for living history?
To select the best activities from the season's bounty, I draw from my arsenal of years of enthusiastic summering -- since 2013, I've created my own calendar of summer events, and in recent years I've published it publicly in my culture newsletter, Lorem Ipsum -- and survey the internet's wealth of listings. I also ask around. We've polled the newsroom about their favorite summer activities, and we solicit readers' suggestions all the time. The best is when friends walk me around their neighborhoods, sharing their haunts and the places they've always wanted to visit.
After that initial recon, every suggestion goes into a massive spreadsheet, broken down into the categories you see in the newsletter: the main event, nearby stops and so on. It's a team effort, so with my editor, Jessica Anderson; our food writer, Max Falkowitz; and our photo editor, Andrew Hinderaker, we cull them to 15 weeks of plans. We look for events that might not be on everyone's radar, but are big enough to accommodate high volumes of visitors. And on the occasion that we write up a summer fixture, we talk strategy on navigating crowds for a smooth experience. (After our feature last year, several readers "finally lined up for Shakespeare in the Park!")
We make sure to hit each borough -- we have some killer Staten Island plans this year -- and spotlight a different type of activity each week. And to keep our fun bases covered, we include suggestions for free events and weeknight activities at the end of each issue.
The newsletter has changed somewhat since our inaugural season last year. Elisabeth has since moved on to a new role on the Travel desk. With her, we had focused on timely events and offered two game plans per week. Now with Jessica as my editor, we feature activities that readers can do throughout the summer, not just on a particular day, and we've scaled back to one weekly game plan to make our newsletters shorter, as requested by our readers.
One other change is the addition of Max to the food and drink section. After last year's food reporter Tejal Rao left the city to serve as The Times's California restaurant critic, we commissioned Max, a Queens native and James Beard Award winner, to tell us where to allot our valuable stomach space on each delicious adventure.
But one thing hasn't changed: Summer in the city is a serendipitous time. On the job, I've filmed a stranger's marriage proposal at the South Street Seaport, accidentally brought a gaggle of tourists to see Shakespeare, and weeded a garden with a retired M.T.A. safety inspector. I've danced with Russian-American bachelorettes in Brighton Beach and witnessed the solstice sunset among friends at Fort Tilden. And as I write this from a picnic table in Prospect Park, I'm being offered pulled pork by the family barbecuing at the next table.
In this city full of things to do and see, it's these small connections that remind us we're all in it together. So go outside and see what you find. It's summer, after all.

Lawyer Offers Novel Theory in Case of Missing Wife

Texto completo: In late May, Jennifer Dulos dropped off her five children at school in a Connecticut town, then vanished. Less than two weeks later, her estranged husband and his girlfriend were arrested in connection with her disappearance.
Now, as the search for Ms. Dulos, 50, enters its sixth week, a lawyer for her estranged husband is offering an unusual explanation for what happened: she took her own life to prevent him from getting custody of their five children.
The lawyer, Norm Pattis, said he also recently discovered that Ms. Dulos underwent $ 14,000 in medical diagnostic and blood tests just before her May 24 disappearance.
"We don't know what diagnosis supported those tests," Mr. Pattis wrote in an email on Tuesday to The New York Times. "Was she critically ill? Did she plan a final farewell intended to assure Fotis never saw the kids? We are looking for Jennifer and for answers."
The husband, Fotis Dulos, 51, along with his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, have pleaded not guilty to hindering the prosecution and tampering with evidence.
In an interview with NBC 4 broadcast on Tuesday night, Mr. Dulos declined to comment on the specifics of the case but said, "I never wanted Jennifer out of the way."
Ms. Dulos and her husband had been going through a tempestuous divorce, accumulating an enormous volume of court motions regarding disputes about bed times, doctors for the children and steep lawyer fees, among many other things. Mr. Dulos claimed in a court filing that the children were being kept under armed guard at their grandmother's apartment in New York City.
"We are exploring all possibilities, including that she made good on a threat she made to him prior to her disappearance: 'I'll do anything I have to do to make sure you never see the kids again,"' Mr. Pattis said. "This, together with evidence of an alarming number of medical tests she endured just prior to her disappearance, makes the revenge-suicide hypothesis something we are taking very seriously as we continue our investigation."
The "revenge-suicide hypothesis" is the latest conspiracy theory proffered by Mr. Pattis, who has developed a reputation as a legal maverick with a flair for the dramatic.
Mr. Pattis is known for taking on clients that other lawyers would not, such as Alex Jones, the founder of the right-wing conspiracy theory website Infowars, who was sued by Sandy Hook families for his false claim that the 2012 school shooting was a hoax.
Last week, Mr. Pattis told several news outlets that Ms. Dulos had staged her own disappearance and had written a manuscript with a plot similar to that of "Gone Girl," a novel that was made into a 2014 film about a woman in a crumbling marriage who fakes her murder and hides in the Ozarks.
Carrie Luft, Ms. Dulos's close friend who has acted as a spokeswoman for her family since her disappearance, dismissed Mr. Pattis's claims in an interview on Tuesday.
"Jennifer Farber Dulos would absolutely never leave her children and would never do anything that would bring them harm," said Ms. Luft. "Attorney Pattis's perpetuation of these allegations is hurting the Dulos children now and into the future."
The children, who range in age from 8 to 13, have been staying in Manhattan with Ms. Dulos's mother, Gloria Farber, who is seeking custody. The children have been participating in summer school and athletics, along with going on field trips and visiting friends, according to Ms. Luft.
"They miss their mother terribly," Ms. Luft said. "Every conversation about the case ends with, 'When are they going to find mom?' Given the horror of the situation, they are doing well. We're doing everything we can to provide them some sense of normalcy within this unfathomably abnormal situation."
Shortly after her disappearance, investigators discovered Ms. Dulos's blood mixed with Mr. Dulos's DNA on a faucet in the $ 3.5 million home she shared with her five children in New Canaan, a wealthy enclave known for its lush, open space -- and low crime.
Security camera footage recovered by the police showed Mr. Dulos and Ms. Troconis, 44, dumping trash bags along Albany Avenue in Hartford on the night of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, according to arrest warrants. The footage also showed a person matching Mr. Dulos's description dumping an item into a storm drain on the same street. The license plate on the vehicle used on that trip had been issued to Mr. Dulos, who is a resident of Farmington, Conn.
Connecticut State Police and cadaver dogs spent three weeks searching a Hartford trash plant for clues, to no avail. An F.B.I. evidence response team also combed through the woods of Waveny Park in New Canaan, near where Ms. Dulos's S.U.V. was found.
Chief Leon Krolikowski, of the New Canaan police department, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Richard J. Colangelo Jr., a state prosecutor involved in the case, also did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokeswoman for the Connecticut State Police said on Tuesday that there were no new updates on the investigation.
Mr. Dulos, who is free on $ 500,000 bond, is seeking to bring the divorce case to a halt as a result of Ms. Dulos's disappearance.
Mr. Dulos urged the public not to rush to judgment in his case during his interview with NBC 4.
"I know what I've done and I know what I haven't done, so I have to stand and fight and hope that the truth is going to come out," he said. "When it first started, I seriously pinched myself a couple of times and I said, 'This cannot be true. I'm dreaming this. I'm wearing orange and in a cell, 6-foot-by-9-foot. This cannot be true."'
Mr. Pattis, in his blog, recently addressed why he decided to represent Mr. Dulos and Mr. Jones.
"The answer might surprise you: I'd rather represent the scorned than the popular," Mr. Pattis wrote. "It's how I am put together. It starts with a simple enough proposition. No one is the sum of their worst moments. Put another way, all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."
On a separate website for his law practice, Mr. Pattis also promotes his media appearances. Philip Russell, a defense lawyer from Greenwich, said Mr. Pattis understands the power of the media in high-profile criminal cases.
"When it's in his client's interest," Mr. Russell said, "he does not shy away from combat."

Trump smiles with North Korea, threatens Iran

Texto completo: BY DEB RIECHMANN and MATTHEW LEE
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - With North Korea, President Donald Trump puts on the charm. But with Iran, he cranks up the pressure with economic sanctions and a stronger military presence in the Persian Gulf. He warned its leaders Monday they are "playing with fire."
Nuclear weapons are at the heart of the difficult U.S. relations with both Pyongyang and Tehran. But it's in North Korea where Trump has more leeway - and perhaps a greater chance of striking a deal.
Kim Jong Un has seemed as willing to meet with Trump as the U.S. president has been to talk and shake hands for the cameras with him. The North Korean leader jumped at the chance to meet Trump at the Demilitarized Zone between the Koreas last weekend.
Trump has made repeated overtures to Iranian leaders, too, but without the same results.
"I think Trump would be equally on a charm offensive with the Iranians if he had a dance partner," said Mark Dubowitz, an Iran nuclear deal skeptic with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
Also, Israel, which views Iran as its arch-
Enemy, is pressuring Trump to take a hardline approach to Tehran, which has threatened to wipe Israel off the map. There is no big anti-North Korea lobby in the United States pressuring the White House to shun Kim's repressive government.
Trump inherited heavy U.S. sanctions on North Korea and then for months traded fiery rhetoric with Kim, saber rattling that caused jitters across the world. That has given way to flowery correspondence, meetings between the two and this weekend's historic visit when Trump became the first U.S. president to step into North Korea while in office.
Not that Pyongyang has taken big steps in return. Critics point out that North Korea has not moved to "denuclearize" as Trump has demanded. But the country has refrained from conducting nuclear tests or test-firing long-range missiles.
Trump tweeted late Monday that "our teams will be meeting to work on some solutions to very long term and persistent problems. No rush, but I am sure we will ultimately get there.
Not so smooth with Iran.
Trump campaigned on pulling the United States out of the nuclear agreement that Tehran signed with the U.S. and other world powers in 2015. He complained that the deal, which eased economic sanctions in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program, didn't address Iranian ballistic missile capabilities or its support of militant groups.
After failing to adjust what Trump condemned as a fatally flawed deal, the U.S. exited the agreement last year and re-imposed sanctions that had been eased when the deal was finalized under the Obama administration.
The pressure campaign evolved not like the Trump-Kim lovefest, but to what seemed like the brink of war.
With its economy diving, Iran lashed out by shooting down a $100 million, unmanned U.S. surveillance drone and attacking shipping vessels in the Persian Gulf region. Trump said he was "cocked and loaded" to retaliate with limited missile strikes but changed his mind when he learned 150 Iranians could have been killed.
He tweeted last week, "Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration."
On Monday, Iran announced it now has a stockpile of more than 660 pounds of low-enriched uranium in violation of the 2015 deal. The U.S. is partly to blame because it failed to renew waivers that allowed Iran to swap its
Excess to other countries.
But officials say the administration is less concerned about Monday's breach than possible further violations that could reduce the time Iran would need to produce a nuclear weapon. The deal aimed to keep that "breakout time" at one year.
Iran's deputy foreign minister has warned the White House that it's naive to think Iran will wilt under pressure, or that the Iranian people will revolt and throw out their government. He said Iran will not be forced to negotiate by having a knife put to its throat.
As for North Korea, administration officials caution that Trump's charm offensive with Kim does not foreshadow a softening of its insistence that his country must not have nuclear weapons. The New York Times reported Monday that the administration might agree to a nuclear freeze as a first step toward denuclearization.
Under that scenario, which was quickly disputed by U.S. officials, North Korea would not make any new nuclear material, meaning it couldn't expand its arsenal of 20 to 60 nuclear weapons. Under such a deal, North Korea would remain a nuclear power and would still have short and long-term missiles that could threaten U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea as well as the United States.
Stephen Biegun, U.S. special envoy to North Korea, said the report was "far from accurate."
"What is accurate is not new, and what is new is not accurate. No one on our team who knows anything would speak right now anyway," he said in a statement from the State Department.
Trump's hawkish national security adviser John Bolton, who has advocated a tough stance against both North Korea and Iran, also said the administration was not considering a softer approach.
However, Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said the fact that Bolton was in Mongolia when Trump met Kim at the DMZ suggested there is a "significant split" within the Trump administration.
Democrats have been quick to criticize Trump for his strategy with both Iran and North Korea.
"After three made-for-TV summits, we still don't have a single concrete commitment from North Korea," said former Vice President Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. "Not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed, not one inspector is on the ground. ... North Korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage."
On Iran, Biden said Trump walked away from a deal that was temporarily keeping it from developing a first nuclear bomb and applied economic pressure that has led Tehran to restart its nuclear program and become more, not less aggressive.
"Trump's Iran policy has alienated us from our allies and taken us to the brink of another war in the Middle East," he said.
In its first year, the administration tried to work with Europeans allies to mend what Trump identified as flaws in the nuclear deal, such as its silence on ballistic missiles and Iran's support for destabilizing proxies around the Middle East. The effort to create a separate agreement without Iran's participation ultimately failed.
Michael McFaul, a U.S. ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama, says that while Trump has said he's open to talks with Iran, he sees little evidence that's the case. He wonders whether complete and verifiable denuclearization is not the goal in Iran or North Korea.
"In Iran, it may be that the real objective is regime change, including the option of U.S. military action," he says.
"In North Korea, it could be that the goal is not complete denuclearization, but an outcome that allows Kim to maintain part of his nuclear arsenal while perhaps dismantling his intercontinental ballistic missile program to reduce the direct threat to U.S. national security.
"This lesser goal could help to explain why Trump is so oddly accommodating toward North Korea."

Texto completo: With metronomic regularity, some well-motivated billionaire announces that he wishes the government would increase his taxes. The latest entrant is Eli Broad. Writing in The New York Times, Broad praises private philanthropy and the capitalist system "that's yielded some of the greatest gains in prosperity and innovation in human history." Still, he concludes, "I simply believe it's time for those of us with great wealth to commit to reducing income inequality, starting with the demand to be taxed at a higher rate than everyone else."
Some pundits might mock Broad, pointing out that nothing is preventing him from sending bigger checks to Uncle Sam than current law requires. Or they might protest that the super-rich can well afford to say "raise my taxes" - they'd never feel it - whereas the comfortable but not quite rich might get caught in the net.
But Broad doesn't deserve disdain. In the first place, he's a great philanthropist who is a walking Horatio Alger story. The son of an immigrant house painter and seamstress, he attended public schools and worked his way through Michigan State by, among other things, selling garbage disposals door to door and operating a drill press at Packard Motor. He is the only former member of the United Auto Workers who went on to found two Fortune 500 companies in different industries - because he is the only person ever to have achieved that feat.
He has committed to giving 75% of his wealth away and has already donated hundreds of millions of dollars to education (especially urban public schools), the arts, and scientific and medical research. He deserves the benefit of the doubt about his motives.
Broad writes: "Some of us have supported closing the gulf between rich and poor by raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, reforming our education system, expanding access to medical care, building more affordable housing." But, he concedes, "even in cities like my adopted hometown, Los Angeles, where many of these policies have been enacted, they have not adequately addressed the crisis. Our country must do something bigger and more radical."
Whoa. If something hasn't worked, maybe the answer is not more of the same. 
Broad is worried about things that top most progressive lists - income inequality, the supposedly shrinking middle class, the climate crisis, and "skyrocketing" housing and health care costs (though not the $22 trillion national debt). There's plenty of doubt that the federal government is competent to address these problems with the proceeds of a wealth tax.
For one thing, housing costs tend to be local matters, and housing costs vary tremendously by region. The reason housing is so expensive in Broad's home state of California is the heavy burden of environmental regulations, rent control, and zoning. Housing in Los Angeles is 257% more expensive than in Dallas, Texas.
Reforming the education system is an excellent idea, and there's a strong case to be made that charters have begun to show results. But K-12 education is mostly a local, not a federal, matter.
How about a $15 minimum wage? It sounds good. People picture a hardworking dad or mom struggling to feed a family on $7.25 an hour and falling behind. But that's not reality. (Twenty-nine states plus the District of Columbia have higher minimum wages than the federal level.) The Bureau of Labor Statistics offers a detailed picture of minimum-wage workers. Half are under the age of 25.
Three-fifths work in restaurants where their incomes may be supplemented by tips. By the way, what percentage of full-time workers would you imagine earns the minimum wage? According to 2017 figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it's just 1.1%. 
Nor is it clear that the "shrinking middle class" is an urgent national concern. Yes, the percentage of adults in the middle-income tier has declined since 1971 from 61% of the total to 52%. But slightly more entered the upper class than fell to the lower.
Rather than calling for the federal government to do more income redistribution, it might be useful to have states and localities examine what works in other jurisdictions. California might learn a thing or two about keeping housing costs down from Texas, and everyone can learn useful lessons from Utah's social welfare programs.
Hats off to Mr. Broad for wanting to do the right thing. Perhaps he might reconsider what that really is.

'These Are Not Easy Images to Use'

Texto completo: After The Times published a haunting photo this week of two migrants, a father and his young daughter, who had drowned in the Rio Grande, many readers said they appreciated the attention it brought to the national conversation around immigration.
Some have questioned the decision, however.
"I understand that the photograph you have with your story is meant to somehow transmit a message, perhaps convey pain and trauma, make us feel shame and sadness, and thereby ignite change," one reader commented on the article accompanying the image. "But somehow I also find it a thoroughly humiliating (disrespectful) photograph, too."
To give readers insight into our editorial process, we asked several top editors how The Times decided to run the photo.
At least a dozen editors discussed the image, which came from The Associated Press, at length on Tuesday after seeing it on social media. Once the photo's legitimacy had been verified, editors decided to publish it online that evening with an article that reported on the victims, Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria, and explained the image's significance in the immigration debate. The photo appeared prominently on The Times's front page on Wednesday.
Beth Flynn, our deputy photo editor, said the editors decided to run the image because it bore witness to what is happening at the border between the United States and Mexico right now.
"It's important for our readers to see and understand that," she said.
The photo reminded the editors of other powerful images, including the photo of a 3-year-old Syrian boy, Aylan Kurdi, whose body washed ashore in Turkey, that have brought world tragedies into greater focus and humanized the victims, said Tom Jolly, the associate masthead editor who oversees The Times's print operations.
Among the questions the editors discussed were whether prominent use of the image on the front page would be seen as gratuitous (they decided it wasn't) and whether it added important context to our coverage of the border, Ms. Flynn said. While The Times has written about migrants who died attempting to cross the Rio Grande, there have not been images of that plight. This photo "has such impact" as a result, Ms. Flynn said.
They also considered whether they would feel the same about the photo if it showed two white Americans.
"In this case, after an almost two-hour conversation involving people with different backgrounds and perspectives, we felt that yes, this photo was an iconic moment that represented something bigger than just the image itself," Mr. Jolly said.
One concern about running the photo at the top of the front page was whether it would give the appearance of The Times making a political statement, Mr. Jolly said. But the editors were confident that the image stood on its own, reflecting the perils migrants on the border face, not a position on the issue of immigration.
There are some places the photo hasn't appeared: The Times has a longstanding policy of not using graphic images in social media posts, except in extremely rare circumstances.
"It's one thing to feature graphic photos on the homescreen or in an article," Cynthia Collins, our off-platform editor, said. "It's quite another thing to serve a graphic image in tweets and Facebook posts that can appear in the newsfeeds of people who didn't deliberately seek out the news and editorial judgment of The New York Times."
After readers criticized a photo of dead bodies that ran with a January article about an attack in Nairobi, Kenya, top editors in our photo department compiled internal guidelines for the publication of graphic or sensitive photos. Phil Corbett, our standards editor, summarized them for us:
■ Editors are advised to take enough time to discuss such a decision thoroughly, and to consult high-ranking editors as needed.
■ They should consider a series of questions and factors, including the newsworthiness of the event; how crucial the photo is to telling the story; the likely impact on loved ones, survivors and the community affected; and whether our judgment would be the same regardless of who the victims were or where the events occurred.
The conversations are never taken lightly.
"These are not easy images to use," Mr. Jolly said. "They're as difficult for us to look at as anyone. We do not do it without a tremendous amount of thought."

Correction: June 28, 2019
An earlier version of this article misstated where the body of Aylan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy who died trying to reach Canada, washed ashore. It was Turkey, not Greece.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: As America celebrates its birthday, we caught up with Cep. Her debut book, Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee, is a deep dive into the later work of one of this countrys most beloved authors. It recounts Lees efforts to tell the story of Willie Maxwell, a rural Alabama preacher suspected of murdering five of his family members for insurance money. Although Lees true-crime story, tentatively titled The Reverend, was never published, through Furious Hours readers learn the details of Maxwells life (and surprising death) and also gain insight into Lees life after the publication of To Kill a Mockingbird. Cep, a Maryland native, is a graduate of Harvard University and studied as a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford. Her work has appeared in the New Yorker, the New York Times and the New Republic.

Whats on your nightstand?

Im usually reading more than one book at a time, so right now there is a stack on my desk for an article Im finishing about womens suffrage. The best of that bunch, and the one everyone should read for the anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, is Elaine Weiss The Womans Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote. There are two stacks by my bed. One contains books I read often, and that includes my favorite Robert Frost collection, West-Running Brook, which I would recommend to anyone who likes thinking about marriage, fireflies or gardens, or almost anything else. In the other stack are books Im reading for what I hope will be my next book. Ill have more to say about that soon.

As you travel for your book tour, what has stood out?

What Ive loved most about my book tour so far is how much it feels like a nonstop, multicity book club. Sometimes people are reading my book, which never stops astonishing me, but we also end up discussing all the books that helped me write it, and all the writers who inspired me along the way, which is why I got to talk about Ursula Le Guin with a professor in Montgomery, Harold Bloom with a librarian in the Mississippi Delta, John Grisham with a paralegal in Knoxville, Zora Neale Hurston with a store manager in Birmingham and Flannery OConnor with a priest in Harrisburg. Ive never felt so sanguine about the future of reading. I know that a lot of people spend time worried about the fate of the written word, but almost all of the things I love are said to be dying, not just books, but also the church, magazines, newspapers, postal mail, and yet they continue to live, and for that I am grateful.

How will you be spending the Fourth?

Ill be at my familys farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland for an afternoon cookout on Independence Day. Later on, my wife and I will head to a spot on the Miles River where we can sit in our kayaks and catch two sets of fireworks. I cant think of anywhere Id rather be.

Orphaned Children of an ISIS Fighter Will Return to Australia. Is Australia Ready?

Texto completo: MELBOURNE, Australia -- It was the breakthrough that Karen Nettleton had pursued for five years: The orphaned Australian children and grandchildren of Khaled Sharrouf, a notorious Islamic State fighter, were removed from a Syrian camp this week and will soon return to Australia.
Ever since her daughter, Mr. Sharrouf's wife, took the eldest of the children to ISIS territory in 2014, Ms. Nettleton had searched for them, eventually making three trips to Syria and pressuring the Australian government to stage a rescue.
Now that the children -- there are six, from newborn to age 18 -- are in Iraq and a step closer to repatriation, the government is confronting its next big challenge in the case: how to reintegrate them into Australian society.
With the fall of the so-called caliphate established in Syria and Iraq by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, governments around the world are facing the same moral, political and security questions that have vexed Australia, as thousands of wives and children of the group's fighters languish in camps in Syria.
In the case of the Sharrouf children -- part of a family that made global headlines when one of them, a boy now believed dead, was photographed holding a severed head -- the Australian authorities and people close to the family have said that plans are in place to aid their reintegration and offer them mental health services if needed.
But deradicalization experts have questioned Australia's capacity to provide sufficient help. Resocializing children exposed to the Islamic State's brutality and hatred is new terrain for many countries, but guidelines and expertise on the issue in Australia are especially limited, they said.
"The young ones have not seen normality for a good chunk of their lives; they've probably seen things that adults would fear," said Anne Aly, a member of the opposition Labor Party and a former counterterrorism professor based in Perth.
"They would need a really comprehensive support program to help them resocialize," Dr. Aly added. "We haven't really done this before."
Few details are known about the children's experience in Syria, but the eldest have consistently expressed a desire to return to Australia, and their grandmother, Ms. Nettleton, says they show no signs of having been radicalized.
"My children are just normal kids," Ms. Nettleton said in an interview with The New York Times this year. "When we get back to Australia," she added, "I want to give them a normal as life as possible."
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, addressing his government's decision to remove the children from the Syrian camp, said that while their parents had committed "a despicable act" by taking them to a war zone, the "children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents."
Those close to the family, including their lawyer, Robert Van Aalst, and Dr. Jamal Rifi, a Sydney physician who has worked to deradicalize Islamic youths in Australia, said government officials had promised to help the children reintegrate. In addition, private donors have offered to sponsor mental health treatment, Mr. Van Aalst said. But, he added, "the government has no plans set in stone."
Dr. Rifi said that "we have gone a long way in developing a plan that meets the aspirations of the community and ensures the safety and security of the rest of Australians," adding that collaboration between the government and the Australian Islamic community would be crucial.
Mental health and deradicalization experts agreed that community and family support -- in particular, the stability provided by the children's grandmother -- were the most important factors in their resocialization. But some warned that the Islamic State's sophisticated indoctrination techniques needed to be countered by equally sophisticated reintegration programs.
The militant group brainwashed and brutalized children by schooling them to perceive Western values as evil, engaging them in combat training and, in some cases, forcing them to carry weapons and commit acts of violence, said Daniel Koehler, the director of the German Institute on Radicalization and De-radicalization Studies in Stuttgart.
"What they wanted to do was really raise the next generation of ISIS fighters," said Dr. Koehler, who has worked with both Islamist and far-right extremists in Europe and the United States. "They've been socialized with a completely different understanding of right and wrong, and good and evil," he added. That has often made child returnees "the most difficult" cases to manage, he said.
Some research into deradicalization has suggested that young children either born or brought into ISIS territory should be primarily viewed as victims, while a more complex approach might be required for children who were old enough to fully understand or engage with the militants' ideology.
In parts of Europe, specialized programs and handbooks have been developed to help experts navigate this new landscape. In Australia, however, where interventions have largely been prison-based, focused on adults, or centered on weeding out online terrorist propaganda, such assistance is lacking, Dr. Koehler and other experts said.
"We don't have any programs," said Ali Kadri, the spokesman for the Islamic Council of Queensland, who said he helped reintegrate two women who were deported back to Australia after attempting to join ISIS in 2015.
The Australian minister for home affairs did not respond to requests for comment, and deradicalization and trauma programs contacted by The New York Times said that working with children in this situation was not their area of expertise.
Some members of the Islamic community and mental health professionals said it would be wrong to assume that the children were radicalized or posed a threat. Australia, they noted, has extensive experience resettling individuals from war-torn countries.
And the Sharrouf children, and other young returnees from ISIS territory -- three children of the Islamic State fighter Yasin Rizvic were removed from the Syrian camp with the Sharroufs on Sunday -- should not be treated as an exception, they said.
"We as a nation have accepted a lot of refugees that have come from equally traumatic backgrounds," said Fiona Jayne Charlson, a research fellow in global mental health at the University of Queensland, whose recent study in The Lancet, a medical journal, quantified the prevalence of mental health conditions among people living in conflict zones.
For decades, thousands of people who have experienced severe violence and trauma have been successfully cared for and reintegrated into Australian society, Dr. Charlson added. "I wouldn't consider this any different," she said.

Texto completo: On the debate stage Thursday, Senator Kamala Harris raised her hand, seemingly in support of a government insurance proposal that would eliminate employer insurance. On Friday, she said she had misunderstood the question.
The wording of the question left room for confusion, but Ms. Harris also has a history of making conflicting statements on the issue. In a CNN town hall in January, she said she'd favor eliminating all private health insurance. The next day, her campaign walked it back.
A single-payer health plan requires people with other forms of comprehensive health insurance to switch. That is a politically risky position. Some Democrats have hedged by backing more gradual, optional expansions of public coverage. Others have decided that they can persuade voters that the advantages outweigh the disruption. Ms. Harris, so far, hasn't chosen either one.
Surveys show that most Americans -- and a substantial majority of Democrats -- back a single-payer system in which the government provides health insurance to everyone. But when surveys ask them if they'd still like that idea if they had to give up their insurance, many change their minds. Surveys asking people if they could keep their insurance under such a plan find many who say yes.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has supported a single-payer plan for decades and is the author of the Medicare for All Act, which Ms. Harris has co-sponsored, argues that support will increase as more voters learn about the benefits of his plan. Insurance under Medicare for all, he argues, will cover all doctors and hospitals, and include no co-payments or deductibles. He thinks such a plan has so many advantages that few Americans will remain attached to their current coverage once they understand it.
Some Democratic strategists look at the polls and worry about a backlash to the major disruptions such a plan would create. Candidates like Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and the former vice president, Joe Biden, say they'd prefer a system in which people could choose to buy public insurance if they want -- or keep the plan they have.
Medicare for all was once cast as a litmus test for the Democratic presidential field, but at this point most of the candidates favor this sort of optional approach, with a mix of public and private insurance.
Most candidates in the field endorsed such a plan in a recent New York Times survey, and in the debates' less formal vote by show of hands.
Another solution might be government plans that cover some things, but allow people to buy private insurance for extras. In other countries with a universal public plan and private insurance, private insurance is there to fill holes in the government system. In Canada, private insurers pay for prescription drugs, which Canadian Medicare does not cover. In Britain, private insurance can get you extra services and the ability to jump the line for certain treatments. In the United States today, older people on Medicare buy supplemental insurance to help cover deductibles and co-payments charged by the government system.
Several candidates who have signed on to Medicare for all legislation suggested they would like to preserve "a role" for private insurance, and these vague statements could point to such a public-private system.
But such a policy stance may not reassure people who are reluctant to give up their current insurance arrangements. It could offer both the disruption of Medicare for all, and the inconvenience of private insurance, in one package.
In the debate Thursday, Lester Holt, the NBC anchor and one of the moderators, said: "Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favorite of a government-run plan?" Ms. Harris later said she thought the "their" meant her, and not the people watching at home.
But in recent answers to a detailed New York Times survey on her health care policy preferences, Ms. Harris also positioned herself on the single-payer side of the line. When asked if she'd favor a plan that abolished private insurance, she said yes. When asked if she'd prefer a Medicare for all plan or an optional proposal, which she also endorsed, she said, "Medicare for all."
"Medicare for All will extend health insurance to every single American, with no co-pays or premiums," she wrote. "It will cover most procedures, as well as dental, vision and hearing aids, and will allow you to choose your doctor, without worrying about who's in-network or not. We have to change a system that allows big insurance companies to put profit over people's health."
On Friday morning, she told the hosts of the MSNBC show "Morning Joe," "No, I do not" support abolishing private insurance. "The question was would you give up your private insurance for that option, and I said yes."
It is hard to reconcile those positions.

Female candidates make history, waves in debate

Texto completo: There was no Lazio moment. No woman was dubbed “nasty" or “likable enough," at least while the mics were still hot.
The first presidential debate to feature multiple female candidates was notable for its lack of gendered gaffes, as well as the breakout performances of Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.
“It's historic enough that we had six women over two nights of the debate," said Betsy Fischer Martin, executive director of the Women & Politics Institute at the American University School of Public Affairs. “But to have, each night, one of the women rise to the top, I think was definitely something that was exciting."
More women took the debate stage this week than had in all of American history, and their appearances gave viewers their first-ever array of alternatives in one election. Though some skeptics have misgivings about putting another female nominee up against President Trump after Hillary Clinton's bruising experience in 2016, several female candidates beat back concerns, said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist.
“Who can take on Donald Trump most effectively" is Democrats' top priority, Marsh noted. “Out of these two debates, Warren and Harris are the two candidates who proved they could."
Fischer Martin, whose institute is studying “Gender on the Ballot" in the 2020 election with the nonpartisan Barbara Lee Family Foundation, found Harris to be a commanding presence.
“She did more than go toe to toe with [former vice president and frontrunner Joe] Biden. She took a giant step right over him," Fischer Martin said. “If you were a Democrat watching that debate, one of your thoughts was, 'I want to see somebody do that to President Trump on a daily basis in the fall.' "
Warren used the word “fight" nine times, and frequently spoke of “courage," Fischer Martin noted, presenting herself as formidable in dealing with Republicans, corporations, and “somebody who is going to take the fight to Trump."
And Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar was the candidate most likely to invoke He Who Must Not Be Named in the first night's debate, positioning herself as a fierce contender who is willing and eager take on Trump, Fischer Martin said.
But Marsh thought Klobuchar came off as calibrated in her debate persona, while some of the other women presented what today's voters demand — authenticity. Women candidates — like Clinton — have often been encouraged to be themselves, even as they're criticized at every turn for being too tough or not tough enough.
“It was refreshing to see Elizabeth Warren as a woman candidate stand up there and be the same Elizabeth Warren you've seen every day," Marsh said. “That is a major step forward for women in general."
Fischer Martin was a producer for the 2000 US Senate debate in which Republican Rick Lazio unexpectedly left his podium and charged toward Clinton asking her to sign a pledge, looking aggressive and more than a little too macho. Fischer Martin didn't spot gender-based missteps of that caliber this time around. But she was struck to hear Washington Governor Jay Inslee try to distinguish himself as the only candidate who passed a law protecting abortion rights, and taking sole credit as the “one candidate that's actually advanced the ball."
“If you're going to mansplain something," Fischer Martin questioned, why would you choose reproductive rights, on a stage with three women?
In doing so, he set up Klobuchar to deliver her best line of the debate: “I want to say there are three women up here who fought pretty hard for a woman's right to choose."
US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand also tried to make the case that she was being talked over by the men onstage, and even offered the floor to Marianne Williamson, a spiritual author and lecturer who is also running for president and hadn't yet gotten a chance to speak.
“It struck me as being frustrated," said Fischer Martin, who noted that Gillibrand got less speaking time than most of the candidates but that her frequent attempts to cut in were largely unsuccessful.
“I think she rubbed some people the wrong way, for sure," she said.
Conversely, Harris owned the debate stage, interjecting, running over time when necessary and even using the clamor kicked up by Gillibrand to her advantage.
“Hey guys, you know what? America does not want to witness a food fight," Harris said, to applause. “They want to know how we're going to put food on their table.“
To Marsh, the women's performance — and the audience's receptivity — proved a different lesson than some took from the 2016 election.
“Women are more political and more empowered than ever," she said. “The perfect way to defeat Donald Trump is to have a woman do it."

Do clothes really make the man?

Texto completo: Do you know when humans started wearing clothing?  It was about 170,000 years ago, right after the second-to-last Ice Age. That's when they finally discovered that being nude was a little too, cool.
Oddly enough, scientists know precisely when man started wearing clothing because that's when head lice moved from being head lice to clothing lice. You see, apparently being embedded in clothing was much more appealing for lice than hanging out in human hair.
That might also be when the saying "clothes makes the man" originated, because it was really clothing that enabled man to conquer the world.
Can you imagine Ole and Lena, for example, trying to homestead in North Dakota while wearing no clothes? Rumor has it that Ole wore both of his winter jackets even when he painted his house one July. And that's because the directions on the paint can suggested that he put on two coats.
Yes, it's interesting to note that humans were able to survive in Africa for hundreds of thousands of years with minimal clothing. And that it wasn't until they began wearing clothing that they moved out of Africa and into other parts of the world. 
Later on, they graduated to a desire to express individuality. And that pushed humans to wear more distinctive clothing, shoes and then jewelry, and to ultimately don makeup and sport tattoos. You see, it is group divisions and competition that fuels that "look at me" desire, along with a need to affiliate ourselves with a particular sect. 
In the midst of all of this, the most important invention might have been something we call the sewing needle.
Way back when, needles were made out of slivers of animal bone that were sharpened to a point at one end and featured an "eye" at the other end. With this tool, man was able to cut up fur hides into pieces to make better-fitting apparel.
In fact, at one point, scientists saw that mankind began to wear close-fitting pants and shirts that protected them in a much better way from the cold, and eventually mankind added shawls, hoods and long boots.
In Europe, historians think that a focus on fashion started about the middle of the 14th century. That's when the male over-garment went from being a baggy, body-length cover to something much shorter with stuffing in the chest, worn over tight leggings. 
Still, the bottom line is this: What looks good on one person doesn't necessarily look good on another. As a result, a person's body shape might ultimately be their biggest fashion statement.
Which reminds me of when Gary Zukav, the American spiritual teacher and the author of four consecutive New York Times Best Sellers said that the essence of a person is not the clothing she wears or the things he does. People who love other people do not stop loving them when they change clothing or do other things. Your essence is not even your history, culture, race, or what you think and do. It is your soul.
And yet I like best the quote by James Montgomery, the British poet, who said, "The fairest and best adorned is she whose clothing is humility."
Kevin Holten is the executive producer of "Special Cowboy Moments" on RFD-TV.

An Athlete and Advocate Who Refuses to Yield

Texto completo: PARIS -- The interview room was packed with reporters and television cameras. Fox Sports went live with a telecast, as if it were covering a presidential news conference. In an indirect way, it was.
Then Megan Rapinoe, the star forward for the United States women's soccer team and a social activist, stood her ground. At a regularly scheduled news conference for the team on Thursday, she reiterated that she would refuse to visit the White House if the Americans won the Women's World Cup, regardless of President Trump's criticism of her via Twitter on Wednesday.
That move probably didn't surprise anyone. It is difficult to imagine an athlete who appears more assured in her views and comfortable in the spotlight than Ms. Rapinoe. She has, after all, dyed her hair lavender for the tournament, a sign of her willingness to stand out.
Recently, she became the first openly gay athlete to appear in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. She and her partner, the basketball star Sue Bird, last year became the first gay couple to be featured in ESPN's Body Issue, in which athletes pose without their clothes.
Ms. Rapinoe has led the way in the women's national team's lawsuit against U.S. Soccer, accusing the federation of gender discrimination. She has referred to herself as "a walking protest" of the Trump administration. On the field and off, she has relished the big stage and has sought to use the public platform provided by the success of the national team to advance both women's soccer and broader social issues.
"If you want to be in this profession, it's best to embrace those big moments," Ms. Rapinoe said Thursday. "That's where all the goods are."
In a statement before the news conference -- held to discuss Friday's much-anticipated quarterfinal match in Paris between the World Cup's two favorites, the United States and France -- Ms. Rapinoe apologized for having used an obscenity when dismissing the idea of a White House visit. That comment came in a videotaped interview with the soccer magazine 8 by 8 earlier this year.
She even doubled down on Thursday, suggesting that she would encourage her teammates not to visit the White House, either. She said she did not want a decades-ong fight for equality and inclusivity by the American team to be "co-opted by an administration that doesn't feel the same way and doesn't fight for the same things that we fight for."
Ms. Rapinoe did not directly address Mr. Trump's criticism of her, in which he wrote on Twitter that she "should never disrespect our country, the White House or our flag."
He also wrote: "I am a big fan of the American Team, and Women's Soccer, but Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!"
Ms. Rapinoe, who will be 34 next week, was asked Thursday whether her jousting with Mr. Trump might distract her team at such an important moment in the World Cup, or destabilize the American locker room. She said emphatically that it would not. "I think, if anything, it just fires everybody up a little more," she said.
Ms. Rapinoe has been heavily influenced as an athlete and as an activist by an older brother, Brian, who is 38. When Ms. Rapinoe and her twin, Rachael, were growing up in Redding, Calif., it was their brother who led them into soccer and vigorously challenged them in two-on-one pickup basketball games, instilling in the sisters an unrelenting approach.
In his adult life, Brian Rapinoe has struggled with drug addiction, and both he and Megan have spoken openly of his issues. On Thursday, Ms. Rapinoe acknowledged that her brother's struggles had influenced her social conscience, her views on drug reform and her desire to help protect society's most vulnerable people.
Brian Rapinoe has been in and out of jail for a series of drug-related crimes. According to the California Department of Corrections, he is in custody in a community re-entry program in San Diego and will be eligible for parole in August.
Ms. Rapinoe said she had come to realize that those incarcerated for drug addictions were "just normal people; they're your brothers and your friends and your family." In influencing her sense of social justice, she said, her brother's story "has a lot of ramifications outside of drug abuse."
Most notably, Ms. Rapinoe began kneeling during the national anthem in 2016 to protest systemic racism and police violence in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, then the San Francisco 49ers quarterback. U.S. Soccer later began requiring players to "stand respectfully."
Now Ms. Rapinoe stands for the anthem but does not sing or place her hand over her heart. On Thursday, she declined to detail exactly what her protest entails. But earlier this month, Ms. Rapinoe told Lizzy Goodman for a story in The New York Times Magazine that her involvement in social issues reflected the work of movements like Time's Up, #MeToo, Black Lives Matter and L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy.
"To me, it's literally all the same, insofar as I want people to respect who I am, what I am -- being gay, being a woman, being a professional athlete, whatever," Ms. Rapinoe said in the article. "That is the exact same thing as what Colin did."
She added: "What kind of person do you want to be for yourself, but also in the larger context of the country and in the world?"
Ms. Rapinoe's breakout occurred during the 2011 World Cup, when she scored a goal against Colombia, grabbed an on-field microphone and began singing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A."
In that same tournament, she made one of the greatest plays in the history of American soccer, lofting a crossing pass to Abby Wambach for a headed goal in the 122nd minute of an eventual victory in a penalty shootout against Brazil.
In the next match, Ms. Rapinoe came off the bench to deliver two assists in a semifinal victory over France. Afterward, she said blithely, "I believe I'm a fantastic player, and I try to go out there and do those things."
Jill Ellis, the U.S. coach, has long agreed with that assessment. She said Thursday she was not worried about any increased pressure on the American women, noting that they thrived under pressure.
"I think we all support Megan," Ms. Ellis added. "She knows that."
Ms. Rapinoe also appears to have the support of FIFA, soccer's world governing body. FIFA has historically been lacking in support for women's soccer, but at Friday's match and at other quarterfinal games it plans to campaign publicly for inclusivity and against discrimination of any type.
Ms. Rapinoe was not always so comfortable in the spotlight.
In middle school, Ms. Rapinoe told Yahoo Sports in May, she felt "lost" and "really alone." But she began to flourish once she started understanding her sexuality, her twin sister told Yahoo.
"Maybe part of the reason she was quiet growing up was because she felt a little different," Rachael Rapinoe said. "She didn't quite feel comfortable in her skin. But once she realized who she was and why she felt the way she felt," that's when "she found strength in her voice."
On a national team that, for two decades, has been publicly standing against what it considers inequalities in pay, travel and playing conditions, Ms. Rapinoe's assertiveness has helped give broad, fearless license to her teammates to also demand equitable treatment and social justice.
She spoke Thursday, as she often has, of using the platform of soccer "for good and for leaving the game in a better place, and hopefully the world in a better place."
Julie Foudy, a former captain of the national team and a two-time World Cup winner, said of Ms. Rapinoe and her teammates: "In a way that I have never seen before, this team seems to unapologetically own their voice. It's O.K. to be confident. I no longer need to apologize for saying I want to win. I don't need to say I'm sorry because I'm competitive."
Ms. Foudy added: "I haven't heard that before in such a way, across the board. Maybe that's because you have examples like Megan, who does it so authentically."

Texto completo: When potential customers visit the online resale store ThredUp, messages on the screen regularly tell them just how much other users of the site are saving. "Alexandra from Anaheim just saved $222 on her order" says one message next to an image of a bright, multicolored dress. It's a common technique on shopping websites, intended to capitalize on people's desire to fit in with others and to create a "fear of missing out." But "Alexandra from Anaheim" did not buy the dress. She does not exist. Instead, the website's code pulled combinations from a preprogrammed list of names, locations and items and presented them as actual recent purchases.
Whatare'dark patterns'?
The fake messages are an example of "dark patterns," devious online techniques that manipulate users into doing things they might not otherwise choose to. They are the digital version of timeworn tactics used to influence consumer behavior, like impulse purchases placed near cash registers, or bait-and-switch ads for used cars.
Sometimes, the methods are clearly deceptive, as with ThredUp, but often they walk a fine line between manipulation and persuasion: Think of the brightly colored button that encourages you to agree to a service, while the link to opt out is hidden in a drop-down menu.
Web designers and consumers have been highlighting examples of dark patterns online since Harry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain, coined the term in 2010. But interest in the tools of online influence has intensified in the past year, amid a series of high-profile revelations about Silicon Valley companies' handling of people's private information. An important element of that discussion is the notion of consent: what users are agreeing to do and share online, and how far businesses can go in leading them to make decisions.
Howmuchare theyused?
The prevalence of dark patterns across the web is unknown, but in a recent study, researchers from Princeton University have started to quantify the phenomenon, focusing first on retail companies. The study is the first to systematically examine a large number of sites. The researchers developed software that automatically scanned more than 10,000 sites and found more than 1,200 used techniques the authors identified as dark patterns, including ThredUp's fake notifications.
But the number of sites the researchers found using dark patterns underestimates the techniques' overall prevalence online, said Arunesh Mathur, a Princeton doctoral student and an author of the paper. The researchers' software focused on text, and it scanned only retail stores' pages and not travel booking sites, social media services or other areas where such tactics might be used. The study, he added, was also confined to patterns used to influence purchasing behavior, not data-sharing or other activities.
Howdoesitwork?
The Princeton study identified dark-pattern techniques across the web by automatically scanning the sites' text and code.
On ThredUp, for example, the researchers saw the website create the messages in April using code that arbitrarily selected combinations from a list of 100 names, 59 locations and 82 items. The New York Times replicated the results. On one day this month, the code led to messages in which "Abigail from Albuquerque" appeared to buy more than two dozen items, including dresses in sizes 2, 4, 6 and 8. On other occasions, it yielded messages showing different people "just" buying the same secondhand item days or months apart.
When asked about the notices, a ThredUp spokeswoman said in an emailed statement the company used "real data" and it included the fake names and locations "to be sensitive to privacy." When asked whether the messages represented actual recent purchases, the company did not respond.
In another example, more than 160 retail sites used a tactic called "confirmshaming" that requires users to click a button that says something like "No thanks! I'd rather join the 'Pay Full Price for Things' club" if they want to avoid signing up or buying something.
More than two dozen sites used confusing messages when encouraging users to sign up for emails and other services. On a New Balance athletic apparel site, for instance, the first part of one message suggested a user could check a box to receive emails, but on closer reading, the opposite was true. "We'd love to send you emails with offers and new products," it said, "but if you do not wish to receive these updates, please tick this box."
New Balance believes the opt-out is "legally compliant and we believe clear to consumers," Damien Leigh, senior vice president of global direct-to-con-sumer sales for the company, said in a statement. But he added the company "is always looking for ways to be as transparent as possible with consumers and will evaluate the study's insight when it is released."
Canthistechnique beregulated?
The report coincides with discussions among lawmakers about regulating technology companies, including through a bill proposed in April by Sens. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and Mark Warner, D-Va., that is meant to limit the use of dark patterns by making some of the techniques illegal and giving the Federal Trade Commission more authority to police the practice.
"We are focused in on a problem that I think everyone recognizes," said Fischer, adding she became interested in the problem after becoming annoyed in her personal experience with the techniques.
The legislation faces uncertain prospects, in part because of language defining dark patterns and the companies that would be subject to the new law is ambiguous, said Woodrow Hartzog, a law and computer science professor at Northeastern University. Still, he added, it is an important first step for policymakers in discussing dark patterns.
"The important question as a policy matter is what separates a dark pattern from good old-fashioned advertising," he said. "It's a notoriously difficult line to find -- what's permissible persuasion vs. wrongful manipulation."

Texto completo: When George Sinner was elected governor in 1984, Ruth Meiers became the first woman to serve as lieutenant governor in North Dakota.
Meiers was a social worker in Mountrail County, where she farmed and ranched with her husband. She was elected to the North Dakota House in 1974 and was drafted by the Democratic women's caucus at the party convention a decade later to be Sinner's running mate. She was diagnosed with cancer in 1986 and died on March 19, 1987.
She was popular in the state and her work was greatly appreciated. The same year she died, the Ruth Meiers Hospitality House was formed as a nonprofit. It started small, offering shelter for a few men in Bismarck. Over the years it grew, expanding its services to include an emergency shelter and a residential program for men, women and children.
Now it appears the Ruth Meiers Hospitality House has closed its doors permanently. That's unfortunate, because for approximately 32 years it has played a key role in helping those in need in the Bismarck-Mandan community.
Its importance to the community was highlighted when it closed its men's emergency shelter in 2017 and sold the facility at 305 N. 23rd St. to the Heartview Foundation. Bismarck-Mandan struggled for months to find a replacement for the men's shelter.
The status of the nonprofit remains unclear, and the Tribune editorial board believes it should be explained to the public as quickly as possible. Ruth Meiers has had a lot of supporters over the years, and they need to know the fate of the nonprofit. The board owes an explanation to the public, and to agencies and organizations that donated generously over the years.
Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota is taking over Ruth Meiers' property at 1100 E. Boulevard Ave. and will maintain the facility's affordable housing units but will discontinue the transitional living program.
Ruth Meiers Hospitality House no longer operates any programs and has no employees. Its board has apparently dissolved, and under state law a nonprofit must be managed or under the direction of a board. Secretary of State Al Jaeger said Ruth Meiers hasn't filed a notice of intent to dissolve.
There are many difficulties in operating a nonprofit, and over the years the Ruth Meiers Hospitality House has encountered its share of problems. When Ruth Meiers purchased the facility at East Boulevard Avenue, many in the neighborhood objected to the services being planned for the site and Ruth Meiers had to change its plans.
The nonprofit was dealing with financial problems when it closed its men's shelter in 2017. There were management issues within the organization and it owed $200,000 in back taxes. The board never explained the extent of the problems. Now is the time to do so. 
Over the years Ruth Meiers Hospitality House has provided essential services to the community. Many people would have gone without the basics in life without the nonprofit. The good it accomplished should be its legacy.
In its obituary for Ruth Meiers, the New York Times reported this quote from her after her cancer diagnosis.
"I believe in prayer. I believe in miracles. I also believe in reality, and I can deal with that."
Some believe what the Ruth Meiers Hospitality House achieved was a miracle. Now it's time to accept reality, explain the situation and close the books on a remarkable effort.

Texto completo: What's on TV
2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DEBATE 9 p.m. on MSNBC, NBC and Telemundo. Maybe they'll blow off steam with a game of baseball afterward. After all, each night of the first presidential debates of the 2020 Democratic primary race carry nine candidates, enough to fill a team. The highest-polling candidate appearing Wednesday, the first night, is Senator Elizabeth Warren. Her opponents in the debate, held in Miami, will include Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas; and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. The second debate will air Thursday, also at 9 p.m., on the same networks. It has perhaps the more starry showdown, with a pool that includes former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Three female candidates will appear each night, more than have ever before been on the debate stage at once (the third on Wednesday is Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii).
TRUE JUSTICE: BRYAN STEVENSON'S FIGHT FOR EQUALITY (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. The human rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson is known for representing death-row inmates, and for his recent work in bringing both a national monument to victims of lynching and an accompanying museum of slavery and mass incarceration to Montgomery, Ala. Stevenson's work to eliminate racial discrimination from the criminal justice system is the subject of this documentary, which profiles him and his career. "When you look at the 13th Amendment, which talks about ending forced labor, it says nothing about ending this narrative of racial differences," Stevenson said in an interview with The New York Times Magazine this year. "Slavery didn't end in 1865; it just evolved."
What's Streaming
HAMLET Rent on Globe Player. Michelle Terry plays Hamlet in this production of the great tragedy, which ran at Shakespeare's Globe in London last year and makes the dramatic pursuit of power you'll see at the presidential debates this week look cordial. You couldn't ask for a more qualified candidate to play the avenging Danish prince than Terry, a veteran Shakespearean actress and the current artistic director of the Globe. "It's difficult to imagine a sparkier, more deeply felt Hamlet than she is here," Matt Wolf wrote in The Times, "her withdrawn, black-clad presence at the start giving way to a jaunty, clownish demeanor that never for a second loses sight of the grieving character's 'noble heart."' "Ophelia," a riff on Shakespeare with Daisy Ridley that hits movie theaters on Friday, makes this an especially good time for a refresher.
BEATS (2019) Stream on Netflix. A talented teenage producer (Khalil Everage) makes music with a high school security guard played by the "black-ish" star Anthony Anderson in this drama set on Chicago's South Side. It's a coming-of-age story with wisdom.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- There were fedoras and single white gloves and sequined military jackets. There was lots of moonwalking. Four people danced the choreography of "Smooth Criminal" in perfect sync.
Five dozen Michael Jackson superfans from around the world had come to a gaming arcade on Hollywood Boulevard on Monday, the beginning of two days of dancing, singing and prayers in honor of their hero.
Some remembered singing "A-B-C-1-2-3" as children; others listened to "Thriller" well into their 50s and 60s, but the one who stole the show was just an infant when Jackson died: a 10-year-old boy named Rudey Parra who glided across the arcade floor in his loafers and white glove, a flawless re-creation of moves he'd studied on YouTube. Another dancer, Gowardy Horton, 38, gave Rudey his fedora, crowning him the party's reigning Michael.
On Tuesday, the 10th anniversary of his death, millions of Jackson's fans and casual listeners recalled where they were when they heard or saw the news. Jackson's death at age 50, from an overdose of drugs he had been administered to help him sleep, was a generational moment of shock. It also allowed a conflicted public to put off dealing with the uncomfortable rumors about his behavior with children.
But the anniversary came just months after the airing of the HBO documentary "Leaving Neverland," in which two men, James Safechuck and Wade Robson, described years of sexual abuse at Jackson's hands, beginning when they were as young as 7. Jackson had been acquitted in 2005 of charges he molested a different boy, but the fresh accounts from the two men, at a time of heightened awareness of sexual abuse, made many wonder whether Jackson's legacy would be tarnished for good.
It could easily take another decade to learn the answer.
A spokeswoman for HBO said the first of the two parts of "Leaving Neverland" has been watched by 9.2 million viewers, making it the most-seen HBO documentary ever. But at the same time, streams and purchases of Jackson's music are down just slightly from the beginning of the year, according to Nielsen. And while his radio play dropped off significantly right after the documentary aired in early March, and a few stations said they would ban his songs from their airways, his plays have crept back up, though to lower levels than in January.
Jackson's estate continues to earn money in other ways, too. "Michael Jackson ONE," a Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas, is still going. A musical based on Jackson's songs, "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough," continues working its way toward Broadway. The producers postponed a development session just before the documentary aired, citing a labor dispute, but are still aiming for an opening next summer.
In a small but telling referendum on Jackson's reputation, a school in Hollywood that Jackson briefly attended as a child, Gardner Street Elementary, held a vote among parents and staff members this spring on whether to remove his name from the auditorium. They kept it.
Margo Jefferson, a former theater critic at The New York Times who wrote a book about the singer, "On Michael Jackson," said that she still listened to his music, but she described it as a process stacked with complexity and conflict.
"The question is, I think, less a question of are we buying or watching, but what are we making of it?" Jefferson said. "My mood changes when I think about the way he was mistreated by his father, for example, and sometimes just by the sheer power of the work that went into developing the talent."
"And sometimes," she said, "I'm overwhelmed with horror by a cycle of abuse and pain that he didn't stop."
Dan Reed, the "Leaving Neverland" director, said he "wouldn't like to see some kind of moral police vetting every single cultural artifact we have, every song, every book, every poem, because I think we'd end up eliminating a large part of it."
"I wish I had a formula for what we should do with Michael Jackson's music," he said. "But I don't."
John Branca, co-executor for the Jackson estate, noted that Jackson had been eulogized by Berry Gordy Jr., the founder of Motown Records, as "the greatest entertainer that ever lived."
"Ten years later he remains just that," Branca said, "with new generations embracing the legacy of his cultural contributions and the elegance of his artistry as passionately as ever."
Noting that the two men in the documentary had sued the estate (so far, unsuccessfully), he added: "No discredited infomercial for a failing lawsuit against a man declared innocent in life is ever going to change that."
Among many of the fans who gathered on Monday and Tuesday in the Los Angeles area, any mention of the documentary was met with reflexive dismissal. "To be honest, it's made people more determined to celebrate," said Rachel Gillard-Tew, 32, a pre-K teacher from New Zealand. "The fans have done the research and we're quite convinced it's rubbish."
Ms. Gillard-Tew organized Monday's dance party, which drew fans from Germany, Japan, Russia, Argentina, Israel, Australia and elsewhere. There was a 59-year-old woman from São Paulo, Brazil, who runs a Michael Jackson-themed hostel with a silhouette of his head at the bottom of its pool.
Another visitor, Peggy Wolf, 61, runs a Michael Jackson dance troupe, Dancing Dangerous, in Graz, Austria. Her entire wardrobe is inspired by Michael's stage costumes and his everyday wear. She makes it all herself.
"When he died, I remember I was preparing lunch," said Ms. Wolf, who was wearing a blue-sequined jacket. "I was broken. It doesn't get better over the years."
She even managed to put a positive spin on the release of "Leaving Neverland." She said it brought his fans even closer together, and "a lot of people who were never interested in Michael Jackson are starting to look into him."

Texto completo: The House Judiciary Committee reached a deal with a key source of information for Robert Mueller's obstruction of justice investigation that will allow her to delay public testimony that had been scheduled for Monday but require her to answer written questions as the committee waits.
Democrats who control the committee said they were willing to take those steps because the witness, Annie Donaldson, is in her third trimester of pregnancy and lives in Alabama. They said she would still be required to testify in person in the coming months before the committee, which is investigating whether President Trump obstructed justice when he tried to thwart the special counsel's examination of his campaign's ties to Russia.
The White House is expected to intervene to try to block Donaldson, a former White House lawyer, from answering any questions about her government service. The White House will most likely cite a Justice Department opinion that close aides to the president have “absolute immunity" from congressional subpoenas.
The House, in turn, is preparing to file a lawsuit as early as next week to try to get the federal courts to strike down the administration's immunity theory, which has been advanced by presidents of both parties but has never been fully tested in court.
Even though the suit will probably take aim at Donaldson's former boss, onetime White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II, a ruling in the Democrats' favor could effectively force Donaldson and other witnesses who have defied the Judiciary Committee to take the witness stand.
Donaldson, as chief of staff to McGahn, witnessed or was privy to some of the most explosive moments detailed by Mueller's investigators, including the firing of James Comey as FBI director and attempts by Trump to gain control of the investigation. Donaldson kept detailed notes of those episodes and others, which are referenced frequently in Mueller's 448-page report.
A lawyer for Donaldson, Sandra Moser, said she was pleased with the accommodation.

Accuser voices frustration about lack of consequences
E. Jean Carroll, a New York-based writer who has accused President Trump of sexually assaulting her more than two decades ago, voiced frustration Monday that Trump has not faced consequences from a string of previous allegations of misconduct.
"With all the women it's the same: He denies it, he turns it around, he attacks and he threatens — and then everybody forgets it until the next woman comes along," Carroll said during an interview on CNN. "I am sick of it. I am sick of it."
Carroll, a longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, is among 16 women who have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct over the past several decades. Most spoke out just weeks before the 2016 election, after The Washington Post published a recording of Trump bragging during a 2005 "Access Hollywood" interview that his celebrity gave him permission to grab women by their genitals.
Trump has denied the allegations of misconduct and called the women "liars."
In a statement released Friday night, Trump said the encounter described by Carroll never happened and that he did not know her. In his statement, Trump asked that anyone who has information that Carroll or the magazine were working with the Democratic Party to come forward.
Carroll denied politics played any role in her decision to come forward.
"I'm barely political. I can't name you the candidates who are running right now," she told CNN. "I'm not organized . . . . I'm just fed up."
Carroll, a registered Democrat, told the Post in an interview Friday that she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She donated $1,000 this cycle to Emily's List, which supports female candidates who back abortion rights, and $500 to President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012, according to campaign finance records. On Twitter, she has posted several sharp remarks about Trump and retweets of satirical and critical articles about him.

Pelosi: Trump's threatened deportations not 'civilized'
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said President Trump's threat to begin deporting migrants if Congress doesn't quickly pass immigration legislation is "outside the circle of civilized human behavior."
Trump gave lawmakers two weeks to act in a weekend tweet. He had earlier said there would be a nationwide immigration sweep beginning this past weekend aimed at removing people in the United States illegally, including families.
Pelosi made her remark Monday at an immigration event in Queens, N.Y.
The California Democrat also said when she called Trump Friday and asked him to call off the raids, she told him, "You are scaring the children of America."
Trump tweeted that he wants Congress to resolve "Asylum and Loophole problems" along the border with Mexico.
It is not clear what he means.

Knitters' network bans Trump support on website
A free, 8 million strong social network for knitters, crocheters, and others in the fiber arts has banned any mention of support for President Trump and his administration.
The new policy on Ravelry.com was posted Sunday. The post says the site took the action because it can't provide a space "inclusive of all and also allow support for open white supremacy." The post went on to say that support of the Trump administration is "undeniably support for white supremacy."
The site, founded in 2017, said the idea was not to ban Republicans or conservative politics but to distinguish them from "hate groups and intolerance." The policy makes no mention of similar treatment for registered users who criticize Trump or the administration.
One of Ravelry's cofounders, Jessica Forbes, did not immediately return a message for comment Monday. The White House declined comment Monday.

Tricky Clicks: 'Dark Patterns' Flood the Web

Texto completo: When potential customers visit the online resale store ThredUp, messages on the screen regularly tell them just how much other users of the site are saving.
"Alexandra from Anaheim just saved $ 222 on her order" says one message next to an image of a bright, multicolored dress. It's a common technique on shopping websites, intended to capitalize on people's desire to fit in with others and to create a "fear of missing out."
But "Alexandra from Anaheim" did not buy the dress. She does not exist. Instead, the website's code pulled combinations from a preprogrammed list of names, locations and items and presented them as actual recent purchases.
The fake messages are an example of "dark patterns," devious online techniques that manipulate users into doing things they might not otherwise choose to. They are the digital version of timeworn tactics used to influence consumer behavior, like impulse purchases placed near cash registers, or bait-and-switch ads for used cars.
Sometimes, the methods are clearly deceptive, as with ThredUp, but often they walk a fine line between manipulation and persuasion: Think of the brightly colored button that encourages you to agree to a service, while the link to opt out is hidden in a drop-down menu.
Web designers and consumers have been highlighting examples of dark patterns online since Harry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain, coined the term in 2010. But interest in the tools of online influence has intensified in the past year, amid a series of high-profile revelations about Silicon Valley companies' handling of people's private information. An important element of that discussion is the notion of consent: what users are agreeing to do and share online, and how far businesses can go in leading them to make decisions.
The prevalence of dark patterns across the web is unknown, but in a study released this week, researchers from Princeton University have started to quantify the phenomenon, focusing first on retail companies. The study is the first to systematically examine a large number of sites. The researchers developed software that automatically scanned more than 10,000 sites and found that more than 1,200 of them used techniques that the authors identified as dark patterns, including ThredUp's fake notifications.
The report coincides with discussions among lawmakers about regulating technology companies, including through a bill proposed in April by Senators Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, that is meant to limit the use of dark patterns by making some of the techniques illegal and giving the Federal Trade Commission more authority to police the practice.
"We are focused in on a problem that I think everyone recognizes," said Ms. Fischer, adding that she became interested in the problem after becoming annoyed in her personal experience with the techniques.
The legislation faces uncertain prospects, in part because of language defining dark patterns and the companies that would be subject to the new law that is ambiguous, said Woodrow Hartzog, a law and computer science professor at Northeastern University. Still, he added, it is an important first step for policymakers in discussing dark patterns.
"The important question as a policy matter is what separates a dark pattern from good old-fashioned advertising," he said. "It's a notoriously difficult line to find -- what's permissible persuasion vs wrongful manipulation."
The Princeton study identified dark-pattern techniques across the web by automatically scanning the sites' text and code.
On ThredUp, for example, the researchers saw the website create the messages in April using code that arbitrarily selected combinations from a list of 100 names, 59 locations and 82 items. The New York Times replicated the results. On one day this month, the code led to messages in which "Abigail from Albuquerque" appeared to buy more than two dozen items, including dresses in sizes 2, 4, 6 and 8. On other occasions, it yielded messages showing different people "just" buying the same secondhand item days or months apart.
When asked about the notices, a ThredUp spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that the company used "real data" and that it included the fake names and locations "to be sensitive to privacy." When asked whether the messages represented actual recent purchases, the company did not respond.
The number of sites the researchers found using dark patterns underestimates the techniques' overall prevalence online, said Arunesh Mathur, a Princeton doctoral student and an author of the paper. The researchers' software focused on text, and it scanned only retail stores' pages and not travel booking sites, social media services or other areas where such tactics might be used. The study, he added, was also confined to patterns used to influence purchasing behavior, not data-sharing or other activities.
More than 160 retail sites used a tactic called "confirmshaming" that requires users to click a button that says something like "No thanks! I'd rather join the 'Pay Full Price for Things' club" if they want to avoid signing up or buying something.
More than two dozen sites used confusing messages when encouraging users to sign up for emails and other services. On a New Balance athletic apparel site, for instance, the first part of one message suggested that a user could check a box to receive emails, but on closer reading, the opposite was true. "We'd love to send you emails with offers and new products," it said, "but if you do not wish to receive these updates, please tick this box."
New Balance believes the opt-out is "legally compliant and we believe clear to consumers," Damien Leigh, senior vice president of global direct-to-consumer sales for the company, said in a statement. But he added that the company "is always looking for ways to be as transparent as possible with consumers and will evaluate the study's insight when it is released."
About 30 sites made it easy to sign up for services but particularly hard to cancel, requiring phone calls or other procedures. The Times requires people to talk with a representative online or by phone to cancel subscriptions, but the researchers did not study it or other publishing sites.
Most sites identified by the researchers used messages that indicated that products were popular, that there were few items in stock or that products would only be available for a limited time. Some were demonstrably false, while others were unclear.
There is disagreement about whether messages about things like high demand constitute a dark pattern if they are truthful. But even those based on actual site activity are an attempt to play on consumers' known weaknesses, said Arvind Narayanan, a Princeton computer science professor and an author of the paper.
"We are not claiming that everything we categorize in the paper should be of interest to government regulators," he said. "But there should at least be more transparency about them so that online shoppers can be more aware of how their behavior is being nudged."

To win on immigration, Trump must address both its security and humanitarian crises

Texto completo: As Congress continues its gridlock over immigration, the humanitarian crisis at the southern border continues to deteriorate.
Lawyers who visited an overcrowded border station in Clint, Texas, earlier this month said they were met with a “chaotic scene of sickness and filth” where “hundreds of young people who have recently crossed the border are being held,” according to the New York Times. Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul echoed the lawyers’ concerns and said his state's immigration detention centers are in the "worst" conditions he's ever seen, as did Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who told the Washington Examiner Monday that the border crisis has "never been worse than it is today."
But Congress has yet to act, and the Trump administration continues to sit and wait patiently for its legislative counterparts to do their jobs.
In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence said the health and safety crises at the border are “heartbreaking” but deflected blame to congressional Democrats.
“Of course we do,” Pence said when asked whether the administration believes migrant children should have access to soap, toothbrushes, and other basic amenities. “My point is that it’s all a part of the appropriations process. Congress needs to provide additional support to deal with the crisis at our southern border.” Tweet
Pence is right: Additional funds are necessary to substantially improve migrant detention centers. It’s a shame congressional Democrats, who tout their commitment to migrants and their well-being, refuse to work with Republicans and compromise on a deal. But there are steps the administration can and should take to aid migrants at the border while it addresses the “root causes” of migration.
"The president and the administration can be doing more," Roy told the Washington Examiner, noting that border security is primarily the executive branch's responsibility. "The executive branch needs to get busy under our current laws."
Worsening conditions at detention centers is one of many symptoms attributable to the massive influx of migrants seeking asylum. To reduce and fix the symptoms, the overwhelmed judicial system responsible for asylum hearings must be unclogged, and border agents must receive more financial and physical assistance. This, of course, depends on Congress. With that said, the absence of a permanent solution doesn’t negate the responsibility and ability to do what we can to alleviate what both political parties have admitted is a severe humanitarian crisis.
Trump was willing to declare a national emergency to secure funding for his border wall. Though the declaration was arguably an unnecessary overreach of executive power, it showed how far the president was willing to go for an issue he’s made his own. This commitment shouldn’t stop at border security.
Roy said that a few temporary solutions to ease the burgeoning crisis include giving border control officers the authority to quickly make decisions about "credible fear" claims, or initial claims from asylum-seeking migrants that must demonstrate a "well-founded fear of persecution," according to the Department of Homeland Security. Giving Border Patrol additional authority would expedite the asylum process and ease the backlogged coffers of immigration judges, Roy said.
It seems Trump knows this, if his recent compromise with House Democrats on a border supplemental bill, which will provide funding for food, shelter, clothing, medical care, legal assistance, etc., is any indication.
To make immigration a winning issue, Trump must own both its security and humanitarian aspects. As it stands, Democrats largely ignore the security crisis and Republicans severely downplay its humanitarian toll. Caught up in their partisan bickering, both parties fail to understand the significance of immigration: Their neglect of the other side’s concerns is proof of that. If this cycle continues, neither side will achieve a permanent solution.
By acknowledging the humanity of the migrants seeking asylum while maintaining pressure on congressional Democrats to pull their weight and advocating for enhanced security, Trump might just unite both sides under a coherent policy he can carry into 2020. But that depends on him.

The profound cynicism of Jack Dorsey and other abortion-promoting CEOs

Texto completo: Earlier this month, a coalition of CEOs launched an ad campaign voicing their opposition to new state-level laws that seek to protect unborn children and their mothers from abortion at various stages of pregnancy.
In a campaign pulled together by Planned Parenthood and other abortion advocacy groups, executives at 180 companies signed their name to the initial full-page ad, which ran in the New York Times and blared the intentionally vague headline, “Don’t Ban Equality: It’s time for companies to stand up for reproductive healthcare.”
As cynical as it is misguided, the campaign’s signatories include Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey (endorsing on behalf of Square rather than his primary company) along with leaders from Bloomberg L.P., Zoom, Atlantic Records, Yelp, H&M, and “swipe-right” app Tinder (the only brand that makes sense in this list).
Of course, what the coalition of corporate executives has in mind has nothing to do with “equality.” "Equality" is not being being banned or harmed in any state that is making strides to protect life in the womb.
Abortion is intrinsically and intentionally unequal, as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas recently noted with some detail. With its roots solidly planted in the eugenic movement of the early 20th century, abortion has always been a tool to allow the strong to overpower the weak. That’s the very argument that suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton used in their time to combat abortion, which they refer to as “child murder” and opposed as a major impediment to the full inclusion of women in society.
Unfortunately, the social engineers of the 20th century did not follow in the footsteps of Anthony and Stanton. The results have been devastating. Not only are African American babies five times more likely to be aborted than white babies, but in New York City, 1 out of 2 black babies is killed by abortion. Meanwhile, girls and those diagnosed with conditions such as Down syndrome are heavily targeted by abortion in the U.S. and all over the world.
All the while, Planned Parenthood and its friends are putting their donor dollars (plus the $500 million Planned Parenthood siphons from American taxpayers each year) toward fighting tooth and nail against any and all efforts to protect children from being aborted just because they were conceived as the “wrong” race, sex, or chromosome count.
Despite the posturing of CEOs like Dorsey and Tinder’s Elie Seidman, the fact is that abortion creates and sustains a profound inequality for its victims: both mother and child. At no point in the ad or on the campaign’s website do supporters make even a passing comment about the very real physical dangers abortion poses to women, risks that increase the further a pregnancy moves along.
Instead, Dorsey, Seidman, and their co-signers assert that “[r]estricting access to comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion, threatens the health, independence and economic stability of our employees and customers. Simply put, it goes against our values and is bad for business.”
How does eliminating millions of ethnic women from the workforce of tomorrow (as abortion does) translate to a competitive talent strategy?
No mother should be made to choose between her child and a career, yet that’s exactly the choice these business leaders are advocating. Think of the message that sends to their female employees and even the customers themselves. That’s not just inequality; it’s outright discrimination.
On that note, it’s fair to ask what Dorsey, Seidman, and others are hoping to accomplish with the campaign. I know it’s a question I’d be asking if I were on the payroll for any of these companies.
After all, it is far cheaper to cover the one-time cost of an abortion via insurance rather than to incur long-term costs of employees' prenatal and maternity care — plus the next 18 years of bumps, scrapes, bruises, and late-night trips to the emergency room.
Whatever these CEOs' specific motives, it’s worth suggesting that when protecting life in the womb goes against your “values” and business model, maybe it’s time to reconsider both. There are better solutions and models for holistic reproductive wellness for all women all over our country. What’s the ulterior motive for these CEOs? Because it is certainly not talent, competitiveness, or concern for women or minorities.

Texto completo: Across the United States, newspapers are disappearing. Over 60 dailies and 1,700 weeklies have ceased publication since 2004 as the internet disrupted profitable business models, and advertisers and readers migrated to other platforms.
Lancaster County hasn’t been spared, losing three weeklies: the Donegal Ledger and Solanco Sun Ledger in 2009 and the Columbia Ledger a year later. And Lancaster’s Steinman family in 2009 combined the morning Intelligencer Journal and afternoon New Era to focus resources on the morning and Sunday papers.
Meanwhile, nearby newspapers are struggling. The family-owned Reading Eagle entered bankruptcy this year and will sell to MediaNews Group, which plans to cut 81 of about 240 jobs. The Harrisburg Patriot-News in 2013 ended daily publication, going to three days a week. And the Lebanon Daily News, West Chester Daily Local News and York Daily Record, owned by national companies, are ghosts of their former selves.
Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times, in recent remarks to an industry group summed up the grim trend, saying, “I think most local newspapers in America are going to die in the next five years.”
While acknowledging the difficulties, Robert M. Krasne, publisher of LNP Media Group, doesn’t share Baquet’s pessimism. He believes LNP can be the exception.
“Please know that LNP has not escaped the challenges facing our industry,” Krasne said last week during the newspaper’s 225th anniversary celebration. “Its revenues have dropped and its expenses have risen. But the path we are taking is different.”
------------
LNP's path
LNP’s plan includes local ownership. Krasne said the Steinman family will continue to own and manage the newspaper while pledging to put all profits back into news operations. The family sold 10 Delmarva radio stations this year and Intelligencer Printing in 2017, moves that allow for diversification in non-media assets while working to make LNP sustainable.
LNP’s path differs from that taken by other Pennsylvania newspaper families, who over the years sold to profit-maximizing national chains such as MediaNews Group (Daily Local News and Reading Eagle) and Gannett Co. (Lebanon Daily News and York Daily Record.)
LNP’s direction also differs from the nonprofit model taken by the Inquirer and Daily News in Philadelphia, which since 2016 have been owned by the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, adding grants and donations to its advertising and circulation revenue.
Sustainability for LNP, Krasne said, will happen by providing “robust, meaningful, unique” local journalism that readers of the newspaper and LancasterOnline value and will be willing to pay for. Increasing paid circulation for both the print and online news product is LNP’s chief strategy.
------------
Controlling expenses
It’s a bold gambit, given that LNP’s daily delivery and single copy circulation (excluding digital subscriptions and other categories) has fallen from 77,000 in 2009 to 47,600 last year. The percentage of Lancaster County adults who prefer to get local news from print is only 23%, although that compares to 13% nationally, according to a 2018 survey by Pew Research Center.
In addition, 16% of Lancaster County adults paid for local news in the past year, the survey found. That compares to 14% nationally.
Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, in a newly released survey, found that among online readers who do subscribe, less than half pay for more than one news outlet.
The Pew survey also found that Americans are largely unaware of how much local newspapers are struggling financially. About 71% think local news outlets are doing very well or somewhat well.
Controlling expenses is another LNP imperative. LNP has saved costs by terminating a frozen pension plan that had an unfunded liability and distributing over $130 million to employees and retirees, Krasne said.
The company will also vacate sprawling, inefficient 8 W. King St. next year for the second floor of the redeveloped former Bulova building at 101 N. Queen St.
LNP Media Group’s subsidiary, Susquehanna Printing Co., also purchased a press and mailroom equipment in the Greenfield Corporate Center to print LNP and its sister publications in-house, ending a contract next year with a Mechanicsburg printer. Krasne said the long-term savings justify the investment.
------------
Investing for future
Research suggests that LNP’s plan for the future is reasonable.
“Newspapers that have made the most progress in transitioning to a sustainable business model tend to be independent or family-owned papers,” Penelope Muse Abernathy, professor of journalism and digital media economics at the University of North Carolina, said in an email. “Those publishers tend to be more in touch with the unique needs and expectations of people in their community.”
LNP has found ways to proactively connect with the community, having, for example, created a community liaison position, sponsored candidate forums and added community members to its editorial board.
Abernathy said her research found that newspapers in communities with average or above average population and economic growth and with a disciplined, creative publisher who invests for the long term have “a good chance of not only surviving, but also thriving in the future.”
“The best newspapers build strong communities by helping residents understand how they are related to people in other communities,” she said. “They build social cohesion, which leads to increased political participation and encourages economic growth and development.”
LNP continues its 225th anniversary with the opening of a LancasterHistory.org exhibit
------------
Reinvention required
Earl Wilkinson, the head of Dallas-based International News Media Association, said newspapers have been forced to reinvent themselves, and to survive they must question all assumptions.
“We have learned that two centuries of print newspapers give us little direction about the decade ahead,” he said at LNP’s 225th anniversary celebration.
Michael Barthel, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center, said in an interview that the future for newspapers is “definitely an open question.”
“People are trying everything they can and seeing what works,” Barthel said. “One of the marketing pushes of the (New York) Times and (Washington) Post is to make the case of their value directly to the public as if they were a public radio station.”
Brad Simpson, president of Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association, said that as newspapers find new ways to connect with readers, they have the advantage of being a reliable, credible source of news and information.
------------
Watchdog role
As community publishers chart different courses, Wilkinson said, it matters that they succeed. In so-called news deserts where news coverage is absent, the civic good suffers.
Studies have found evidence that communities without strong local news coverage have weaker voter turnout and civic participation. In places where newspapers close or reduce publishing to less than four days a week, municipal borrowing and rates increase significantly. In counties where a newspaper closed, local governments increased their payroll and the average tax bill rose $85.
A recent example of LNP’s watchdog function was the filing of open records requests and pursuing litigation to find out what happens to assets seized by the county’s Drug Task Force. LNP also recently obtained a police video of a vehicle stop involving a Lancaster County judge.
“Can we credibly say that ‘We the People’ can exercise our will without access to facts, without access to news, without access to institutions that constantly hold truth to power?” Wilkinson said. “The great danger to the emergence of news deserts is to the country itself and the principles on which it was founded.”

Texto completo: ALBANY - Eliot Spitzer remembers driving back from the Catskills in September 2007 and receiving a phone call from a former college roommate who was perplexed about how anchor Lou Dobbs was railing on TV about the governor's plan to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.
Just a few days earlier, Spitzer, still in his first year as governor, had announced he would direct the state Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver's licenses to any New Yorker regardless of status so immigrants in the country illegally could come "out of the shadows."
The proposal didn't draw an initial strong reaction, but days later Dobbs and others picked up on the issue and it was panned by Republicans, creating a national fervor.
The biggest attention came when Hillary Clinton, then the New York senator running for president, stumbled over her stance on the issue, leading to criticism from her Democratic primary rivals, including Barack Obama.
The backlash, Spitzer recalled this week, was too strong and was hurting his broader agenda, and Clinton's team asked him to pull the proposal. So he did.
Now, 12 years later, Spitzer's fight proved prescient.
The state Legislature passed a law Monday to let undocumented immigrants, perhaps 250,000 of them, apply for driver's licenses — ending a debate that started with Spitzer's failed attempt to mandate it.
The law is "good for the state," Spitzer, who just six months after introducing the plan resigned when he admitted to soliciting a prostitute, told the USA TODAY Network's Albany Bureau on Tuesday.
"The credit goes to the advocates who stuck with this for years pushing the issue."
A fight that spans a decade and more Spitzer was trying to reverse a policy put in place in 2003 following the 9/11 attacks that banned immigrants in the country illegally from obtained licenses n New York.
But the Democratic governor said he didn't anticipate the type of reaction he received.
"I will confess," he said, "I didn't predict way back when I first proposed it that it would be such a third rail in terms of the emotions that it evoked and the way, when I look back at it, the leading edge of the whole immigration debate."
But it certainly was.
Spitzer, who was elected by a record margin in 2006, saw his poll numbers fall over the plan, and the issue was overwhelmingly opposed by a majority of New Yorkers.
Even now, a Siena College poll this month showed a majority of voters did not support the measure. It narrowly passed the state Senate with 33 out of 63 votes after more easily passing the Assembly, and it was signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo hours later.
Spitzer said he thought it was an important issue to tackle.
"There are many members of the community who are here, who are working and who need a means of transportation to work and support themselves and their families," Spitzer recalled.
The battle nationally For Spitzer, the issue took an unexpected turn when it became a hot-button issue in the Democratic presidential primary.
Clinton initially said on the campaign trail that Spitzer's plan "makes a lot of sense."
But as criticism built, Clinton stumbled on the issue during a debate that October, leaving an opening for her opponents to say she was flip-flopping.
Obama, then the Illinois senator, pounced.
"When it takes two weeks and six different positions to answer one question on immigration, it's easier to understand why the Clinton campaign would rather plant their questions than answer them," his campaign said, according to Reuters.
With little support in New York and questions about whether the measure would be upheld under legal challenges, Spitzer traveled to Washington to meet with federal officials on the issue and ultimately announced in November 2007 that he would drop it.
"I am not willing to fight to the bitter end on something that will not ultimately be implemented," Spitzer told The New York Times of the decision.
Spitzer recalled Tuesday the Clinton campaign had urged him to pull the plan, which was something he didn't reveal at the time but years later revealed. At the time, Clinton applauded Spitzer for dropping the effort.
"The Hillary campaign was very steadfast in calling and asking that we pull the proposal," Spitzer said Tuesday.
"It reached a point where it was overwhelming all other substantive issues, and I said, 'We have an agenda and let's see if we can push this down the road.'"
Through the years The bill to allow driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants had lingered at the state Capitol since, and with Republicans in control of the state Senate for most of that time, it was gridlocked in the Legislature.
But this year, with Democrats in control of state government, lawmakers were able to narrowly win enough support for its passage. Republicans remained opposed, saying licenses should only be reserved for citizens.
"By passing this needed legislation, we are growing our economy while at the same time making our roads safer," Senate Democratic Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, said Monday.
Even Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has had a frosty relationship with Spitzer, has noted he backed the measure since Spitzer had introduced it. Cuomo was attorney general at the time.
"I support driver licenses; I did from the time Eliot Spitzer was governor," Cuomo said May 10 on WXXI, a public-radio station in Rochester.
"It now gets wrapped into the immigration discussion, especially back then when Spitzer first did it."
So 12 years later, Spitzer, now a major New York City real-estate developer, sounded pleased he was on the right side of New York history on the issue.
Does he feel vindicated on the matter?
"I'm glad it passed because it's good for the state. It's good for the immigrant community. It speaks to who we are in an affirmative way," he answered.
"And like with all other issues, I suppose, it's better to be on the winning side than the losing side. More importantly, it's better to feel that we were taking a position that was the proper one for the state."

Texto completo: Regarding New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger's plea for the president to de-escalate his dangerous rhetoric against journalists (" With Talk of 'Treason,' Trump Crosses a Line ," op-ed, June 20): President Trump's use of the word "treason" to characterize the Times, and his attempts to misuse government authority to retaliate against journalists must end, full stop. However, organizations such as the Times are also guilty of misusing rhetoric to stoke fear and mistrust. Mr. Sulzberger says that because of Mr. Trump's rhetoric, 25% of the public believes the "'news media is the enemy of the American people'"—an astounding and horrifying number. But how many Americans now doubt the virtues of democracy because they're being told it has already failed? Mr.
Trump isn't the only one who needs to take a sabbatical from the ceaseless chatter of Twitter and the 24-hour news cycle.
Tom Mysz
Oakland, Calif.
A.G. Sulzberger is justly exercised over President Trump's inapt application of the word "treason" to his newspaper. In these hyperpartisan times the word is thrown about all too casually. One might have more sympathy for Mr. Sulzberger had his newspaper objected editorially with equal vehemence when the same charge was leveled against the president by the likes of former CIA Director John Brennan and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff during the "Russian collusion" investigation.
Brian R. Merrick
West Barnstable, Mass.
Perhaps Mr. Sulzberger, in his esteemed position, could help to mollify the contentious atmosphere in the country and model more civil discourse. The contrast between how the Times treats Democratic Party leaders and Republicans, especially conservatives, is self-evident. After Hillary Clinton's loss in 2016, which came as a shock to the New York Times, Mr. Sulzberger promised some soul searching to address the Times's apparent disconnect with the "deplorables'" anger at liberal condescension. I read the Times often and see little evidence that its editors have arrived at any new revelations.
Tom O'Hare
Charlestown, R.I.
Shut down the press? The president wasn't even able to revoke White House credentials from an obnoxious and disruptive reporter. In my view, the majority of the Times's news stories rightly belong on the opinion pages.
Richard Kaufer
East Wenatchee, Wash.
Will wonders ever cease? I certainly am not going to defend President Trump, but there was one sentence in Mr. Sulzberger's article that jumped out at me: "(T)he president's rhetorical attacks . . . foster a climate in which trust in journalists is eroding." Mr. Sulzberger, my trust in journalists eroded long before Mr. Trump. Since the New York Times refused to accept the election results of 2016 and became the propaganda organ for the resistance, my trust has eroded even more. May I respectfully suggest that whenever one has a problem, the first place to look is in the mirror.
Terrence H. Scout
Purcellville, Va.
While the New York Times may feel the president's rhetoric has crossed the line, could Mr. Sulzberger please tell me what journalists the president has imprisoned, what publications he has shut down, what broadcast licenses he has revoked or, for that matter, any actions he has taken to restrict a free and fair press?

Federal minimum wage stuck at $7.25/hour since July 2009

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - America has now gone longer without an increase in the federal minimum wage than at any point in the law's eight-decade history.
In July 2009, almost 10 years ago, the federal minimum wage rose from $6.55 an hour to $7.25 an hour.
Since then, Congress has not approved any additional hikes, with Republican lawmakers rejecting Democrats' attempts to raise the minimum wage.
Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said he and President Donald Trump have not discussed the administration's position on raising the federal minimum wage.
Trump has backed a number of positions on the minimum wage, saying at one point during the 2016 presidential campaign that he supported significantly increasing it and at others that he would not lift it.
Twenty-nine states have passed state minimum wages that are higher than the federal baseline, while in the other 21 the federal minimum prevails.
Republican-controlled states are less likely to have passed minimum wage hikes, although voters in conservative-led states such as Arkansas and Alaska have approved higher minimum wages through ballot initiatives.
"We've had Congress upon Congress that can't get it done, so we're stuck with this shameful number," said Judiy Conti, government affairs director for the National Employment Law Project, which advocates a higher federal minimum wage.
Experts say the recent strong run of U.S. economic growth over the past several years bolsters the case for raising the minimum wage, given that businesses are better positioned to survive the rise in costs than they are during a downturn.
Wages have begun rising for U.S. workers as low unemployment improves their bargaining power, but some economists argue they would increase even faster with minimum wage hikes.
The "effective" minimum wage - the average wage being paid to all minimum wage workers - has surged to $12 an hour, largely due to state and local governments' hikes, according to a report in The New York Times by an economist who served in the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama.

Texto completo: Been to the movies lately? Neither have a lot of folks. This summer has produced a string of low-performing duds, from the sci-fi spinoff "Men In Black: International" to the X-Men origin story "Dark Phoenix."
Thirty years ago, in the summer of 1989, America's multiplexes were teeming with hits. "Record Summer for Movies," a New York Times headline sang about a season that pulled in $2.05 billion. Movie-lovers still point to it as a Hollywood high point, when a mix of well-crafted sequels and strong originals added up to a crowd-pleasing summer. 
Here are just some of the 1989 titles that were playing at a theater near you:
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (May 24) The third entry in Steven Spielberg's franchise brought back Harrison Ford in the title role and Sean Connery as his rugged dad. Audiences loved the father-son act and turned the movie into a $474 million hit.
Dead Poets Society (June 2) One of Robin Williams' best roles was as an English teacher whose unorthodox methods rattle a conservative boarding school. The film's $235 million take was stunningly high for a drama; the film remains a favorite for its young cast (Josh Charles, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke) and Oscar-winning screenplay.
Ghostbusters II (June 16) Bil Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and the gang returned in this paranormal comedy, which didn't wow critics but became a $215 million success.
Batman (June 23) Tim Burton took the camp value out of the superhero (played by a counter-cast Michael Keaton) and turned him into the Gothic shadow-dweller he originally was - and remains to this day.
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (June 23) Rick Moranis played a wacky inventor in this Disney throwback to the studio's Flubber-themed comedies. It became the summer's fourth-highest domestic earner with $130 million.
Do the Right Thing (June 30) Though not a box-office blockbuster, Spike Lee's film about racial tensions boiling over in Brooklyn became a cultural sensation. Its impact continued at the Oscars, where its absence in the best picture category caused a controversy; it's still an oft-cited flashpoint in Hollywood history.
Lethal Weapon 2 (July 7) Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were the big stars in this sequel, but it was Joe Pesci, as the antic informant Leo Getz, who stole the show. He became part of movies three and four, as well.
"When Harry Met Sally ..." (July 14) One of the definitive modern classics, starring Billy Crystal as Harry (loosely based on director Rob Reiner) and Meg Ryan as Sally (a composite of writer Nora Ephron and her friends). Full of memorable scenes and quotable lines ("I'll have what she's having"), the movie became a must-see hit. Even 30 years later, rom-coms have rarely gotten better than this.
Parenthood (Aug. 2) An irresistible film with one heck of an ensemble cast, including Steve Martin, Tom Hulce, Diane Wiest (earning an Oscar nod), Mary Steenburgen, Jason Robards and Keanu Reeves. It was turned into a sitcom - twice - and still feels like a gold standard for t

Texto completo: Valley News Columnist
At The Village at White River Junction, retired Dartmouth music professor Jon Appleton found many of the amenities he was looking for in a senior living community.
There’s a movie theater, a library, a fitness room and even a pub – all under one roof. The 85-year-old Appleton picked his apartment on the fourth floor because it’s across the hallway from the Village’s music room, which has a piano. He plays about 30 minutes a day.
But the Village is missing one crucial thing: people.
“I feel lonely here,” Appleton said.
Five months after opening in downtown White River Junction, the $27 million assisted living and memory care facility sits mostly empty.
Appleton, who moved in a month ago, is among a dozen or so residents. When I met up with Appleton on Thursday morning, only a couple of people were in the dining room. In the top-floor conservatory, which offers a bird’s-eye view of downtown, we sat for nearly an hour without seeing anyone else.
The staff, which Appleton describes as “wonderful,” seem to outnumber residents by a wide margin.
Since developers Brooke Ciardelli and Byron Hathorn announced plans for a five-story senior housing development on Gates Street, the project has evoked Field of Dreams: They can build it, but will seniors come?
Cost is the biggest obstacle. Rents range from $8,500 to $10,500 a month.
While competitive with some of its upscale counterparts in the Upper Valley, such as Harvest Hill in Lebanon, the Village is still roughly double the median cost for private assisted living facilities in Vermont and New Hampshire.
The Village’s developers and management say the slow start is nothing to worry about. “We have a little bit to make up, but it’s manageable,” said director Jodi Egger, who has worked in the assisted living field nationally for 15 years.
Egger, who is from Tampa, Fla., just recently took over the Village’s day-to-day operations. Her predecessor, Sandy Conrad, of Royalton, lasted only a short time. When contacted by the Valley News last week, neither Conrad nor Des Moines, Iowa-based Life Care Services, which manages the Village, would talk about the reasons for her departure.
Egger told me that she expects the Village to be up to about 20 residents by early July. It also has some furnished apartments available for short-term rental to people who want to escape Florida for a few months.
The Village probably didn’t do itself any favors opening in January. Getting folks to pick up stakes in midwinter is a tough sell. Originally, the Village was scheduled to open in September 2018, but construction delays, among other things, got in the way.
In March — two months after opening — Ciardelli and Hathorn asked the Hartford Board of Abatement for a break in its property tax bill of nearly $370,000. The developers said they “ran of short cash” due to the construction delays.
The town approved a $50,000 abatement. Last week, the Valley News reported the Village was current on property tax payments. The developers also have paid back roughly $280,000 they had used of a Vermont Community Development grant.
That’s a good sign.
To get a better idea of the national picture, I called the National Center for Assisted Living, a nonprofit trade organization in Washington.
Some facilities have waiting lists before they open their doors, but it’s not unusual for places to take “a bit longer” to fill up, said Rachel Reeves, the organization’s spokeswoman. “It really depends on the market.”
The Village recognizes that its market must be “much larger” than just seniors already living in the Upper Valley, Egger told me. A “secondary market” are seniors who have relatives, usually children, in the Upper Valley that they want to move closer to.
The Village, which offers everything from an outdoor dog park with artificial turf on a fourth-floor terrace to on-site nurses around the clock, would seem to have demographics working in its favor.
“The potential market is huge,” The New York Times wrote in 2018 about high-end facilities that resemble five-star hotels. “By some industry estimates, 20% of baby boomers, or about 15 million people, have saved enough to afford private continuing care, with many expected to demand a very high standard of living.”
After spending time with Appleton and listening to him play the piano, I find myself rooting for the Village.
I don’t expect it will ever have much economic diversity, but it affords residents who have the means to be part of the larger downtown community.
They can walk next door to the Northern Stage performing arts theater. The Briggs Opera House, restaurants and shops are around the corner. Last week, Appleton took a tai chi class at a downtown studio.
It’s not only what folks such as Appleton can get out of living in White River Junction. It’s the life experiences they bring to the town.
Appleton is a musician and composer. (He didn’t tell me this, but he has produced about two dozen CDs.) He taught at Dartmouth for more than 40 years, and he was among the few tenured faculty not afraid to criticize the college for its increasingly elitist bent.
Appleton lived in Hartford for 30 years before leaving the Upper Valley. He spent the last five years in Hawaii. Following a stroke that slowed his speech (he says it’s also affected his piano playing, but I’m not sure who could tell), Appleton wanted to return to the Upper Valley to be closer to his children and grandchildren who live in New York.
“I wanted to be in White River Junction because I can walk to things and see friends,” he told me.
All the amenities his new home has to offer — and its downtown location — are nice.
But as Appleton reminded me, it still takes people to make a village.

Texto completo: What's on TV
2019 BET AWARDS 8 p.m. on BET. Regina Hall hosts this year's awards show, with a lineup of performers that includes Cardi B, Migos, H.E.R., Lizzo and Lil Nas X, whose "Old Town Road (Remix)" collaborator Billy Ray Cyrus also appears. Honorees include Tyler Perry, Mary J. Blige and Nipsey Hussle, the Los Angeles rapper who was killed earlier this year, and who will be the subject here of a tribute performance by John Legend, DJ Khaled and the rapper YG.
APOLLO 11 (2019) 9 p.m. on CNN. Todd Douglas Miller gives fresh angles on the big lead-up to Neil Armstrong's small step in this documentary about Apollo 11, which highlights what needed to go right to allow that step to happen. The big draw is the fact that the movie is made up primarily of newly discovered archival footage. But what makes it more than the sum of its parts is the way Miller presents that footage, with directorial flourishes that add suspense to a story whose ending everybody already knows. In his review for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny called the movie "entirely awe-inspiring." He pointed out that Miller "uses simple but effective white-on-black graphics, graphic animations and, occasionally, footage set up in split-screen to highlight particularly harrowing maneuvers, to convey the complications of the actions the Apollo 11 crew had to so precisely execute." The result, Kenny wrote, "is nearly mind-boggling."
What's Streaming
GLORIA BELL (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Julianne Moore stars in this drama from the Chilean writer-director Sebastián Lelio, a reimagined version of his 2013 movie "Gloria." Moore plays Gloria, a California woman who revels in the freedom offered by her well-off lifestyle -- think yoga and weed -- and by a divorce. Much of the plot centers on a romance Gloria strikes up with Arnold (John Turturro), a former Marine, and on Gloria's relationships with her adult children. It's a tale Lelio navigates in limber form. "'Gloria Bell' is filled with quicksilver tone shifts," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "It's often quietly funny and then a little (or very) sad and then funny again. The humor is sometimes as obvious as the hairless cat that looks like a wizened extraterrestrial and the Velcro crackle of a girdle being hastily removed in a dark bedroom."
THE CASKETEERS Stream on Netflix. An article in The Times earlier this month reported that a California start-up sells people the right to have their remains cremated, mixed with fertilizer and fed to a tree. But when we think of end-of-life services, most of us still think of the traditional coffins and hearses. Those are the tools of the trade for the New Zealand funeral directors at the center of this series. The show follows them as they conduct the day-to-day business of operating funerals. The results are touching and, thanks to witty staff members, surprisingly funny.

Moon landing influenced toys, jewelry - later films; Countdown to Apollo 11

Texto completo: Apollo 11's impact on popular culture was evident 50 years ago in memorabilia, dishes and fashion. Its influence on movies and television would come later. In the 1960s, movies and TV offered stories that, although inspired by the whole space program, did not try to compete with the real drama.
"People understood in the moment that landing human beings on another world for the first was a remarkable landmark," said Margaret Weitekamp, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. "This is unlike other events."
The awareness was reflected in pins, patches, buttons, T-shirts, hats, mugs and matchbooks. Arthur C. Clarke, author of "2001: A Space Odyssey" and a commentator CBS News, kept The New York Times with the headline of man walking on the moon. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had landed on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969.
"Even someone as distinguished as Arthur C. Clarke is keeping the copy of the newspaper. He recognizes this is really important and wants to hold on to memorabilia of the moment," Weitekamp said. "You see it in pop culture in the creation of tangible souvenirs that people want to be able to mark their witness to this event, even if it is mostly mediated by television, which it was basically for everyone but the two men on the moon and astronaut Michael Collins going around it."
The National Air and Space Museum has Apollo-influenced clothing, jewelry, stamps, toys and commemorative dishes in its collection, curator Teasel Muir-Harmony said. She cited a woman's shiny silver purse, shaped like a command and service module, and a charm bracelet with space-related trinkets. The Smithsonian's collection of toys includes little plastic astronaut figures and a lunar module.
"People also made their own Apollo-inspired gear," Muir-Harmony said. She described a photo of a woman from Iceland wearing a shift dress with a Saturn V rocket.
"You see this around the world, this enthusiasm," she added. "When you think about the way people dress up for sporting events, it's a demonstration of participation and investment in the missions."
Television and the movies usually took paths far removed from news coverage of the day.
NBC's "I Dream of Jeannie" was a sitcom about an astronaut (Larry Hagman) who is master to a 2,000-year-old genie (Barbara Eden). NBC's "Star Trek" told amazing stories of the future and extraterrestrial life. Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" from 1968 depicted technological advances and a computer run amok. The CBS series "Lost in Space" and the 1968 film "Planet of the Apes" had space connections and fantastic plots.
Space lends itself to treatments that are more fictional, Muir-Harmony said. "People were quite familiar with astronauts' stories," she added. "Apollo 11 was the first live global broadcast. In the United States, 94 percent of households were watching. People did have that experience. They did watch it. It was something they had seen. It was not necessary to create movies based on it."
Space movies could spin off into unusual directions. "In a twisted way, you get 'Capricorn One,' the whole sort of moon hoax thing comes into play," said Robert Stone, director of PBS' "Chasing the Moon" documentary. The 1977 "Capricorn One" presented a Mars landing as a hoax and O.J. Simpson as an astronaut.
"You also see a turning away, a rejection of science and an embrace of pseudoscience," Stone said, pointing to the "Chariots of the Gods" documentary, which suggests extraterrestrials affected early human life.
"Capricorn One" reflects the time of Watergate and the Pentagon Papers, the Smithsonian's Weitekamp said. "Public confidence is very shaken by these revelations of real deceptions that had been carried out by the U.S. government," she said. "It fits in a moment where you have the 'Planet of the Apes' movies. By the end of the decade, you end up with 'Alien' in 1979. You're looking at corporate corruption and a depiction of space flight that isn't shiny or optimistic."
Yet NASA's stock has risen with other movies. Philip Kaufman directed "The Right Stuff," a stirring 1983 film of Tom Wolfe's 1979 book about the early space program. "The Right Stuff was an important part of the valorization of what happened in the 1960s and myth-confirming," Weitekamp said.
"Apollo 13," Ron Howard's 1995 film, presented Tom Hanks as astronaut Jim Lovell and depicted the crippled 1970 mission powerfully.
"Apollo 13 was a unique dramatic event. It was about overcoming incredible technological obstacles and personal heroism and bringing these guys back safely," Stone said. "It was kind of forgotten for a long time. It was brought back to life by Jim Lovell's book and the Hollywood movie. That became a touchstone."
Howard and Hanks would later produce "From the Earth to the Moon," a 12-part HBO miniseries about the Apollo program. It won the Emmy for outstanding limited series.
In 2018's "First Man" director Damien Chazelle depicted the Apollo 11 moon landing and presented Ryan Gosling as Armstrong. "It reflects the director wanting to create a good piece of filmmaking," Weitekamp said. "He has a distinct take on it. It's not a documentary."
This year, for the 50th anniversary, the focus is on documentaries. The real version is just too good to duplicate.

"She did achieve 65 million cracks in the highest and hardest crack ceiling, and she actually won the popular vote, so she did a lot right," Gillibrand said. "To win the popular vote by 3 million votes just shows she ran a strong campaign, and she certainly in my opinion was the most qualified, capable person ever to run for president ever."
"So I loved what she put out there in terms of herself and how much confidence she had and how much she believed in herself and always had a strong vision for America," she said.

Gillibrand worked on Clinton's Senate campaign and went on to fill her Senate seat in New York.
Trump received 62,985,106 votes, or 45.9% of the vote, in 2016. Clinton received 65,853,625 votes, or 48%, according to the New York Times. Trump won the election by getting 306 electoral college votes, well over the 270 needed, while Clinton got 232.
Much of Trump's success came from winning battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan — states Clinton herself largely ignored in the contest.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Attorney General William Barr's review of the origins of the Russia investigation is focused in part on the U.S. intelligence assessment that found Moscow intervened in the 2016 presidential election to help then-candidate Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Barr's review of U.S. intelligence gathering during the probe's early stages, announced in April, will look in particular at whether there were disagreements among the intelligence analysts who produced the findings, one of the people said. The review also is likely to look into whether the findings were motivated by political opposition to Mr. Trump, the person said, although a previous review found no evidence of that.
The spy agencies' conclusions, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly questioned, have been affirmed by special counsel Robert Mueller and by the Senate Intelligence Committee. But U.S. intelligence officials have privately expressed concern that the Justice Department plans to "red team," or challenge, the finding of Russian interference on Mr. Trump's behalf, those familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Trump last month empowered Mr. Barr to declassify information as part of his review, a move with little if any precedent, and ordered the intelligence chiefs to cooperate. Mr. Barr tapped John Durham , the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut, to lead the review, and he and members of his staff have quickly gotten to work. He meets frequently with Mr. Barr at Justice Departments headquarters, where officials have set up space for him to work.
Mr. Durham has signaled that he will seek to review documents and interview Central Intelligence Agency officials, a senior congressional official said. "From what we understand, they're still in kind of a document-review mode," the official said.
The Justice Department declined to comment, as did the CIA. Mr. Barr's interest in the CIA officials was earlier reported by the New York Times and CBS News.
The spy agencies' report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, made public in January 2017 , concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign "to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process." Over time, the Russian government "developed a clear preference" for Mr. Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, it said.
The report was drafted by the CIA, Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
As far as is publicly known, analysts differed only on one significant point—how confident they were that Mr. Putin and the Russian government "aspired to help" Mr. Trump's election chances by denigrating Mrs. Clinton. The CIA and FBI had "high confidence" in that judgment, while the NSA had "moderate confidence."
The Senate Intelligence Committee in its own investigation found in a report issued last year that those differences were handled "in a professional and transparent manner." The committee, which interviewed those who prepared the 2017 spy-agency assessment, said intelligence analysts "were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions." It termed the assessment "a sound intelligence product."
Mr. Mueller also determined that Moscow interfered in the election and aimed to help Mr. Trump, but he found insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy by people in Mr. Trump's campaign. In a news conference ahead of the report's release, Mr. Barr acknowledged Russia's efforts to interfere in the election, noting that the special counsel's investigation led to the indictments of two dozen Russian citizens, including Russian intelligence officers.
Mr. Barr doesn't dispute the conclusion that Russia interfered in the election, a person close to him said, but has questions about U.S. intelligence-gathering efforts around the Trump campaign more broadly.
Mr. Barr has said his review, which at this point isn't a criminal investigation, is focused on intelligence-gathering activities before the FBI formally opened its inquiry in July 2016. He told The Wall Street Journal the review could lead to rule changes for counterintelligence investigations of political campaigns.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who has been one of Mr. Barr's fiercest critics, said Wednesday that "we have very little visibility" into Mr. Barr's review.
Mr. Schiff said he had expressed concerns to Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, about what he described as Mr. Barr's "desire to provide cover for the president by investigating the investigators…ignore what the Russians did, ignore what the Russians may do in the next election."

Mr. Barr and his allies have said the review of the intelligence assessment is legitimate. Mr. Durham, they note, has deep experience investigating national-security officials while serving in Democratic and Republican administrations. In 2008, then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey tasked him to investigate the destruction of videotapes made of certain CIA interrogations of terrorism suspects overseas during the Bush administration. The following year, under President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder had Mr. Durham to expand that review to look into whether CIA officials or contractors broke the law in their treatment of detainees.
Republicans have long called for an inquiry into whether Trump associates were wrongly targeted for surveillance. Democrats have said any suggestion that the Russia probe came about because of animus toward Mr. Trump and not because of national-security concerns is itself a political argument.
The senior congressional official expressed concern that the Justice Department review would attempt to distort analysts' legitimate debates to paint the 2017 spy agency assessment, as well as then-CIA Director John Brennan, as politically motivated against Mr. Trump.
"They're going to try to find every fissure, no matter how slight, they can find," the official said.
Since leaving office, Mr. Brennan has been highly critical of the president, who in turn threatened to rescind Mr. Brennan's security clearance. Mr. Brennan declined to comment.
Mr. Barr also will examine information-sharing between the CIA and FBI as the FBI counterintelligence probe of Mr. Trump's campaign got under way, those familiar with the matter said.
The CIA is generally not allowed to target Americans for intelligence collection. But Mr. Barr appears interested in whether the spy agencies gathered information overseas that was shared with the FBI, they said, which could have been improper.

Meritocracy is the classic American foundation myth

Texto completo: In 2017, sociology professor Rachel Sherman wrote "Uneasy Street: The Anxieties of Affluence," a book that drew upon 50 interviews with wealthy New Yorkers to obtain a picture of just how they perceived their status.
Sherman found her interviewees, all in the top 1% to 2% of income or wealth or both, had thoroughly imbibed the narrative of meritocracy to rationalize their affluence and immense privileges. That is, they believed they deserved all their money because of hard work and individual effort. Most identified themselves as socially and political liberal and took pains to distinguish themselves from "bad" rich people who flaunt their wealth.
One striking characteristic was that these folks never talk about money and obsess over the "stigma of privilege." One typical respondent, whose wealth exceeded $50 million, told Sherman, "There's nobody who knows how much money we spend. You're the only person I've ever said the numbers to out loud." Another couple who had inherited $50 million and lived in a penthouse had the post office change their mailing address to the floor number because PH sounded "elite and snobby." Another common trait was removing the price tags from items entering the house so the housekeeper and staff didn't see them.
Her subjects readily acknowledged being extremely advantaged but remained "good people, normal people" who work hard, are careful about ostentatious consumption, and, above all, give back. Sherman concludes they've largely succeeded in feeling "morally worthy."
As a follow-up to this study, professor Sherman has been conducting similar interviews with young people whose parents or ancestors accumulated sizable fortunes, wealth they now have or will soon inherit. Sherman's recent piece, "The Rich Kid Revolutionaries," (The New York Times, April 28) reveals a stark contrast in self-perception from her earlier findings.
First, her interviewees get the lie of meritocracy as they ruefully skewer family myths about individual effort, scrimping and saving and the origins of wealth. One young woman, who's in line to inherit a considerable fortune, told Sherman, "My dad has always been a CEO, and it was clear to me that he spent a lot of time at work, but it has never been clear to me that he worked a lot harder than a domestic worker, for example. I will never believe that."
Sherman discovered that whether the immense fortunes came from "the direct dispossession of indigenous people, enslavement of African Americans, production of fossil fuels or obvious exploitation of workers, they often express especially acute guilt." One response has been that some wealthy people under age 35 have formed organizations to fund social justice initiatives.
Second, many of her respondents have read about racialized capitalism and harbor no illusions about their own success. From access to the "right" schools and acquiring cultural capital, to social networking and good, high-paying jobs, they readily acknowledged that it's all derived from their class (and race) privilege.
Third, they are convinced the economic system is "immoral," equality of opportunity does not exist and their wealth and privileges are absolutely "unearned."
One might ask about the case where a person of modest means succeeds at something and accumulates a fortune. We've all heard or read, ad infinitum, a rich, grumpy person say, "Damn it! Nobody even handed me anything. I did it all on my own. I'm entirely self-made." Isn't that evidence of individual merit? No.
I can list many factors that belie this powerful, seductive but wholly fictional narrative, one that's also touted to and embraced by many members of the working class: Child labor, immigrant labor, eminent domain, repression of unions, public land grabs and corporate welfare, to name a few. Another factor that deserves its own paragraphs is pure luck. By any objective criteria, we can conclude that absent this arrangement, there would be no accumulation of private wealth.
Meritocracy is the classic American foundation myth and provides the basis for an entire array of other fairy tales. Foremost, this illusion serves to justify policies that foster economic inequality and hinder the development of social movements.
After so many decades of neoliberal ideology, this lie is now firmly lodged in the public's collective consciousness. But I'm convinced that with effort and relying on the evidence, it can be expunged.

Texto completo: For the last several years, EPAC on the Edge, a series of staged readings featuring edgy plays, has popped up periodically during the season.
This year, EPAC on the Edge is featuring all three of its shows in the upcoming weekend.
“Queer Voices Staged Reading Festival” features three full-length plays about the LGBT community.
Alex Bannon, producer of EPAC on the Edge, explains how the series idea got started.
“Ed (Fernandez, the artistic director of EPAC) wanted to direct ‘Boys in the Band.’ I wanted to find a newer piece.”
And then a third play fit into place.
Friday’s show, “Boys in the Band,” by Mart Crowley, is the best-known of the three, having recently enjoyed a revival on Broadway.
First performed in 1968, it was a groundbreaking play. A group of gay and bisexual men are together to celebrate a birthday. The host of the party, fueled with alcohol, insists on a game where everyone must call someone they love and tell them.
“We are doing the revival version,” Bannon says. “They streamlined it and made it faster, more bare bones. The rewrite really helped.”
On Saturday, “Significant Other,” by Joshua Harmon, will be performed. It opened off-Broadway in 2015 and on Broadway in 2017.
“It’s one of the funniest pieces I’ve ever worked on,” says Bannon, who is directing.
Jordan is a gay man in his late 20s who is looking for love and watching his female friends all finding it and getting married.
“You are trying to be a good friend, but you’re feeling abandoned,” Bannon says. “It’s hard to see other people flourish when you aren’t.”
The final production in the festival is 2017’s “Bull in a China Shop,” by Bryna Turner. The play is inspired by letters between Mary Woolley, the president of Mount Holyoke College for the first 30 years of the 20th century, and her partner, the writer Jeanette Marks, who Woolley made head of the English department at Mount Holyoke.
“It’s the story of these two women and how they navigate through life,” Bannon says. “It’s being directed by Cody Allyn, who is writing his school thesis on it.”
As Laura Collins-Hughes wrote in The New York Times: “ ‘Bull in a China Shop’ is about how hard and heartbreaking and personally messy it has always been to swim against the current, how necessary bravery is — and how bracingly alive the struggle can be.”
"Boys in the Band" and "Significant Other" start at 8 p.m. "Bull in a China Shop" is at 2 p.m. Tickets are $15 per show, or $40 for all three. Student tickets are $5 each.

The Ephrata Performing Arts Center is located at 320 Cocalico St., Ephrata.

Hypocrisy has lost all meaning

Texto completo: There was a time when calling someone a hypocrite could stain their reputation. No more. Like the overused and often misapplied word “racism,” hypocrisy has lost the power to cause harm.
The media and Democrats are agog over President Trump’s comment to former Bill Clinton adviser and current “Good Morning America” host George Stephanopoulos. Trump said if a foreign power had “dirt” on one of his political opponents, he’d “listen” and would not necessarily inform the FBI.
On Friday, he backtracked somewhat, telling “Fox and Friends” he might tell the FBI if he received such information from a foreign government.
Unsatisfied, congressional Democrats say the first remark provided more grounds for impeachment. Opposition research is what Democrats (and Republicans) have long done, said the president.
Washington Times reporter Rowan Scarborough writes that Hillary Clinton was once fine with obtaining dirt on her opponents from foreign sources. Recall the Steele dossier, which falsely claimed bad behavior by Donald Trump when he stayed in a Moscow hotel, allegedly cavorting with prostitutes and urinating on a bed in which the Obamas had slept.
Clinton excused the dossier, which was initially paid for by her campaign and the Democratic National Committee, saying it was “part of what happens in a campaign.” The Daily Caller even reported that Christopher Steele told a State Department official that “a former Russian spy chief and a top adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin” were sources for the dossier.
No problem for the media or Democrats now campaigning openly for President Trump’s impeachment because they loved Hillary and hate Trump. This attitude colors all media reporting. Consider The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN and MSNBC, which appear to be anti-Trump, all the time.
Another example of hypocrisy is coming from Democrats, the Left and the media (do I repeat myself?) at the announcement that White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will resign at the end of the month and return to Arkansas.
Reporters are honing in on a statement Sanders made alleging that “the rank and file of the FBI had lost support” for its former director, James Comey. She later said she “misspoke.” Critics called her a liar.
From PolitiFact: “Jay Carney, Barack Obama’s press secretary, echoed Obama’s claim that Americans could keep their current health-care plans under the Affordable Care Act. As Obama’s plan moved from idea to legislative reality, the statement became inaccurate. Ultimately, the statement was repeated dozens of times with insufficient context, earning PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year for 2013.” Carney never said he misspoke.
Many press secretaries for Republican and Democratic presidents have lied or “spun” on behalf of their bosses, but those working for Democrats mostly get a pass or were treated better than Sanders. In 1971, when asked if American and South Vietnamese forces were preparing to invade Laos, President Nixon’s press secretary, Ron Ziegler, replied, “The president is aware of what is going on in Southeast Asia. ... That is not to say anything is going on in Southeast Asia.”
In 2009, Michael Collier of the San Francisco Chronicle compiled a list of some of the lies associated with modern presidents. They include John F. Kennedy’s aides, who claimed Kennedy had to cut short a visit to Chicago and return to Washington because he had a cold. It was 1962, and the truth was the Cuban missile crisis demanded his attention.
Pentagon spokesman Arthur Sylvester said at the time the government had a “right” to lie in such instances.
Lyndon Johnson lied about “guns and butter,” claiming the Vietnam War could be fought without damaging the economy.
A funny one Collier discovered might be apocryphal, but it makes a point: “Franklin D. Roosevelt went to Pittsburgh before the start of World War II and promised that the United States would not go to war. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor – when war became inevitable – he asked his aides what he should say to the American people. They told him: ‘Say you were never in Pittsburgh.’”

Texto completo: When Bill Cunningham died, in 2016, at 87, an era in New York fashion died with him. By day he would prowl the streets of the city on his bicycle photographing anonymous strangers whose style caught his eye. These he would print in his popular New York Times column On the Street. By night he would attend fancy fetes and snap photos of high-society nabobs in their finery for his feature Evening Hours. 
Richard Press's documentary “Bill Cunningham New York" (2010) turns the camera on Cunningham, following him for two years as he pursued his high-profile vocation and would return home from chi-chi parties to a monk-like tiny studio atop Carnegie Hall. He delves into Cunningham's life from his origins in a strict Boston Irish-Catholic family to his role as a revered mediator between the hoi polloi and the upper crust, between haute couture and the fashion that springs from the genius of ordinary people. 
“Bill Cunningham New York" can be seen on Filmatique as part of its The Creation of Meaning series.

Father away
How broken is the US immigration system? Local filmmaker David Sutherland (“Kind-Hearted Woman," 2013) details the plight of a family victimized by it in his wrenching and inspiring documentary “Marcos Doesn't Live Here Anymore."
Elizabeth Perez is a former US Marine decorated for her service in Afghanistan. She fell in love with an undocumented immigrant, Marcos Perez, and married him. They had four children, worked hard to support them, and were well liked and respected in their Cleveland community. Then in 2010 the police picked up Marcos in a traffic stop while he was driving to work. He was deported to Mexico, where he remains to this day.
But his wife is a fighter. For years she filed lawsuits and chased down politicians to have her husband restored to his family (her confrontation with US Representative Jim Jordan is especially galling). Finally she decided to move with her children to Mexico so they could live with their father — despite the challenges of learning a new language, adapting to a different culture, finding employment, and losing their health insurance. Not to mention leaving the country she loved and served with distinction.
For years, Sutherland had access to members of the Marcos family on both sides of the border as they struggled against bureaucracy and a systemic xenophobia and racism. The resulting film is a non-polemical portrait of a family responding to injustice with courage, persistence, and an abiding faith in the values that make our country great. 
“Marcos Doesn't Live Here Anymore" is available on DVD ($24.99) from PBS Distribution on June 25 and on digital download.

Ceci n'est pas un film
In 2010 an Iranian court found the world-renowned filmmaker Jafar Panahi (“The White Balloon," 1995; “Crimson Gold," 2003) guilty of political outspokenness, or, as the charges described it, “assembly and colluding with the intention to commit crimes against the country's national security and making propaganda against the Islamic Republic." He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment (later reduced to house arrest) and a 20-year ban on making movies. Since then he has covertly made and released to the outside world four features, one fewer than his total output prior to his conviction. 
The first of these, the coyly titled documentary “This Is Not a Film" (2011), he smuggled out of the country to the Cannes Film Festival on a USB drive hidden in a birthday cake. It is a film about a filmmaker who is not allowed to make a film made by a filmmaker not allowed to make a film. Set in Panahi's apartment, it features him talking on the phone, talking to his pet iguana, and talking with himself. He describes and acts out a script he has written about a girl who is locked up by her parents (it sounds a little like his 2018 film, “3 Faces"). He films the janitor with his phone as he picks up trash and tells him the story of his life. It comes as a relief when he steps onto his balcony and the fireworks celebrating the Iranian New Year burst in the sky. 
Evocative of both Beckett and Kafka, “This Is Not a Film" is a bleak celebration of the persistence and power of cinema.
“This Is Not a Film" can be seen on Filmatique starting on June 27 as part of its The Creation of Meaning series.

Diamonds are forever
As a catcher playing in the 1920s and '30s for the Washington Senators and other teams (including the Red Sox), Moe Berg put his Princeton education to good use by translating into Sanskrit the signs he flashed from behind the plate. It was one of 10 languages he had mastered. Though not a strong hitter (his 15-year career batting average was .243) he shone defensively and had a knack for calling pitches. These skills earned him a spot alongside such future Hall of Famers as Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, and Lou Gehrig on the All Americans Baseball Team that made a goodwill visit to Japan in 1934.
As Aviva Kempner (“The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg," 1998) shows in “The Spy Behind Home Plate," her fascinating documentary about this largely unheralded Jewish hero, that's when Berg's second career began.
Aware of the rising tensions between Japan and the United States that would culminate in the attack on Pearl Harbor, Berg secretly filmed a panorama of Tokyo. He shared this with the government back home, and in 1942 it would later prove useful for the Doolittle bombing raid. Proving himself to be a valuable asset, he would work intermittently throughout the war with the Office of Strategic Services, precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Sometimes his espionage work verged on the exploits of James Bond. Berg met and befriended Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, himself a British secret agent. A particularly dicey assignment occurred in 1944, when Berg was instructed to attend a lecture given by Werner Heisenberg in Zurich, and determine how close the German physicist was to developing an atomic bomb for the Nazis. If necessary, Berg was to assassinate him. Luckily for Heisenberg, Berg concluded that he had abandoned the project.
Rich with anecdotes, entertaining interviews, rare archival footage, and even a recording of Berg acing the questions on the radio quiz show “Information Please," Kempner's film probes the secret life of a beguiling, enigmatic figure who probably had more secrets that we'll never know.
“The Spy Behind Home Plate" opens on June 28 at the Kendall Square Cinema.

Trump spurned ‘control’ by donors in ’16; not so for ’20

Texto completo: DORAL — Behind the high wall of manicured trees surrounding his private golf club here, President Donald Trump held his first campaign fundraiser Wednesday as an official candidate for reelection.
Details of the bounty aren’t known; the event was closed to the press.
But the few details that have emerged indicate it was likely quite the affair, costing $250,000 for a table and a picture with the president or $100,000 for merely a table and a chance to hear the president speak.
Wednesday’s fundraiser, held a day after Trump kicked off his reelection campaign with a rally in Orlando, didn’t just pour money into the campaign’s coffers and underscore the Sunshine State’s primacy as a critical trove of Electoral College votes. It served as an announcement of sorts that, as he seeks reelection, the president won’t even pay lip service this time to the notion that he’ll use his
vaunted wealth to avoid begging for money from rich and well-connected donors who could turn around and make policy demands.
In announcing his initial campaign for president four years ago, Trump mocked politicians who weren’t as moneyed as him.
“They will never make America great again,” he said. “They don’t even have a chance. They’re controlled fully. They’re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests. Fully.”
Trump said he would be different.
“I’m using my own money,” he said. “I’m not using the lobbyists. I’m not using donors.”
America’s campaign finance system — where fat cats make puppets of politicians with their plenty — has long frustrated people across the political system.
Trump said he knew that game and promised he’d use his money to hold the strings of power himself.
“I don’t care,” he said during his 2015 campaign announcement. “I’m really rich.”
Whether Trump is as rich as he claims is still a subject of debate. He has refused to release his tax returns and has resisted other efforts to get him to divulge details of his finances.
What’s not debatable is that Trump did not honor his pledge to swear off campaign donors.
The New York Times, analyzing data from the Federal Election Commission, reported that nearly 80% of the $322 million his campaign raised for his 2016 presidential run came from donors.
And in this election cycle, Trump is again working the wealthy.
Even before Wednesday’s event at Doral, Trump had demonstrated a mastery of money raising with Florida as particularly fertile ground.
The Palm Beach Post has reported that, through March 31, Trump had raised $5.2 million from Floridians while his would-be Democratic Party rivals had raised a combined $1.1 million.
All told, Trump raised a total of $97.8 million through March and had $40.7 million in cash on hand.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, leading in the polls on the Democratic side, announced on Monday that he had raised $20 million so far. That amount would put him on par with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, who raised $20.8 million through March and had $17.8 million in cash on hand.
Other Democratic hopefuls weren’t too far behind that.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, pulled in $16.4 million and had $11.2 million in cash on hand, while her Senate colleague, Kamala Harris, of California, raised $13.2 million and had $9 million in cash on hand.
Trump, the man who scorned fundraising, is outraising them all.
Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer and voter advocacy group, said that’s not a good thing.
“He’s relying on all the traditional big-money events that all the other candidates have,” Holman said.
Holman said Trump had it right when he said donors expect a return on their generosity.
“The very large donors do expect to get something in return,” he said.
Holman said Trump can now look to his own example for proof of that.
He pointed to Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a big donor to the Trump 2016 campaign, who wanted the U.S. to have closer ties to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and to move the U.S. Embassy to the politically divided city of Jerusalem.
Trump’s ties to Netanyahu are so close the prime minister’s government named a settlement in the disputed Golan Heights area in Trump’s honor. Trump has recognized Jerusalem, a city claimed as a capital by Palestinians and Israelis, as Israel’s capital and carried out plans to move the U.S. Embassy there. And Trump awarded Adelson’s wife, Miriam Adelson, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.
Well-heeled donors have long been rewarded for their contributions. Republican and Democratic administrations have been stocked with ambassadors and Cabinet members whose most prominent qualification for the job was their history of ponying up when the presidential candidate passed the hat.
As unconventional as Trump has been in so many areas, in campaign finance he’s proving to quite conventional, Holman said.
“He’s entirely abandoned any pretense of having a self-funded campaign,” Holman said.
Trump’s backers don’t seem concerned about the president’s move away from his 2015 pledge.
“I think he’s doing what he has to do,” said Brian Miller, a 45-year old musician from Van Nuys, California, whose visit to South Florida coincided with Trump’s.
Miller waited in mid-90s heat to take pictures and wave as the president’s motorcade ushered him away from his club and to the airport for the return trip to Washington.
“It doesn’t make sense to go broke,” Miller said when asked about Trump’s fundraising. “He’s doing what everyone else is doing.”

Donald Trump and the New York Times; Will the President and the newspaper's employees stop accusing each other of treason?

Texto completo: This column has been hoping for a few years that the discourse conducted by the President of the United States would always remain above that occurring in the pages of the New York Times. But such hopes seem unlikely to be fulfilled any time soon.
Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger writes in a Journal op-ed today about the latest reckless rhetoric from Donald Trump:
First it was "the failing New York Times." Then "fake news." Then "enemy of the people." President Trump's escalating attacks on the New York Times have paralleled his broader barrage on American media. He's gone from misrepresenting our business, to assaulting our integrity, to demonizing our journalists with a phrase that's been used by generations of demagogues.
Now the president has escalated his attacks even further, accusing the Times of a crime so grave it is punishable by death.
On Saturday, Mr. Trump said the Times had committed "a virtual act of treason." The charge, levied on Twitter , was in response to an article about American cyber incursions into the Russian electrical grid that his own aides had assured our reporters raised no national-security concerns...
Treason is the only crime explicitly defined in the U.S. Constitution. The Founding Fathers knew the word's history as a weapon wielded by tyrants to justify the persecution and execution of enemies. They made its definition immutable—Article III reads: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort"—to ensure that it couldn't be abused by politicians for self-serving attacks on rivals or critics. The crime is almost never prosecuted, but Mr. Trump has used the word dozens of times.
This column agrees with Mr. Sulzberger's message and hopes it will be amplified and advanced by better messengers.
There also remains the hope that Mr. Sulzberger's employees will consider living by the standards he demands of the President.
"Trump, Treasonous Traitor" was the headline on a Times column by Charles M. Blow in July of 2018. Wrote Mr. Blow:
Put aside whatever suspicions you may have about whether Donald Trump will be directly implicated in the Russia investigation.
Trump is right now, before our eyes and those of the world, committing an unbelievable and unforgivable crime against this country. It is his failure to defend.
The astounding argument was that even if the Russia collusion conspiracy theory fell apart—as it did eight months later with the completion of the Mueller report—it was still reasonable to accuse Mr. Trump of treason because his administration was insufficiently tough on Russia, in the estimation of Charles M. Blow. With sledgehammer subtlety, the Times columnist added that "America is being betrayed by its own president" and reiterated that "Trump is a traitor".
Treason has been a recurring theme at the Times. "Already, Trump has flirted with treason," wrote Timothy Egan shortly before Mr. Trump took office in January of 2017. By July of that year columnist Maureen Dowd seems to have concluded that the Trump administration had gone fully medieval:
Wicked siblings willing to do anything for power. Secret deals with sworn enemies. The shock of a dead body. A Wall. Foreign bawds, guns for hire, and snakes. Back-stabbing, betrayal and charges of treason. Little birds spying and tattling. A maniacal mad king and his court of scheming, self-absorbed princesses and princelings, swathed in the finest silk and the most brazen immorality, ruling with total disregard for the good of their people.
The night in Washington is dark and full of terrors. The Game of Trump has brought a pagan lawlessness never before seen in the capital.
Perhaps readers were gratified to see a Times columnist go on record against pagan lawlessness, but the talk of treason continued. "When the President Isn't A Patriot," read one 2017 Times headline. The story now appears online under the headline: "Odds Are, Russia Owns Trump." "The Real Coup Plot Is Trump's" was another 2017 Times doozy .
Times Columnist Paul Krugman has been peppering his screeds with treason references for years. But instead of simply assailing the President he prefers to accuse tens of millions of other Americans of being willing to sell out their country.
In a 2017 Times blog post entitled, "The New Climate Of Treason," Mr. Krugman wrote that "essentially the whole GOP turns out to be OK with the moral equivalent of treason if it benefits their side in domestic politics."
In another piece that year the Times fixture wrote that his partisan opponents appeared to be willing to betray their country not just for power, but for money as well. In "Judas, Tax Cuts and the Great Betrayal," Mr. Krugman wrote that "almost an entire party appears to have decided that potential treason in the cause of tax cuts for the wealthy is no vice."
By 2018, Mr. Krugman was so busy making separate accusations about the millions of Americans who disagree with him that he almost didn't have room to include an allegation of treason. But he somehow managed to find the space:
For more than a generation, the Republican establishment was able to keep this bait-and-switch under control: racism was deployed to win elections, then was muted afterwards, partly to preserve plausible deniability, partly to focus on the real priority of enriching the one percent. But with Trump they lost control: the base wanted someone who was blatantly racist and wouldn't pretend to be anything else. And that's what they got, with corruption, incompetence, and treason on the side.
Treason on the side. Just a casual step across the line that the Times publisher rightly scores the President for crossing. Mr. Krugman has so thoroughly convinced himself of the wickedness of people who disagree with him that he now asserts that one of America's two main political parties "will do anything, even betray the nation, in its pursuit of partisan advantage."
Here's hoping that the both the President and the opinion writers at the New York Times will choose their words more carefully.

Texto completo: Reihan Salam, the new president of the Manhattan Institute, near Grand Central Station, New York City, June 10. PHOTO: Christopher Lane for The Wall Street Journal
Reihan Salam has made a name for himself as an iconoclastic conservative thinker. More than a decade ago, he and Ross Douthat (now a columnist for the New York Times) made a splash with a coauthored book titled "Grand New Party," which argued that the GOP needed an activist policy agenda to win back working-class voters. Last year, in a book on the immigration problem, Mr. Salam called for amnesty, assimilation and a shift toward admitting higher-skill newcomers.
He is a 39-year-old Muslim whose parents emigrated from Bangladesh. He shaves his head and lives in the progressive enclave of Park Slope in Brooklyn. And he is, to the surprise of those expecting a more conventional choice, the new president of the Manhattan Institute, the influential conservative think tank whose ambitions long ago spilled beyond the confines of New York City.
Mr. Salam takes on his new role in the conservative intellectual establishment at a time of unusual ferment. The advent of Donald Trump has upended much that once seemed immutable in American conservatism. Old ideological alliances are fraying.
So will he steer the Manhattan Institute in a sharply different direction? What is his vision for the future of American conservatism? Is his idol the communitarian Edmund Burke or the individualist John Locke? Is he a nationalist or a cosmopolitan? Trump or never-Trump? Mr. Salam isn't taking the bait.
"I'm a coalition builder," he says earnestly over a long, animated lunch in midtown Manhattan. He argues that the institute, like conservatism itself, should be a big, open tent. "Conservatism is always refreshed by refugees from other political traditions," he says.
"When you're a columnist, your job is picking fights," he says of his previous work. "When you're the leader of an institution, you have to build consensus and solve practical problems."

'Most of our major urban centers have become political monocultures,' says Mr. Salam. PHOTO: Christopher Lane for The Wall Street Journal
Think tanks have long played an outsize role in developing America's right-leaning intellectual infrastructure, and since its founding in 1977, the Manhattan Institute has carved out an unusual niche: It examines urban problems and policies through the kind of market-oriented perspectives that can be scarce in big-city American politics.
"Most of our major urban centers have become political monocultures," Mr. Salam says, "where a small number of voters—in many cases, a small number of primary voters—are driving rigidly ideological agendas that threaten to undermine public safety and private-sector job growth."
Though the Manhattan Institute has worked on urban problems with a range of public officials over the years, it had a particularly close working relationship with Rudy Giuliani, New York City's mayor from 1994 through 2001. Mr. Giuliani was particularly receptive to the think tank's arguments for school choice, lower taxes, less regulation and a diminished role for public-employee unions.
Will those remain causes for the institute? "The policies you mention will continue to be high priorities, but we won't succeed unless we win over people" who don't already share our values and beliefs, Mr. Salam adds later by email. "In some cases, our scholars will make clear, principled arguments that have little shot of being embraced in the moment but that can set the stage for future policy victories; in others, they will try to identify compromises and pragmatic accommodations."
WSJ Essays by Reihan Salam
* A Way Out of the Immigration Crisis
* Donald Trump as Nixon's Heir
* Taxation Without Exasperation
Additional priorities, he says, include a strong economy and a healthy culture. "I am deeply concerned about what I call punitive multiculturalism—a cultural politics that revolves around the demonization of putatively privileged groups. We want to foster a policy conversation focused on developing the potential of all Americans, regardless of color or class."
In a sense, Mr. Salam grew up in his think tank's New York. The Manhattan Institute played an important role, for example, in advocating the influential "broken windows" theory of policing, which emphasizes public order and was put into effect in the city during Mr. Salam's teenage years. He was raised in Brooklyn's Borough Park, a neighborhood long home to many Orthodox Jews, and he remembers his parents sometimes working two jobs each, even as they studied—his father for the CPA exam and his mother for a master's degree that helped her to become a renal dietitian.
Mr. Salam followed his sisters into the city's elite public Stuyvesant High School (lately the subject of controversy because few black and Latino students do well enough on the standardized entrance exam to get in) and went on to Harvard for his undergraduate degree. His upbringing took place largely among working-class Brooklynites. There were few nearby Bangladeshi immigrants, and his friends came from across New York's complex ethnic mix. He fondly recalls an Italian-American grandmother in his building who lavished love and lasagna on him when he was boy.
Mr. Salam's memories of the period around 1990 also include the city's crack epidemic and the climate of hostility surrounding an African-American boycott of two Korean-American stores over discrimination charges. In Mr. Salam's liberal family, he says, Mr. Giuliani's election as mayor in 1993 was seen as "some sort of calamity," yet he believes there is no denying that the city subsequently improved. These experiences, Mr. Salam says, helped to make him a conservative who embraces diversity while eschewing identity politics.
In keeping with this ideological ecumenism, he has written for a range of publications over the years, including Slate, the Atlantic and National Review, where he worked as executive editor. He says that he has always loved finding and cultivating talented people, something that he is now in a position to do at the Manhattan Institute.
Mr. Salam describes himself as a not particularly observant Muslim. He lives in Brooklyn with his wife (a magazine editor) and their 6-month-old daughter.
His hope, he says, is that his growth-oriented vision of urban conservatism will "draw in a new generation of people who feel frustrated by the debate we have now." As his own family's trajectory shows, newcomers to the U.S. have always arrived and forged their identities in places like New York. "A conservatism that does not speak to the cities," he says, "is going to be marginalized."

Texto completo: BASRA, Iraq -- Two rockets struck separate targets on Wednesday in oil fields just outside Basra, not far from the headquarters of many international and domestic oil companies.
Though a bit more frequent in recent weeks, rocket attacks have been rare since the Islamic State was pushed out of Iraq more than 18 months ago, and oil fields generally have not been targets. Basra, in southwestern Iraq just above the Persian Gulf, is one of the richest oil production regions in Iraq.
In the first attack, three employees of an Iraqi drilling company who were injured when a Katyusha rocket hit their sleeping quarters were taken to a hospital, said Khalid Hamza, the deputy director of the Basra Oil Company, an Iraqi firm.
There were no injuries reported in the second attack. No other details were available about the strike, and officials would not say who they believed was responsible for the attacks.
The rocket strikes come as tensions are escalating between the United States and Iran after attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, for which Washington blamed Tehran. Iran said on Monday that it would soon breach curbs on its stock of low-enriched uranium set out in the 2015 pact limiting its nuclear program. In response, President Trump ordered an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East and affirmed his pledge that Iran would not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.
The Trump administration withdrew the United States from the nuclear pact last year and has reimposed painful economic sanctions on Iran, including a prohibition on oil exports that has cut off a large portion of its government's revenue.
Western analysts have described the attacks on the oil tankers as an effort by Iran to signal that if it is blocked from selling its oil, it will penalize the rest of the world by making the shipment of oil riskier and more expensive.
Recent rocket attacks in Iraq have included one in the Green Zone, home to the embassies of the United States and other countries. Other strikes appeared to take aim at Iraqi security forces.
The Iraqi government has been resolute about keeping out of any conflict between Iran and the United States.
"We think its an operation that aims to drag Iraq into the crisis between Iran and America and to involve Iraq in a war," said Gen. Yahya Rasool of the Baghdad Joint Command, which includes American and Iraqi forces.
The first rocket landed before dawn Wednesday near the Zubair oil field in an area that includes the headquarters of many oil companies, including those of Shell and Exxon Mobil; the second landed in the area of the Rumaila oil field, one of Iraq's oldest and largest oil patches, where BP is operating. Shell said in a statement that all its staff members were accounted for and that the company was continuing normal operations in Iraq.
Abbas Maher, the mayor of Al Zubair, said the first rocket had been launched from his town.
"This is the first incident of its kind, and we consider it as targeting an Iraqi company and damaging the Iraqi economy," Mr. Maher said.

Agassiz descendants put pressure on Harvard to give up slave photos

Texto completo: A Connecticut woman suing Harvard University over slave images that she says belong to her family has gained support from an unlikely corner: the descendants of the professor and controversial scientist who commissioned the pre-Civil War daguerreotypes.
More than 40 descendants of Louis Agassiz have signed an open letter to Harvard's president and trustees urging them to relinquish the images to Tamara Lanier, who traces her lineage to the slaves.
Lanier filed a lawsuit against Harvard in March, alleging that the university has capitalized on what are believed to be the oldest images of American slaves. The daguerreotypes of a South Carolina slave named Renty and his daughter Delia were taken for Agassiz to bolster his theory of white biological superiority.
Lanier has said that the images are of her family members who as slaves were forced to sit for the photographs and that those images now belong to her family.
Agassiz's descendants back her claim, which probably puts additional public pressure on Harvard to surrender the images.
“Does the university want to continue to gain from an image stolen from enslaved people?" the family letter asks. “It is our hope that releasing the daguerreotypes will be a first step in a long overdue movement of reckoning and repair."
Agassiz's descendants said they have struggled to come to terms with their ancestor's legacy of white supremacy. They encouraged Harvard to acknowledge its part in providing “intellectual legitimacy" to the once-renowned professor of geology.
Agassiz's descendants shared the letter but declined to comment further. Family representatives plan to hold a press conference Thursday and deliver the letter to Harvard officials afterward.
Harvard declined to comment specifically about the litigation Wednesday. But college officials said the daguerreotypes, which are fragile, are treated carefully to ensure their preservation. They are viewed twice a year and kept in a temperature-controlled room.
Harvard's Peabody Museum holds the images and has gone to great lengths to develop practices that engage descendant communities and others who may have an interest in its some of its sensitive collections.
“Harvard has and will continue to come to terms with and address its historic connection to slavery," said Rachael Dane, a spokeswoman for the Peabody Museum. “Harvard also strives to be an ethical steward of the millions of historical objects from around the globe within its museum and library collections."
Harvard has yet to respond in court to the lawsuit, but president Lawrence Bacow has said there is nothing unlawful about the university's possession of the portraits. The university does not profit from the images and charges only a small fee for reproductions, Harvard officials have said.
“I think we have the law on our side. Again, I would hope, though, that we could resolve this not purely by resort to legal process," Bacow said in April in an interview with the student newspaper The Crimson.
But legal experts have said that the case is not only about the lawful ownership of the images, but what is ethical, considering that the subjects of the photos were slaves and had no ability to consent.
Lanier's attorneys said they hope that the letter from Agassiz's descendants will bolster their case against Harvard.
“They can speak to Harvard in a way that others can't, white or black," said Josh Koskoff, a Connecticut attorney representing Lanier. “The letter is an exceptional show of support and goodwill from this family."
The Agassiz descendants who have signed on include artists, psychologists, a published poet, a college administrator, a Harvard reference librarian, and a former top official in the US Treasury Department under the Obama administration. They live in Minnesota, California, Mexico, and New England. Several are graduates of Harvard.
Agassiz, a Swiss-born naturalist, was a contemporary of Charles Darwin, although he disagreed with the theory of evolution. He was among the early scientists to theorize that the Earth had gone through a great ice age, and he founded the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard. He was so popular at Harvard during his time that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote him a birthday poem and when he died in 1873, the Boston newspapers published special editions trimmed in black, according to a Harvard publication.
But Agassiz also advocated polygenesis, the belief that humans weren't all the same species and that white people were superior. His work was used to bolster slavery.
The images of Renty and his daughter are part of Agassiz's polygenesis work. Renty, a white-haired black man, is photographed emaciated and stripped of his clothing. His daughter, Delia, is photographed in profile, too, as if she were a scientific specimen.
In their letter, several of his family members said they have celebrated Agassiz's scientific contributions.
But they added, “For too many years we have ignored his role in promoting a pseudoscientific justification for white supremacy," the letter said. “We see this as a collective failure to live up to our values of anti-racism and compassion."
An Agassiz descendant from Minnesota read the news reports about the lawsuit in the spring and contacted Lanier about the images, said Ben Crump, one of Lanier's attorneys. Crump is a civil rights attorney who represented Trayvon Martin's family after the black teen was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch coordinator.
While only a few of the descendants continue to carry the Agassiz name, Crump credits them for willingly stepping forward to acknowledge their family's part in slavery and its effect across generations of black Americans.
Americans remain reluctant to talk about slavery and reparations, Crump said.
The more common reaction would be to simply portray Agassiz to a man of his time, without confronting his influence in present day America, Crump said.
“I think most people in America don't get involved in the debate," he said. “They could have been neutral and silent."
The images of Renty and his daughter were long forgotten until 1976, when they were discovered in a corner cabinet in the attic of Harvard's Peabody Museum. Since then, they have been widely available online.
Harvard used Renty's image on the cover of a 2017 book on anthropology and during a conference it hosted that same year about universities and slavery. The image was also used in a recent art exhibit on Harvard's campus about slavery and the university.
For a while, Harvard kept tight control over which outside groups could use the image.
Lanier wrote to former Harvard president Drew Faust in 2011 detailing her ancestry and ties to Renty and Delia. The paucity of records about slaves and their families has made ancestry research difficult for many black Americans, and some Harvard officials have in the past raised questions about the documentation that Lanier provided to prove her lineage to Renty.
The lawsuit is now in federal District Court in Boston.

Texto completo: Del Taco will begin serving meat-free Beyond Burritos on Thursday, June 20, two months after the successful launch of its Beyond Tacos.
The new burritos expand Del Taco’s partnership with Beyond Meat, a Los Angeles-based company out to revolutionize meat substitutes with plant-based products that look and taste like beef.
The two new menu items are:
Beyond 8 Layer Burrito: Made with seasoned plant-based crumbles, slow-cooked beans, guacamole, diced tomatoes, lettuce, cheddar cheese, sauce and sour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla.
Epic Beyond Cali Burrito: Beyond Meat plant-based crumbles wrapped with crinkle-cut french fries, sour cream, guacamole and handmade pico de gallo in a flour tortilla.
The two Beyond Tacos on the menu are among Del Taco’s most successful launches. It has sold about 2 million of them since they were added to the menu in mid-April, according to a news release from the Lake Forest-based chain.
Plant-based protein is a hot trend in fast food and fast casual restaurants. Beyond Meat and its main competitor, Impossible Foods, have an expanding list of partners serving their products in burgers, Mexican foods and pizzas. The New York Times reported this week that Red Robin and White Castle are struggling to keep up with demand for Impossible Burgers.
Peas are a key ingredient in the Beyond Burger, while the Impossible Burger is made with soy, but both products are engineered to grill and even bleed like real beef.
Burger King began testing an Impossible Whopper in St. Louis on April 1 and three weeks later announced it would roll out the burger to the entire chain. Bay Area restaurants began serving it last week.

Biden lavishes praises on New York Times columnist David Brooks

Texto completo: Joe Biden is heaping praise on New York Times columnist David Brooks, talking up what the former vice president calls the writer's insight into American political life.
At a Manhattan fundraiser Tuesday night Biden offered a reading list to paying guests, including the 2018 book How Democracies Die by Harvard professors Steven Levitzky and Daniel Ziblatt, in which the authors paint President Trump as a de facto authoritarian.
Biden then mentioned "a conservative writer you all know of or you may know, David Brooks."
Biden added, "I think the guy writes pretty damn well about an awful lot of things."
Brooks made his name as a conservative polemicist and reporter, working his way up through the Wall Street Journal and as a founding editor at the Weekly Standard. His work initially focused on electoral politics and current affairs, but his focus in recent years has been morality and ethics. Brooks' most recent book is The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life.
But Brooks hasn't completely forsaken politics. When several women came forward to accuse the former vice president of inappropriate touching, Brooks took to Twitter to defend Biden.
"When I started covering politics I was struck by how often politicians made physical contact with voters and journalists. It wasn’t about sex," Brooks wrote on Twitter. "It was about connection. Joe Biden, who emerged in that era, is one of the finest people I’ve ever covered."
That's a long-held sentiment for Brooks. In 2008, even before Democratic nominee-in-waiting Barack Obama chose Biden as his running mate, Brooks was effusive in his praise of the Delaware senator for three-and-a-half decades.
"Democrats in general, and Obama in particular, have trouble connecting with working-class voters, especially Catholic ones. Biden would be the bridge," Brooks wrote in an Aug. 22 column, "Hoping It's Biden."

Britain’s gender stereotype ban just went into effect, but it won’t make ads better

Texto completo: Some years back, a woman in a yellow bikini sparked a change in British advertising regulations. She was posing on a weight loss ad in the Subway in between text that read, “Are you beach body ready?”
The people of London took offense at the idea of a one-size-fits-all “beach body,” and more than 70,000 people signed a petition to have the advertisements removed.
In response, the United Kingdom’s Advertising Standards Authority reviewed its regulations, finally changing them in December to ban all depictions of sexist stereotypes. It may sound like a win for women, but the rules will be difficult to qualify, and even harder to enforce. Tweet
Under the new regulations, which went into effect last week, a company could get in trouble for showing a woman struggling to park a car, or a man floundering while changing a diaper, if the ad “depicts a man or a woman failing to achieve a task specifically because of their gender,” according to the ASA.
Other scenarios that the ASA describes as “likely to be problematic” include ads that contrast stereotypical personalities for males and females, ads that imply an ideal physique is standing in the way of a person’s success, and an “ad that depicts a man with his feet up and family members creating mess around a home while a woman is solely responsible for cleaning up the mess.”
Advertisements have a long history of perpetuating stereotypes. In her TED Talk, “The Dangerous Ways Ads See Women,” Jean Kilbourne says advertisements subconsciously affect their viewers, even at a very young age. “Babies at the age of six months can recognize corporate logos,” she says, “and that’s the age at which marketers are now starting to target our children.”
Yet the government shouldn’t try to downplay the role of advertising agencies in monitoring their own content. The ASA’s list of guidelines is long, but it could be even longer. How will it determine which ads go too far? Beth Egan, an associate professor of advertising at Syracuse University, told the New York Times that the ASA may find it difficult to distinguish “between what’s a gender stereotype and what’s a representation of real life in the real world.”
In the U.S., the government largely permits the free relationship between the advertiser and the consumers, who can speak out about advertisements they feel are harmful.
“Our history is more about consumer backlash and self-regulation than allowing a voice from on high to come down and just say, ‘You can’t,’” Egan said.
Time will tell how the regulations play out in the U.K., but it's a good thing the U.S. hasn't adopted any similar rules. Consumers are free to criticize ads they dislike, from Nike's Colin Kaepernick endorsement to Gillette Venus' promotion of an obese model.
But the government has neither the expertise nor the responsibility to monitor the effects of commercial advertisements. If consumers dislike an ad, they can still sign a petition. And advertisers, not the government, should pay attention.

Advertising (A Special Report) --- Creativity, by The Numbers: Consumer data increasingly is shaping the creative process -- worrying some to lament it is leading to less originality

Texto completo: Consumer data has become an integral part of digital ad-buying, allowing advertisers to better target consumers on the internet. Now, data is shaping the creative process as well, a trend that is sparking debate within the advertising industry.
Ad agencies' increasing reliance on data is inverting the traditional creative model, where the teams dreaming up ad campaigns use their gut instincts to tap into the zeitgeist. Now, thanks to a preponderance of highly specific information about consumers collected from sources such as social media, surveys and search engines, more agencies are making creative choices based on what the data dictate.
Such an approach is creating tension within the industry, ad executives say, alienating the evangelists who believe that data yield more precise messaging from those who think it should be just another ingredient in the creative calculus -- if that. For the moment, the data evangelists appear to be winning out.
Jason Musante, the chief creative officer of Huge, a digital-marketing agency in Brooklyn owned by Interpublic Group of Cos., which recently acquired Acxiom's data-marketing unit, says that data is going to make the adage "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don't know which half" a thing of the past.
Data can infuse an ad campaign's creative execution in a variety of ways.
Rob Campbell, a Memphis-based director of strategy at VMLY&R, the newly consolidated marketing agency owned by WPP Group PLC, the world's largest ad company, is working on a continuing ad campaign for the U.S. Navy aimed at attracting recruits between the ages of 18 and 24.
Using research provided by the Navy, along with VMLY&R's own data, Mr. Campbell says he and his colleagues zeroed in on one specific factoid to hone the message: Younger people aren't familiar with the Navy's workings because so few of them have friends or family members who serve in the military. So the team crafted a campaign to address that, producing, among other things, a video series called "Faces of the Fleet," featuring interviews with sailors. The goal, he says, was to create a sense of empathy for service members in people in that age group.
Those who saw ads from the campaign two or more times were 16% more likely to consider joining the Navy, according to Sandra Muoio, a senior director at Wavemaker, the WPP-owned media agency that joined with VMLY&R to release the videos.
In the U.K., meanwhile, BBH London recently wrapped up a campaign for Burger King that was geared around "one killer data point," as head strategist Ben Shaw puts it. BBH found that two-thirds of people in the U.K. had never heard of the Whopper, because the burger chain had spent most of the past decade advertising its limited-release items.
In April, the agency released a series of ads across multiple platforms in which Burger King customers were depicted as being reprimanded for referring to the Whopper as a cheeseburger -- a playful attempt to explain what the Whopper was to British consumers.
The data point allowed BBH to be somewhat counterintuitive to stir up its audience, a strategy that has also been taken up by other firms such as Droga5, the boutique agency that agreed to be bought by Accenture PLC in April and whose recent clients include Dine Brands Global Inc.'s IHOP chain and the New York Times.
According to Amy Avery, Droga5's chief intelligence officer, the firm wouldn't be able to do its job without data guiding the way.
For instance, when creating an ad campaign for the Times in 2017, the Droga5 team relied on a tool designed to gauge the emotions behind online posts. It determined that the prevailing mood across the country was that the truth was under attack, so it designed a campaign focused on the importance of truth and urging people to support that cause by subscribing to the Times. The agency says the campaign was launched during the Academy Awards, an event that it determined would be popular with the target audience and that was held toward the end of the month, when Times subscriptions tend to fall off.
Still, while many see data as a panacea, others in the industry remain skeptical about its usefulness. Mark Fitzloff, an ad industry veteran and the founder of Opinionated, a Portland, Ore.-based creative agency, says he ignores the insights gleaned from data all the time because he believes an overreliance on consumer information has taken spontaneity and surprise out of the creative process, leading to a sense of homogeneity in advertising.
"If we all march from this detailed map of consumer behavior," he says, "we're going to make the same stuff."
Some industry observers say data may become less central to the creative process in the future as concerns over how to safeguard consumers' private information become more of a priority.
But if that day should come, advertisers can always rely on the more traditional approaches.
"What's the oldest data point in the world?" says Mr. Musante, the creative officer at Huge. "It's your gut."

Justice Department Weighs In: Manafort Won't Be Going to Rikers

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Paul J. Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman who is serving a federal prison sentence, had been expected to be transferred to the notorious Rikers Island jail complex this month to await trial on a separate state case.
But last week, Manhattan prosecutors were surprised to receive a letter from the second-highest law enforcement official in the country inquiring about Mr. Manafort's case. The letter, from Jeffrey A. Rosen, Attorney General William P. Barr's new top deputy, indicated that he was monitoring where Mr. Manafort would be held in New York.
And then, on Monday, federal prison officials weighed in, telling the Manhattan district attorney's office that Mr. Manafort, 70, would not be going to Rikers.
Instead, he will await his trial at a federal lockup in Manhattan or at the Pennsylvania federal prison where he is serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence for wide-ranging financial schemes, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
A senior Justice Department official said that the department believed Mr. Manafort's treatment was appropriate, but several former and current prosecutors said the decision was highly unusual. Most federal inmates facing state charges are held on Rikers Island.
The intervention of Mr. Rosen was just the latest twist in the case of Mr. Manafort, whose campaign work for Mr. Trump and political consulting in Ukraine put him in the cross hairs of a two-year investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.
He was convicted last year of financial fraud in two separate federal cases that came out of the investigation, which was led by the former special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
While that might have been the end of his criminal problems, in March, he was indicted on 16 New York state felonies, including mortgage fraud and falsifying records to obtain millions of dollars in loans. The indictment, which was based on some of the same actions in one of the federal cases, was brought by the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., in an effort to ensure Mr. Manafort would still face prison time if Mr. Trump pardoned him for his federal crimes.
Mr. Manafort is set to be arraigned next week in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
He had been expected to be held on Rikers Island, which has long been plagued by violence and mismanagement, prompting efforts to close it. Officials there had said Mr. Manafort likely would have been held in protective custody for his own safety, isolated from the general population and under heavy guard.
Federal prison officials told Manhattan prosecutors on Monday that Mr. Manafort had been transferred to the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal detention center in Lower Manhattan, in anticipation of his arraignment, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
He could be held there while he awaits trial, or he could return to the federal prison in Loretto, Penn., where he is serving his sentence, and be brought to New York for pretrial hearings, according to the people with knowledge of the matter.
The former Justice Department officials and current state prosecutors, who regularly handled the transfer of federal inmates to state custody, said they were surprised that the second-highest official in the Justice Department would take an interest in the case. The decision is usually made by the warden at the prison where the inmate is being held.
Justice Department officials were unable to say who made the decision in Mr. Manafort's case; the Bureau of Prisons, which is part of the Justice Department, did not respond to a request for comment.
Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Manafort, acknowledged that the involvement of the deputy attorney general and the decision not to hold his client on Rikers was atypical. But he said the case itself was also unusual: Mr. Manafort, he argued, should not be facing state charges for behavior that was the subject of two federal convictions.
"You'll find no example of someone like Mr. Manafort being prosecuted by the feds and then by the district attorney for exactly the same conduct," Mr. Blanche said.
A spokesman for Mr. Vance's office declined to comment.
The question of Mr. Manafort's detention was one of the first high-profile matters to be undertaken by Mr. Rosen, who was confirmed as the deputy attorney general on May 16, one day before Mr. Manafort's attorney asked the Bureau of Prisons to keep his client out of Rikers.
In the weeks after his client was charged, Mr. Blanche objected to Mr. Manafort being held at Rikers. In a May 17 letter, he asked the warden at the federal prison in Pennsylvania not to approve New York's request that Mr. Manafort be transferred to state custody, citing his age and health issues.
In the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Blanche also criticized the charges against his client, arguing that they were "a blatant violation" of New York's double jeopardy laws and calling the case "politics at its worst." The district attorney's office has said it is confident the charges will stand.
Mr. Blanche also said in his letter that the New York prosecutors were "insisting that Mr. Manafort remain on Rikers Island, likely in solitary confinement, pending trial."
While Mr. Blanche's letter indicated that copies were sent to Mr. Vance by email and registered mail, other correspondence and people with knowledge of the matter indicated Mr. Vance's office did not receive the letter.
Instead, Mr. Rosen wrote to Mr. Vance last week, asking whether his office was going to respond.
A senior Justice Department official said that the Bureau of Prisons had been keeping the Justice Department apprised of Mr. Manafort's situation, given the high-profile nature of his case. Mr. Rosen sought Mr. Vance's response largely because of these briefings, the official said.
Mr. Vance replied on Friday, dismissing what he called Mr. Blanche's "gratuitous claims" that the prosecution was politically motivated and violated double jeopardy protections. He said those arguments were irrelevant to a routine discussion about where Mr. Manafort would be held.
In his letter, Mr. Vance said New York prosecutors took no position on whether Mr. Manafort should be held at Rikers, but that keeping him in Pennsylvania did not appear to be a legitimate option under the law and was not consistent with how other inmates had been treated.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Gloria Vanderbilt, the mom: What she said about the loss of a child, Anderson Cooper coming out

Resumen: Gloria Vanderbilt had many titles, including "mom." Before her death, she talked to USA TODAY about love, loss and sexuality.

Texto completo: Gloria Vanderbilt died at age 95 with a vault of titles: heiress, painter, writer, designer, artist, actress, fashion model and philanthropist.
But most moms would agree that "mom" is the title that trumps them all.
Vanderbilt was mother to four sons: Anderson Cooper, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, Christopher Stokowski and Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski.
Her most famed son is CNN journalist Anderson Cooper, who documented correspondence between him and his mother in "The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Loss and Love. "
The two promoted the book together and those interviews gave us a glimpse into Vanderbilt as a "mom. " She opened up about losing a child and learning her son Anderson is gay.
'There's never closure'
Vanderbilt's son Carter died by suicide when he was 23.
No mother ever wants to outlive her children, but Vanderbilt actually witnessed her son's plunge from the 14th floor of her New York apartment in 1988, The New York Times reported. Carter had been undergoing treatment for depression.
Vanderbilt recounted the loss in an interview with USA TODAY.
"I love to talk about Carter, because for me, it brings him alive again," she said. "People talk about 'bringing closure,' but in my opinion, there's never closure. "
'Love is all'
The mother also discussed her son Anderson Cooper's sexuality.
Anderson, who came out to his mother while he was in college, noted that he grew up surrounded by her gay friends.
But Vanderbilt acknowledged that she was "terrified" when her bisexual mother was accused of being a lesbian. "At the time it was considered a crime, a sin, and I thought I might have inherited it – though I had no idea what it was," she told USA TODAY.
Vanderbilt also added that she often wished she was a lesbian because she understands and trusts women, and men are mysterious, to which her son argued, "Men are so not mysterious. "
She added:
"I'm always in love. If it's not a person, it's a flower or a sunset. Love is all. "

Texto completo: Plants and animals have some crazy lifestyles, particularly when it comes to pollination.
Pollination, as you may recall, is the transfer of pollen from one plant to another. This makes it possible for flowers to produce seeds, which, in turn, will produce more plants.
Insects need food, often in the form of plant sugars from nectar and protein from pollen. Put humans in the equation, and it’s a win-win-win situation. The plant gets to make more plants, the animal gets nutrition, and we get stuff we need — like soybeans, cotton, apples, tomatoes, and Tequila.
Pollination ranges from the straightforward to the intricate and complex. In the latter category is buzz pollination (or, to be fancy, "sonication"). Bumblebees seek nectar and pollen for food for their growing colonies in the summer.
Flowers in the tomato family have tons of nutritious pollen, but they don’t give it out for free. The flower won’t release its pollen unless it "hears" a certain vibration.
Bumblebees, it turns out, give off good vibes. In fact, just the right vibes.
Grasping onto the flower by the anthers, the bumblebee buzzes with a specific frequency. At this frequency, the flower explodes with pollen, giving the bumblebee its protein and coating it with pollen.
Thus doused, the bumblebee heads right to another flower, taking the pollen from Flower One to Flower Two, and on to many others.
Scientists have determined that the frequency of buzz pollination is equivalent to a C note on a tuning fork. (Or, the "Hey" in "Hey Jude," for those Paul McCartney fans out there.) And speaking of music, recent research has revealed an amazing new page in the pollination songbook.
Some flowers produce sweeter nectar when they hear pollinators approaching.
Yep, they "hear" or detect the vibrations of pollinators.
Michelle Z. Donahue reported in the January 2019 issue of National Geographic some exciting studies undertaken by Lilach Hadany of Tel Aviv University.
"Hadany’s team looked at evening primroses," wrote Donahue, "and found that within minutes of sensing vibrations from pollinators’ wings, the plants temporarily increased the concentration of sugar in their flowers’ nectar. In effect, the flowers themselves served as ears, picking up the specific frequencies of bees’ wings while tuning out irrelevant sounds like wind."
Sweet!
The Tel Aviv researchers also looked at flower shape and the ability to sense approaching pollinators. Plants with bowl-shaped flowers may be able to detect sound better than others.
"This makes them perfect for receiving and amplifying sound waves," explained Donahue, "much like a satellite dish."
This exciting research has launched a new field of study called phytoacoustics. It all goes to show that sometimes you do need to sing for your supper.
Another amazing plant-pollinator relationship has been recently discovered. Tilo Henning of the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum in Berlin, and Maximilian Weigend of the University of Bonn in Germany have hypothesized that a group of plants native to the Peruvian Andes can move their pollen-bearing structures according to past visits from pollinators.
Henning and Weigend studied the plant Nasa poissoniana and determined that it can remember the schedule of pollinator visits, and repeat their movements accordingly.
"These plants can gymnastically wave around their stamens — the organs they use for fertilization — to maximize the distribution of their pollen," according to Cara Giaimo in The New York Times.
"More surprisingly, (Henning and Weigend) suggest that individual plants can adjust the timing of these movements based on their previous experiences with pollinators. In other words, they remember the past and try to repeat it."
Crazy? You bet. You can read details of the research methods and conclusions in the April 2019 issue of Plant Signaling and Behavior.
A close-to-home example of unusual pollination is the skunk cabbage-carrion insect relationship.
Skunk cabbage, as the name implies, is a smelly plant that grows in wet woods. It’s one of the first plants to flower each year — often in February when the snow is still on the ground.
The flower is definitely not bouquet-worthy. It’s dark maroon, lacks petals, and is hidden by an overarching structure.
The color, as well as the stench of the flower, mimic dead, rotting things — hence attracting carrion beetles and flies.
The flower also produces its own heat, and can maintain a comfortable 60 to 70 degrees inside the floral covering. Perfect for those carcass-loving insects.
Other examples of strange pollination abound. With each new discovery, we find that the business of life is fascinating in its complexities.
What happens when one of the partners in the intricate dance of pollination disappears?
We are losing pollinators at an alarming rate, and plant extinction continues apace. Habitat loss and pesticide use are the big culprits.
Not to end on a buzz-kill, let me present some good news to counter the bad. Everyone can chip in to restore, preserve, and protect habitat for the myriad creatures around us.

Texto completo: MEXICO CITY - Mexico will post 825 additional immigration agents on its borders as part of an agreement with the United States to reduce migration flows, Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard announced Friday.
A planned deployment of 6,000 troops on the Guatemalan border, meanwhile, will be completed Tuesday, the minister said at a joint news conference with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Thousands of migrants cross daily from Guatemala into Mexico on their way to the U.S., which threatened Mexico with import duties unless it stopped the influx.
Mexico has also agreed to receive migrants who have been sent back by the U.S. and to host them while its northern neighbor is handling their asylum requests.
However, Mexico wants to limit the numbers of such migrants, Mr. Ebrard said.
Meanwhile, the head of Mexico's migration authority, Tonatiuh Guillen, announced his resignation.
Mr. Guillen didn't give any reason for his decision, according to an announcement published by the National Institute of Migration.
He had been handling a plan of granting humanitarian visas to migrants, which was canceled because the possibility of obtaining such visas was drawing more migrants into the country.
More than 670,000 migrants reached the U.S. border from Mexico since January, according to U.S. data. Most are Central Americans fleeing poverty and violence, but they also include Haitians, Cubans, Africans and Asians.
President Donald Trump announced a deal with Mexico a week ago to avoid imposing tariffs on all Mexican imports. Mexico was given 45 days to significantly reduce the number of migrants reaching the U.S.-Mexican border, or face a renewed tariff threat.

Candidates, pay your interns to grow diversity

Texto completo: My first "job" after high school was an unpaid internship with John Kerry's presidential campaign in Iowa.
I was based in Des Moines and slept on the living room floor of a donated apartment from a local supporter. The only furniture was an inflatable mattress bought by a campaign staffer, who was also my apartment-mate. As an unpaid intern, my primary income was mileage reimbursement for driving my hatchback around Iowa, delivering yard signs and other supplies to newly opening offices.
Despite how it sounds, sleeping on a floor in Des Moines is a luxury activity. Many students need to work during the summer to pay for school and life's expenses. I was privileged enough to be able to afford an unpaid role all summer. However, if we value diverse party leadership, campaigns up and down the ballot need to begin paying their interns.
This summer, a new crop of young staff will arrive in Iowa and other early states. For those seeking political careers, a few months in Des Moines or Manchester can be a major accelerant. When I was in Iowa in the summer of 2003, The New York Times described the experience as "out of town tryouts for the West Wing." Staff even worked the prior congressional election in Iowa to position themselves, even though campaign pay could be as low as $1,000 per month. (Given 12-plus hour days for six or more days a week, it is not an attractive hourly rate either.) Still, there will be hundreds of staff across Iowa and New Hampshire by October — months before any caucuses are held or votes cast.
Early state campaign work is not glorious. Midnight battles with copy machines making canvassing packets for volunteers vastly outnumber nights out on the town. Still, campaign staff are amazing individuals building toward big careers. Years later, my colleagues from 2003 who started as administrative assistants and field organizers became CNN hosts and White House communications directors. The staffer kind enough to let me crash on his floor was Addisu Demissie, now Cory Booker's presidential campaign manager.
As the 2020 campaign begins, each candidate is focusing on building a diverse staff reflective of the country. At least five of the Democratic presidential candidates have named executives with minority backgrounds as campaign managers. But filling campaigns for candidates up and down the ballot with staff representative of a diverse electorate may prove difficult.
The seeds of these challenges were sown years ago, as tight campaign budgets necessitated an army of volunteers and unpaid interns. Fortunately, at least seven of the Democratic presidential campaigns have committed to paying their summer interns to increase access to the political process. Others should follow their lead. This step forward should be matched by the hundreds of congressional candidates across the country. Paying interns – say those who work more than 40 hours a week for more than 10 weeks in a row – would lay solid groundwork for the future.
Today, Democratic donors are sensitive to equity issues and highlighting plans to pay interns could be a catalyst for increased donations. For campaigns willing to lead, a paid internship program could "pay for itself" through galvanized donor support. As a frequent political donor, I can attest that donors would be happier to see dollars spent building the next generation of political leaders through paid internships than driving up TV ad rates in the Des Moines or Manchester media markets.
As proof, one organization – SNAP PAC– which I helped start following the 2004 campaign – pays promising low-income college students to work as field organizers on competitive Democratic congressional campaigns and has supported more than 170 fellows over the past 14 years. The organization has raised almost half a million dollars from donors committed to the cause. Almost every SNAP PAC fellow would have spent the summer in retail, food service or farm work if not for a paid campaign opportunity. When summer ends, most campaigns offer the fellows full-time employment through Election Day.
Until Congress appropriated money last year so each office could pay its interns, less than 10 percent of representatives on Capitol Hill did so. In 2017, the Democratic National Committee began paying its interns. This year's Democratic candidates should consider how their pay levels – and who receives it – will impact the leadership of the party for years to come.
Many of today's campaign leaders benefited from similar opportunities early on – and it is time to pay it forward, literally.

When we stop doing the things that made us great

Texto completo: Last weekend, I went to one of Detroit's most celebrated Italian restaurants. I'd been years ago, and anticipated the same exquisite experience. Known for their impeccable service and inspired dishes, I was expecting them to nail every detail like they had in the past.
Yet the very things that made them successful had obviously been significantly diluted. It took 35 minutes for the first splash of wine to reach our glasses.
Our server was curt, frazzled and disorganized. The portions had shrunk over the years, and they managed to botch my friend's order altogether. Peeking over to others, I noticed similar frustration among the restaurant's other guests.
At nearly every touchpoint throughout the evening, the underlying message was the owners no longer cared. After our dinner, my wife and I agreed that we wouldn't return to the once-great restaurant.
This pattern unfortunately occurs far too frequently when those that achieve greatly feel entitled to their continued success. They cut corners here and there, thinking no one will notice. Over time, their passion for excellence fades and they ignore the attributes that put them on the map in the first place. Just going through the motions. Rote instead of zeal, this trap can deplete businesses, relationships and communities.
Nostalgia is not a sustainable business strategy.
Ever-changing world We must realize that success is not a permanent condition. Rather, it is a fluid and ever-changing state that requires continuous care and feeding. The rest-on-our-laurels strategy is a fool's bet, whereas remaining a humble, passionate servant of our craft is the best long-game play.
The trap can be hard to spot, since it's never a single decision to stop caring. I can't imagine a leader proclaiming that their organization shall now suck going forward.
Instead, the pattern unfolds through a series of small choices — seemingly harmless sacrifices to quality, service, innovation, and customer-focus — that lead to gradual decay. Previous wins may carry momentum for a while, but eventually the toxic departure from our early ideals can deliver a fatal blow.
No one is immune We've seen it with businesses, actors, churches, community leaders and politicians. When people and organizations veer away from the core principles that enabled their success, they enter those treacherous waters that can lead to their undoing.
Let's commit to rekindling that day one enthusiasm, passion and commitment to excellence that enabled our early successes. Let's treat each customer interaction with the same care that allowed us to win our first deal.
As we each look to drive our businesses and careers to the next level, let's reconnect to that early fire and deep sense of purpose we had during our initial assent. When we keep doing the things that made us great, greatness can truly be savored for the duration.

Texto completo: To illustrate headlines are used to influence readership, particularly with our biased media, the Naples Daily News pulled a good one recently. On May 28 they ran an editorial entitled, "Big Oil is Down Even with Trump Priming the Pumps." On the following Sunday they ran the identical article, but the headline was, "President Trump and the Expansion of Big Oil." This time it appeared to be masquerading as a news article, however, it was written by the USA Today Editorial Board.
As someone with a background in oil and gas, it looked like the articles were telling different stories, but like many articles sourced from The Washington Post, and the New York Times, it was a pro-climate change, anti-big oil and Trump. The article was loaded with misinformation, innuendo, and half-truths typical of people who really don't know the industry or geopolitics.
It quotes a Boston Consulting group that warns fossil fuel interests to "rethink their social license to operate head-on as the public and investors grow worried about the planet".
Most investors I know care mostly about profits and the public ranks climate change very low on its priority list, unless you're talking to the radical left Democrat followers of AOC. Major oil equities have felt the impact of lower prices at the pump and were slow to jump on the horizontal drilling of shale properties in the U.S., while smaller drillers who have developed this technology that is now accounting for more than half our domestic oil production and 70% of our new gas production, have seen their stocks soar.
The article boasts that the renewables industry is growing at a 20%/yr clip. Well, the last time I did that calculation, 20% of small number is still a very small absolute number, relative to 3 or 5% of a gigantic number! And a lot of that growth are profit hawks taking advantage of the government subsidies that keep renewables afloat.
The most preposterous statement in the article, which has no scientific validity, is "The planet can only absorb so much more CO2 in this century before rising temperatures wreak widespread havoc on food production and causes incalculable suffering." The fact is that floods , storms, and wildfires are fewer now than in recent centuries, and food production is flourishing even with 100 ppm more CO2. In fact, with more CO2 we would have an even greener planet, and if California improved its forest management instead of wasting money on welfare for their teeming illegitimate population, there would be fewer fires.
The article also tells about the carbon-free energy goals of our 5 liberal states, and in the U.K. and Germany, but fails to tell you about their energy results: more CO2 emissions, higher energy bills, and constant need for fossil fuel back up. I fail to see why articles like this are plastered all over the media, as they ignore our enviable energy situation and the fact that we, rather than OPEC, now control the price of oil.
The marvelous innovation of our oil and gas industry is a secret because apparently the media does not want you to know. I wonder why...

AJC EDITOR ON CAPITOL HILL: Let's hope testifying aids local journalism

Texto completo: It came via email.
"Mr. Riley, greetings. ... The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law will hold a hearing on the topic of journalism and online platforms. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act will be a central focus of the hearing. Would you be willing and able to serve as a witness at the hearing? If so, that would be terrific."
Let's just say, you don't get that kind of invitation every day.
For a moment, I thought it might be a prank. But the sender checked out; he's a lawyer who works for the U.S. House of Representatives.
And, though a bit hesitant, I agreed to testify.
Journalists usually report on what Congress does; we're not comfortable participating.
So let me explain why I was invited and what the hearing was about -- and how that changed between the time I was invited and when I testified.
The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, which we've written about before, would allow newspapers to negotiate as a group with the large technology companies: Facebook, Google and others. It would create a "safe harbor" from antitrust laws so that newspapers can collectively work out agreements for use of our content.
A company such as Facebook can publish, display and promote newspaper stories as it wants with no input from -- or payment to -- a newspaper. Newspapers have said negotiating with these large companies as individual entities is impractical and unfair, given their dominance.
The subcommittee, I was told, wanted my perspective on how the large technology companies impact local news operations and coverage.
U.S. Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, is one of the sponsors of the bill, along with Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island. Cicilline is also the chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law; he would run the hearing.
You may be thinking what I was: This will be interesting and fun. I can spend a day in Washington, let these politicians know what I think, and that will be that.
It's not nearly so simple, given the demands of the process, and the volatility of politics in the nation's capital.
The process officially began with a letter, on U.S. House of Representatives stationery, that formally invited me to be a witness. It was signed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler. I admit I've saved that letter; it's from one of the most prominent and polarizing members of Congress. As the Democratic leader of a committee that is investigating the president, I figure he'll make some history, one way or another.
The letter explicitly states the requirements of testimony:
|Producing a written statement that can be as long as you want. It will be included as part of the official record of the hearing.
|Preparing an oral statement of five minutes or less. This, and your answers to questions, also will be part of the official record.
Also, the subcommittee wanted my resume and "Truth in Testimony Disclosure Form," filled out and signed. All of this is part of the public record.
I thought writing my statement would be simple, and preparing oral testimony would be even easier. I have much experience at writing and public speaking, I thought to myself.
But there was something about visualizing myself at the witness table, behind a microphone, in a crowded hearing room with cameras clicking that daunted me.
I decided to leave the technical and legal explanations to the other witnesses. I wanted to highlight the AJC's role in:
|Creating in-depth local journalism that lets the community know what's really going on.
|Protecting the public's right to know.
|Documenting our communities' moments, milestones and people.
I also planned to leave it to other witnesses to talk about the perils of Google and Face-book's dominance. I would emphasize the importance of sustaining local journalism.
It was a sunny day when I arrived in Washington on an early flight. I spent the morning going over my notes and stopping by the offices of Georgia delegation members who would be part of the hearing.
I arrived at the hearing room about a half-hour early, only to find out the hearing would start late. Members of the House were voting to go to court to enforce some subpoenas issued to the Trump administration, causing the delay.
Room 2141 in the Rayburn House Office Building was quiet. A few people milled about, and some journalists were setting up cameras and microphones.
But that changed quickly.
Interest in the hearing had increased dramatically in the days just before. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department had announced plans to investigate the big technology companies. Suddenly this hearing, titled "Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 1: The Free and Diverse Press," was a big deal. In a short time, the room was full.
I took a seat behind the placard displaying my name. I would be the last of six witnesses to testify.
That was a bit of a relief, since I wasn't sure whether the microphone in front of me was turned on, or if I needed to push the button first. (You have to turn it on before you speak, I discovered by watching others.)
I shifted and positioned in my chair, considering how I'd look to the remote-controlled camera set up right in front of the witness table. After all, I'd worn an orange tie -- my wife's favorite color -- and I wanted to make sure she could see it.
Cicilline banged his gavel to call the hearing to order. I raised my right hand as he administered the oath.
Cicilline introduced all of the witnesses, except me, before they gave their five-minute statements.
Collins introduced me -- noting that he had sought information beyond my resume from one of our reporters, Greg Bluestein.
It was a gracious introduction, but the change in routine rattled me.
I got a lot of advice before the hearing, tips like this: I should address the chairman and ranking member by name and thank them and the committee for the invitation.
I was also counseled to not be distracted by members coming and going. One of them might get up and leave while a witness is talking, as they tend to other duties. In fact, I don't think all members of the subcommittee were ever there at the same time.
I began my statement. I hoped I didn't sound as nervous as I felt. My confidence grew as I went, and I got to my conclusion without stumbling:
"We should be worried about losing newspapers, the fountainheads within the local news ecosystem. It is worth considering stories that would go untold."
In fact, those words were quoted in The New York Times.
The subcommittee members then asked us questions -- sort of. What they really did was make long statements with a question at the end.
Several were directed at me. One of my answers:
"In what kind of world do you grow your audience, reach a bigger market and somehow face even greater financial challenges than you did before?" I said. "Something's out of whack in that equation."
As members of the committee nodded their heads, I knew I'd made my point.

Texto completo: This simple wisdom — “Fans don’t boo nobodies” — is courtesy the pinstriped philosopher Reggie Jackson, and it resonates for anyone who has ever been in the public sphere.
Put yourself out there and the cranks crank it up. In the end, they’re still cranks.
When you are being noticed, it’s because you have become a cause for concern, for somebody.
So that’s how I realized early this month that the formerly minor character known as Mayor Pete has become a serious cause for concern for the Republican National Committee as it continues its unethical quest to re-elect the president.
How did I realize this? Because the RNC told me so.
On June 3, its Christiana Purves sent me an email: “Good evening — With less than a month to go before the first 2020 Democrat Presidential debate, we’re still only scratching the surface of truly learning about lesser-vetted candidates like Pete Buttigieg. Unfortunately for Mayor Pete, the more we learn, Californians are more likely to see that he was a lousy Mayor who’s struggling to keep up with the pace of presidential politics.”
Then Purves goes on to cite an odd selection of stories from what the Grand Old Party on a normal day, when it didn’t suit its needs, would term the lamestream media.
“‘I ain’t ever seen the dude’ — Residents of South Bend’s poor neighborhoods say Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg left them behind,” the RNC quotes CNBC as saying. Oh, how the GOP is in touch with America’s troubled urban youth. And then: “Buttigieg is only top 2020 presidential candidate not offering staffers health care yet.” Ha ha ha. The former deputy press secretary for Trump buddy Sen. Lindsey Graham concerned a Democratic longshot is not yet being able to afford benefits for his ragtag staff? Ha ha ha.
But with the RNC concerned enough about the guy to start doing a lot of opposition research and sending it out to members of the press, maybe he’s not such a longshot, what?
I have by no means figured out who stands the best chance of preventing the global disaster that would be a second term for this president. No one has stood out in particular from the clearly too many candidates clogging the opposition field. Too bad a gutsy moderate Republican won’t come forward to take advantage of the ridiculously tainted incumbent.
The latest poll of California Democratic voters goes: Biden 22, Sanders 17, Harris 13, Warren 18, Buttigieg 10, O’Rourke 3.
So, only 10 percent of California’s Democratic voters right now say Buttigieg is their main man. Or, to look at it another way, a guy who otherwise just leads the fourth-largest city in Indiana is in fifth place among voters in the nation’s largest state. And this sudden GOP attention would lead us to believe that’s fifth place with a bullet. Harvard and Oxford graduate, former Navy Reserve lieutenant who served in Afghanistan — nice resume. Oh, and he’s gay. And he’s getting noticed — pollsters say awareness of Buttigieg shot up from 4% to 48% in the last six months.
Still actually a stretch, though. The problematical guy who is for some reason not a longshot, Joe Biden, is the frontrunner who is really giving the incumbent conniption fits. The president’s own campaign pollster came to him with numbers from a 17-state survey showing Trump losing to Biden in states that he needs to win, including Texas (sweet!), Michigan and Pennsylvania. After seeing the polls, the president told aides to deny them, Annie Karmin reports in The New York Times.
Biden is “Sleepy Joe” to Trump.
What’s he gonna call Buttigieg when the going gets rough on down the road?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump doesn't seem to be a believer of aliens or UFOs flying through Earth's atmosphere, although he has been briefed on them.
ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, in a wide-ranging interview, asked Trump about recent news reports about Navy pilots spotting flying objects and what he made of the apparent UFO sightings.
"I want them to think whatever they think," Trump said, raising his eyebrows and slightly grinning before adding that he did have "one really brief meeting on it. "
"People are saying they're seeing UFOs. Do I believe it? Not particularly," he added.
Stephanopoulos followed up, asking the president whether he thought he'd actually know if the U. S. had any proof of extraterrestrials — a question Trump didn't appear to actually answer directly.
"I think our great pilots would know and some of them really see things that are a little bit different than in the past, so we're gonna see, but we'll watch it," Trump said, following his answer with a promise that Stephanopoulos would "be the first to know" if there was alien life.
Trump's comments followed a number of reports chronicling how the government has examined UFO sightings and a report in the New York Times about Navy pilots reporting bizarre flying objects, including one that looked like a "spinning top" and another with no visible engine that could reach 30,000 feet and hypersonic speeds.
The Times report includes a number of videos filmed by Navy pilots showing the aircraft and the curiosity of the pilots who couldn't figure out what the objects were and how they were so quick, even when they were flying against the wind. But the report makes clear that the Defense Department doesn't believe the objects are from beyond Earth and that an explanation can almost always be found for incidents like these.
Unexplained flying objects have been seen by pilots for decades. In 2017, the Department of Defense released footage from 2004 showing Navy Pilots coming into contact with an unidentified flying object off the San Diego coast.
In an interview with the Times, one of the pilots, David Fravor, said mysterious aircraft were being investigated after appearing on radar at 80,000 feet, dropping suddenly to 20,000 feet then hovering there before dropping out of radar or shooting back up in the sky.
Fravor said he went to investigate one of the aircraft, saw it moving erratically then hovering just above the Pacific Ocean. As he got closer to the object, it zipped off.
"It accelerated like nothing I’ve ever seen," he told the Times, adding the incident, which was never explained, left him feeling "pretty weirded out. "

By Eduardo Garcia
The barbecue season has arrived. I went to my first cookout of the year a couple of weeks ago and, while I really enjoyed a few cold beers and plenty of delicious food, I couldn't help thinking about the smoke that came from my friend's charcoal grill.
Does that smoke contain high levels of greenhouse gases? For insight, I contacted Eric Johnson, an environmental consultant based in Switzerland who wrote a study comparing the carbon footprints of charcoal and gas grills.
Mr. Johnson said charcoal grills typically generate three times as much greenhouse emissions than gas for the same cooking job. "People tend to overuse charcoal," he said. "But when you use gas or propane, you turn the grill on and off."
He found that a typical charcoal grilling session emits as much carbon dioxide as driving a car for roughly 26 miles.
That may not sound like a lot. But, consider the fact that approximately 90 million Americans own a charcoal grill. "These things add up in the end," Mr. Johnson said.
Two other factors can worsen the environmental footprint of charcoal grills: Not all charcoal comes from renewable resources, and the accelerants that are often used to start a charcoal fire are usually made from fossil fuels. (The most environmentally friendly way to get a charcoal fire going is to use a chimney starter.)
Electric grills don't emit carbon dioxide, but, given that coal is burned to produce more than a quarter of the power generated in the United States, Mr. Johnson said that gas would probably be the most sustainable barbecue option in most cases.
Organizing an environmentally friendly barbecue is also about serving food and drinks in compostable or reusable plates and cups, reducing food waste by planning ahead and favoring grilled vegetables over meat.
If you don't want to cut the meat altogether, you could try these five burger recipes that blend meat and mushrooms.
"Mixing your meat patty with 30 percent plants like mushrooms is an easy way to satisfy your carnivore friends and do something helpful for the planet," said Sujatha Bergen, director of health campaigns at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Don't mess with Texas pipelines
By John Schwartz
Texas is making it a lot riskier to protest new pipelines.
The Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, a new measure passed by the state legislature, would increase penalties for damaging or interfering with oil or gas pipelines and related infrastructure, in some cases allowing felony charges, stiff fines and jail time of up to 10 years. Punishable offenses include entering such facilities without permission and the intention to cause damage.
Organizations involved in protests could be hit with penalties of $ 500,000.
Gov. Greg Abbott has yet to sign the bill, but he has signaled no opposition and it will most likely go into effect on Sept. 1.
The bill resembles those already passed by a half-dozen states, including Louisiana, North Dakota and South Dakota. Those measures, which have proliferated in the wake of protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline, have much in common with a model infrastructure protection act drawn up by the business-backed American Legislative Exchange Council.
The Trump administration, too, has proposed legislation along the lines of the ALEC model as part of a pipeline safety reauthorization bill.
The trend clearly worries civil liberties organizations. Some, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, have begun legal challenges.
Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel for the A.C.L.U., said that "they all have the same effect, which is to chill protests and protesting activity that the government doesn't like."
While the sponsors of the pipeline bills say they are essential to fight destructive protests, Marla Marcum, a founder and director of the Climate Disobedience Center, noted that trespassing and vandalism were already illegal. The new laws, she said, are written in such "overly broad" ways that they won't simply prevent damage to infrastructure but will have the practical effect of chilling constitutionally protected activism.
"The primary intent is to suppress dissent," she said, and "to paint dissent as an illegal act."
State Senator Brian Birdwell, a Republican who sponsored the bill in the Texas Legislature's upper chamber, suggested its impact would ultimately depend on prosecutorial discretion. "These offenses, the penalties are ceilings, not floors," Senator Birdwell said, according to The Texas Observer.

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Un bebé de 4 meses llamado Constantin Mutu es el niño migrante de menor edad identificado hasta el momento entre las miles de víctimas de la separación de familias en la frontera Estados Unidos-México por la política de “tolerancia cero” del gobierno de Donald Trump, reveló este viernes The New York Times.
Exclusive: We found the youngest known child separated from his parents at the border under President Trump. He was only 4 months old https://t.co/IHSAe6ebrs
— The New York Times (@nytimes) June 14, 2019
Un episodio en “The Weekly”, la nueva serie de televisión producida por el NYT, aborda las vicisitudes que atravesó el pequeño rumano, enviado a los cuatro meses a un hogar de acogida lejos de sus padres, que habían viajado a México desde Rumania con dos de sus cinco hijos -él y un niño de 4 años- para pedir asilo en Estados Unidos en 2018.
Los agentes fronterizos estadounidenses detuvieron en Texas al padre, Vasile, y al bebé Constantin, y después la madre, Florentina, y el otro hijo y los padres y el hijo mayor tuvieron que volver a Rumania.
De acuerdo a la historia que adelanta el diario, el padre de Constantin tiene antecedentes criminales y aseguró haber recibido “presiones para retirar la petición de asilo”.
Vasile Mutu fue enviado a un centro de detención y finalmente lo deportaron a Rumanía, mientras que las autoridades colocaron a Constantin, que tenía solo 4 meses de edad, en una familia de acogida en el estado de Michigan, al noreste de Estados Unidos.
“Cuando el presidente Trump se rindió a la presión y firmó una orden ejecutiva que paralizaba las separaciones, un juez dio paso a una demanda que pretendía reunir a las familias y preparó el camino de vuelta a Rumanía para Constantin”, señala el rotativo, que visitó al pequeño en el hogar de acogida y a sus padres en Rumania.
El Times reveló el año pasado que las autoridades estaban separando a los menores de sus familias en la frontera, acusó a las autoridades de no cuantificar el problema, y después calculó que en octubre había más de 700 niños migrantes separados de adultos que los reclamaban como sus hijos.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump announced on Twitter June 13 that his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, would be leaving the White House by the end of the month.

- https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1139263782142787585

Sarah Sanders said she was blessed for having the opportunity to serve.

- https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1139279314095149078

Sen. Lindsey Graham praised Sanders' work and said that she would be missed.

- https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1139338592264818688

The Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro said there was only one man who could replace Sanders.

- https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1139289288007278592

Sanders' father, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, said he was proud of his daughter.

- https://twitter.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/1139502827187965952

Megan Garber from The Atlantic said that Sanders reminds us what happens when partisanship takes control.

- "Her tenure serves as a reminder of what happens when partisanship, aided by the power of the presidency, is allowed to subsume everything else: traditions, norms, truth, people’s lives."

Katie Rogers and Peter Baker of The New York Times noted that it had been months since she held a press briefing.

- "It has been 94 days since she held a formal briefing. Instead, she left the daily feeding of the media to Mr. Trump, who prefers to speak for himself and takes questions from reporters on a far more regular basis than most of his recent predecessors."

Margaret Sullivan, columnist for The Washington Post, said that Sanders won't be remembered for transparency and honesty, but for gaslighting.

- "When Sarah Sanders said Thursday that she hopes to be remembered for her transparency and honesty, the first impulse was to laugh. But lying to citizens while being paid by them really isn’t all that funny. ... She would claim to represent the truth on behalf of a president who lies. She did it disrespectfully, and apparently without shame or an understanding of what the role of White House press secretary should be. She misled reporters or tried to, and through them, misled the American people. And all with her distinctive curled-lip disdain."


Former press secretary Joe Lockhart wrote on CNN that Sanders' legacy of lying would be enshrined in the Mueller report.

- "Her legacy of dishonesty is enshrined in the Mueller Report and is very telling. Many will remember the day she went after former FBI Director James Comey, saying the White House had heard from many FBI agents who were critical of Comey's leadership. It was only when she was under oath and facing potential jail time did Sanders admit she made the whole story up. To be clear, she smeared a former high-ranking government official with a story that was made up from whole cloth."

CNN analyst Brian Stelter noted that her legacy would be one of letting the dust settle.
"Last month, reporters noticed that there was literally a coating of dust on the press briefing room podium. That is Sanders' legacy."

Controversial 'Framing John DeLorean' opens in Detroit

Texto completo: Before making "Framing John DeLorean," directors Don Argott and Sheena M. Joyce had deep discussions about the challenges they faced.
"Why are there so many different versions of the man? How do you really know a person? Who was the real John DeLorean? Can you be both hero and villain?" says Joyce, recalling questions prompted by the epic rise and fall of the automotive icon.
"Those were such fun conversations, we thought, 'We should be shooting this!' "
So they did exactly that, in essence. "Framing John DeLorean," which opens Friday in Royal Oak and Ann Arbor, takes the unique approach of being a movie within a movie within a movie — all blended into one documentary.
For the backbone of the film, Argott and Joyce take the traditional route of using interviews, photos and archival footage to tell the story of the innovative General Motors executive whose dream of having his own car company crashed into a notorious scandal.
But they also weave in dramatizations of key moments from DeLorean's life, with Alec Baldwin playing the title character. And they include bits of meta-commentary by Baldwin and actress Morena Baccarin, who plays DeLorean's third wife, Cristina Ferrare, who break the fourth wall to talk about their characters.
The documentary has been applauded for its complexity and, as of Wednesday, was rated at more than 90 percent fresh by Rotten Tomatoes.
"It is a quintessentially American story of ambition and greed, with plot twists a fiction writer might consider outlandish," wrote the New York Times.
"It is true that no movie can tell the full story of a man's life. But movies like this one can tell us something important about our own," wrote Nell Minow of RogerEbert.com.
Argott and Joyce joined forces on "Framing John DeLorean" with Tamir Ardon, a film producer and lifelong DeLorean car buff who was determined to make the definitive film about the man.
Ardon was a fan of their 2009 film "The Art of the Steal," a documentary on the controversial move of the multi-billion-dollar Barnes art collection to downtown Philadelphia. He told the Free Press he knew after meeting the duo that he needed them to come on board his passion project.
Eventually, the pieces came together for the collaboration that will introduce DeLorean to a generation that knows him best as the guy behind the car featured in the 1985 hit "Back to the Future."
The documentary follows DeLorean's meteoric career as a muscle car pioneer at General Motors in the 1960s and his subsequent effort to create the DeLorean Motor Company, maker of one vehicle, the DeLorean DMC-12.
Desperate for money to keep his dream afloat, DeLorean was arrested in 1982 after a government sting operation; he was charged with trafficking cocaine. After what was called the trial of the century by some, he was acquitted in 1984. Not long after that, he was back in court on charges of skimming $9 million from investors to his car company. He was acquitted of those charges, too, but his reputation was shattered by then.
DeLorean died in 2005. At the time, he was living in a one-bedroom apartment and still working on a comeback.
Filmmakers have been trying for years to make a DeLorean movie. A decade ago, there was talk of four projects vying to be the one that moved forward. Argott says the very idea of those multiple unproduced films became an entry point into their documentary.
"Why is it that everybody in Hollywood is so intrigued by this story and why couldn't they pull it off?," he says.
Argott and Joyce set about a process that involved making the documentary portion first, then filming the re-created scenes over seven days. Then they edited the two parts together, along with the actor commentaries.
Joyce says they were fortunate that Baldwin and Baccarin were willing to take on the dual acting/musing roles.
"It's a tough sell to an actor, especially actors of the caliber we were lucky enough to get. ... They took a huge leap of faith with us."
And they discovered something remarkable. As Baldwin told USA Today, he had wanted to play DeLorean for years, and he actually got a phone call from the auto magnate a couple of decades ago.
DeLorean actually wanted Baldwin to play him.
"It was a very short conversation, and it never went anywhere. I don't know why these projects died," Baldwin said in the interview. "But whenever a living historic figure anoints you to do a project like that, that's a cool thing. I'm not really that intoxicated by any of the work I do, but when he called, I thought, 'That's pretty cool.' "
In a sense, DeLorean lived his life as if he were starring in a movie. "Image was everything to John," says Argott. "When you're trying to cultivate a specific image, especially someone like John who understood marketing, he was very aware of that stuff. Ultimately, the success that he garnered at GM, he was able to use that story" to launch the DeLorean Motor Company.
That was his genius, according to Argott, and his downfall. "He was a house of cards. They didn't have anything other than John. They had John's image, John's press clippings." When the financial side later collapsed, DeLorean was willing to do almost anything to keep it going, even entering the scheme that resulted in his arrest.
One of the most powerful dramatized scenes shows Baldwin as DeLorean obsessing over which tie to wear to court as his wife pleads with him to talk to their two young children, who are scared their father will go to prison.
That moment came from conversations with the real Cristina Ferrare, who was "a friend of the production," says Joyce.
"That was so powerful to hear from her perspective, we thought it would be good for one of those moments to show where John's head was at as the world was crumbling around him."
In that scene, DeLorean's daughter is played by Argott and Joyce's own young daughter.
"We joke that we have to give her something for therapy later. ...'You have to act really sad until we say cut!' " says Joyce with a laugh.
The directors say they left the movie feeling DeLorean was neither a hero nor a villain, just a complex person.
"John was certainly flawed, but I don't think he was all bad and I don't think he was all good. Now, more than ever, it's important to look at the gray areas of people," says Argott. "As the media and filmmakers in general, we're always tasked with retelling stories. That's a big responsibility and one film, frankly, is going to get it wrong. "
That is why "Framing John DeLorean" is three films in one.

'No one wants answers more than we do'; Va. Beach city manager disputes reports that gunman had previously been violent

Texto completo: VIRGINIA BEACH - The city's top leader on Thursday released a statement saying that police have uncovered no evidence that the gunman in the mass shooting two weeks ago at the Municipal Center got into fights or was confrontational at work.
City Manager Dave Hansen's statement directly disputes a New York Times report that said DeWayne Craddock had been involved in physical "scuffles" at work, including a "violent altercation on city grounds" before killing 12 people.
"The investigation has not uncovered evidence corroborating these allegations," Hansen wrote.
It was the first public statement from the city about the mass shooting investigation since it released the gunman's resignation email on June 3.
Hansen already disputed the allegations during news conferences in the days after the May 31 shooting. He has said Craddock had a "satisfactory" job performance, was not fired or asked to resign. Craddock, a nine-year engineer with the public utilities department, resigned via email the day he opened fire on his colleagues.
"In the aftermath of the most horrific tragedy in Virginia Beach, we understand the intense interest in finding out why one of our own conducted this deadly rampage," Hansen said. "No one wants answers more than we do. We, like the families, co-workers and community, want to understand the circumstances that played into this tragedy as best we can."
Jason Nixon, the husband of Kate Nixon, one of the shooting victims, has called for the city to be more transparent and to allow an independent investigation. Nixon and his attorney asked the city to release all records about the gunman.
The city has said it is too soon to conduct an external investigation. Hansen repeated that position Thursday, but left the door open for one.
"It is our unwavering commitment to conduct a complete, thorough, professional and responsible investigation," Hansen said. "Once we have the entire criminal investigation completed (both FBI and Police) and reviewed by the Commonwealth's Attorney, we can determine whether there are still unanswered questions that merit an independent investigation."
Kevin Martingayle, Nixon's attorney, said an external probe shouldn't be delayed because witnesses'memories fade with time. He said he doesn't think Hansen wants an independent investigation. Martingayle took issue with part of Hansen's statement that said the city has "demonstrated commitment to transparency."
"The city should have no problem releasing 100% of the information the city has about the shooter," Martingayle said. "That is what it means to have a demonstrated commitment to transparency. You can't say, 'we are committed to transparency' and not do the things we requested."
Jason Nixon revealed that Kate Nixon had told him she had concerns about Craddock and had written him up for his performance and attitude. She was also concerned a different employee who had been fired would come to work and start shooting on the day she died. Her husband urged her to consider taking a pistol to work that day, but Kate Nixon decided not to because it was against city policy.
The city can release all of Craddock's personnel information if it wanted to, but the law allows officials to withhold the information. Hansen said some people have speculated that Kate Nixon was a recipient of the resignation email. On Thursday, he said she was not.
The city released Craddock's emailed resignation, but redacted the send and receive times as well as the recipients. A city attorney said the entire document is considered a personnel record and is subject to redaction under the state's Freedom of Information Act. The Police Department asked the city attorney's office to keep those portions confidential, the attorney said.
Police have identified 240 witnesses they would like to interview, according to Hansen's statement. On Monday, the FBI finished collecting forensic evidence from Building 2 where the shooting happened. By Wednesday, police had released the building to the city for cleanup and remediation. The city has begun retrieving personal items from the building to return them.
Officials are also "securing paper and electronic files that may have relevance to this ongoing investigation," Hansen wrote.

Old radio magic will come alive in Marshfield

Texto completo: Radio, the theater of imagination, brought live drama to millions of American homes in the decades before the arrival of the television screen. This month the Talking Information Center, a regional reading service with thousands of daily listeners, is drawing on the techniques and traditions of live radio theater to share the old magic of the spoken word with both the visually impaired and the general audience.
Powered by its volunteers, the Marshfield-based station will stage a live production of “Rebecca," a taut psychological mystery penned by Daphne du Maurier in 1938, a dark year when families regularly gathered around their radios to listen to inspiring speeches by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
The Talking Information Center's main business is to provide live and recorded content for visually impaired and “print-impaired" listeners. Conditions such as advanced MS and Parkinson's disease can make the act of turning pages impossible, executive director Anna Dunbar said.
The service's volunteers read content from daily newspapers every day on the station. Readings from magazines and books also are broadcast. In addition to live readings, recorded readings are available at ticnetwork.org.
But entertainment such as live radio theater is also part of the package.
“We think it's important to provide well-rounded programming for our listeners," Dunbar said. “Our goal is to help our listeners to live autonomous, independent, and fulfilled lives."
Attending a radio theater production reveals how actors, directors, and sound-effects wizards put on their shows in radio's heyday, volunteer reader Mary Kay of Quincy said.
“They read from scripts, use several different mikes, have great sound effects," said Kay, who attended a recent production of “Arsenic and Old Lace," a film classic featuring Cary Grant's comic hamming.
Volunteer Karen Hayes of Kingston, a former Boston Globe staffer, is making her directorial debut in “Rebecca." After a career in journalism, Hayes looked to the reading service as an opportunity to give back. She began by reading newspaper stories live, then took part in the active radio theater program led by theater professional Eric Joseph, who has since departed.
Hayes has performed in eight productions, recently voicing the role of an elderly poisoner in “Arsenic."
Unlike film or TV, radio narrows an actor's focus. “It's all about the voice," she said.
But directing poses another challenge. Sound effects are crucial in radio dramas, Hayes said, and it's up to the director to produce the right sound at the right moment. The center's live productions use recorded sound effects, but nuance is important and timing is crucial. Doors are knocked hard or tapped softly. Footsteps may scamper with agitation, or amble slowly.
Both the general audience and the visually impaired are invited to attend the live broadcast in the center's studio at 130 Enterprise Drive on Thursday, June 27, at 7 p.m. Seating is limited; reserve a space by contacting Lorraine Bottelli at 781-834-4400 or e-mail lbottelli@ticnetwork.org. There's no admission fee, but donations are appreciated.
Radio theater productions also give the audience a chance to meet some of the center's dedicated volunteers. Relying entirely on volunteer readers, the service broadcasts 24 hours a day to 30,000 listeners statewide.
Edith Griffiths of Marshfield is one of those steady listeners who depend on the day-in, day-out efforts of volunteer readers to connect with the world of print.
“I could not do without it," she said. At age 93, blind in one eye and suffering from macular degeneration, her memory is strong. “I can tell you what's on from 8 in the morning until noon."
Here's the schedule devoted listener Griffiths has memorized: The Wall Street Journal at 8 a.m.; Boston Globe at 9 a.m.; Boston Herald at 10; Washington Post at 11; and New York Times at noon.
“Most of the people who read are angels of mercy," she said. “That's the way I feel. I really depend on it a lot. I do love the TIC. . . . I can't say enough about it. They do so much good, give so much time, and present it in a lovely manner."
Kay is one of those “angels," reading from the Globe for an hour on Wednesday mornings since her retirement a couple of years ago.
“My partner and I read it together as a team and it's one of my favorite times of the week," she said. Two readers share the hour because “you need to take a breath between stories."
Though not a fan, she throws in a sports story, recently reading one that focused on a controversial “big hit" in the Stanley Cup finals. “I don't think it's fair to listeners," she said, “to read only the stories that would interest me."
Listeners can hear the service's dedicated readers via a TIC radio receiver, or access the service online at ticnetwork.org by clicking on the “listen now" button; recorded readings and podcasts also are available through the website. You can also call 781-834-5836 on your phone; or get a smartphone app. Members of Android nation using Amazon Alexa and Google Home are invited to command, “Alexa (or Hey Google), play radio station Talking Information Center!" For more information on the range of options, see the website.

Texto completo: Grammy award nominee and one of the most respected comedians for over 35 years now, Jeff Foxworthy, will appear June 21 at the Inn of the Mountain Gods.
After over three decades, Foxworthy continues to make people laugh with antics about his life, his friends, and everyday adventures that make life more fun.
His career began decades ago when he was working for IBM and was entered in a stand-up comedy competition by his co-workers in 1984.
The contest was for working comedians; he had never performed on stage before.
Knowing that he had been entered into a contest, he went one night to the club to observe the other comedians, went home and wrote five minutes of material to perform live.
Early beginnings "I went back the next week and won the contest," he said. "That night totally changed my life and it was also the night that I met my wife."
Years later he would become recognized for his famous routines, "You Might Be A RedNeck if....", hosting the TV show "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?" and "Blue Collar TV."
Foxworthy was born in Georgia and as a child his family moved a lot.
Being "the new kid" at school, he was always quick to make jokes to gain acceptance from his peers.
"Everyone likes the funny kid. So, I started to make jokes in my classes and became the funny kid. I started doing this at a very early age," said Foxworthy.
When he was young, he saved his money to buy comedy records. He would memorize the lines and go to school and perform them. However, this was not much to the delight of his teachers or principals.
The first time he played the Fox theater in Atlanta, Georgia, he received a note while he was in his dressing room. The note was from his High School principal that read, "I cannot believe I am shelling out money to listen to the same kind of stuff that I tried to put a stop to."
He reflected about how many times he had been in that principal's office with the principal saying to him, "Who do you think you are? A comedian?"
"Well apparently so Mr. Gibbons. Apparently so," he said.
Family shenanigans Much of the comedy he writes is based on his life experiences. In a routine about cool whip containers becoming salad bowls he did many years ago; it was about his sister.
"We know, the family, that she had to have bought dishes at some point, but all we have ever seen are the cool whip tops and the jelly glasses. I know she has real dishes somewhere," he said.
His routines are about his life, especially his redneck jokes.
"I learned really quick, with my redneck jokes, that if I tried to make them up, they were not nearly as funny as when I wrote them about my life," he said.
Often, over the years, he has been asked if he believes that these jokes were ever offensive to others.
His reply is always the same. "It is quite the opposite. People brought me books with these jokes in it, and placed check marks next to same things they have done in their lives. At that point I knew there was no need for any research. It was pretty much just reporting on my own life," he said.
Recently, he played the voice of Smokey Bear in an ad celebrating the 75th year of the most successful ad campaign with an animal in it.
"It was cool to be the animated voice for Smokey Bear. You don't think about doing things like this early on in your career," he said.
In May, Foxworthy filmed a new show that will air on NBC this July. He will be one of the judges along with Kenan Thompson from SNL, and Chrissy Teigen.
"It was a gas. You never know when you are doing TV if you are going to mesh with the other people. My young daughter told me that she was worried to death that I would not fit in because Chrissy is so 'hip and so cool, and you are just dad.' However, Chrissy and I hit it off fabulously. Much to the shock of my daughter," he said.
Foxworthy said that he enjoyed working with Thompson and Teigen but was disappointed that the filming had been completed.
"We were sad when it was over. We were like, please God let this show get picked up for another year. This was fun," he said.
Foxworthy recalled his days as the host of "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?"
During one of the shows, a contestant had a second-grade grammar question about antonyms. She asked him to use it in a sentence. Indeed, he did, with a reply of, "My aunt and them came over for Thanksgiving dinner."
Quality time with family When on the road, he never thinks of his shows being tours. To him it has been a continuous journey through his lifetime.
"Tour implies that it ends at some point. One tour blends into the next one. I have just been on the road. I am not complaining at all. In the past 35 years there has just never been a gap. The longest I have ever gone without doing a show has been maybe three weeks," he said.
Foxworthy performs mostly on the weekends now giving him more time to spend with his family.
"I recently got to BBQ for family. The girls came over, and then my wife said to me 'it was really cool to have you home on a weekend.' "
Recently, he was interviewed for a Biography that will air soon.
"I thought to myself that is a little bit scary when you give someone permission to tell your life story. They did a really nice job. Everyone that has called me said that they cried at leas three times," he said.
Always jotting down a joke Foxworthy wrote three children's books some years ago. Two of them made the New York Times Best Seller list.
"When I was writing them, I kept finding out that some of the lines were a syllable too long. They were not turning out like Dr. Seuss books that have a musical rhythm to them. How could I say the same thing I had just written but take a syllable out? After a week of it, I though to myself, no wonder Dr. Seuss books are such a big deal. This is hard work," he said.
"Whenever I write, as I have done for so many years, I write on a note pad first then I type it on my computer. There is just something about the act of physically writing it. A connection between the mind, the eye, and the hand. You have a 70 percent chance of memorizing something when you write it. For a comic, I must remember it. I write every bit of my material by hand," he said.
Fulfilling a dream Foxworthy is a very modest man. His house isn't filled or adorned with memorabilia from his life-long career.
"On a shelf, by the kitchen, there is a picture of me sitting in the chair talking to Johnny Carson, and he has his head back as he is laughing. I tell people, that is all I ever wanted to do. I made Johnny Carson laugh. I remember going home that night and thinking, I have no plan now. That is all I ever wanted to do. What am I going to do next?" he said.
Being on the Tonight Show with Carson was one of his biggest goals ever, one he was successful at.
"It was something that I had always wanted to do and because of Rodeny Dangerfield and Jay Leno, I was able to do it," he said.
"Comedy really is a diverse thing and stand up is what I love the best. I have been blessed. But, it is like in writing books. I had to learn how to write something without performing it. I have notebooks full of people I have drawn with funny captions on them," he said.

Texto completo: In response to the reports President Trump's campaign revealed to him he is behind in the internal polling they conducted, Trump called the polls "phony" and asserted he likes to tell the truth.
The New York Times reported Trump told his advisers to say that he was winning in all the polls after finding out he did poorly in the 17 state poll that was run.
"I don’t believe the polls. There’s no way [Joe Biden] beats me in Texas," Trump told ABC's George Stephanopoulos.
"But even your own polls shows you’re behind, don’t they," Stephanopoulos asked.
Trump replied, "No my polls show I’m winning everywhere."iFrame ObjectWhen Stephanopoulos asked about the polls where Trump is losing in many states, Trump said they don't exist.
"I’m losing in 15 out of 17 states? Those polls don’t exist. I just was given a meeting with my pollster, I frankly don’t even believe in pollsters if you want to know the truth. You just run a campaign and whatever it is, it is. But I just had a meeting with someone that’s a pollster, and I’m winning everywhere," he said.
Trump then asked to go off-the-record in order to call his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, to find out more about the polls.TweetStephanopoulos asked Trump the next day why the news of bad polling bothers him so much.
"Because it’s untrue. I like the truth. You know, I’m actually a very honest guy," Trump said.
In their analysis, the Washington Post states Trump has made 10,796 false or misleading claims since being in office.

Alleged New Zealand mosque shooter pleads not guilty

Texto completo: The man who allegedly killed 51 and injured others at two New Zealand mosques in March pleaded not guilty Thursday.
The charges include 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder, and one count of terrorism.
Psychiatric reports ordered during his previous court appearance found that the accused was mentally sound to enter the plea.Tweet
The Christchurch shooter would face life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted, a penalty that has never been given in New Zealand. The longest previous sentence was 30 years without parole, given to a man who killed three people, the New York Times reports.
Additionally, New Zealand will continue to approach the trial in a manner that restricts the defendant from taking advantage of it as a platform.
New Zealand's news outlets have agreed to avoid spreading any white supremacist views on their platforms throughout the case.
At his court appearance Friday, the defendant appeared via an audiovisual link from the country's only maximum security prison in Auckland, the country's largest city.
Members of the gallery reportedly gasped when the announcement was made. Seating was reserved for survivors and their families, to the point where an additional courtroom was used for overflow seating of about 140 people.
“The logistics of this case will be a nightmare” for officials, said Chris Gallavin, a law professor at Massey University in Palmerston North. He also said that heightened security would be required at the court throughout this trial. “All of that is going to be incredibly disruptive for the flow of an already overworked court."
Between the Facebook Live video during the attack, which appeared to be released by the defendant, and his online manifesto, Gallavin struggles to see what kind of defense will be used in the case.
Trials in New Zealand typically take place a year from the arrest. However, the judge said that because of the case's complexity, both sides will be given more time to prepare, much to the disappointment of most of the victims.
A procedural hearing in August will be the next step in the case.

Texto completo: The Justice Department intends to interview two CIA officers for its review of the origins of the Russia investigation.
U.S. Attorney John Durham's team wants to talk to at least one senior counterintelligence official and a senior analyst who examined Russia's role in meddling in the 2016 election, according to the New York Times.
Although formal requests have not yet been submitted, CIA Director Gina Haspel informed senior officials that her agency will cooperate, but work to ensure that sources and methods and intelligence provided by allies would be protected.
Attorney General William Barr tasked Durham, a U.S. attorney from Connecticut, with leading the inquiry focused on the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into President Trump's campaign, which the FBI began in the summer of 2016.
American officials say Barr is interested in understanding how the CIA coordinated with the FBI and how the agency came to its conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the order to sow discord in the election to help Trump and undermine his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.
The review is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity he can take prosecutorial action. Top CIA officials are said to be anxious by the federal prosecutor's efforts.
The Justice Department's examination of the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign has been cheered by Republicans and criticized by Democrats. After Trump granted Barr sweeping powers to declassify secret information, and instructed a handful of agencies to cooperate with his investigation, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff panned the effort as a "disturbing" scheme to politicize intelligence.
A DOJ letter written to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., outlining the scope of its investigation said the review is "broad in scope and multifaceted" and includes a look at actions both by the U.S. government and by foreigners.

Texto completo: If impeachment proceedings advance in the House of Representatives, at least two members of West Virginia's delegation will not be on board.
Republican Reps. Carol Miller and Alex Mooney said they remain supportive of President Donald Trump after reading Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 elections and possible obstruction of justice from the president.
The report covers Russia's success in interfering in the presidential election to support Trump via email hacks and social media campaigns, how the Trump campaign encouraged and amplified the effort, and a series of 11 attempts by the president to potentially stymie the investigation.
"The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels, the report states. "These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General's recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony.
Through his spokeswoman, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., declined an interview and would not say whether he read the report.
Tom Moran, a Miller spokesman, said "of course the congresswoman has read the report and she "is not going to spend another moment discussing the political smear campaign against President Trump.
Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., said he opposes impeachment, as well as any sort of congressional condemnation or censure of Trump. While the report neither exonerates nor indicts Trump, Mooney said after skimming through its entirety, he thinks impeachment should be put to an up-or-down vote and left in the past.
"Reports aren't done to prove somebody didn't do something, it's hard to prove a negative, he said. "So the Democrats are harping on the whole thing about, Well, he didn't say definitively there was no obstruction of justice.' But the goal of the report wasn't to prove something didn't happen.
Mueller's investigation led to 34 indictments. This includes the conviction of Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman; a guilty plea from Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney; a guilty plea from Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser; a guilty plea from Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign official; and indictments against Roger Stone, Trump's adviser, and several others.
However, Mooney said crimes committed in tandem with Trump's campaign shouldn't be held against Trump himself.
At least 60 House members (only one Republican) have spoken in favor of impeaching Trump, according to a whip count by The New York Times. In a show of escalation this week, the House Judiciary Committee struck a deal with the Department of Justice to obtain evidence gathered by Mueller's team, and fielded testimony from John Dean, President Richard Nixon's attorney who served as a key witness in the congressional Watergate hearings.
In the Senate, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he read the report but declined an interview on the potential for impeachment. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she has "read the extended summary and a lot of the background, but not the full report.
Capito said she plans to read it, and that she should read it.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump desató críticas y burlas en redes sociales por presumir un papel en blanco como muestra de que tiene un documento firmado por el Gobierno del mexicano Andrés Manuel López Obrador , donde se contempla un “plan secreto”, como parte de los acuerdos para evitar aplicar aranceles a México.
“Voy a dejar a México que lo anuncie en el momento adecuado” , expresó el mandatario al tiempo que sacó un papel doblado, aparentemente en blanco, el cual no mostró a la prensa.
El Gobierno mexicano ha negado que haya un acuerdo secreto.
President Trump pulls a piece of paper from his jacket he says is one page of a secret agreement with Mexico: "I am going to let Mexico do the announcement at the right time."

What Trump Can Learn From James Carville; The Clinton adviser's 1992 mantra, 'The economy, stupid,' nicely sums up the president's strength.

Texto completo: As George Stephanopoulos tells the story in his memoir of Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential race, strategist James Carville was just trying to keep the campaign on message. He scribbled a few lines on a whiteboard and stuck it to a pillar in the middle of the room at campaign headquarters. One of the lines read: "The economy, stupid."
The White House would do well to remember that phrase as President Trump's re-election campaign revs up. If the president "indefinitely suspended" his threat of placing tariffs on Mexican imports in part due to pressure from fellow Republicans in Congress, they did him a favor. Like everyone else, economic migrants are in search of a higher return on their labor. To the extent that a worker from Mexico can find satisfactory employment at home, he is less likely to head here. A trade war with Mexico would undermine the Mexican economy and create another incentive for workers to head north. Rather than stemming illegal border crossings, tariffs could well exacerbate them.
Mr. Trump's frustration with Democratic inaction in the face of an obvious humanitarian crisis at the border is both understandable and justified. Democrats well know that our asylum system is being gamed, but won't work with the White House to address the problem because they believe the chaos helps them politically. Meanwhile, migrant families from Central America are showing up with young children who will be detained for no more than 20 days and then released into society along with their parents.
And as Julia Preston of the Marshall Project has reported, most of them won't show up for hearings to adjudicate their claims. "Of nearly 100,000 parents and children who have come before the courts since 2014, most asking for refuge, judges have issued rulings in at least 32,500 cases, court records show," wrote Ms. Preston, a former immigration reporter for the New York Times. "The majority—70 percent—ended with deportation orders in absentia, pronounced by judges to empty courtrooms."
Because the U.S. shares such a long boundary with a significantly poorer country, some amount of illicit immigration is inevitable. We could and should do a much better job of managing the illegal flow, but ending it outright anytime soon is a pipe dream. The Journal reported this week that "the number of job openings exceeded the number of unemployed Americans by the largest margin on record in April, signaling difficulty for employers to find workers in a historically tight market." In raw numbers, there were 7.5 million unfilled jobs but only 5.8 million people seeking work, and the worker shortage has been growing, not shrinking. Labor shortages in the U.S. serve as a powerful magnet for foreign nationals, and history demonstrates that when they can't come through the front door, they'll try the back way. Guest-worker programs would do far more to address this problem than imposing tariffs.
Trade wars also mean higher prices for U.S. consumers and uncertainty for businesses. Companies become more hesitant to bring on new employees or invest in additional equipment. Tariffs adversely affect the flow of goods, services and capital, which can translate into a drag on economic growth.
It's a scenario that ought to be of particular concern to Mr. Trump, because his oversight of the economy has long been a strong suit of his presidency. Surveys consistently have his overall approval rating muddled in the low to mid-40s, but his stewardship of the economy—which includes historically low unemployment across racial and ethnic groups—has generally polled much better. In a CNN poll released last month, 56% of respondents said he was doing a good job on the economy, a new high for the president.
This record gives Mr. Trump a golden opportunity to expand his message to voters beyond his base, which is Joe Biden & Co.'s worst nightmare. Citing a national SurveyMonkey poll from May, the Times reported last week that black Democrats "are significantly more likely than whites to call jobs and the economy the most important issue facing the nation." One black woman told the paper that Democrats running for president hadn't focused enough on jobs and other core economic issues, adding that if the candidates were really listening to black voters, "you'd be hearing more about economic opportunities. . . . It's almost like they don't get it." Ouch!
Mr. Trump has spent a fair amount of time in front of mostly white audiences boasting about what he's done for black people on the jobs front, and it's not a good look. A more fruitful approach might be for the president to visit some low-income minority communities in places like Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia, listen to their concerns, engage them in a way that Democrats are not, and talk about what strong economic growth has enabled blacks and others to do for themselves. If there was ever a time for Donald Trump to be channeling James Carville, it's now.

CEOs sign letter against abortion restrictions

Texto completo: More than 180 CEOs signed an open letter opposing state efforts to restrict reproductive rights, as business leaders weigh how to most effectively exert pressure on abortion bans.
Square Chief Executive and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey as well as fashion icon Diane von Furstenberg and others wrote that restrictions on abortion access threatens the economic stability of their employees and customers, and makes it harder to build a diverse workforce and recruit talent.
The letter, which appeared Monday as a full-page ad in The New York Times, marks the business community's latest foray into a polarizing societal issue. The chief executives of Bloomberg News, Atlantic Records, Yelp and Warby Parker, among others, aligned themselves with such national organizations as Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights.
The move also comes nearly four weeks after Alabama signed off on the nation's most restrictive abortion law. Other states, including Georgia, have adopted similar laws.
"As anti-choice politicians are escalating attacks on these fundamental freedoms, we encourage the entire business community to join us in protecting access to reproductive health care in the critical months and years to come," Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement.
Georgia's law, signed last month by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, bans abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which typically occurs near the six-week mark and before many women even know they are pregnant. Alabama banned virtually all abortions in the state - including for victims of rape and incest. Anti-abortion supporters expect that the laws will ignite a broader state-by-state strategy to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to take a new look at Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.
Several industries have moved to exert pressure on states that limit access to abortion. Some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Walt Disney and WarnerMedia, have suggested that they might pull their business from Georgia if its new law survives a court challenge. Filmmaking is a $9.5 billion industry in Georgia that created more than 92,000 jobs last year, according to a McKinsey study.
But even among the law's staunch objectors, there isn't a clear consensus on how companies should respond. Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost Georgia's gubernatorial race last year, is urging Hollywood to keep its business in the state, saying a boycott would only strip working-class people of their jobs with no guarantee it would reverse the new law.
Instead, Abrams and other business leaders are launching a "#StayAndFight" campaign encouraging Hollywood powerhouses to put their money behind political groups challenging the state's law. Film industry workers are also organizing against any potential boycott and are raising money for a challenge to the law by the ACLU.
Businesses that threaten to take their business elsewhere often have the sharpest influence, said Timothy Coombs, a corporate communications expert at Texas A&M University. There may be an initial debate about leaving a country or state altogether, or trying to "change the system from the inside."
Coombs cited companies that cut ties with Indiana over a 2015 law, signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, that could have made it easier for religious conservatives to deny service to gay couples. At the time, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com, said he would cancel all company events in the state. Jeremy Stoppelman, the founder of Yelp, said that "it is unconscionable to imagine that Yelp would create, maintain, or expand a significant business presence in any state that encouraged discrimination."
"To say, 'Oh, we're going to stay and engage,' that's usually pretty hollow," Coombs said. "To say, 'OK, we're going to boycott,' companies need to know that most of their stakeholders are going to support that position."

Texto completo: The authorities in Iran have barred the Tehran-based correspondent for The New York Times from working for the past four months, the newspaper said Monday.
The correspondent, Thomas Erdbrink, a Netherlands citizen, has reported for The Times from Iran since 2012. He resides in Tehran but has been unable to work since late February, when his press credential was revoked.
The Times decided to make the issue public after recent speculation and comments on social media. Mr. Erdbrink's absence from the news report has become increasingly conspicuous because of escalating tensions between the Iranian authorities and the United States.
Officials of Iran's Foreign Ministry have repeatedly assured The Times that Mr. Erdbrink's credential would soon be restored but have offered no explanation for the delays or for why it was revoked, said the Times international editor, Michael Slackman. He added that there are some indications this will be resolved soon.
Mr. Erdbrink's wife, Newsha Tavakolian, an Iranian citizen and award-winning photographer represented by the Magnum photo agency, also has been denied permission to work, The Times said. She has shot for The Times and other news organizations since 2001.
It is rare, but not unheard-of, for governments to suspend or invalidate the credentials of foreign correspondents, which are required for them to work without penalty. Mr. Erdbrink has temporarily lost his credential previously.
The Trump administration, which abandoned the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran last year, has reimposed sanctions that the agreement had rescinded, putting enormous new pressure on Iran's economy. The administration also has moved to strengthen the American military presence in the Persian Gulf in response to what it has called increased Iranian threats.
The Times has been one of the few American news organizations to report from Iran in recent years. Mr. Erdbrink, a fluent Persian speaker, has written from many parts of the country.
Before joining The Times, Mr. Erdbrink reported from Iran for The Washington Post. His successor at The Post, Jason Rezaian, an American citizen, was imprisoned for 544 days by the Iranian authorities for what the newspaper called absurd accusations of espionage. He was released in 2016 as part of a prisoner exchange when the nuclear agreement took effect, and wrote a book about his ordeal.

Texto completo: Grand Ronde tribal citizen Mia Prickett used to assume she was reading unbiased reporting in the tribe's newspaper, Smoke Signals. But all that changed when the tribal council disenrolled her and more than 80 of her relatives in 2013, effectively taking away their tribal citizenship.
"I had no reason to think that council or anybody had an undue influence on the paper," Prickett, then a journalism student at the University of Oregon, said. She describes herself as naive for believing that the tribe's newspaper reported all the facts and considered different points of view. She was proved wrong when Smoke Signals failed to tell her family's side of the story.
Grand Ronde tribal leaders have come a long way from dictating news content in the tribal newspaper. In December 2016, the tribal council passed an independent press ordinance, making it one of just three tribes the Native American Journalists Association, or NAJA, recognizes for having a viable press ordinance. (Full disclosure: HCN Associate Editor Tristan Ahtone is president of NAJA and was not involved in the editing of this story.)
A majority of Native media outlets are owned by tribal governments. That is problematic, because ownership means tribal leaders can, and often do, control content. In a 2018 NAJA press freedom survey, 83% of respondents said stories about tribal government affairs sometimes, frequently or always go unreported due to censorship.
Chris Mercier was among the Grand Ronde tribal members who noticed Smoke Signals' failure to tell the full story about the disenrollments. Mercier, who earned a journalism degree from the University of Oregon in 1998, became a key advocate for tribal press freedom and was elected to the Grand Ronde Tribal Council in 2004.
In March, Staci Cummins and Anne Loyer, two students, from Harvard University's Nation Building class, and I discussed freedom of the press with the Grand Ronde editorial board and staff. The tribe's disenrollment debacle ultimately spurred the paper to seek independence.
Smoke Signals editor Dean Rhodes remembers the pre-ordinance days, when he followed council leaders' orders just to keep his job. "If we had written any story that would have even been close to being viewed as sympathetic to the cause of Mia's family, Siobhan and I would have probably been fired," he said. His comment led the editorial board members seated at the table to erupt in laughter. "I don't even think that's probably," said Prickett. "I would say that would be 100 percent."
The Grand Ronde independent press ordinance declares that Smoke Signals must be "free from any undue influence, and free from any particular political interest." The ordinance, which was enacted 29 months ago, has kept council members and administration staff from interfering with content. "They've been totally taken out of the equation," Rhodes said.
Editorial board member Monty Herron recalled adjusting to the new independence, reminding council members: "Hey, by the way, you guys need to hire your own publicist again, because we're not doing your job for you anymore," said Herron. "We're not going to be the mouthpiece of the council." In 2018, the tribe hired its own deputy press secretary.
The influence of tribal leaders on tribe-owned media is apparent in a number of cases, according to a preliminary Red Press Initiative survey from 2018. In reply to a question about how government officials influence media coverage, one person wrote, "Tribal officials have complete control over our tribal media." Another noted: "Again, a lot of news is pretty much censored by tribal administrators and entities. We need more independent journalists who can report on the news without watering down stories or following the dictates of tribal governments."
One example of an independent press is the Navajo Times. I recently interviewed Navajo Times Editor Tom Arviso about freedom of the press and his role in securing editorial and financial independence from the Navajo Nation Council. The newspaper now stands as an independent, for-profit corporation of the Navajo Nation, paying its own bills through advertising revenue, subscriptions and display ads. "It's not the government that owns the paper," said Arviso. "It's the Navajo people."
May marks Arviso's 31st year of employment at the Navajo Times. In the course of his career, he has faced bomb threats, been physically threatened, been suspended - even seen the newspaper shut down for months. He and his staff have reported on tribal corruption, including the imprisonment of former Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald, who was convicted of riot, bribery, fraud, extortion and corruption.
The New York Times described the Navajo Times as an "aggressive newspaper" whose stories led to the resignation of Navajo Chairman Albert Hale in 1998. Hale faced potential criminal charges for misspending tribal money.
Grand Ronde tribal leaders took a critical step to better inform their tribal citizens with uncensored news when they enacted an independent press ordinance. By doing so, they have raised their level of accountability to those who matter most - the tribal citizens who elected them.

Texto completo: In the beginning, Bryan and his bandmates learned the ropes just like every other fledgling band in a 1980s college town: playing club and party gigs, making demo tapes, touring around the home state and region whenever possible. But Bryan also remembers getting a leg up from Musician magazine, a monthly publication that was a must-read for both aspiring performers and die-hard music fans at that time.
“Every month, they would have one feature piece on how to make it as a young band,” recalls Bryan, speaking by phone from South Carolina, where he still lives. “It would be like, how to send your demo tapes out, or how to get gigs, or how to add merch to your shows for extra money.”
Decades later, after Bryan and his bandmates put Hootie on hold while singer Darius Rucker pursued a second career as a country singer, he put those lessons to good use. Taking a job at the College of Charleston in 2009, Bryan helped create a music industry program at the school, something that’s now a point of pride for him. “It’s some really great knowledge that I wish I would have had when I was in college,” he says.
Bryan stopped teaching last fall for an auspicious reason: For the first time in a decade, Hootie & the Blowfish are recording and touring again. They made an album that’s due out later this year and began a string of about 50 U.S. dates a couple of weeks ago. The tour comes to the Austin360 Amphitheater on June 13.
“It’s not a reunion, in the sense that we never broke up,” Bryan says, explaining that the band has continued to do a few shows every year in South Carolina, mostly for charity causes. “But we haven’t made an album or toured in a decade, so it is a reconvening of sorts.”
The new material won’t be part of the set list on the current tour, save for an introductory single, Bryan says. The band will hit high points from “Cracked Rear View,” which topped 20 million in sales, as well as other hits and a few choice covers. They’ll also touch on a couple of high points from Rucker’s impressive solo career.
THE NARRATIVE that has been building since the band announced its 2019 plans late last year is one of re-evaluation and even contrition. A January article in Esquire featured the melodramatic headline “How our cruelty killed Hootie & the Blowfish — and damaged our souls.” Last week, The New York Times chimed in with a piece that suggested “it’s time for a reassessment” of the band’s legacy.
It’s true that the group’s rise in the mid-1990s led to a significant backlash. An unabashed pop band that arose just as the early-’90s grunge wave was cresting, Hootie ran counter to the hip cynicism of the Lollapalooza age. Whether that was a good thing ultimately depended on the attitudes of the listeners.
“A couple of the interviews I’ve been doing recently, they asked about that,” Bryan says. He welcomes the new perspective, citing the Esquire piece as especially “cool and positive. It was as if to say, ‘Hey, maybe that backlash thing is no longer; let’s start fresh with these guys.’”
It’s easy to do so, for several reasons. For starters, context is everything. The popular music landscape of 2019 spreads out in so many directions that Hootie’s sound and style simply seem like part of a much broader tapestry today. Further, fans of pop singers such as Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith seem likely to appreciate Hootie’s music. (To wit: Sheeran co-wrote a song on the band’s upcoming album.)
And Rucker’s impressive success in the country realm — he’s had four No. 1 albums and a half-dozen chart-topping singles — clearly has primed the band for crossover appeal. It’s telling that the new album is coming out on Universal Music Group Nashville, not the label’s New York or Los Angeles hubs. Country music’s gradual move toward pop music makes Hootie’s sound perhaps more suited for that audience in 2019. Rucker went so far as to suggest to The New York Times that “‘Cracked Rear View’ would have to be a country record today.’”
Simple nostalgia for the ’90s, arguably America’s last great decade, may play a part as well. “I think their appeal can also be found in the same sphere that sends people to ‘Friends’ reruns each night,” said a fan who first saw the group in their formative mid-’80s years at the University of South Carolina. (Indeed, one of Hootie’s bigger hits was a cover of 54-40’s “I Go Blind” that appeared on the 1995 “Friends” soundtrack CD.)
AND YET this “reappraisal” of Hootie in some ways feels as awkward as the backlash did back then — precisely because the backlash was so hollow in the first place.
I was fortunate, perhaps, to have encountered Hootie & the Blowfish differently than most fans did when the band first hit the radio in the summer of 1994. The previous fall, I’d been on a driving trip around the Southeast, and a friend suggested I stop by the office of Dick Hodgin, who managed several bands. Hootie, as it turns out, was one of them.
I left the office with a handful of his bands’ cassettes, including two Hootie demos stamped with 1991 copyright dates. They got a lot of play in my rental car over the next few days. That’s how I first heard “Hold My Hand” and “Let Her Cry” and other songs that ended up on “Cracked Rear View.”
So when an Atlantic Records publicist called a few months later to pitch a story on them, I was already on board. It didn’t take a genius to recognize that Darius Rucker was a major talent as a singer. Beyond that, these guys just wrote really good pop tunes, played with a near-perfect balance of polish and energy. And they were willing to dig deeper: On “Drowning,” Rucker sang forcefully, “Why is there a rebel flag hanging from the state house walls?” — two decades before South Carolina removed the flag from its grounds.
What I didn’t know, but which was clear to their legions of fans in the Southeast who’d been seeing them play the club circuit there for years, was how rooted they were in the 1980s alternative-rock scene. The sad irony to the mid-’90s hipster disavowal of Hootie was that Rucker, Bryan, bassist Dean Felber and drummer Jim Sonefeld revered many of the same underground bands as their detractors.
That single from the “Friends” soundtrack should have been a clue: “I Go Blind” was on 54-40’s debut album from 1986, but the great Canadian band was known in the U.S. only to those who were actively seeking out non-mainstream music. (In our interview, Bryan noted that he recently found VHS footage of the band playing another 54-40 song, “Baby Ran,” at a mid-’80s live show. The footage surfaced while the band was digging through historical material for a documentary film on the band that’s in the works.)
As “Cracked Rear View” was blowing up, the band hired Peter Holsapple of acclaimed North Carolina band the dB’s as a sideman, another signal of where their hearts were. Holsapple, who’d previously had a similar sideman stint with R.E.M., is with the band on the current tour, alongside longtime percussionist Gary Greene and multi-instrumentalist Garry Murray, who has played with Rucker in recent years.
In 1996, Hootie teamed with Austin native Nanci Griffith to record “Gravity of the Situation” on a tribute album to brilliant singer-songwriter Vic Chesnutt, whose early-1990s indie-label albums were among the most idiosyncratically beautiful records of the era. They invited Griffith to sing that song with them when they appeared on “Austin City Limits” in 1999. (Bryan later launched a similar PBS series in South Carolina called “Live at Charleston Music Hall” that won regional Emmy Awards.)
More evidence of the band’s bona fides came in 2000 with “Scattered, Smothered and Covered,” an odds-and-sods collection that included Hootie’s versions of songs by New York band the Silos and North Carolina producer-musician Don Dixon — and two by Austin’s own ’80s alt-rockers the Reivers, “Araby” and “Almost Home.”
Much of this stemmed from Bryan’s lifelong tendency to keep his ear very close to the ground. He’s like Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top in that respect. It’s no coincidence that when I first launched an alternative-country magazine called No Depression in the mid-1990s, both Gibbons and Bryan got in touch within the first couple of years, when we were still printing just a few thousand copies.
And when I ask Bryan about his band’s past visits to Austin, it’s not huge concerts that come to mind first, but a gig at Liberty Lunch before the band’s big breakthrough.
“I have a really fond memory of that show,” he says. “There were only 30 people there, but that was my first time here, and we were playing a real club in Austin. I went to Strait Music and bought a 1972 Fender Thinline Tele that I still have, and I love dearly.”
Liberty Lunch co-owner J’Net Ward remembers that night as well. “Darius said he wanted to show us they could draw a crowd,” she recalls, “and they came back the next year and played to a packed house.”
HOOTIE’S HOMETOWN, at least, always seemed to get it. Among the factoids you’ll find on the band’s Wikipedia page is this one: “In 2009, Hootie & the Blowfish performed live in a ballet which chronicled their rise and success in the 1990s.”
“This is true,” says Bryan, who also spent time producing South Carolina bands during the Hootie hiatus. “The City of Columbia Ballet scripted a story of our career to that point and cast a ballet to tell the story. They had dancers that looked like each one of us, and then a bunch of other dancers who played everything else. We were the band in the orchestra, so we played the whole time; I actually didn’t see a lot of the show because I was playing.
“But I give them credit — they went ahead and wrote it before they came to us. They were like, ‘We really want to do this, and here’s how we see it going.’ We were impressed that they took it seriously. But it wasn’t like they were trying to take advantage of us. They were just like, ‘We want to pay homage to you.’”

Texto completo: National business and lifestyle magazine Forbes has published an article about Cincinnati "roaring back."
Travel writer John Oseid penned the latest national article showing favor to Cincinnati
Prior articles from the New York Times and other national media websites in recent years have documented an ongoing love for the Queen City.
The New York Times and "Destination Hotlist" by American Express Essentials both put Cincinnati on their top 10 places to visit in 2018.
Into, an online magazine launched by meet-up app Grinder, placed Cincinnati on its 2018 Travel List as well.
Art deco architecture of Cincinnati is Oseid's focus in the June 3 Forbes article. He leads off with a visit to the offerings skyline-dominating Carew Tower from the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza to the heights of the observation deck views.
The Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal is reviewed as an art deco "temple" by Oseid. He points out the museum is the home to Nancy & David Wolf Holocaust & Humanity Center.
The Over-the-Rhine neighborhood gets a mention, but so does Camp Washington and the lesser-known architectural delight of the arcade inside Dixie Terminal at 49 E. Fourth St. Downtown.
This was Oseid's second travel review about Cincinnati in two weeks. Oseid focused a May 22 article on 21C Museum Hotel Cincinnati. The headline called the Downtown hotel "An Art Mecca with Pillows." The article explored art within 21C and gave a nod to Boca, a fine dining restaurant around the corner from the hotel.
Cincinnati Art Museum was the subject of an April 17 Forbes article by Oseid focusing on the now-concluded 1900 Paris exhibit and the No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man exhibit showing until Sept. 2
The rotunda at The Cincinnati Museum Center showcases the spaciousness of the former train station.

Your home won't fund retirement

Texto completo: On April 5, USA TODAY reporter Paul Davidson wrote a piece on the big gains folks reaped buying starter homes as housing markets rebounded from the long 2006-11 housing crash.
Buying in low-cost suburbs, folks could upgrade to larger "forever" homes in just several years. They used starter-home gains to fund bigger down payments. It was a great financial win for young families. It also supports one of the most controversial things I've ever said here: Owning a home is wonderful, but don't bank on real estate as your chief retirement investment.
People looking to real estate today for retirement riches often point to those big post-crisis gains. Trouble is, you can't buy past performance. And the recent past probably isn't a blueprint for the next 10, 20, 30 years or more.
After the housing bubble popped in 2006, prices tanked for five years, bottoming in 2011. Returns since that time are a near-perfect V-shaped recovery -- a point that a chart in Davidson's story shows. As a general but not perfect rule, what gets hammered the hardest on the way down rebounds the strongest. Starter homes were punished most in the crash. So they rallied most in the recovery. But this bounce effect has largely matured.
Like all assets, home prices move on supply and demand. The key to both? Location, location, location.
The housing market isn't uniform nationally or even within the same city. Anyone looking to hop onto San Francisco's property ladder or other coastal hot spot knows this. Coloradoans may have scored entry-level homes for roughly $200,000 in 2012, but no such luck for would-be first-time homebuyers in Californian metropolises or New York. The cost of Silicon Valley starter homes can come close to $2 million, depending on style and neighborhood. That's your first clue real estate is a geographically fragmented game.
Even where it's cheaper to buy, eye-popping gains aren't guaranteed. If you buy where new construction is limited and job opportunities are humming, keeping supply low relative to demand, you may do very well.
But what if you buy where construction eventually outpaces job creation and population growth? What if a city is focused on one or two industries, and what if they fall from favor and fizzle? What happens to San Jose prices if tech crashes and burns? What of Houston when the energy industry hits the skids? What if your neighborhood school system takes a perceived quality dive relative to nearby communities?
Counting on real estate for your retirement nest egg is a very long-term bet on weak real estate development plus good economic fortune – both in one location. You're betting your town will attract people with good jobs and maintain schools long-term –and that politicians will limit new development. You're betting some hot new suburb won't steal your hamlet's thunder.
Instead, if you see a home purchase as merely guaranteeing a roof over your head and protecting against rising rents, things look different. You don't shun a neighborhood because more housing construction might constrain property values. If all the jobs move, you can too, even if that means having to rent for a few years. You needn't stress about timing your purchase just right or not picking the highest-flying neighborhood. You can simply go where you and your family feel most at home –whether it's a green suburban neighborhood or a hip urban townhouse.
Homes are great. Banking on them for retirement income isn't.

Texto completo: "City Of Girls" by Elizabeth Gilbert; Riverhead (480 pages, $28)
At the start of Elizabeth Gilbert’s much-anticipated new novel, “City of Girls,” the year is 1940, and Vivian Morris is a Vassar dropout shipped off by her well-to-do family to live with her offbeat Aunt Peg in Manhattan. To a pretty 19-year-old with no discernible ambition but an eye for all that’s beautiful, sensuous and frivolous – “a girl so freshly hatched there was practically yolk in my hair” – her arrival in the big city practically shocks her into consciousness, propelling her into a life worth telling about.
Vivian’s Aunt Peg owns the Lily Playhouse Theatre, a “grandiose” yet “crumbling” old palace that puts on schlock for its working-class neighborhood audience. Still, this world dazzles Vivian. The Lily attracts a wondrous hodgepodge of misfits: a tough-as-nails stunner of a showgirl named Celia; a cantankerous playwright who greets each day with doom and gloom; and a friend of Peg’s, Edna Parker Watson, an esteemed stage actress with impeccable style, who finds refuge at the Lily with her handsome lout of a husband after their London home is reduced to rubble during the Blitz.
Living above the theater in a fully furnished apartment – the stuff of fairy tales for young people moving to New York now – Vivian embarks on a series of wanton adventures glued to the side of fast-living Celia, soaking up gin and male attention in one swanky nightclub after another.
Months after Vivian’s arrival, the Lily puts on a play that’s worthy of Edna Parker Watson’s star power. That play – “City of Girls” – reverses the fortunes of the shambling theater and turns it into a destination for New York’s elite. Gilbert unfurls the premiere of the play in rapturous, breathless chapters that, in a tour de force of literary mimicry, are punctuated with reviews by Brooks Atkinson from The New York Times and Walter Winchell for the now-defunct New York Daily Mirror.
The good days last just a little bit longer. When reflecting upon her adventures in show business and sex, Vivian is so prone to hyperbole she can appear to be hooked on hallucinogens; to her, everyone and everything in her new life is cranked up to impossible extremes: New York City is a synapse-frying wonderland orgy of booze and handsome men, Celia is a once-in-a-generation beauty, Aunt Peg is a larger-than-life bon vivant, Edna Parker Watson possesses unlimited stores of otherworldly charisma, while her husband is the most doltish human to ever live.
This isn’t a criticism – a first move to the big city is an extreme experience for a young person, especially a beautiful, moneyed 19-year-old starting out in pre-WWII Manhattan. But just as the endless nights of waking up hung over in makeup-streaked sheets start to become monotonous – both to Vivian and to the reader – the fantasy comes to an abrupt end, when Vivian is mixed up in a ruinous scandal splashed all over the gossip rags.
The city spits Vivian out – temporarily, at least – thus setting off a surprising, more sober second half to her story, as World War II transforms the city and the world. It’s no spoiler to say this isn’t a novel about an indecorous woman’s descent into disgrace – Vivian harbors no shame in her checkered past; it’s her taste for sex and adventure, independence and rebellion, that makes her life worth following over seven decades.
For fans of Gilbert’s best-known work, “Eat, Pray, Love,” there are no concrete similarities with her juggernaut memoir. Yet “City of Girls” embraces some of the same themes: the power of a woman breaking from a traditional path, and the wisdom of taking true, two-handed joy in the pleasures that life offers up. The only other similarity? “City of Girls” is an unbeatable beach read, loaded with humor and insight.

New Book Sheds Friendly Light on Trump as Businessman; Trump Organization former counsel George Sorial details the president's awe at his ascent from real estate to the White House

Texto completo: President Trump marveled over his own use of Twitter while hosting the Trump Organization's chief compliance counsel for dinner at the White House last March.
"Listen, today I fired a cabinet member and revealed it on Twitter to the world and the media was all over it in seconds," the president said, referring to former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, according to a new book that George Sorial, a longtime top executive at the Trump Organization, has written about his experience working for Mr. Trump.
Mr. Sorial was dining with the president on sea scallops and thyme-brined chicken breast more than a year after the Trump Organization appointed him chief compliance counsel to ward against conflicts of interest while Mr. Trump was in office.
The conversation soon turned to "which was worse: the New York Times or the Washington Post," according to "The Real Deal," the book that Mr. Sorial co-wrote with journalist Damian Bates and is set to publish June 11. It is a glowing account of the president's business instincts and managerial tactics and offers glimpses of Mr. Trump's awe at his own ascent from real-estate developer to commander in chief.
Mr. Sorial's close relationship with the president, as depicted in the book, is expected to draw some criticism from ethics experts who have expressed concern about what they view as an overly cozy relationship between the president and the company from which he pledged to distance himself while in office. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., the president's sons, whom he placed in charge of the company before his inauguration, joined him on his state visit to the U.K. earlier this week.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.
In the book, Mr. Sorial describes the president inquiring, in jest, about his sons' leadership at the Trump Organization. Mr. Sorial describes meeting with the president in Palm Beach, Fla., around Thanksgiving of 2017, and running into Eric Trump. "Trump asked me how Eric was doing with his company, and we joked about Eric ruining the organization that Trump had spent decades building up!" he wrote.
Mr. Sorial, whose last day at the Trump Organization was Friday , responded to ethics concerns by pointing to his decision to leave the company.
"I really felt that I could much more effectively promote the book and talk about these things as an independent person," Mr. Sorial said in an interview. The president, he said, "has much more important things to do now" than involve himself in the company.
The book offers a detailed look at the president's predilections as a businessman. Mr. Trump preferred emails to be printed out and would respond to them either by dictation or by scrawling notes on the printout. And when he wanted to see someone, Mr. Trump "would shout from behind his desk for that person to come to him," according to the book.
The president, who has developed a penchant for early-morning tweets in office, once advised Mr. Sorial to call him at home "any time after 5 a.m.," the book says.
Mr. Sorial recounts the president's evolving business focus, moving away from building towers and toward licensing deals. "Why should I take the risk of putting up a ninety-story building when I can do one season of The Apprentice and make tens of millions?" Mr. Trump once asked him.
As president, Mr. Trump has often displayed a greater appetite for the minute details of a policy than for the policy itself—for instance, his intense focus on the appearance and the material used in building the wall he has called for on the southern U.S. border.
He similarly zeroed in on such details at the Trump Organization. On an excursion to his Turnberry golf course in Scotland, Mr. Trump directed Eric Trump and Mr. Sorial to hang paintings that had been brought to the hotel.
"There were two of his senior executives—one of them his own son—standing with these massive picture frames up against the wall, and DJT looking at them from every angle to judge whether they were in the right place, at the right height and whether they looked appropriate in the spot," Mr. Sorial wrote.
Mr. Sorial dodges some questions about the president's business record, including details of his personal finances that House Democrats have sought to obtain through subpoenas. "How much is he worth? Well, to be frank, I have absolutely no idea and even less interest in finding out," Mr. Sorial writes.
The book nods to Mr. Sorial's interactions with Democratic lawmakers who sought information from the company. Referring to his Palm Beach office, Mr. Sorial wrote: "No one bothers me there—well, apart from the world's media and every asshole from Capitol Hill who wants to bring the president and The Trump Organization down!"

Miracle Mets reminisce about '69 World Series

Texto completo: BRIDGEWATER – Ahead of an appearance at TD Bank Ballpark this afternoon, Art Shamsky joked that he played 13 seasons of professional baseball, but fans only seem to ever want to ask him about one of them.
"Nobody talks about the other 12," he quipped. "All anybody ever talks about is 1969."
Four members of the 1969 World Series Champion "Amazin' Mets" will be reunited as part of a special event prior to and during the Somerset Patriots' series finale with the York Revolution at 1:05 p.m. Shamsky, Ed Kranepool, Cleon Jones and Ron Swoboda are scheduled to appear and sign autographs on the main concourse.
Kranepool, who spent his entire 18-year career with the Mets from 1962 to 1979 and is a member of the Mets Hall of Fame, is just five weeks removed from kidney transplant surgery. But the beloved former first baseman and outfielder says he "feels great" and is excited to once again meet the fans in Somerset after an extremely well-received appearance in Bridgewater with Shamsky and the now-late Ed Charles in 2015.
"It's going to be nice to get out, say hello to these fans and enjoy myself," Kranepool told MyCentralJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. "I'm encouraged about going over there. It's always a nice event. They do such a professional job over there, it's a great organization and great ballpark, and the last time we were there it was very well-received. I'm really looking forward to this one."
The Bronx native memorably hit a home run in Game 3 of the World Series that year, and echoed Shamsky's sentiments that, despite a long career, it's the legacy of the 1969 season that's seemed to live on forever.
"I played 18 seasons and went to two World Series for the Mets; we lost in '73 in seven games to Oakland, but nobody talks about that," Kranepool said. "Everybody seems to have been at the stadium at '69 and has a piece of the action, whether it be the sod, or they saw the game...being a New Yorker, people always want to talk about it. It keeps you current."
Shamsky was a .300 hitter with 14 home runs for the Mets during the 1969 season, both of which were good for second on the team; he also hit cleanup in the postseason and hit .538. Five of his eight big-league seasons were with the Mets, but it was the Amazin' year that he captured with co-author Erik Sherman in his new book, "After The Miracle: The Lasting Brotherhood of the '69 Mets," which recently made The New York Times best-sellers list.
"The memories are still vivid, because that was such an incredible year for all of us," Shamsky said. "All of our lives changed when we won on Oct. 16, 1969...so many books have been written about that team, I'd venture to say that more books have been written about that team than any team in history, so what we wanted to was just let fans get closer to the players and feel like they were a part of the conversations. This was about the camaraderie and the friendship we had on the team that we still have to this day."
Between the stories told in the book and those that will be shared Sunday at the ballpark, fans both young and old can perhaps gain a new appreciation for the "Miracle Mets" club.
"I enjoy talking with the younger people, but many people know about that team from their parents or their grandparents," Shamsky said. "We live in a world where it's what's in front of you right now, and a lot of people who weren't born by then don't know a lot about that team or that era. But, once they hear stories about that team and where we came from – how bad the team was in the early years and even the year before – and when people talk about the late 60's and that era, which was so much in turmoil, I think we get their ear. That team has a special meaning to people, and they're able to pass it on from generation to generation."
The Mets defeated the Baltimore Orioles in five games in '69 to capture their first World Series championship.
Playing prominent roles in the Mets' big win were, left to right: Ken Boswell, Cleon Jones, Ed Kranepool and Donn Clendenon.

Texto completo: Imagine that you're about to celebrate a big anniversary, but start running into unnerving problems.
First, you don't know exactly when you should celebrate. Or, really, whether you should celebrate at all -- and you won't have a reliable answer for months, maybe years.
Even worse, you're in no mood to mark the occasion. Nasty issues keep cropping up. They have already killed the buzz for this year's party -- and might ensure that you won't be celebrating again a year down the road.
That predicament is, more or less, why there may not be revelry for a rare achievement of the United States economy: 10 years of growth without a recession. That has happened only once before, during the long expansion that ended in March 2001. Instead, we are likely to see a sober anniversary, burdened by hypotheticals and gloomy predictions.
With a trade war, simmering income inequality, a disappointing jobs report and shaky markets affecting the mood, this may not be the perfect time to pop the corks. But part of the problem is fundamental: It's not entirely clear that the economy has set a record, nor is it certain when we will know if it has.
This much can be safely said: "If the United States makes it past July 1 without a recession, the current economic recovery will turn out to have been the longest in American history."
That careful formulation came from James Poterba, an M.I.T. economics professor. As president of the National Bureau of Economic Research (widely known by its abbreviation, N.B.E.R.), his words are authoritative. The nonprofit research organization is the semiofficial arbiter of recessions and expansions in the United States.
In an interview, Professor Poterba qualified that statement further.
"We won't know on July 1 that we are not already in a recession," he said. And even if it turns out that the economy did keep growing through June, we don't know exactly when the expansion started.
For more detail, I called Robert Hall, the Stanford professor who heads the N.B.E.R.'s Business Cycle Dating Committee, which rules on when recessions start and stop. I said I'd appreciate more clarity, but he said: "We don't really know the answers."
First, he said, "The committee's microscope just isn't accurate enough for us to pinpoint the actual date of a peak or a trough in the business cycle." The committee only narrows things down to months. "That's as precise as we're comfortable with," he said.
The closest the N.B.E.R. can come to specifying the end of the last recession is somewhere in June 2009. That imprecision itself is why, even if we were so inclined, we could not mark our calendars for an anniversary party on any specific day.
Then there's another problem. The N.B.E.R. neither forecasts the future nor reports immediately on the past, he said. "We don't even attempt to do forecasting," he said. "We just try to measure what's already happened. We go as fast as we can. But we take enough time to make sure that we're right, sometimes a very long time. We're proud of that."
For example, the N.B.E.R. didn't declare that the last recession was underway until December 2008, a year after the economy started to decline. "People made fun of us for that at the time," Professor Hall said.
Similarly, it wasn't until September 2010 that the committee was confident enough to declare June 2009 the end of the recession.
Professor Hall explained how the committee operates. The 10 eminent academics on the panel typically meet via conference call when they have something to decide, but Professor Hall said he hadn't called a meeting "for a very long time." Between sessions, he said, the members exchange spreadsheets with economic data but haven't done so "for quite a while now."
That inactivity suggested to me that the committee doesn't think a recession is underway or likely to start soon. I asked whether he would confirm that.
"No, unfortunately, I can't say that," he said. "Because you never really know about a recession, do you?"
While a recession is often said to consist of two consecutive quarters of declining gross domestic product, the N.B.E.R. embraces more complex definitions.
The core is this: "During a recession, a significant decline in economic activity spreads across the economy and can last from a few months to more than a year. Similarly, during an expansion, economic activity rises substantially, spreads across the economy, and usually lasts for several years."
Discerning these changes takes so long because a cloud of ambiguity makes economic analysis difficult in real time. That opacity sometimes prevents policymakers, financial market participants and journalists from perceiving events accurately.
In December 2007, the start of the recession, for example, The New York Times carried some fairly optimistic -- and, ultimately, incorrect -- reports about the economy. I was here then. We simply didn't know which way the economy was going.
One article, for example, reported on Dec. 14, 2007, that Lehman Brothers earnings were better than expected and that the investment bank forecast "that the United States economy will grow 1.8 percent next year and that the global economy will expand 2.7 percent." In fact, the economy contracted and Lehman itself declared bankruptcy, making matters vastly worse.
And a September 2007 article said that the Federal Reserve began to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy, setting off a stock market rally only two months before the recession's start.
There is scant evidence that anyone has a clear view of the future now, despite many attempts.
Signals from financial markets are worrisome, but not definitively so. Yields have "inverted," a reversal of the typical order of things that sometimes, but not always, occurs before a recession. The futures markets predict multiple Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, an indication that traders, at least, think the economy is deeply troubled. A government report on Friday that only 75,000 jobs were created in May heightened those concerns.
James Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, says: Hedge your bets. If a recession is imminent, stock investors will probably endure major losses; if the economy grows, the long bull market is likely to revive. "Basically," he said, "if the economy doesn't kill you, it may make you rich."
Though it may be risky to celebrate the economy now, years of further growth are certainly possible. The N.B.E.R. isn't ruling that out.
As Professor Poterba observed, Australia hasn't had a recession since 1991. "That tells us that an economic expansion can last for decades," he said.

Texto completo: During the fall of 2017, along with the rest of the country, Jules Woodson watched the Me Too movement play out in the media. As women came forward to expose the predatory behavior they'd survived, the Colorado Springs-based flight attendant reflected on a night in 1998, when Andy Savage, the youth pastor at her local church in her hometown of The Woodlands, Tex., offered her a ride home. At some point, Woodson says, Savage passed the turn to her home and drove down a dirt road, where he reached a dead end and switched off the headlights. He unzipped his jeans and asked Woodson, then 17, to perform oral sex. A few minutes later, she says, Savage jumped from the truck, fell to his knees and told Woodson she must take what happened to the grave.
The next day, terrified and traumatized, Woodson told the church's assistant pastor what happened; she says he asked if she'd "participated." While Savage continued as youth pastor - even leading a True Love Waits event encouraging youth to abstain from all physical contact, not just from sex - Woodson sank into shame and a deep depression. Although she retained her faith, she eventually left the church.
Twenty years later, Woodson found Savage's email and sent him a note with the subject line: "Do you remember?" She asked if he recalled the night he was supposed to drive her home - "and instead drove me to a deserted back road and sexually assaulted me?" She signed off with "#metoo."
When Woodson Googled his name, along with "sex abuse in church" and "youth pastor sex abuse," she found a blog dedicated to Christian survivor stories called the Wartburg Watch; there, she read a post about an alleged abuse coverup at a church affiliated with Savage's current church. About a month later, Woodson submitted her own first-person account about her abuse to the Wartburg Watch and a similar Christian survivor blog called Watch Keep. When the blogs simultaneously published her story, Woodson figured that maybe a hundred people would read it - but by that afternoon, the posts had spread enough that Savage responded with a statement. On the website of the Highpoint Church in Memphis - where he worked at the time - Savage described a regretful "sexual incident with a female high school senior" 20 years prior. For his mea culpa at church that Sunday, Savage's congregation gave him a standing ovation. Within days, Savage responded to Woodson's email, saying, in part: "I am genuinely sorry for the pain this has caused you and I ask for your forgiveness."
Woodson soon found herself at the center of a media storm. The hashtag #JusticeForJules bubbled up on Twitter. On a CNN commentator's radio show, Savage described the incident as an "organic sexual moment." The New York Times ran a news story the next week and, two months later, a video piece in which Woodson detailed her story. Eleven days after the video came out, Savage resigned from Highpoint Church, acknowledging that his "relationship" with Woodson was "not only immoral, but meets the definition of abuse of power." The same day, Savage emailed Woodson to again apologize and to say his initial in-church statement and the church's response were "defensive and self-serving." (Savage did not respond to my requests for comment.)
Savage's ouster was a direct result of Woodson's posts on the Wartburg Watch and Watch Keep, blogs that are part of a larger constellation of "Christian watchdog" outlets. While clergy sex abuse within the Catholic Church has been in the headlines for years, it's only more recently that abuses within Protestant churches have started to draw mainstream media attention. Much of the credit for this quickening churn goes to a circle of bloggers - dozens of armchair investigative journalists who have been outing abuse, one case and one congregation at a time, for over a decade now, bolstering their posts with court records, police reports, video clips of pastors' sermons, and emails, often provided to them by survivors.
Most of these bloggers are women; many come from churches that teach women's submission and deny women's spiritual authority. "Investigative blogger women started a revolution at their kitchen tables," says pastor Ashley Easter, who hosts the Courage Conference, a Christian, survivor-focused gathering. They have advocated "for victims of abuse from where they were, where they could find a platform - blogs and social media."
Recently, a younger cohort of "ex-vangelicals" and online activists have joined the fold, and in late 2017 #ChurchToo started to trend on Twitter. In turn, a wave of secret-smashing tweets blossomed into reported pieces at publications like Mother Jones and the New Yorker. Yet the bloggers who built the foundation for this activist network are known mainly to church abuse survivors and reporters covering these stories. To the rest of the world, their efforts have mostly blended into the joint backgrounds of the clergy sex abuse scandal and #MeToo.
The Wartburg Watch is run by Darlene Parsons, a 65-year-old former home health nurse who goes by "Dee" online; Watch Keep was founded by Amy Smith, a 50-year-old Houston mother of four. Both sites have covered numerous stories of abuse in recent years. Posts on both blogs, for instance, helped a missionary's wife in Dallas put pressure on her church after she said she was disciplined for requesting an annulment (her then-husband had admitted to watching child pornography and being attracted to children, according to a report Smith obtained from the missionary organization where he worked at the time). And a Pennsylvania minister resigned three months after a woman alleged on the Wartburg Watch that he'd molested and raped her 40 years before, when he was a teenager and the woman was a child. Parsons believes her post had something to do with his resignation, as the minister's attorney reached out with a letter demanding she stop writing about the man. She was unfazed: "I knew I didn't do anything wrong, so I wasn't worried about it," she told me.
Parsons, one of the first watchdog bloggers, isn't a trained journalist - but she hawkishly covers any credible allegation of church-based abuse she finds. It's no wonder, then, that a year ago reporters for the Houston Chronicle contacted Parsons and Smith - along with others in the watchdog blog world - for the paper's joint investigation with the San Antonio Express-News that uncovered 700 sexual abuse victims over a 20-year span in Southern Baptist churches. Much of what Parsons and Smith had to offer had already appeared on their blogs.


Parsons runs the Wartburg Watch from the kitchen of her brick Colonial outside Raleigh, N.C. Online, she's forceful and fearless, tagging celebrity pastors, churches and Christian publications alike; her Twitter profile photo is the Church Lady, Dana Carvey's famously prim, purse-lipped and piously judge-y "Saturday Night Live" character. Parsons is nervous to meet a reporter in person, she admits, offering me a plate of cookies while her three rescue pugs skitter across the tile floor. It's hard to fathom that this suburban mom of three, with her tidy cardigan and sensible bob, is the same person online haters have called "the Wartburg witch," a "feminist heretic," an "e-pharisee" and a "minion of Satin [sic]."
In 2006, leaders at Parsons's former church, Providence Baptist, called in Parsons and other parents for a meeting. A seminary student and church volunteer who led a youth Bible study, Brian "Doug" Goodrich, had been found with a child in a local park. That child, it seemed, was not the only suspected victim. "We're so sorry there were some boys who were harmed," Parsons says she recalls the church leaders saying; she also remembers them saying they hadn't received any prior reports of wrongdoing and that, "if you have any information, let us know. The police are involved." The church leaders asked the parents not to talk among themselves to figure out which boys had been victims, to protect their privacy. (Parsons's son had soccer practice during Goodrich's Bible study and wasn't part of the core group of boys who regularly interacted with Goodrich.)
A few weeks later, a friend and fellow congregant, Janet Wilson, told Parsons her elder son was one of the boys involved. Parsons was afraid to talk about it, since the parents had been instructed not to; besides, she trusted the matter was being well handled by law enforcement and the church.
In 2007, Goodrich was convicted on 10 charges of statutory sex offense, indecent liberties and first-degree sex exploitation, and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Wilson was understandably distressed during the investigation, and after the conviction she stopped by Parsons's house, wracked with guilt. Wilson wished she'd done more, she told Parsons, because the church leaders had known about Goodrich before the 2006 incident. In 2005, Wilson says that she and her husband had described incidents with Goodrich to two youth pastors. Goodrich had exposed himself to a group of boys, including Wilson's eldest son, at church camp, Wilson told Parsons, and encouraged them to reciprocate.
At the time, Wilson had been too embarrassed to tell anyone else about the flashing, or about the conversation with the youth pastors in which she and her husband reported Goodrich's behavior. But Wilson knew her son was not the only boy hurt by Goodrich's abuse. "My kids were okay," she told Parsons that day, "but I feel terrible that these other boys have been harmed." Wilson told me, "I felt guilty because the church knew about it. They didn't feel guilty, but I did."
Parsons was appalled - and decided to do something about it. She, Wilson and a few church friends wrote a letter to the church elders reminding them of the earlier incident. She expected the pastors would say they'd made a horrible mistake. When they didn't, and the church instead began an internal investigation, Parsons and her group wrote another letter to the entire congregation. Fed up, Parsons and her cardiologist husband, Bill, left Providence Baptist to join another church.
(Goodrich's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. Brian Frost, senior pastor at Providence Baptist, confirmed that the church's internal investigation was motivated by Parsons's group letter, and said church policies have since changed: Now, any report or allegation of abuse by an employee or volunteer triggers a leave of duty until an investigation is completed, and all allegations of abuse must be reported to police.)
During their second week at the new church, Parsons says, she saw a man she knew to be a convicted pedophile. (His wife used to teach at her kids' school, so news of the man's conviction had circulated among the parents.) "I thought God was playing a joke," she says. Two churches, two convicted sex offenders. She remembers thinking, "God, this is really not funny."
Parsons decided to turn to the Internet. She would start a blog dedicated to exposing hypocrisy in the Protestant church. She called her friend Wanda Martin, who would go by "Deb" on the blog and who'd likewise stood with Wilson. Together, they launched the Wartburg Watch, naming it after Germany's Wartburg Castle, where, starting in 1521, Martin Luther translated the New Testament into German and hid from Pope Leo X's condemnation. (Wanda Martin stepped back from the blog last year.) "I assumed no one would read it," Parsons says. "Of course, no one did read us for a while. But we were getting it all out of our system."
The Wartburg Watch started as a few-times-weekly critique of patriarchal theology, comments on news stories featuring church hypocrisy and posts about Parsons's and Martin's experiences. But over the intervening years, as the blog grew in scope, Parsons developed certain habits: She talks to survivors at length, sometimes holding back stories for years until the survivor is ready or she is convinced of the accusation's veracity. If a survivor alleges the accused is a registered sex offender, Parsons checks the registry. If there are court records, victims are usually eager to turn them over to underscore their story, and when such documents exist, there are usually other people she can talk to, such as a detective on the case, to confirm details. Her posts are littered with the term "allegedly." As she wrote in one post, "Sorry for all the alleged but lawyers really like that word."
Parsons received advice early on from a lawyer she knew who had tried clergy sex abuse civil cases on behalf of victims. Their conversations made her unafraid of litigation. She quoted back his advice: "In order to get sued, they have to prove that I lied, and I knowingly lied in order to cause malicious harm to another person, and that I'm doing it not for the greater good." Her buoyant voice grew firm as she told me, "I never lie when I'm writing on these blogs. I am dead serious about what I write." She does not consider herself much of a writer, though, telling a Vermont-based reporter, "I struggle through every post to write in such a way that people don't think I'm a moron."


In April 2010, Amy Smith started a blog, where she posted recipes and reflected on faith and patriotism. On October 12, 2011, she posted a recipe for pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. The next day, her blog joined the Protestant watchdog community - and soon became one of the Internet's most relentless outlets exposing church sex abuse.
For over a year, Smith had been quietly pushing an investigation into John Langworthy, a youth minister Smith knew growing up. Smith's family attended Dallas's Prestonwood Baptist Church, where Smith interned in youth ministry and her father was a deacon. Langworthy had lived with her family for about a year when he'd been a minister at Prestonwood; Smith even played the flute in Langworthy's wedding. In 1989, when Smith was a sophomore at Baylor University in Waco, Tex., she heard rumors about sexual misdeeds involving Langworthy, who had been fired and left Prestonwood. (Mike Buster, Prestonwood's executive pastor, says that Langworthy was terminated after church leadership heard a rumor that he behaved in a "crude and inappropriate way with a male high school student," but that no evidence of molestation was presented.)
Smith didn't press for details until 2010, when she Googled his name and discovered he had been serving for decades at a Baptist church in Mississippi, as well as teaching elementary and high school. "I was just terrified," says Smith. "There's so many more possible victims and kids at risk." But when she called and emailed the church, the school system where he taught, the Mississippi Department of Education and even Prestonwood Baptist back in Dallas, she was unsatisfied with their responses.
She Googled "Baptist sex abuse" and connected with Christa Brown, a blogger who ran a site called Stop Baptist Predators, and with a group called Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (SNAP), a Catholic-specific advocacy organization. "I'm not Catholic; I'm Southern Baptist," says Smith, "but the common denominator of the way abuse was handled and was covered up was the same."
Smith posted (anonymously) about Langworthy on blogs, including Stop Baptist Predators; she also contacted reporters at the Clarion-Ledger in Mississippi and Dallas's Channel 8 News, and kept them apprised of her efforts while she talked to men she'd known Langworthy was close to as boys. She'd originally reached out to these men via Facebook message, and they told her how they'd wrestled with coming forward. When a church member captured a cellphone video of Langworthy confessing at the altar at his new church that he'd had "sexual indiscretions with younger males" before moving to Mississippi, the church member sent it to Smith, who forwarded the video to the reporters. In the video, Langworthy described seeking forgiveness from his wife and family and receiving counseling. He also said that, through God's grace, there had been "no sexual impropriety" while serving at the Mississippi church, and referenced blog posts that had surfaced "concerning these indiscretions." He was resigning due to stress, he said, much of it caused by revelations about his past.
On Oct. 13, 2011, the day after the pumpkin muffin recipe post - and two months after the Langworthy story appeared on TV - Smith came out about her involvement in the case. Her lifestyle blog took a hard turn as she revealed her efforts to, as she put it, "shine the light of truth on this admitted pedophile." (In January 2013, Langworthy pleaded guilty to molesting five boys between the ages of 6 and 13 in Mississippi in the 1980s, before he'd worked at Prestonwood. But the entirety of his 50-year sentence was suspended under a plea agreement. Langworthy could not be reached for comment, and is registered as a sex offender in Mississippi.)
With that post, Smith's recipes became a discordant prelude to a flood of sex abuse posts that included screen shots of emails to pastors reporting allegations, links to recorded voice mails, and uploads of police documents. Smith's efforts eventually drew Parsons's interest, and Parsons emailed Smith to ask if she could profile her on the Wartburg Watch. "I was stunned that someone would want to write about me," Smith says. After that, she and Parsons kept in touch, and their kinship led to shared investigations and common enemies. In 2015, an anonymous package was mailed to over 20 pastors, Baptist leadership, reporters, SNAP leaders and bloggers, including Parsons. In a 23-page, rambling defense of Langworthy - with attacks on Smith's character and her reasons for pursuing the Langworthy case - the writer stated he or she was "dead serious" about stopping Smith.
Attempts at intimidation have taken other forms. Brown, a church abuse survivor and former appellate lawyer who started the Stop Baptist Predators blog in 2006, says she has received hate mail for years; commenters and faith leaders alike have called her "Jezebel," "an opportunist" and "spawn of Satan." After years of battling church leaders to acknowledge abuse and develop a database of known clergy sex abusers - plus receiving a double cancer diagnosis - Brown decided to quit blogging at the beginning of 2017 and now writes occasionally for outlets like Baptist News Global and Ethics Daily.
The Wartburg Watch has garnered its share of trolls, too. In 2017, someone sent an anonymous letter accusing Parsons of questioning male authority in the church, causing "dissension in churches" and "defam[ing] the Church, the Bride of Christ" to various leaders and staff - even the janitor - of her current conservative Lutheran church. Other copies went to denominational leaders, a community board on which Parsons and her husband sit, and colleagues of her husband's. The pastors at Parsons's current church were surprised by the letter - she hadn't yet told them about her blog - but were supportive and worried only about her safety. A seminary leader wrote a prayer for her and sent Bible verses to encourage her family. "God had given me a wonderful, unexpected gift," she wrote on the Wartburg Watch. Her family had finally "found a church that we love and pastors who we can respect and trust."


The bloggers themselves can, of course, be at risk for litigation. Julie Anne Smith, for instance, created a church-critical blog - and was then sued by her former pastor.
Julie Anne (not related to Amy Smith) attended Beaverton Grace Bible Church (BGBC) in the greater Portland, Ore., area from 2006 to 2008 with her husband and seven children. She says expectations for church members included men's authority over their wives and children's behavior, and rules on modest dress. After Julie Anne and her husband questioned such teachings - culminating in their decision to leave the church - she found the world of watchdog blogs online, where she stumbled on descriptions of pastoral control. She began to understand her own experience as one of spiritual abuse - defined as church leaders using their position of authority to control others through shame, belittling, guilt, shunning and coercion.
Years later, Julie Anne wrote Google reviews recounting the harm she believed the church had caused her family and claims about sex offenders having free rein in children's areas. The reviews were removed. (It's unclear why, although Google restricts reviews that include child sexual abuse imagery.) Frustrated, Julie Anne called Parsons, whose blog she'd been reading. Parsons reassured Julie Anne that she'd get through it and encouraged her to start writing. Soon after, she launched a site called BGBC Survivors, where she described the pressure and manipulation she'd felt.
Within days, Julie Anne received a summons. Her former pastor, Chuck O'Neal, was suing her, her daughter (who'd also left a negative Google review), and three other online commenters for $500,000 for defamation. Then O'Neal started a counter-blog, True BGBC Survivors, about surviving allegations and slander online and in his community. When I spoke to O'Neal recently, he denied Julie Anne's characterization of him, describing her blog and accusations as "the curse of my life." To be accused of abuse, he said, "is a hanging," adding, "They just have to get it into the press. ... What's in the press, it just destroys you."
O'Neal's suit was dismissed five months after filing, but by then an ABC affiliate's story of a pastor suing a blogger had gone viral. Some days, Julie Anne's site had 17,000 hits. Today she runs one of the most-cited watchdog blogs, Spiritual Sounding Board, where she covers a range of church-based abuse. "It does put us at risk for lawsuits, [since] we're looking at the whole picture of harm that's being done," she says. "[But] those are the kinds of stories that I like to take, since there's so much at stake."


t
hus far, watchdog bloggers have mostly come from white, conservative churches. The lack of survivors of color in the stories the bloggers share is conspicuous. After "slavery and since Jim Crow, black folks have been trying to be seen as respectable by white folks," says Lyvonne Proverbs, a pastor, poet, incest survivor and blogger who speaks and runs retreats for black Christian women as part of her #WereSurthrivors (survivor + thrivers) platform. She suggests this tendency to protect reputations includes "not airing out one's 'dirty laundry' " and an impulse among black Christians "to refuse to witness the grotesque in our communities."
She sees deep shame in black religious spaces that carry evangelicalism's legacy of patriarchy and white supremacy, and where women are often made to privilege black men "because they have it so hard." Black girls are sexualized, often viewed as older than they are, and blamed for their own abuse, she says. Privately - not publicly on her blog - Proverbs has helped two women write notes to their perpetrators. Despite working actively in this space, she'd never heard of the Wartburg Watch or Watch Keep before I asked her about them. She told me "there is a critical chasm" between white and black evangelical women, whose churches rarely talk about race.
For those who do tell their stories on sites like the Wartburg Watch or Watch Keep, the blogs offer the power of exposure - but exposure doesn't carry the force of law or necessarily lead to changes in church leadership. In October, Parsons wrote about a 1997 case in which a girl was abused, beginning when she was around 14, by a teacher at her Pennsylvania Christian school. The teacher, John Longaker, went to prison in 1998 on charges related to sex acts with the girl, including involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and indecent assault. Parsons wrote on the Wartburg Watch that Longaker "was released and is now serving as the sole pastor" of a Vermont church.
The survivor, Kelly Haines, has struggled with mental illness related to her trauma and the knowledge that Longaker was still preaching. She says she'd contacted his small Vermont church five years ago to no avail. Because "nobody did anything," says Haines, "at that point, I just thought, I guess it doesn't matter anymore." Then the pastors at her current nondenominational church - who "love Dee and love her work and love what these bloggers are doing for survivors," says Haines - suggested Haines reach out to the Wartburg Watch to share her story.
After talking to Haines, Parsons called Longaker and chronicled their debate on the Wartburg Watch: He insisted he was innocent; said his lawyer told him to plead guilty and he'd get only probation; argued that Haines was out for revenge; and said that he and his wife were the real victims. Parsons asked if he understood the trauma Haines "suffered at his hands." Longaker didn't answer Parsons directly, but instead told her the apostle Paul was forgiven and went on to become a church leader. Parsons later posted additional stories from another alleged victim of Longaker's who'd contacted her, and this past January, the Longaker story was picked up by the Burlington Free Press and USA Today in a piece that linked back to the Wartburg Watch. The story began: "No one conducted a background check when a small church in southwestern Vermont hired a pastor in 2010, a Burlington Free Press investigation has found."
The attention was a mixed blessing for Haines. The press and comments on social media were generally supportive, she says, but Longaker is still listed as the sole pastor on the church's site. (Longaker did not return repeated calls for comment.) Haines feels empowered, she says, but that "does not mean I'm going to stay empowered, because the abuse has changed everything in my head." What she does have now - between the bloggers and other #ChurchToo advocates - is "an army of people who are so supportive, who are there." "The Dr. Oz Show" contacted Haines, and she and Jules Woodson - the survivor whose Wartburg Watch story led to the resignation of pastor Andy Savage - were taped together for an upcoming episode.
Woodson has undergone a dramatic transformation herself since coming forward. She's an increasingly vocal advocate for other church sex abuse survivors, and this past winter, she felt ready to attend a new church. When she met with the pastor to tell him her history, he was supportive and kind. In April, Woodson told me she is healing, finally, although there are "still times when I'm taken back to that dark place and I cry for that little girl." It's hard to communicate to others the power of her relationship with Parsons, she says. "I've essentially entrusted my life to her, you know?" says Woodson. "She, in turn, has supported me unconditionally and has made me feel safe for the first time in 20 years."
For years, sex abuse survivors within the Protestant church have quietly carried painful burdens. Some of the pain is now being redistributed - back to the accused and to the pastors who kept their secrets. Yet there's a burden, too, in being the one to tell the truth, to call for justice in the midst of trauma and secrecy. Parsons was never molested, never hurt as badly as the survivors with whom she works. But she continues to be fueled by anger at those who hurt others.
Parsons told me about a quote from C.S. Lewis that she considers a driving force in her life. It reads, in part: "The load, or weight, or burden of my neighbor's glory should be laid daily on my back, a load so heavy that only humility can carry it, and the backs of the proud will be broken." She and her fellow watchdog bloggers keep returning to their computers because the stories keep coming. In the process, they lighten others' loads by risking the same reproach, fear and self-doubt the survivors feel. And isn't that the measure of a church anyway? Not thousands in pews, or secrets held in shame to protect the powerful - but a community of people, with shared faith, who care enough about one another to build sanctuary.

Texto completo: The party isn’t over for the Warriors but the fun is.
You know this thing has gone off the tracks if you’re the wife of the owner, sitting courtside next to the ultimate rapper power couple, when you lean across Beyoncé to ask Jay-Z if you can get him a lime in his vodka and soda … and are vilified globally.
That’s what happened to Nicole Curran, the wife of Warriors owner Joe Lacob, in Game 3 of the Finals when fans of Beyoncé – known as the Beyhive – decided the video showed their idol’s space being invaded, setting off a viral maelstrom, which, a tearful Curran said, included death threats.
In fact, nothing bad had happened, as confirmed by Beyoncé’s spokesperson who asked fans to “spread love, not hate.”
Unfortunately, all that was spreading that night for the Warriors was pain. Minority owner Mark Stevens, also sitting courtside, pushed away Toronto’s Kyle Lowry, who was chasing a loose ball, then, when Lowry protested, cursed at him.
The NBA barred Stevens for a year, fined him $500,000 and may force him to sell his 7% of the team.
Nor did Game 3 go so hot for the team. The injury-plagued Warriors were totally outclassed by the Raptors, a heretofore little-known crew that had avoided overtime in Game 7 of the second round with the stumbling 76ers on Kawhi Leonard’s shot that bounced four times on the rim … then was thought to be toast after trailing the Bucks 2-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals.
The Raptors led Game 3 for 46:35 of 48 minutes, winning 123-109 as Warriors Coach Steve Kerr took out his starters with 1:37 left, a surrender rarely seen in the Finals.
Remember when the Warriors were the adorable dynasty with cute Steph Curry and his band of merry marksmen?
Remember when they seemed invincible … like last week?
Then, out of nowhere, came this unexpected death struggle, capping a four-year glory run in which the Warriors once posted a record 73-9 finish and then landed Kevin Durant … won three titles, blowing a fourth in 2016 after leading 3-1 … then for the maraschino cherry atop the sundae of their magnificence, got DeMarcus Cousins on a one-year, $5.3 million deal.
Unfortunately for them, or fortunately for fans who tired of their domination and self-inflation, it seemed as if the gods had also had enough of the Warriors, whose starters began disappearing even as they went 12-4 in the West draw.
April 15: Cousins goes out in Game 2 in the opening round against the Clippers.
May 8: Durant is lost in Game 5 in the second round against the Rockets.
June 2: Klay Thompson and Kevin Looney go down in Game 2 of the Finals.
June 5: Raptors go up 2-1 as Curran offers Jay-Z a lime and Stevens reaches out and touches someone. Warriors haters just wish it had involved Lacob, the majority owner, who tipped off his self-importance after winning his first title, telling the New York Times his team was “light years” ahead of the others.
Not that a merely 2-1 deficit discouraged the Warriors. With Thompson returning for Game 4, they expected to lock this up in six games … with them as champions, of course.
“We just gotta continue to battle and win the next game, go back to Toronto, win Game 5, come back to Oracle, win Game 6, and celebrate,” said Draymond Green, team braggart. “Fun times ahead.”
Oops.
June 7: Klay goes for 28 points in Game 4 but they fall again. Once again, it isn’t close, with the Raptors winning 105-92.
With KD hoping to make it back for Game 5, the Warriors now expect to pull this one out in seven.
Win or lose, they’re going into a new arena in San Francisco next season, in which their fans, known for enthusiastically backing the team in the bad times, will have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in personal seat licenses as well as the standard exorbitant ticket prices.
So they may have already played their last game in friendly little Oracle Arena … which their loyal fans commemorated by fleeing up the aisles before it was over.
To give them their due, the Warriors really have been special.
They haven’t just been good but entertaining, sparking a revolution in offense. Curry is surely the greatest shooter in NBA history. Steph and Klay are surely the best shooting backcourt. The Steph-Klay-KD combination is one of the NBA’s greatest.
They’re also nice people. Kerr is a great quote and a super-nice man. Curry is said to be as wonderful a person as he is a player. For all KD’s whining, he’s considered a nice guy. For all Green’s braggadocio, he’s an unfailing stand-up guy who never uses the dodge of blaming his latest outrage on the press.
Lacob deserves his share of credit. It was his idea to hire Jerry West as a consultant, making the Warriors the first team to pay over $1 million for a part-timer … which turned out to be a bargain. If Jeanie Buss had been as savvy as Lacob when West was looking to rejoin her team, the Lakers might be in far better shape.
In the biggest “unfortunately” for the Warriors, more is at stake than one title.
The season has been played under the shadow of Durant’s ambition after he turned down a $150 million extension for a one-year deal to become a free agent this summer.
Insiders have paired Durant and Boston’s Kyrie Irving all season. Now with reports that Kyrie is leaning toward signing with the Nets … and Brooklyn trading salary to get a second maximum slot … the KD Leaves scenario looks ever more real.
It’s not over yet for the Warriors, but we’re about to see how many light years ahead they are now.

Abogados trabajan como taxistas de Uber y meseros para sobrevivir a los costos de Nueva York

Información de publicación: El Diario La Prensa ; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]. 08 June 2019.

Texto completo: Nadie escapa a los precios exorbitante de la ciudad y el estado más caros de EEUU. Ni siquiera los profesionales. Irónicamente, muchos abogados que tratan de ayudar a quienes no tienen dinero, deben buscar un segundo ingreso para poder costear el trabajo que donan y/o cubrir sus deudas universitarias.
Según Jared Trujillo, presidente de la Asociación de Abogados de Ayuda Legal (The Legal Aid Society) , al menos un tercio de sus colegas allí a tiempo completo, tienen empleos adicionales las noches o los fines de semana. Y dos tercios deben una deuda de préstamos estudiantiles de al menos $200 mil dólares.
Danielle, por ejemplo, entrega comida para Grubhub y UberEats, y ayuda a personas con sus declaraciones de impuestos. Su colega Julia Boms acude a los tribunales en los días hábiles, y los fines de semana trabaja atendiendo una barra, como en sus tiempos de estudiante.
“Fui a la escuela para hacer esto”, comentó irónicamente la joven de 28 años a The New York Times. A pesar de tener además una maestría en psicología forense, vive en un apartamento compartido con dos personas más en Murray Hill, en Manhattan.
Otros colegas suyos son meseros, pasean perros o conducen autos para Uber.
Según un documento interno, The Legal Aid Society, la organización de servicios legales sin fines de lucro más antigua del país , ofrece a los recién graduados salarios iniciales de $53,582 dólares, que aumentan a $62,730 al aprobar el examen estatal del colegio de abogados.
En contraste, el salario promedio de los abogados de primer año en firmas privadas fue $135 mil dólares en 2017, según la asociación NALP.
Los ejecutivos de The Legal Aid reconocen que los salarios relativamente bajos son un obstáculo para reclutar y retener a abogados fuertes, especialmente en Nueva York.
No buscan competir con los salarios del sector privado. Su objetivo es alcanzar la paridad con los abogados en el Departamento Legal de la ciudad, que paga aproximadamente $108 mil dólares a profesionales con 10 años de experiencia. Los de The Legal Aid con experiencia similar ganan alrededor de $90 mil.
En una audiencia reciente en el Concejo Municipal, funcionarios de The Legal Aid destacaron la disparidad salarial ante los líderes que han propuesto otorgar a las organizaciones de servicios legales financiados por la ciudad $15 millones de dólares adicionales en el presupuesto 2019-20 para ayudar a cerrar la brecha salarial. Los abogados dicen que deberían ser $50 millones de dólares.
“El trabajo es difícil porque estás viendo mucha tristeza, mucho dolor”, dijo Janet Sabel, directora ejecutiva y abogada en The Legal Aid. “Ves a personas que están presas, ves a clientes cuyas casas están cubiertas de moho, simplemente estás viendo cosas muy, muy tristes. Queremos que la gente tenga tiempo libre”.
El tema de la baja remuneración para los defensores públicos ha llamado incluso la atención de la senadora Kamala Harris de California, quien busca la nominación Demócrata para presidente.
Harris dijo el mes pasado que presentaría un proyecto de ley que establecería la paridad salarial entre los defensores públicos y los fiscales de todo el país en un plazo de cinco años.
El alcalde Bill de Blasio, un Demócrata que también se está postulando a la presidencia, no se ha comprometido con el posible aumento a los abogados de The Legal Aid. Un portavoz de la alcaldía, Raúl Contreras, dijo que “las conversaciones con el Concejo sobre este tema están en curso”.
Mientras, en NYC los alquileres de vivienda han alcanzado precios históricos.

Texto completo: Andre Lanier Davis Jr., a beloved presence in the 12th Street area in East Austin, was gunned down in Givens Park on April 9 when police say two men pulled up in a black Nissan and robbed a group of people playing dominoes.
Fifty-one days after the crime, a witness came forward in late May with the tip police needed to close their case and file a capital murder charge against 25-year-old Glenn Madison Deal Jr.
Davis’ 28-year-old son, Andre, said he’s grateful for investigators’ work toward making an arrest and is confident they will identify the second suspect.
“It’s very comforting to find out they’re doing everything they said they were going to do,” he said.
Davis’ shooting is one of 11 homicides in Austin this year. Police have made arrests in seven and issued an arrest warrant in another, which is not too far from the homicide unit’s usually high clearance rate.
From 2007 to 2017, Austin police arrested a suspect in 73% of the city’s homicide investigations, the highest rate in a Washington Post analysis last year of homicide arrests in the nation’s 55 largest cities. Austin loomed significantly above the analysis’ average arrest rate of
49.6% and other large Texas cities like San Antonio (57%), Fort Worth (54%), Dallas (52%) and Houston (49%).
Austin detectives as well as local and national experts point to several reasons why the city’s police have been so successful in solving homicides. Community members often come forward with information about killings — like the witness who identified Davis’ killer to police as “Deal” — or respond to media reports and calls for tips, like when a firefighter watching the evening news recognized the suspected attacker in the 2016 strangulation of University of Texas student Haruka Weiser and notified police. That person, Meechaiel Criner, was arrested and found guilty of capital murder last year.
“Time and time again, it’s a key witness who will say they heard or saw something and it breaks a case,” homicide Detective Nathan Sexton said. “If they wanted to sit on that information we would not be where we’re at. To have a good rapport with the community goes miles.”
A well-staffed unit
Another factor is Austin’s low level of gang activity compared with other big cities. Homicides committed by gang members, experts say, are tougher to solve because witnesses are less likely to cooperate for fear of retaliation and due to a code of silence common among gangs.
Several experts also noted the abundance of resources Austin pumps into every homicide investigation, something they say is lacking in many other major cities with more homicides than their overwhelmed detectives can handle.
Even while Austin’s population has grown to become the 11th largest in the country, the city has remained relatively safe with an average of 28 homicides per year since 2000. Yet even in 2016, when annual killings in the city reached a record 39, the 4.3 homicides per 100,000 residents was well below the 12.9 average homicides in similarly sized cities.
As was the case in Davis’ killing, Austin homicide detectives say that allows them enough time to exhaust all leads before moving on to their next investigation.
John Skaggs, a retired Los Angeles police officer who travels the country evaluating homicide units and training their detectives, called Austin’s homicide unit “probably the fattest unit I’ve ever seen or heard of.”
In addition to the Austin Police Department’s 12 homicide detectives, a tactical intelligence unit frees detectives to canvass neighborhoods or interview witnesses by scouring digital databases for useful information. Two homicide sergeants and a lieutenant chip in when needed, as does the multiagency Lone Star Task Force.
“It’s inspiring and helps motivate us to work as hard as we can to find answers for the families of the victims,” homicide Detective Paul Chavez said.
In contrast with the homicide unit’s robust staffing, Austin police’s overtaxed sex crimes unit handles 1,800 cases per year with only one more detective than their counterparts in homicide. That, according to an American-Statesman analysis from last month, leaves sex crimes investigators with an average of 10 hours to solve a case.
The sex crimes unit currently has one less detective than the number suggested in a 2012 recommendation from the Police Executive Research Forum. By 2018, six years after the study, the number of cases the unit handles had gone up 34%.
Best practices
Operating on an on-call rotation, each homicide detective takes the lead on about three cases per year and assists on maybe three more. They also stay busy looking into drownings, suicides and accidental deaths.
The annual budget for Austin’s homicide unit is $2.3 million, with $124,737 of it set aside for overtime so detectives can continue to work cases beyond the allotted time in their shift.
Skaggs, who investigated homicides in Los Angeles for more than 20 years, said Austin implements best practices by not diverting the attention of homicide detectives to other crimes, such as burglaries or nonfatal assaults.
“The majority of success for homicide squads in this country comes from two things: how many cases detectives handle per year and the time between cases they receive,” said Skaggs, whose police work is highlighted in The New York Times bestseller “Ghettoside: A True Story of Murder in America.”
Chicago police, for instance, tackle more than 500 homicides per year and made arrests in just 26% from 2007 to 2017, according to The Washington Post analysis. Detectives in Detroit, where there are more than 300 homicides per year, arrested a suspect just 41% of the time over eight years. And Jacksonville, Fla., a city with a population comparable to Austin’s, had 106 homicides over an 11-year period and made an arrest in less than half of them.
Former Austin Police Monitor Margo Frasier agrees that Austin’s high homicide arrest rate is likely a reflection of the low number of homicides that come across detectives’ desks.
“While I think the homicide unit is not sitting around with their feet up, they don’t have (a heavy) workload because our city doesn’t have as many homicides as others,” she said.
But Frasier also said the city is fortunate to have “some very solid detectives.”
The Police Department has some longtime veterans like Detectives Rogelio Sanchez and Dave Fugitt, who have been with the homicide unit for 17 and 16 years, respectively. Former homicide detectives have used their experience in the unit to springboard to higher positions, including Chief Brian Manley, who investigated homicides for two years in the late 1990s.
Solving tough cases
The homicide unit puts together a summary each year with details about killings, including location, race and the victim’s relationship to the killer.
In 2017, eight of the 25 homicides were “stranger-on-stranger,” which police define as killings in which the victim was chosen at random or the victim and the suspect were brought together by a location (like a bar) or an activity (like buying drugs).
Experts say those homicides are harder to solve than when, for instance, the victim had a dispute with a significant other or a roommate. But Austin police solved all eight stranger-on-stranger homicides in 2017, having made arrests in seven and filing a warrant in the other to arrest a suspect they believe fled to Mexico.
Police made an arrest in 80% of the 2017 homicides and issued arrest warrants in three others.
Lt. Jeff Greenwalt of the homicide unit said teamwork plays a big part in the high arrest rate.
“We don’t draft people who don’t want to be here,” he said. “Long hours, time away from family, a rigorous on-call schedule. You have to work in a team environment. It’s not a one-man show.”

Texto completo: BANGUI, Central African Republic - Dr. Jean Chrysostome Gody bounds down a stench-filled hallway in the Central African Republic's only pediatric hospital, his daily soundtrack the high-pitched crying of dozens of babies in the malnutrition wing.
The sickest infants lie silent and listless. One baby's skin is gray and splotchy. A nurse pokes at his head to make sure he's still alive.
Yet amid all the suffering, Gody offers something rarely heard in this conflict-plagued country: optimism.
The hospital is no longer filled with children suffering from gunshot wounds and missing limbs from bomb blasts. A fragile calm has settled over Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, where the government recently signed a peace accord with rebel groups it had been battling for years. The agreement seems to be holding for now, despite an apparently isolated attack in the countryside in May that killed more than two dozen people.
In May, Gody congratulated the first-ever class of pediatricians to graduate from the country's only medical school. The hospital has just opened a new multimillion-dollar malnutrition wing, doubling the number of beds and offering clean rooms with fresh paint and new mosquito nets.
More patients than ever are coming through the doors - a sign not that more children are sick, Gody said, but rather that word finally is spreading that treatment there is free.
"It is not the time and place to be pessimistic," said Gody, director of the Bangui Pediatric Hospital for the past 16 years.
Nearly seven years ago, Muslim rebels fed up with a lack of government services in rural areas - basics such as schools, roads and hospitals - invaded the capital and clashed with Christian militias in fighting that slid toward genocide, the United Nations said at the time. Armed groups have been battling over turf ever since in this mineral-rich nation, which has suffered regular upheavals since independence from France in 1960.
The conflicts have left this country, with its lush forests and butterflies flitting about, in absolute tatters.
Most of Bangui, situated along the banks of the wide Ubangi River, hasn't had running water for more than a year. At night people spill into the streets in search of water, lugging empty yellow jerrycans on bikes and motorcycles. Men strip naked and lather up in the gutter, where runoff flows from the country's only water treatment plant.
Electricity is also in short supply in Bangui. Planes can't land at night because the main airport has no lights.
The state of the country, which ranks second to last of 189 countries in the U.N.'s Human Development Index, is especially hard on children. Many have been recruited into the war.
"And here are our child soldiers," chief of staff for one local warlord who calls himself Force chirped on a tour of his militia's compound in Bangui. He pointed to two frowning 15-year-old boys with AK-47s slung over their shoulders.
Infant mortality rates here are some of the highest on Earth; 1 in 5 children won't live to see their fifth birthday. Malnutrition rates are rising.
About 40% of the nation's health budget is supported by international funds, said Dr. Pierre Somse, who is minister of health. Government revenue supports just 20%, and the rest comes from patient fees in a nation where few can afford them.
If peace holds, people will flow back to their homes, Somse said, and such gatherings can launch disease outbreaks, especially for babies who went without vaccinations while their families were in hiding. One region suffered a measles outbreak in April.
"It will get worse before it gets better," Somse said.
But the country has made progress.
A vaccination program that required cooperation from militias has succeeded in immunizing 74% of children, Somse said. And a new program has been created to offer free care to pregnant mothers and children younger than 5, based on Gody's model at the pediatric hospital.
Gody, 60, already has executed the first step in his plan to revive health care: He stayed.
Doctors who graduate from the University of Bangui's medical school must go abroad to complete their specialty degrees. Most never come home. Gody thought about doing the same when he was in Ivory Coast completing his degree. Shame overtook him for even considering the notion.
"For a doctor - a real doctor," he said, "should we flee the people who are suffering?"
"I could have waited for everything to be fixed here and come back, but how could I look them all in the eye?" he said.
One of Gody's professors in Ivory Coast had created more specialty degree programs at a university there to encourage students to stay. Gody decided to do the same with pediatrics in Bangui, and designed the program at the medical school.
This May's graduating class will more than double the number of Central African pediatricians in the country, to a total of eight. Ten more are in training.
To boost the ranks, Gody has helped lure health professionals from global organizations to Bangui. UNICEF provides support, and after Pope Francis visited the hospital in 2015, the Vatican announced a donation to help pay for the new malnutrition wing.
The pediatric hospital treated 72,000 children in 2018 and admitted 18,000 of them. The old critical care malnutrition unit was so full that two babies, along with their mothers, all shared a single bed. Many of the children's conditions are complicated by malaria, HIV or other illnesses.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - A group of schoolgirls uses baby dolls to powerfully subversive effect in Erica Schmidt's Shakespeare adaptation, "Mac Beth." Fifth-graders snuggle "slave dolls" around their school in "Underground Railroad Game," the Obie Award-winning play that Jennifer Kidwell and Scott R. Sheopard made with their company Lightning Rod Special. A Cabbage Patch Kid called Babs Kimbra is a little girl's prized companion in Bess Wohl's wistful comedy, "Make 3elieve."
Dolls are having a moment off-Broadway right now, leading us to ask five playwrights - inducing Aleshea Harris, Obie-winning author of " is God Is," and Amina Henry, whose "The Great Novel" and "Sleeping Beauty" open this month - to talk about their childhood history with dolls and how it shaped their storytelling. Here are edited excerpts from what they had to say.
BESS WOHL
THEN: Babs Kimbra was the name of my best friend's Cabbage Patch Kid. My Cabbage Patch was Felicia Vivian, and Babs and Felica were best friends. Felicia Vivian was definitely a huge part of my life.
I also had Barbies that I Ioved. When I was a kid, my mom worked at Ms. magazine. To even have a Baroie was so rebellious. And then a: one point I had sort of a freakout - I must have been Iike 10 when this happened - and I chopped all their hair off. I gave them all these punk crew cuts. It's a powerful, powerful feeling to have a doll.
NOW: Creating worlds for little characters is very connected to being a playwright. I had a Barbie Dreamhouse, and I also had a very beautifully made dollhouse that was passed down through my family. And those little coms to me are little environments. On a very simple level, there is something about wanting to move little bodies around in space and put them in relationship to each other that is a similar impulse to being a playwright. We give ourselves total permission with our colls It's a scarier thing to enact when you're older and it's real people.
ERICA SCHMIDT
THEN:I had a Raggedy Ann kind of doll and then a Cabbage Patch. But I wasn't heavy into dolls. You know that Golden Book, "Mommy and Me"? The dolls are meant to be about playing at being a mom as a little kic. That was so never a part of what we were doing with Barbies. But I wasn't doing the 'blow up the G.I. Joe figures," either, which was what the boys in the neighborhood did.
NOW: In the play, I'd really struggled with what the appations are within the girl world. The idea is that every-thing they have comes from their backpacks and would be things that girls would have. These visions that Macbeth sees, the apparitions, two of them are children or babies. So it felt like, what are babies to these girls? They're their dolls. Somehow when the babies came out, it solved the way that the girls were performing the apparition scene, and it unleashed in them a wildness that really helped inform the rest of the piece. That just sort of happened when the dolls came in the room.
AMINA HENRY
THEN: I moved around a lot when I was a child. I was an only child until I was 10, so I spent a lot of time alone in new places that I didn't necessarily have friends yet. I did have a really special Grover that I had from age, I want to say 2, up until college. Then I lost him in college, which was devastating. He went with me everywhere. I would play with him a lot, and I would hang him from the ceiling fan, and we would have adventures, and I slept with him all the time. His arms fell off several times and had to be sewn back on. I loved him.
NOW: Haying Grover really helped me develop my imagination, and find solace in my imagination. I haven't used colls in any of my plays, but I feel like I often have a character that functions the way Grover did. Lest year, I did an adaptation of "Cindere la."' My Cinderella had a pet rat who was kind of like a Grover because no one else knew that he could talk. He would go with her on her adventures.
SCOTT R. SHEPPARD
THEN: I played with lots of stuffed animals. We had this puppet stuffed animal whose name was Bowser. One of the things Bowser would always do was bite people - that was part of his shtick - and I thought it would be a hilariousicea as a second grader to go bite my teacher's butt. I got in big trouble. I was surprised that she didn't understand that this is what this dog was made to do.
NOW: We've been really interested as a compary in toys and dolls and the ways in which what we do as young people shapes our lives. I definitely think it's shaped how I think about writing pieces of theater and making them sometimes very explicitly, like in "Underground Railroad Game" about dolls and about how we played.
I always played with dolls and the dolls were always fighting, always like banging into each other. They're kind of these landing places for all of our wonderful and awful human attributes. They're totally teaching us how to have power over something in sometimes sweet and wonderful ways and often in really terrible ways. Which is learning how to become a human being.
ALESHEA HARRIS
THEN: I did play with Barbies, and then I played with what I called teddies, which is just stuffed plush animals. I played with them separately, so they had two different worlds. And I took it really, really seriously. I was really into American Girl books, and I remember re-creating those stories. When I was a kid they were pretty white, and they were of a different time, so it was a different context. I remember trying to bring it into my own context.
NOW: I'm working on a few things now, and I recognize that I'm trying to challenge things that I've seen in the theater. I'm calling out the same old story that I've seen a million times, which I think is connected to this erasure that I experienced as a young black girl reading American Girl books, and putting myself into those narratives.
It feels like my characters are dolls. I put these figures into a room and they tell a story, and I have to come up with each person's voice. I dress them, I figure out what the culture of their world is, and I put them in it and see how they sort of smash into one another.

WHAT TECH INDUSTRY HAS TO FEAR FROM FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

Texto completo: It's official. Big Tech is public enemy No. 1 in Washington, D.C.
When such polar opposites as Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren set their sights on tech as a focus of their 2020 campaigns, it should be obvious that the industry has some work to do.
The innovation economy may have rescued the nation from the 2008 Great Recession and is largely responsible for the longest economic growth period in U.S. history. But its unchecked privacy scandals, repeated data breaches and inability to monitor political disinformation campaigns has created a day of reckoning for tech companies. Tech firms need to clean up their act or face a wave of unprecedented regulation.
The consequences of ignoring the threat: the prospect of a 21st-century version of the Dark Ages, where innovation is feared and slowed at every turn, giving our global competitors an edge on artificial intelligence, robotics and game-changing advances in energy, medicine and transportation.
Warren threw down the gauntlet last week in advance of the California Democratic Party Convention in San Francisco. She paid for a billboard near the Caltrain station in downtown San Francisco with her picture and the message: "Break Up Big Tech."
"I've been talking for years about how Big Tech has too much power over our economy and our democracy," Warren wrote in an email to The New York Times. "I'm going to keep making the case for my plan to break up Big Tech and put power back in the hands of the American people whether it's at SXSW (the South by Southwest Conference & Festivals), a town hall in Iowa or a billboard in the heart of Silicon Valley."
Soon thereafter the news broke that the federal government is considering antitrust investigations of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook, a move Trump has threatened more than once while charging the tech industry of anti-conservative bias. The Justice Department has oversight responsibilities for Google and Apple, and the Federal Trade Commission would lead any probe of Facebook and Amazon.
Then on Monday the House Judiciary Committee announced plans for a separate antitrust review of the tech giants.
Most analysts say they don't expect the investigations to force a breakup of the tech firms. And even if they do, the process would take years. But that's not the point. Long-term tech success depends largely on public trust both from the consumers who buy tech products and the government's willingness to give the industry the freedom it needs to innovate and thrive.
It's true that a Pew Research poll last year found that 63% of Americans think tech firms' impact on society as a whole has been more positive than negative. But the same poll revealed that only 28% of Americans think tech firms can be trusted to do the right thing always (3%) or most of the time (25%). And more than half of the public thinks tech companies should be regulated more than they are now.
The tech industry has a lot to answer for in recent years. It wasn't so long ago that industry leaders were known for their high level of concern for the impact their products had on the world. Restoring lost trust needs to be a high priority today.

Texto completo: La industria de combustibles fósiles se comporta como la prima donna de la economía nacional. Sin importar las consecuencias catastróficas de sus actuaciones, la administración Trump sigue premiándola con ramos de rosas.
Las comunidades hispanas que sufren las consecuencias de estos desastres, en cambio, solo reciben las espinas.
Un claro ejemplo son los barrios hispanos de Houston —Pasadena, Deer Park y Manchester— que recientemente han sufrido de primera mano varios desastres petroquímicos. El más grave fue el incendio en una instalación de almacenaje de ITC que emitió enormes cantidades de sustancias tóxicas al aire y las vías acuáticas colindantes. Decenas de familias, en su mayoría hispanas, sufrieron los efectos tóxicos de venenos como xileno y benceno.
Este abuso ocurre por todo el país. En los dos últimos años se han dado decenas de desastres petroquímicos similares, al mismo tiempo que la administración Trump ha debilitado las protecciones que ayudan a prevenir estas tragedias.
Un estudio del New York Times reveló que desde su llegada al poder, la administración ha debilitado o eliminado 84 protecciones, favoreciendo abrumadoramente los deseos de los contaminadores fósiles.
Esta insidiosa narrativa —sucio, bueno; limpio, malo— es un desesperado intento de ocultar los verdaderos costes de los combustible fósiles. Según un reporte del Fondo Monetario Internacional, Estados Unidos gasta más en subsidiar los combustibles fósiles que en sus fuerzas armadas. En 2015, los subsidios directos e indirectos al petróleo, carbón y gas alcanzaron los $649 mil millones, mientras que el Pentágono recibió unos $600 mil millones.
El cálculo de estos subsidios incluye las llamadas externalidades de esta industria, incluyendo los descomunales costos de su contaminación a la salud nacional. El estudio también reveló que los subsidios mundiales a esta industria se elevaron a $4,7 billones (trillions en inglés). El FMI llegó a la pasmosa conclusión de que si se hubiera puesto un precio justo a estos combustibles, se hubieran reducido las emisiones climáticas en un 28%, y se disminuirían las muertes prematuras en el mundo en un 50%.
Mientras tanto, el avance de la economía de energía limpia continúa imparable. Cinco estados más Puerto Rico y el Distrito de Columbia, y más de 120 ciudades se han comprometido a generar un 100% de energía limpia, y varios proyectos de construcción de gasoductos han sido derrotados o intensamente confrontados en Carolina del Norte , Maryland , Nueva York , Virginia y Virginia Occidental .
En una economía en la que la energía limpia rápidamente se convierte en su prima ballarina, no hay espacio para prima donnas.

RANGE, OTHERS PAID $3M TO SETTLE FRACKING HEALTH CLAIMS

Texto completo: Range Resources and 10 other companies involved in developing the Yeager shale gas well site in Amwell, Washington County, paid Stacey Haney and her neighbors $3 million to settle their claims that the well development damaged their health.
The terms of the August 2018 settlement were revealed Tuesday after Range stated in a hearing before Washington County Common Pleas President Judge Katherine Emery that it would make public its portion of the agreement.
Judge Emery then vacated her temporary injunction barring publication of the agreement terms that were mistakenly made available to radio journalist Reid Frazier last week because of a computer glitch in the Washington County prothonotary's office.
According to the three-page offer sheet released by Range, the shale gas drilling company's insurance carrier paid $1,880,000 of the total settlement amount and 10 defendant subcontractors paid the rest, although the amount each paid was redacted from the offer sheet by Range.
Ms. Haney and her neighbors agreed to release Range and the other companies from all past, current and future claims related to operations at the Yeager site and other nearby shale gas development sites. They also agreed to refrain from making any disparaging remarks about the shale gas companies or their developments and gave Range right of first refusal if Ms. Haney wants to sell the property where she no longer lives.
"We have voluntarily released the settlement agreement that resolved prior litigation with eight landowners in Washington County. We believe this additional transparency resolves any outstanding questions on this topic," Range spokesman Mark Windle said in an email.
The company continues to maintain that it did not damage or pollute the plaintiffs' water supplies or cause any adverse health impacts.
The agreement does not specify how much Ms. Haney and five of her neighbors - Beth, John and Ashley Voyles and Grace and Loren Kiskadden - received in the settlement. Loren Kiskadden died in November. Range said in an email that attorneys received 33 percent of the settlement amount, a standard fee.
The settlement agreement ended a contentious and lengthy legal battle that began seven years ago. Range drilled the Yeager shale gas well in 2009 and also built a drill cuttings pit and wastewater impoundment next to the hilltop well pad and near the plaintiffs' homes.
Ms. Haney, her family and neighbors claimed the drilling and fracking operation fouled their air and water and caused a host of physical ailments.
John Smith, the attorney who represented Ms. Haney and other plaintiffs, declined to discuss the judge's decision "due to our firm's and our clients' involvement with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office and its ongoing criminal Grand Jury investigation."
As part of that investigation, state Attorney General Josh Shapiro sent a letter to attorneys representing Ms. Haney and Range that referenced the "Stacey Haney/Range Resources Investigation" and requested that the case record be preserved, under penalty of law.
The Haney family's story, including health problems, was also chronicled in a book, "Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America," by Eliza Griswold, which was among The New York Times critics' top books of 2018.
Attorney David Strassburger, representing Mr. Frazier, said he was pleased at the outcome of the hearing.
"Reid Frazier was in the right. He was in a public courthouse in a public room, on a public computer, doing what is called constitutionally protected newsgathering," Mr. Strassburger said. "He should never have been enjoined in the first place."
Before its abrupt turnaround in court Tuesday, Range had sought to keep the settlement confidential.
Kimberly Brown, an attorney representing Range, argued in court that Mr. Frazier knew that the August 2018 court order barring the public from accessing the confidential agreement was in place but copied the document anyway when he found it in the public file in the prothonotary's office.
"It was an intentional violation of the court order and made a mockery of the court order," Ms. Brown argued in court.
Mr. Frazier, an energy reporter for the Allegheny Front, a Pittsburgh-based public media outlet, and StateImpact Pennsylvania, a media group that includes 90.5 WESA, was able to access the document last Tuesday, shortly after a hearing on the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's attempt to unseal the settlement.
Judge Emery imposed the temporary restraining order barring Mr. Frazier from publishing the document on Thursday at Range's request.
Mr. Strassburger noted at Tuesday's hearing that the First Amendment protects publication of lawfully obtained information on matters of public concern, and cited numerous examples of case law that rejects prior restraint, including New York Times Co. v. United States, the so-called Pentagon Papers decision of 1971.
In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the Nixon administration's claim of national security as a reason to keep The New York Times and The Washington Post from publishing stories based on classified military documents about the Vietnam War.
Mr. Strassburger's brief also states the allegedly confidential nature of a settlement agreement in the case at hand between private litigants in a "run-of-the-mill civil dispute" does not justify the court's granting of a prior restraint.
In his brief, Mr. Strassburger also said the Pennsylvania Constitution contains a prohibition against prior restraint that is "just as strong, if not stronger than that afforded by the First Amendment."

Texto completo: A financial-information company partly owned by the news organization Thomson Reuters removed articles related to the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square massacre from the feeds of its data terminals in China last week. The move came under pressure from the Chinese government, Reuters reported Monday.
The data firm that complied with the censorship demands, Refinitiv, is Reuters's biggest customer. It prevented some articles that included mentions of the pro-democracy demonstrations from appearing on its Eikon software and mobile app in China.
In a statement, Refinitiv pointed to legal realities in China, whose government previously blocked websites from publishing stories it deemed politically sensitive. The Chinese authorities have also denied visas to journalists working for news outlets that have published articles that were critical of the nation's leaders.
In recent days, with the 30th anniversary of the uprising approaching, China has made efforts to quash public mentions of the day when tanks and troops moved into the Beijing plaza and crushed student-led protests. Reuters reported on Monday that the Cyberspace Administration of China, which censors online speech, had threatened to suspend Refinitiv if it did not go along with its demand to pull articles that mentioned what took place in Tiananmen Square.
[Read more about the anniversary: Silence in Beijing, but emotion in Hong Kong.]
In a statement, Refinitiv said, "As a global business, we comply with all our local regulatory obligations, including the requirements of our license to operate in China."
The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a faxed list of questions. There was apparently little discussion of the Tiananmen Square anniversary on the Chinese internet. A small number of people shared the news and other articles related to the crackdown by posting images that appeared upside down or were otherwise manipulated to fool censoring software.
The move by Refinitiv echoed a decision by Bloomberg News in 2013 to stop publication of an investigative article on links between a wealthy businessman in China and the families of the country's leaders, including that of President Xi Jinping.
While that decision was made about a year after Bloomberg reported the personal wealth of several leaders' families, it also followed an order from Chinese officials to various companies to halt their subscriptions to Bloomberg's terminals, which have generated billions for Bloomberg L.P. At least three Bloomberg journalists resigned after the company gave in to official pressure.
Fifty-five percent of Refinitiv is owned by a consortium of private-equity funds managed by the Blackstone Group. Thomson Reuters owns the rest, having sold the majority portion last year at a valuation of $ 20 billion. Under the deal, Refinitiv licenses Reuters news services for roughly $ 325 million annually.
Just as Bloomberg News makes money from Bloomberg terminals, Refinitiv's bread and butter is Eikon, not the Reuters news articles it includes on the platform. On its website, Refinitiv bills Eikon as a digital product that allows users to "turbocharge your analysis of the financial markets with the ultimate set of tools."
A Blackstone spokesman referred questions on the pulled articles to Refinitiv. So did a Reuters spokesman, after standing up for the company's journalism in a statement.
"Reuters reports around the world in a fair, unbiased and independent manner," the spokesman, David Crundwell, said. "And we stand by our China coverage."
"We continue to provide Refinitiv with the same scope of content that we always have, including stories relating to China, and its decisions will not affect the breadth or quality of our coverage," he said.
In a memo emailed to Reuters staff members that was obtained by The New York Times, the company president, Michael Friedenberg, and the editor in chief, Stephen J. Adler, said they had "expressed our concern" to Refinitiv.
"We urge you all to continue reporting as you always would: to pursue the truth, without fear or favor," they said.
Last month, two Reuters journalists were released from prison by Myanmar's government, which had held them for 16 months for covering the military's attacks on the Rohingya minority.
Days before the journalists were set free, Mr. Friedenberg and Mr. Adler released a statement: "These are treacherous times for journalists and -- consequently -- for the billions of people around the globe whose lives can be informed, improved and sometimes even saved by the work journalists do."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Chinese cuisine sets the scene for novel

Texto completo: Inside China Canteen, a restaurant in a nondescript strip mall in Rockville, novelist Lillian Li digs into her favorite Sichuan dish: braised pork intestines in blood. This was one of her family's favorite restaurants when she was growing up in Montgomery County, where Asians compose 15 percent of the population, and Li was exposed early on to the depth of Chinese cuisine, including Shanghai specialties, Taiwanese and noodle-shop dishes. But that does not mean she understood it.
"For a long time, I thought of Chinese food as food that I had to eat - that I had no choice in eating," she says. "I didn't even know exactly what I was eating. I think that it was only once I got old enough to be able to order off the menu myself that I started being able to pick up that Chinese food is not just this food that I have no understanding of."
Li's experiences eating at Chinese restaurants in Montgomery County and working at one in Northern Virginia helped inspire her first novel, the story of a fictional Rockville restaurant she calls Beijing Duck House. "Number One Chinese Restaurant," which comes out in paperback this month, charts the intergenerational conflicts that arise when the son of the restaurant's founder strikes out on his own to open a modern, pan-Asian restaurant in Georgetown.
A deep dive into the emotional and physical toil of working at a Chinese restaurant, Li's book focuses on the personal lives of the restaurant's overlooked, hard-working staff. In fact, in an early draft she so effectively detailed the industry's blood, sweat and tears - not to mention salt, heat and grease - that her editor questioned her love for food. In response, she sprinkled in a little more of the joy that goes into feeding others.
But her goal was a larger one: to write a novel that "felt effortlessly and organically Chinese American," she says, and to show that resilience - a word often used in reference to immigrants - is twofold. "Even as my characters shape the environment of the restaurant to find pockets of connection and dignity and respect, they're also irrevocably shaped by the environment as well," she says.
Li's own stint working as a waitress at a Chinese restaurant was short. It was in 2013, the summer before she would head to the University of Michigan's MFA program. She lasted a few weeks before she quit, exhausted physically and emotionally. She would not say which restaurant inspired the fictional restaurant of her novel, but Peking duck is its signature dish. That and other similarities might prompt readers familiar with the Washington area's dining scene to assume the inspiration was Peking Gourmet Inn in Falls Church.
In her novel, the immigrants of Beijing Duck House are the latest in a long tradition of Chinese immigration to the United States, starting with the Gold Rush of the 18th century and broadening with the 1965 passage of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. What once was seen as "other" ultimately became integrated into the American food scene when Shun Lee Palace became the first Chinese restaurant to receive a four-star review from the New York Times in 1967.
As with any immigrant group, the food in Chinese-American restaurants and home kitchens changed in response to local ingredients and customers. When Li's own parents immigrated to the United States in the late 1980s, they inadvertently created their own subset of Chinese American food based on what they could easily find in stores. Their recipes, such as the sweet-and-sticky spare ribs featured on Li's website, are no replica of what is served in China, she says, but that doesn't make the food any less valuable. Demonize Chinese American food, and "you end up demonizing the entrepreneurial, enterprising spirit that allowed those earlier immigrants to now create a real base in America."
Li closely follows the ongoing conversation about cultural appropriation, something that came up during a question-and-answer session at a stop on her book tour last summer, a panel on food writing at the Asian American Writers' Workshop in New York City. An audience member asked how she should feel when Americans - especially white ones - "discover" her food and help popularize it.
"You used that word 'discover,' and I think that's a really key distinction," Li replied. "Within it, there's a lot of hubris, right? 'I discovered this thing that so many people already knew about.' . . . The difference between appropriation and appreciation [when] cooking with flavors that are not from your region or background is humility."
Take Andrew Zimmern, who caused an uproar late last year by saying that with his new restaurant, he was "saving the souls of all the people from having to dine at these horses--- restaurants masquerading as Chinese food that are in the Midwest." As Li said in an interview later, the biggest problem was his attitude. "If there's no humility when approaching, let alone profiting off, another culture's food, then I consider that venture to be made in bad faith," said Li, who lives in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Li sees the same sorts of issues at play in attitudes about monosodium glutamate (MSG), which was vilified for decades after reports of ill health effects from "Chinese restaurant syndrome" that have long since been debunked. In fact, one of the most recent instances of an outcry about alleged cultural appropriation involving Chinese cooking touched on the ingredient, which adds umami to dishes. The owner of the new Lucky Lee's in New York City promised she would serve "clean" versions of Chinese dishes, meaning without gluten, wheat, refined sugar, GMOs, additives - or MSG - and was pilloried for implying that other Chinese restaurants don't "make people feel good," as hers would.
When Li was growing up, MSG was that nameless white powder her parents stored in a small crock and added to their home-cooked dishes. Later, she realized that most Americans didn't seem to feel the way her parents did about the ingredient, as signs touting "No MSG" started to pop up in her neighborhood Chinese restaurants. In retrospect, she sees xenophobia at work, pointing out that Chinese restaurants were unfairly targeted for using a "magic powder" that imitates a natural chemical reaction.
In "Number One Chinese Restaurant," Jimmy Han brushes aside his family's heritage when he opens his pan-Asian fusion restaurant, but disgruntled customers convince him to return some classic dishes to the menu. Li sees MSG making a similar comeback. Celebrity chefs David Chang and Grant Achatz have spoken out in support of it, as have such food writers as the New Yorker's Helen Rosner. Now Li is seeing it in more places.
"I have friends who have a salt shaker of MSG on their kitchen table," Li says. "I love that. It's like the lineage continues."

Texto completo: Sen. Rand Paul suspects someone revoked President Trump's order to have former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance revoked.
The president announced in August that Brennan's security clearance was being stripped due to "erratic behavior" that disqualified him from having access to sensitive information. But the White House never followed through with the complicated bureaucratic process of revocation, a source told the New York Times in a report published last month.
Asked to comment about it in an interview on CNN, Paul said the "deep state," in which federal or military officials defy a democratically elected government, was likely to blame.
"Now the deep state is actually protecting their own and not listening to the president's orders," the Kentucky Republican said on Tuesday. "I was sitting in the White House when President Trump said I want his security clearance taken, and I saw the order given. I saw the chief of staff was there, not the current chief of staff, the previous chief of staff."TweetHe was referring to former White House chief of staff John Kelly.
"If they are working against ... the president that really does disrupt our country, does disrupt a representative democracy where the president makes a decision. If someone is countermanding that, I think we need to get to the bottom of that," Paul said.
A close ally of the president, Paul said he hopes Trump will conduct a search to find out who defied his order.
Brennan has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his tendency to question the motives of members of the U.S. intelligence community. He recently said he hopes Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel will "stand up" to Trump's "unprecedented act" of granting Attorney General William Barr "full and complete authority to declassify information" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Paul said he thinks Brennan has been "a partisan" and "abused his office in developing the Trump investigation. I think it was done under false pretenses and done for political reasons."

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- The large, brightly colored canvases sparkled beside the white walls of the Gagosian Gallery downtown. Larry Gagosian, the art world's megadealer, stood toward the back of the room in blue jeans and loafers while the star of the evening, Richard Prince, the artist perhaps best known for tweaking iconic images and pushing the boundaries of intellectual property, stood reticently at the gallery entrance in a blazer and black Dr. Martens boots.
The only hint that this show on Thursday night might stray from the norm was the faint smell of marijuana.
Mr. Prince, who turns 70 later this year, used the occasion to introduce both an exhibition of his vivid, faux-primitive paintings and drawings called "High Times" and a line of branded joints and cannabis vape pens in packaging adorned with his art.
"Everybody seems to be piling into pot," Mr. Gagosian said.
"It's like Clooney with tequila," he said, referring to the actor's brand of booze that went on to sell for around $ 1 billion. "Hopefully it will do as well."
As the number of states legalizing marijuana has grown in recent years, celebrities of all stripes have started their own pot brands -- Joe Montana, Mike Tyson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Willie Nelson and Snoop Dogg to name just a few -- but until now the high-end art world had not intersected with commercial weed.
High Times magazine, the counter culture publication revitalized by legalization, put Mr. Prince's work on its cover twice in the past year, including a garishly colored Prince sketch in the January edition with the headline, "High Art."
On Thursday, a fleet of chauffeured SUV limousines idled outside the gallery, testament to the wealthy patrons who mingled inside. Selected guests were shuttled to a nearby dispensary to test samples of Mr. Prince's marijuana brand, Katz + Dogg.
The dispensary, Moe Greens, is a short walk from the headquarters of Uber and Twitter and has a lounge where Mr. Prince's guests sat in avocado-green banquettes sucking on bongs and smoking joints. In a separate room, guests stepped up to a bar where they were offered dabs, the concentrated doses of marijuana extract that are heated and inhaled.
San Francisco has some of the country's most stringent laws against cigarette smoking but is also one of the only cities in the country that allows cannabis to be smoked in what are known as "consumption lounges."
Nate Haas, the chief executive of Moe Greens, said servers don't spend more than a few hours at a time in the smoking area lest they get a contact high.
When it was his turn to travel to the dispensary, Mr. Prince, accompanied by his daughter, Ella, walked into a haze of marijuana smoke.
"Do you want to take a dab," she asked her father, who declined.
For Mr. Prince, his marijuana venture completes a journey that began in the 1960s. He says the first time he tried marijuana was after flying to Los Angeles in 1967 from his home near Boston. He saw a Doors concert and then went to a party in Laurel Canyon where he was offered weed.
"I was already interested in art and music," he said. "It seemed like a kind of a natural fit."
The informality of the pot economy of the 1960s has been replaced by a vast cannabis commercial universe in California today: ubiquitous delivery services, apps that tell you the closest dispensary, legal or not, and an ever-growing list of pot-derived products, from hops-flavored drinks to roll-on pain reliever. High-end restaurants pair cannabis with morel mushroom pasta dishes (among many other delicacies), caterers offer pot-themed weddings and at least one company promises to sooth the nerves of anxious pets with pot snacks.
Mr. Prince says he took a three-decade hiatus from the drug but when he renewed his interest several years ago he was surprised and dismayed to learn how much more potent new strains had become.
He instructed the company that helped him formulate his marijuana products to make something much weaker, a nostalgic nod to the pot of his youth.
Ian Skelly, a partner at 710 Labs, a cannabis company, has chosen a variety called "ice cream cake," with a lower level of the main psychotropic ingredient, THC.
"You could smoke it first thing when you wake up and it wouldn't be overwhelming," Mr. Skelly said.
Mr. Skelly, whose specialty is knowing a vast repertoire of cannabis varieties, was one of the reasons that the Gagosian Gallery smelled like pot. The sweet odor seemed to radiate from him like perfume from eager spritzers competing at a department store cosmetics counter.
Mr. Prince said in an interview that he does not use marijuana for artistic inspiration, although the viewer might be forgiven for thinking that he did.
Roberta Smith, a co-chief art critic for The New York Times, said his new works "radiate an unusual heat."
"Their flat, dark surfaces are covered with cartoonish, robustly painted figures," she wrote. "Some of these creatures loom; others are tiny, and many flaunt bright colors and bristling masks. Still others are so simply outlined that they might be wearing onesies. Big, mitt-like hands are the norm. These figures conjure jubilant trick-or-treaters, comically armored avatars or rock fans leaving a concert."
A number of works had already sold when they were displayed in New York, said Mark Francis, a Gagosian director who handles Mr. Prince's work. But he wouldn't say how many or what they sold for. "We never talk to the press about prices," Mr. Francis said.
There is less mystery about the price of the cannabis: a five pack of pre-rolled joints of the ice cream cake variety goes for $ 146.
Mr. Prince says starting his cannabis brand felt like an appropriate extension of his art.
"It satisfies this idea of creating something or making something," he said. "It's not necessarily an accessory but it's not that different from making a T-shirt."
Mr. Prince has been seen by many in the art world as somewhat of a provocateur for pioneering the notion of appropriation, photographing images like the Marlboro Man and reframing them just enough to claim them his own, as he did with the "Cowboys" series in the early 1980s.
"The pictures I went after, 'stole,' were too good to be true. They were about wishful thinking, public pictures that happen to appear in the advertising sections of mass-market magazines," the artist has said. "I wanted to re-present the closest thing to the real thing."
But while starting a marijuana brand might feel provocative in some parts of the country like Idaho or Alabama, where it is still fully illegal, in California it was greeted with shrugs by some who attended.
"I heard about it and thought, yeah, of course," said Ben Rogers, a restaurant owner who came to both the opening and the dispensary. "There's such a marijuana culture here I was surprised this hasn't been done already."
Sean McAllister, a lawyer who specializes in the cannabis industry in California and Colorado, said marijuana entrepreneurs have become increasingly skeptical of celebrity brands. Artists like Carlos Santana and members of the Grateful Dead launching brands means little to a 22 year old today, he said.
For many consumers, Mr. McAllister said, a joint is just a joint.
"Honestly some of these artists don't have much connection with young people," he said.
Mr. Prince, whose auction record is $ 9.7 million for his painting, "Runaway Nurse," says he has ignored the business aspects of this venture.
Will it be a commercial success?
"I don't know, can you make money from selling weed?" he asked. "We'll find out."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON (AP) – The U.S. Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google’s business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports.
The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.
Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the comp- any’s search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Justice Department spokesman Jeremy Edwards and Google both declined to comment.
Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., has faced mounting scrutiny as regulators around the world have focused on tech companies’ business practices over the past year. In addition to the 2017 record fine, European regulators also slapped a $1.7 billion penalty on the company in March for barring websites from selling ads from rivals alongside some Google-served ads near search results.
Google says it has now ended that practice.
The company made changes voluntarily when the FTC shut down its investigation, including letting advertisers use information from their Google ad campaigns to create campaigns with rivals.
But an FTC staff report that was released years later showed that the agency staff had urged the presidentially-appointed commissioners to bring a lawsuit against Goo- gle. That never happened.
Google commands the lead in digital ad revenue by a wide margin, controlling 31.1% of global digital ad dollars, according to eMarketer’s 2019 estimates. Face- book is a distant second with 20.2%.
Politicians and outside antitrust analysts have expressed concern in recent years that Google controls too much of the digital ad process. It makes the technology, hosts the largest search site where ads appear and collects data from all ad campaigns that it runs.

Texto completo: LONG BEACH, Calif. -Even before he became president, Donald Trump was a character in the opera Anthony Davis was writing about racism and injustice, "The Central Park Five." But the role grew as the piece was reworked for its premiere in June at Long Beach Opera.
"Bring back the death penalty!" Trump, the opera character, sings in one scene. The line comes straight out of a full-page ad that Trump took out in New York newspapers in 1989, shortly after five African-American and Latino teenagers were charged in the brutal beating and rape of a jogger in Central Park.
In the wake of breathless news coverage that stoked fears of crime and inflamed racial tensions in the city, the five men spent years in prison for the attack before another man confessed, DNA evidence backed his account, and their convictions were overturned.
Their story has already been told in books, documentaries and a new Netflix series. Now it is becoming an opera.
"The Central Park Five" is one of several new works through which American opera companies are exploring questions of race, identity, personal history and the criminal justice system, as the often staid world of opera works to catch up to other art forms. When it comes to telling diverse stories by diverse creative teams, opera has remained strikingly pale, even compared with #OscarsSoWhite Hollywood.
"I have been so thrilled seeing these operas coming out now, writing blackness into history in this unlikely place: on the opera stage," Naomi Andre, a professor at the University of Michigan who wrote "Black Opera: History, Power, Engagement," said in an interview.
The same day "The Central Park Five" opens in California, "Fire Shut Up in My Bones," a new opera by the jazz trumpeter and film composer Terence Blanchard based on the memoir by Charles M. Blow, will open at Opera Theater of St. Louis. In July, the Glimmerglass Festival in Cooperstown, New York, will give the premiere of "Blue," an opera by the Tony Award-winning composer Jeanine Tesori about an African-American family whose son is killed by a police officer.
The focus on race in the opera houses comes after a white nationalist march in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia, was met with an equivocal response from the president; a series of scandals about state officials wearing blackface or using images of it in their yearbooks; and a stream of shootings of black men by the police. It is a change for an art form that told such stories only sporadically, if at all, in the past.
Davis may be considered the dean of African-American opera composers. He has been writing operas for more than 30 years, going back to "X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X," which Beverly Sills brought to New York City Opera in 1986, and "Amistad," which had its premiere at Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1997 - grand stories, grandly told.
In an interview, he remembered a conversation he once had with a prominent director who maintained that the age of the epic opera had passed.
"I told him, 'No, no, no, just because you white guys are done with it, we're not done,'" Davis recalled. "Because our stories have not been told. So forget that!"
Here is a look at the works having their premieres this summer.
Outrage as Opera: 'The Central Park Five'
In a cavernous, abandoned supermarket that Long Beach Opera had commandeered as a rehearsal space recently, the quintet of singers playing the five wrongfully convicted men were harmonizing about the fragility of their worlds when they began trading lines weighted with an all-too-recognizable history:
It can be snatched in a minute
A man can take it with a word
A woman can take it with a scream
A cop can take it...
...Just because!
Davis has been working on the opera, with a libretto by Richard Wesley, for years. An earlier version, called simply "Five," was given its premiere in Newark, New Jersey, in 2016 by the opera company Trilogy before it was reworked and renamed.
"I want people to experience the opera so they identify with them, so they think they're one of the five," said Davis, who wrote harrowing music for the interrogation scenes that led to what the young men later said were coerced confessions.
Derrell Acon, the bass-baritone singing the role of Antron McCray, one of the five, organized a conversation series with local community groups to discuss some of the issues raised by the opera. Some have drawn hundreds of people. But he said that ultimately the opera itself was the most powerful communicator.
"With opera it's like: Here's a story, I'll tell you what the story is, and I'm giving it to you in this very raw, emotional way, singing with my heart," he said. "It's almost like as audience members you don't have a choice but to listen. How you deal with it, or what you do next is up to you."
Memoir As Jazz-Inflected Opera: 'Fire Shut Up in My Bones'
"When I was in my 20s, man, I wanted to be Miles Davis - but then when you get a little bit older you can still listen to Miles Davis but you understand that that was him, and you have to find your own thing," Blanchard said in an interview. "That's kind of the relationship I'm having with Puccini's music right now."
After the success of his first work for Opera Theater of St. Louis - "Champion," in 2013 - Blanchard was asked by the company to come back for more. "Fire Shut Up in My Bones," is based on the memoir of the same title by Charles M. Blow, an op-ed columnist for The New York Times. The book centers on Blow's upbringing in a segregated town in Louisiana; the scars left by childhood molestation; meditations on masculinity and sexual identity; and efforts to escape cycles of violence.
The opera's librettist, Kasi Lemmons - a writer, actress and film director who has worked with Blanchard on several of her films, including "Eve's Bayou" and the coming "Harriet," about Harriet Tubman - said that she had been drawn to Blow's portrayal of his youth.
"He's a character who's very comfortable in his own skin, but the people around him are not comfortable with him," said Lemmons, who wrote lines like:
I was once a boy of peculiar grace.
A dangerous existence for a man of my race.
James Robinson, the artistic director in St. Louis, said that the company has tried to tell a more diverse array of stories that bring in new audiences.
"A lot of these are gateway operas, for people who have never seen opera before," said Robinson, also the director of a production of "Porgy and Bess" that will open the Metropolitan Opera's season in September. "The old idea was get them hooked on 'Madama Butterfly,' and then you'll get them for life. I was never a firm believer in that. I thought, Why not try to hook them on something new, more resonant, and then see how they like classic rep?"
Blanchard said that while he had been raised by an opera-loving father, it was not until recently that he had experienced the power of the art form live.
"Film is great, and it's been a big part of my life," said Blanchard, who has written powerful scores for many films, especially those by Spike Lee. "But sometimes if I'm going to the sixth screening, I'll say, 'Hey man, I'm going to go grab some dinner and I'll come back and do the Q and A after the film is done.' With opera it's not like that. Every time they do 'Champion' I want to go to every performance, because I find something different each time. It's a living, breathing thing that constantly evolves - and it's beautiful to watch."
Black Lives Matter As Opera: 'Blue'
When he was asked to write the libretto of "Blue," Tazewell Thompson reflected on the talks many black parents have with their children about how to safely survive encounters with the police.
"Imagine getting up every day, getting your child dressed and fed and sent off to school," Thompson said in an interview, "and wondering if your child will come home, wondering if your child would be locked up or frisked up or shot down."
That fear will suffuse the opera:
Don't wear your ball cap backwards.
Don't wear a hoodie.
Don't carry shiny objects.
"Blue" was conceived by Francesca Zambello, the artistic and general director of Glimmerglass, who commissioned it after watching the country convulse in recent years over a series of shootings of unarmed Black men by police officers. Washington National Opera, which she also leads, will also perform it at the Kennedy Center next year.
To write the score she enlisted Tesori, who has written a number of successful musical theater works, including "Fun Home" and "Caroline, or Change," and an opera, and who recently became one of the first women to have an opera commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera.
"It can only be an opera, this story, for me," Tesori said. "Because we are part of this giant system that has become a Greek tragedy, where there is not really a free will. We are riding the wave of hundreds and hundreds of years that have brought us here."
It was Tesori who came
up with one of the opera's twists. While Thompson had originally wanted the father of the African-American family at the center of the opera to be a musician, Tesori thought it would add complexity and nuance if they made him a police officer.
Thompson said that his initial response was negative. But he reconsidered, and interviewed African-American police officers about their lives and how they are seen by their
families and communities. Zambello said the opera had grown in depth as they tried to fairly represent different points of view of a fraught subject.
"It's not a protest opera, it's not an opera about police brutality," Thompson said. "But it is an opera about what happens to this family when this unarmed teenage boy is shot by a fellow police officer of the father, a white police officer."

Texto completo: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports.
The search giant was fined a record
$2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.
Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company's search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Justice Department spokesman Jeremy Edwards declined to comment Saturday. Google declined any comment.
Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., has faced mounting scrutiny as regulators around the world have focused on tech companies' business practices over the past year. In addition to the 2017 record fine, European regulators also slapped a $1.7 billion penalty on the company in March for barring websites from selling ads from rivals alongside some Google-served ads near search results.
Google said it has now ended that practice.
The company made changes voluntarily when the FTC shut down its investigation, including letting advertisers use information from their Google ad campaigns to create campaigns with rivals.
But an FTC staff report that was released years later showed that agency staff had urged the presidentially-appointed commissioners to bring a lawsuit against Google. That never happened.
Google commands the lead in digital ad revenue by a wide margin, controlling 31.1% of global digital ad dollars, according to eMarketer's 2019 estimates. Facebook is a distant second with 20.2%.
Politicians and outside antitrust analysts have expressed concern in recent years that Google controls too much of the digital ad process. It makes the technology, hosts the largest search site where ads appear and collects data from all ad campaigns that it runs.

Texto completo: Like a lot of other people, I first learned of the "worst sea disaster in U.S. Naval History" from watching a Steven Spielberg movie. "Jaws" has been playing on cable a lot lately, and the scene where the two shark hunters, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw compare scars, only to have Shaw reveal that he was one of 300 (from a crew of 1,100) survivors of the Indianapolis is enough to make the hairs stand up on your arm still.
The story of the Indianapolis is a story of secrecy, outright horror, bureaucracy, and a whole lot of CYA, as well as the inevitable scapegoating of someone not at all at fault, which in this case had a truly tragic dimension.
What gives the story it's true power is the irony that Spielberg recognized: the U.S.S. Indianapolis was a heavy cruiser that had just delivered the first atomic bomb to the island of Tinian where it shortly was to be used on Hiroshima. The story, however, is the most primordial one: basic human survival and, oh yes, sharks.
What is striking about Lynn Vincent and Sara Vladic's new book, "Indianapolis" (Simon & Schuster, $28) is how quickly everything happened. The first and only test of the atomic bomb took place at Almagordo, New Mexico on July 16, 1945, three days after the makings of "Fat Boy" were delivered to the Indianapolis in San Francisco, and one day after the ship had sailed.
In other words, the U.S. was gambling that the bomb would work before having proof that it would. By July 19, the Indianapolis reached Hawaii and by the 26th had offloaded the bomb at Tinian.
Top secret mission After a stop at Guam, the ship was scheduled to reach the Philippines which the U.S. had liberated in late 1944. At five minutes after midnight on July 30, the Japanese submarine I-58, commanded by Mochitsura Hashimoto fired two torpedoes into the side of the Indianapolis, sinking it in about 12 minutes and sending those members of the crew not killed by the explosions into the water.
Because the mission to deliver the bomb was top secret (personally ordered by President Truman), there was an effective blackout when the Indianapolis was overdue. Despite the fact that the U.S. had broken the Japanese military code, and thus knew that Hashimoto had sunk something, and despite the fact that a plane from Guam apparently witnessed the sinking, nobody raised an alarm when the ship was late.
It was not until midday of Aug. 2 that a PV-1 Ventura bomber, piloted by Lieutenant Chuck Gwinn spotted the oil slick, and flying lower realized that there were men in the water, a lot of men. Once the word went out, ships and planes showed up, and the last survivors, including the Indianapolis's captain, Charles McKay were rescued on Aug. 3. It was almost too late. Of the 1,100 men who served on the Indianapolis, about 1/4 were still alive, barely. Four days at sea may not seem like much, but four days at sea in circumstances like this, was unimaginable. For comparison, note that when the Titanic sank in 1912, the rescue ship showed up in six hours.
Shark-filled Pacific waters The reason Steven Spielberg made the Indianapolis disaster part of the backstory of "Jaws" was what happened during those four days. The Pacific was warm in July and full of sharks. We don't know exactly how many crew members fell victim to them, but it was a lot and, of course, the more who did, the more aggressive the sharks became, often literally leaping out of the water to grab them off of life rafts.
By releasing the news itself, before reporters who were on to the story, could do so, the Navy guaranteed control of the narrative. It would be the mid 1950s before the first books were written about the Indianapolis and 1975 before it entered the popular consciousness via the movies. In the meantime, someone had to be blamed and someone was blamed.
Despite the fact that U.S. Pacific command at Pearl Harbor knew that there were Japanese submarines in the Indianapolis sailing area, no one told Captain McVay. It was standard operating procedure under such circumstances for ships to stop zigzagging at dusk, and that is what McVay ordered on July 30. As a result, he was brought to trial by general court martial for "culpable inefficiency in the performance of his duty," and "negligently endangering the lives of others." He was found guilty on Dec. 19, 1945.
McVay spent the rest of his life dealing with outraged families who blamed him, and blaming himself. In 1968, he walked out to the steps in front of his house, sat down, and put a pistol to his head.
Pivotal science fair project It took an eighth grade Florida middle schooler, 30 years later, doing a history fair project to set matters right. Hunter Scott contacted, or attempted to contact every living survivor of the Indianapolis, found news articles and primary sources, and even contacted Hashimoto, who was still living in Japan as a Shinto priest. To a man, the survivors were still outraged over McVay's treatment.
Scott's congressman, Joe Scarborough put his project on display in his office, which attracted the attention of reporters, and also Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who recognized the degree of disservice done to McVay and was determined to rectify it. On Sept. 14, 1999, the Senate Armed Services Committee, chaired by Virginia Senator John Warner (a former Navy Secretary) held a day-long hearing on the Indianapolis. Warner, extremely protective of the Navy, was reluctant to allow a Senate resolution exonerating McVay for a floor vote. The turning point came when the elderly Hashimoto wrote him a personal letter, urging him to correct the "unjust conviction." It took nearly another year, but in October 2000, the measure passed the Senate.
I'm not quite sure what lessons we are supposed to draw from Indianapolis: the indomitability of the human spirit, the inclination for the truth to finally be revealed, the willingness of individuals to seek it out, etc. Maybe.
However, I can't let go of the fact that in the end, innocent people were sacrificed for the integrity of institutions, and institutions lost their integrity anyway, or at least had it chipped away.
Losing author Tony Horwitz One of the books I was going to write about later this summer was Tony Horwitz's "Spying on the South: An Odyssey Across the American Divide," in which Horwitz traced the travels of New York Times reporter Frederick Law Olmstead across the South in the 1850s. But then came news that Horwitz, in the middle of a book tour collapsed and died Monday in Chevy Chase, Maryland at the age of 60. I suppose I will still write about his book, but it will be tempered by the knowledge that there won't be any more.
There is already a lot of nonsense — from people who should know better — about Horwitz being a great historian. He was not a historian. He was a journalist who explored the effects of history on modernity, particularly the effects of the Civil War and the divisions that led to it. He was good at it, a lot better than some of the people who tried to emulate him. What always struck me about Horowitz, particularly in the book for which he is best known, "Confederates in the Attic," was his good humor toward people with whom he disagreed. He was not disagreeable and was often downright funny, an attribute which is sorely lacking in our age where even humor is weaponized. "Confederates in the Attic" was about the re-enactor culture; I don't know of a single re-enactor who disliked it.

Older People Are Contributing To Climate Change, But Also Suffering From It

Texto completo: When it comes to discussing climate change, older people may have one advantage: They have watched it happen.
In the nine Northeastern states, for instance, where average winter temperatures climbed 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit between 1970 and 2000, they have seen fewer snow-covered days and more shrubs flowering ever earlier.
And they have experienced hotter summers. In New York City, daily summer temperatures at LaGuardia Airport have risen 0.7 degrees per decade since 1970, according to the city’s Panel on Climate Change.
Older Americans are also significant contributors to climate change. A just-published study has found that residential energy consumption rises as a resident’s age increases.
Buildings, and residential buildings in particular, are the world’s largest energy consumers. Two researchers recently analyzed federal data on household energy usage that was gathered from 1987 to 2009 and involved nearly 30,000 owner-occupied units. Distinct patterns emerged by age.
Usage was lowest among young adults, who typically occupy smaller households, said Hossein Estiri, a computational demographer at Harvard Medical School and an author on the paper.
Consumption rose rapidly among the 30-to-54-year-old cohort - “the peak of having kids and larger houses,” he noted - then stabilized when people reached their 60s. But “after 70, it goes up and it keeps going up,” Estiri said.
The trend persisted when the researchers controlled for income and housing types, but it varied by geography. When the researchers looked at climate zones, they found that “energy consumption in warmer regions becomes really elevated for the older group.”
Why do older people use more juice? The study could not provide explanations, but “there might be more need for air-conditioning,” Estiri speculated. “Or older people may not be able to maintain their homes as well” to conserve energy. “Maybe their appliances are old and less efficient. All of these could contribute.”
The climate change story has plenty of villains; seniors are hardly wrecking the environment on their own. Still, the demographic trends do not bode well.
“There will be more warm days in most areas because of climate change,” Estiri said. “There will be more energy use by the older group. And because of the population aging, there will be more people in that age group. These trends will amplify each other.”
But in a world that is both warming and graying, older adults suffer disproportionately from climate change.
Consider extreme heat. “It puts a stress on anybody’s body, but if you’re old and frail, it’s harder,” said Patrick Kinney, who studies the effects of climate on health at the Boston University School of Public Health. In addition, he said, “certain medications older people take, for blood pressure or cholesterol, reduce the body’s ability to thermo-regulate.”
The risk of heatstroke, which is potentially fatal, increases because older adults may be less mobile and thus less able to reach cooler locations in a heat wave. They may also be socially isolated and less able to seek help.
With impaired cognitive function, “you might be less able to judge what to do,” Kinney said. The air pollution often associated with heat waves intensifies the problems. The Chicago heat wave of July 1995, for instance, caused 514 heat-related deaths; people older than 65 accounted for 72% of the fatalities.
Humans can adapt to these extremes, of course. Kinney and his colleagues found that the risk of dying from heat in New York City declined 65% from the early 1970s to 2006 as the proportion of households with air conditioning surged. But air conditioners also contribute to climate change.
Any particular episode of extreme weather may be linked only loosely to climate change. But the overall relationship is clear: Aside from heat waves, climate change will bring other kinds of extreme weather and disasters. Elderly people will be disproportionately affected.
“The mortality is always higher among older people,” said Lisa Brown, director of the Risk and Resilience Research Lab at Palo Alto University. “They can’t get out of harm’s way fast enough.”
An unhealthy 75-year-old in a care facility may fare better than a healthy 75-year-old living on her own, Brown pointed out. The facility most likely has a generator and stockpiles of food and water; few individuals do.
But in California, Pacific Gas and Electric recently announced that it would consider turning off transmission lines when deemed necessary to prevent wildfires.
“If the power goes off for three or four days, people here are not prepared,” Brown said. She thinks older people - indeed, all people - should always have enough food and water to last five to seven days and a plan to evacuate or seek help in emergencies.
Perhaps older Americans, as disproportionate contributors to and victims of climate change, could play an additional role, as active participants in the global campaign to mitigate the damage.
A decade ago, Karl Pillemer, a gerontologist at Cornell University, began exploring environmental volunteerism among older adults. He found that most environmental organizations had not recruited older members or adapted to support their participation, leaving a major resource untapped. He established a program called RISE, for Retirees in Service to the Environment, to prepare older volunteers for leadership roles in environmental stewardship.
Older volunteers would benefit by working to halt climate change, Pillemer said: “Participants gain fulfillment from activities that have results they will not be here to enjoy.”
Later-in-life, or “generative,” volunteerism has been shown to increase health and psychological well-being.
“If the boomers could be motivated to take this on as their defining generational legacy, they could have incredible impact,” Pillemer said. “With their huge numbers, they could potentially do something about it.”

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - More than a dozen Democratic presidential hopefuls flocked to California on Saturday for the chance to make their cases to thousands of activists in the nation's largest liberal stronghold during a three-day gathering of the state party.
California's own Sen. Kamala Harris looked to make a show of force in the prime first speaking slot to kick off the day's main event, and her campaign even emblazoned the official convention lanyards with her name. But it was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who electrified the crowd the most among the early morning speakers, bringing the Democratic Party's most faithful voters to their feet repeatedly.
"Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses," Warren said in a thinly veiled shot at former Vice President Joe Biden, who has expressed hope the GOP will have "an epiphany" after President Donald Trump is gone. "But our country is in a crisis. The time for small ideas is over."
Biden was the only major candidate not attending the weekend gathering, opting instead to campaign in Ohio.
Harris has a deep connection to California voters; she has won statewide office three times, once to the U.S. Senate and twice as the state's attorney general. Before that, she was elected as San Francisco's district attorney. In her remarks, she reminded the crowd of their long history together, then brought the crowd to its feet with her call for impeachment hearings for Trump.
"We need to begin impeachment proceedings and we need a new commander in chief!" she declared.
Acting Pentagon chief slams China's tech policy in speech
SINGAPORE - U.S. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Saturday denounced China's efforts to steal technology from other nations and militarize man-made outposts in the South China Sea as a "tool kit of coercion," saying activities by Beijing the U.S. perceives as hostile must end.
In his first major speech on the international stage, Shanahan mixed sharp criticism of China and warnings of North Korea's "extraordinary" threat with vows that the U.S. will remain strongly committed to the Indo-Pacific region and is ready to invest billions of dollars in securing its stability.
While he didn't specifically name China in early parts of his speech, he made clear who his target was, making pointed references to Beijing's campaign to put advanced weapons systems on disputed islands in the region.
Justice Department preparing to investigate Google practices
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports.
The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.
Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company's search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Officials: 79 people injured in blast at Russia explosives plant
MOSCOW - Russia's health ministry says 79 people have been injured in an explosion in a plant manufacturing TNT.
The blast took place Saturday in Dzerzhinsk, 250 miles east of Moscow. An investigation is underway but the cause of the blast has not been determined.
The ministry said 38 employees at the plant and 41 local residents sought treatment after the blast. It said 15 were hospitalized, one in serious condition.
The blast broke windows in about 180 residential buildings near the plant, the state news agency Tass reported.
Dmitry Krasnov, deputy governor of the region that includes Dzerzhinsk, said earlier on state TV that two people were missing in the blast, but later said that information had not been confirmed.
Judge orders captain arrested in Danube sinking
BUDAPEST, Hungary - A Hungarian judge on Saturday ordered the formal arrest of a captain whose Viking river cruise ship collided with a sightseeing boat on the Danube River, sinking the tourist boat and leaving seven South Koreans dead and 21 people missing.
Authorities said water levels in Budapest are expected to fall quickly in the coming days, helping efforts to salvage the wreckage that may still contain victims' bodies.
The judge ordered the 64-year-old Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn cruise ship formally arrested for 30 days. He said the captain could be released on bail - subject to him wearing a tracking device and remaining in Budapest - but prosecutors are appealing that decision.
Divers so far have been unable to even approach the wreckage.
In speech to leaders, Saudi king slams Iranian attacks
MECCA, Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia's King Salman slammed Iran over recent attacks targeting the kingdom, describing the incidents on Saturday in a speech before Muslim leaders gathered in Mecca as "terrorist acts" that threaten global energy supplies.
It was the monarch's strongest words yet since tensions spiked in recent weeks between the two regional heavyweights.
Iran had a representative present at the 57-nation summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, but its top leadership did not attend.
The Islamic summit drew political figures and heads of state from countries spanning Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
They come with widely varying policies and priorities, but share a common reverence for the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem.

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called WikiLeaks a "nonstate hostile intelligence service." Apparently Julian Assange agrees.
In its new 18-count indictment of Assange for multiple violations of the Espionage Act, the Justice Department notes that Assange told former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning that WikiLeaks had originally described itself as an "intelligence agency" for the people.
Now, at long last, the head of that enemy intelligence agency is facing a possible 175 years in a federal penitentiary for his theft of American secrets.
The damage Assange has done is unfathomable. In 2010, he exploded what he called his "thermonuclear device" – releasing more than a quarter of a million classified State Department diplomatic cables. According to the indictment, those cables "included names of persons throughout the world who provided information to the U.S. government in circumstances in which they could reasonably expect that their identities would be kept confidential.
These sources included journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents who were living in repressive regimes and reported to the United States the abuses of their own government, and the political conditions within their countries, at great risk to their own safety."
The indictment cites specific examples of sources WikiLeaks burned inside China, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Moreover, Assange's decision to release 90,000 Afghanistan war-related activity reports also revealed the identities of at least 100 Afghans who were informing on the Taliban. The indictment quotes a New York Times interview with a Taliban leader who told the paper, "We are studying the report. We knew about the spies and people who collaborate with U.S. forces. We will investigate through our own secret service whether the people mentioned are really spies working for the U.S. If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them."
The indictment points out that WikiLeaks copies were also found in Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. During the raid that killed the al-Qaida leader, U.S. forces recovered "a letter from bin Laden to another member of the terrorist organization al-Qaida in which bin Laden requested that the member gather the DoD material posted to WikiLeaks" as well as a response from that al-Qaida operative providing him with the secret U.S. government documents Assange had provided.
Indeed, Assange's disclosures nearly blew the bin Laden operation. Just one week before the raid, Assange released his "Gitmo files "which contained information that could have tipped off bin Laden that the CIA was closing in on him. One of Assange's stolen documents – the file on Abu Faraj al-Libi, al-Qaida's captured operational commander – revealed that Faraj had "reported on al-Qaida's methods for choosing and employing couriers, as well as preferred communications means"; that he had "received a letter from UBL's designated courier" who was "the official messenger between UBL and others in Pakistan"; and that "in mid-2003, [Faraj] moved his family to Abbottabad, and worked between Abbottabad and Peshawar," Pakistan.
The CIA tracked bin Laden down to Abbottabad by following his courier, thanks, in large part, to information provided by Faraj. Had bin Laden read that document detailing what Faraj had told the agency, he could have known that the United States had made the connection between his courier and his Abbottabad hideout. Fortunately, U.S. Special Operations forces did not give bin Laden time to figure it out.
The indictment leaves out much of the damage Assange did, such as his 2014 release of classified CIA documents exposing how CIA operatives maintain cover while traveling through airports; his 2016 release of documents detailing European Union military operations to intercept refugee boats traveling to Europe from terrorist-infested regions along the Libyan coast; and his 2016 exposure of top-secret documents describing NSA intercepts of foreign government communications.
Some are concerned that the newest Assange indictment will help set a precedent to go after investigative journalists who publish classified information. But as I wrote in 2010, unlike "reputable news organizations, Assange did not give the U.S. government an opportunity to review the classified information WikiLeaks was planning to release so they could raise national security objections." So responsible journalists have nothing to fear.
Regardless, Assange is not a journalist. He is a spy. The fact that he gave stolen U.S. intelligence to al-Qaida, the Taliban, China, Iran and other adversaries via a website rather than dead-drops is irrelevant. And he has no remorse for the harm he has caused. He once called the innocent people hurt by his disclosures "collateral damage" and admitted WikiLeaks might get "blood on our hands."
Sorry, he does not get to aid and abet our enemies, put countless lives at risk and then hide behind the First Amendment. The Justice Department is right to indict him for his crimes.

A Big Piece of TV History: Tony Soprano's House Hits the Market

Texto completo: The house that Tony Soprano called home is listing for sale 20 years after its television debut.
The roughly 5,600-square-foot home in North Caldwell, N.J., where America's favorite fictional mobster scooped up his morning newspaper and swam with ducks, is being listed for sale by the owners, Patti and Victor Recchia, at a "starting price" of $ 3.4 million. Set on a 1.5-acre lot, it includes the main house with four bedrooms, four full bathrooms and a powder room; two two-car garages; and a detached one-bedroom guesthouse. The property taxes are $ 34,005 a year.
The price is ambitious for a neighborhood where comparable homes have sold for between $ 1.5 million and $ 2 million, according to Zillow. But Mr. Recchia, 65, the owner of Fourth Generation Construction, which built the house, as well as more than 20 in the development where it's located, said the value exceeds the brick and mortar.
"Those things can be quantified," said Mr. Recchia, "but I don't think you can quantify the intrinsic value of this home."
The house, where Tony Soprano pulled into the long, curving driveway in the opening credits of "The Sopranos," was both a frequent filming location and the inspiration for a meticulous replica of the interiors at Silvercup Studios in Queens, N.Y.
Scenes in the pilot episode were filmed in the home's kitchen, where viewers first met Tony's long-suffering wife, Carmela, and their children, A.J. and Meadow. Tony, the sullen gangster with mommy issues, waded into the backyard pool with a family of ducks and had a panic attack on the patio in the same episode.
While later indoor scenes were mostly filmed on a Silvercup soundstage, the production crew returned to the Recchias' home year after year for exterior shots. So do some die-hard fans.
"I was pulling out of the driveway and I noticed a few fellas on their motorcycles coming down the cul-de-sac," said Ms. Recchia, about a recent interaction. "So I open my car window just to acknowledge them, and they say, 'Hi, Mrs. Soprano! We're not going to mess anything up, just want to take a couple photos."'
"They'll pull up in like a limo or something, get out in a robe, and pick up a newspaper," said Mr. Recchia, who encountered a father and son who said the photo op was part of a Father's Day present.
An unofficial Facebook page for the house has more than 1,200 "visits" at the address, along with dozens of selfies by grinning fans posed in front of the driveway. When the actor James Gandolfini, who played Tony, died suddenly in 2013, fans left flowers, candles and a bag of dried ziti near the curb.
"We've met a lot of great people," Mr. Recchia said.
The house was one of 150 considered for the Sopranos' home, Ilene S. Landress, a producer for the series, told The New York Times in 2002. "And from then on, the Recchia house determined the look of everything," she said, while noting that the couple's real décor was far more tasteful.
Today the home, which was built in 1987, has undergone some cosmetic changes, but retains much of what made the property a character in its own right. Gone are the pickled oak cabinets in the kitchen that defined a certain vision of late 1990s suburbia, but the long kitchen island that anchored the show's domestic drama still stands.
In the dining room, with pink wallpaper and a grand tray ceiling, Carmela, played by Edie Falco, once pulled an assault rifle from inside a decorative column on the wall, because she thought someone was "jimmying a window." It turned out to be her teenage daughter, Meadow, trying to sneak into the house through her bedroom window.
The great room, with an octagonal vaulted ceiling, a bar and a white stone fireplace, has matching sets of French doors with gold-trim curtains that lead out to the frequently filmed patio, which has a cabana and breezeway access to the guesthouse.
This was also the Recchias' home for 32 years, and the real and imagined converge in all corners of the house. In the family room, with a skylight and green carpet, is a tall promotional poster for "The Sopranos," signed by the actors and crew. Over six seasons, the crew used the property somewhere between 30 and 50 times, the couple said. They declined to say how much they were paid for use of the space.
On a recent tour, Mr. Recchia played home videos of the cast filming the pilot episode in his kitchen. In another video, Mr. Gandolfini joked poolside about not wanting to leave. "I'll be here every Thursday at 7," he said with a smile.
As the show became a critical darling and commercial juggernaut for HBO, the Recchias hosted still more celebrities. There was Steve Buscemi, who played Tony Soprano's cousin, Tony Blundetto, and also directed some episodes. Annie Leibovitz, the famed photographer, shot a portrait of Mr. Gandolfini looking somber in the sitting room. Yogi Berra, the legendary Yankees catcher and manager, swung by once to watch the filming. "The crew was mesmerized," Ms. Recchia said.
The Recchias are selling because their adult son moved out many years ago and they don't need as much space. They plan to stay in New Jersey.
Because the couple eschewed working with a real estate agent on the sale, Mr. Recchia is asking qualified bidders to submit offers and proof of funds by June 21 to the email address sopranoshouseforsale@gmail.com. They are bracing for a flood of emails, but said they believe this is the best way to market a home with this kind of cachet.
As for the price, he believes the home has more in common with movie memorabilia or exotic cars than it does with other houses.
Perhaps the right buyer will feel the same way. On a recent morning, a Maybach with tinted windows was parked outside the Recchias' home. As another car approached the cul-de-sac, the unseen driver sped off.

N.S.A. Denies That Its Tool Was Used in Hacking of Baltimore, Lawmaker Says

Texto completo: BALTIMORE -- A Maryland congressman said on Friday that the National Security Agency had denied that one of its hacking tools, stolen in 2017, was used in a ransomware attack on Baltimore's government that had disrupted city services for more than three weeks.
The statement, made by Representative C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, came in response to an article in The New York Times last weekend. The Times was told by people directly involved in the investigation in Baltimore that the N.S.A. tool, EternalBlue, was found in the city's network by all four contractors hired to study the attack and restore computer services.
Investigators are still trying to determine the exact chronology of the attack. The leading theory is that hackers broke in through an open server in Baltimore's network, installed a back door and then used EternalBlue to move across the city's computers searching for valuable servers to infect, said the people involved in the investigation.
This week, the contractors discovered an additional software tool, called a web shell, on Baltimore's networks. They believe the web shell may have been used in conjunction with EternalBlue and another hacking technique known as "pass-the-hash," which uses stolen credentials, to spread the ransomware.
The people involved in the investigation spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it on the record.
N.S.A. officials are naturally sensitive to reports of continuing damage done by their hacking tools, stolen and released on the internet in 2017 by a still-unidentified group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. EternalBlue and other N.S.A. tools were used in attacks by North Korea and Russia later that year that caused billions of dollars in damage to corporations and governments around the world.
More recently, according to cybersecurity experts, EternalBlue has turned up in attacks on local governments in the United States, which often used aging equipment and fail to keep their software up to date. A patch issued by Microsoft in 2017, but apparently never installed in Baltimore, should have made Windows secure against EternalBlue.
An N.S.A. spokesman declined to comment on the congressman's statement or the Times article, which was published online on Saturday. A spokesman for Baltimore's mayor's office also said he could not comment on the continuing investigation.
Mr. Ruppersberger, a Democrat whose district includes the N.S.A.'s Fort Meade campus south of Baltimore, said in his statement that he had been briefed by "senior leaders" of the N.S.A. They told him that "there is no evidence at this time that EternalBlue played a role in the ransomware attack affecting Baltimore City."
He added: "I'm told it was not used to gain access nor to propagate further activity within the network."
The statement did not explain how N.S.A. learned the details of the forensic investigation in Baltimore, which is being carried out by the private contractors. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also opened an inquiry but has not commented publicly on any findings.
The N.S.A. routinely hunts for security flaws in widely used software and uses them to penetrate foreign computer networks and gather intelligence. It used EternalBlue for such spying for at least five years before the Shadow Brokers stole the tool and posted it on the web to be grabbed and used by foreign states and criminal hackers.
"Our country needs cybertools to counter our enemies, including terrorists, but we also have to protect these tools from leaks," Mr. Ruppersberger said. "We can't ignore the damage that past breaches have done to American companies and, possibly, American cities. Now, our focus now should be on Baltimore's recovery."
Some former N.S.A. officials have suggested that Baltimore bears some responsibility for the attack, because it evidently had not installed updates to Windows that might have kept its system safe. But Mr. Ruppersberger said "the reality is that patching can be hard and requires resources that many municipalities don't have."
He said he thought the federal government "needs to do more to help municipalities better protect their networks."

Klopp leaves his stamp on Liverpool's crown

Texto completo: When Jurgen Klopp bounced into Liverpool in October 2015, flashing his toothy smile, hugging everyone he could get his arms around and announcing his arrival at an introductory news conference that was part stand-up routine, it was the start of a revolution.
A revolution of style and substance, of science and spirit. It was a revolution that finally triumphed Saturday with Klopp and Liverpool beating Tottenham 2-0 in a historic Champions League final in Madrid.
The goals came from Mohamed Salah in the second minute and Divock Origi three minutes from the end of regulation. Tottenham dominated everywhere but on the scoresheet, outshooting, outpossessing and outpassing Liverpool.

But that's often how revolutions go: You don't have to win all the battles, just the war.
"Did you ever see a team like this?" Klopp enthused afterward, a gold Champions League winner's medal draped around his neck. "This is unbelievable. Really the best night of my life, my professional life."
When Klopp came to Anfield four years ago the hidebound English soccer establishment looked at color and personality the same way butchers consider vegetarians: with disdain. It preferred managers stern and taciturn like Jose Mourinho, the self-described "special one." Klopp tweaked that establishment, dubbing himself the "normal one" when he arrived from Germany, where his touchy-feely brand of enthusiasm had made Borussia Dortmund into a Bundesliga power yet had won the manager the often-derisive nickname of the Teutonic Care Bear.
Now after two appearances in the Champions League final, one title and the most league wins in three seasons of any Liverpool coach since Bob Paisley more than a generation ago, Klopp's success has other Premier League teams wondering if they, too, should embrace embracing.
But Liverpool's revolution went far deeper than that. The club is owned by John Henry, the American investment manager who made a fortune by designing an algorithm that foresaw fluctuations in the soybean market.
Henry is a true believer in the power of analytics, so when he bought the Boston Red Sox in 2002, the team became an early proponent of the data-driven reformation that remade the sport. Two seasons after Henry took over, the Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years.
When Henry bought Liverpool in 2010, the Reds, once the top team in England, had gone two decades without a first-division title. The new management team had neither the money nor the desire to try to change that by outspending the Russian billionaires and Emirate royals who were buying up some of the EPL's other teams.
It could, however, outthink them by using advanced calculations, statistical formulas and predictive models to see what video and the naked eye missed.
Analytics were still new to many EPL teams and few coaches believed in them when Henry began importing the Red Sox culture to Liverpool. Klopp was more agnostic than nonbeliever, though.
When he arrived the club already had a full analytics department led by Ian Graham, who earned a doctorate in theoretical physics at Cambridge before making his way to Liverpool. Graham, whose work was recently profiled in the New York Times, leads a staff there that includes a former astrophysics student, a junior chess champion with an advanced degree in math and an American with a doctorate in high-energy physics from Harvard.
With Klopp, they remade the Liverpool roster, including nine of Saturday's 11 starters -- among them Salah, who Graham recommended, and goalkeeper Alisson Becker, for whom the team spent $90 million in the summer transfer window -- either coming to the club or making their first-team debuts since the manager's arrival.
Saturday they became one of the greatest boy bands to come out of Liverpool since the Beatles.
The final with Tottenham was the first all-EPL matchup in Europe's most important club competition since 2008. But the drama that had built in the three weeks leading up to the match evaporated in the first 30 seconds when Tottenham's Moussa Sissoko was called for a hand ball in the penalty area. Salah calmly converted from the spot to give Liverpool a 1-0 lead.
For Salah the goal was reward, if not redemption, for the pain and frustration of his first Champions League final last year. After scoring a record 32 times during the EPL season, Salah came into the continental championship a marked man -- so Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos took him out in the 30th minute, knocking him to the ground with a rough tackle that ended Salah's night.
Missing its talisman striker, Liverpool went quietly, losing 3-1.
Salah was not to be denied this time. Despite missing the second leg of the Champions League semifinals because of a concussion, he would not be sidelined again Saturday and his goal changed the complexion of a game that had just started.
With the early lead, Liverpool ceded possession to defend. Though Tottenham had the ball 60% of the time, they couldn't get it past Alisson, who faced eight shots on target. Origi, one of the heroes of the Salah-less semifinal win over Barcelona, then came off the bench to score an insurance goal in the 87th minute, clinching a sixth European title for Liverpool and giving the Reds twice as many as any other English team.
That allowed Klopp, the Teutonic Care Bear, to shed another nickname that has stuck to him in recent years: that of runner-up rather than front-runner. Three times he made it to final of a continental tournament, only to come home empty-handed. This year he left the stadium hugging the trophy.
"It took a while, obviously," he said.
He was smiling when he said it.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Female genital cutting, a traditional ritual in many countries, can cause lasting harm to women, leaving them with pain, sexual dysfunction and emotional trauma. For a recent front-page story, Pam Belluck, a health and science reporter for The Times, spent time over two years with four women who were cut as girls in Africa and are now living in the United States, where they sought the help of a surgeon, Dr. Ivona Percec at the University of Pennsylvania. The surgeon performed a procedure known as clitoral reconstruction, aiming to ease pain, improve sexual sensation and restore the appearance of intact female anatomy.
The surgery is still viewed with skepticism by some medical experts, and the World Health Organization cautions that there isn't enough evidence of its safety or effectiveness for women who have experienced cutting (also called female genital mutilation).
But demand for such operations is growing as women who have been genitally cut move to places where medicine is advanced, insurance often covers surgery and women have more autonomy. The four women shared some of their most personal experiences with Ms. Belluck, and one of them, Aminata Welcome, allowed Ms. Belluck to be in the operating room during her surgery. Ms. Belluck recently discussed her reporting. Her answers have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.
What made you want to tackle this subject?
We're talking about 200 million women and girls in the world today that have undergone female genital cutting. And in their home countries, and as they move to the Western world, it's unclear how to best take care of their physical health concerns and their emotional health concerns. Doctors in the Western world, if they know about it, are often uncomfortable asking.
We just felt like it would be very valuable to look at what is available to help women in this circumstance since there are so many.
What was it like to be in the room for Ms. Welcome's surgery? What did that allow you to bring to the story?
It really helped me see step by step what the procedure involved, so I could describe it more accurately to our readers. And just being there helps you identify a bit more with what the patient is going through and what her body has been through. I think that is valuable.
How did you approach the process of talking with the women about their intimate and traumatic experiences?
I have a history of writing stories about very sensitive topics, such as mental illness and postpartum depression. I feel like the best way to tell the story and show our readers what is happening -- and, honestly, also to reduce stigma -- is to bring out the stories of real people who are going through those experiences.
I have a lot of respect for the fact that they are allowing me to hear their story. I think that maybe that comes through, that sense that I am not making any judgments. I'm just listening and asking questions and letting them know that they can feel comfortable sharing what they would like to share. I think it's just about investing time and attention and respect and allowing them to ask me questions if they want: What is this story going to look like? They have agency and really valuable stories to tell.
What do you want readers to take away?
I think maybe first and foremost, a better understanding of a very large part of the world where this has been a cultural practice, and an understanding of what women from these cultures have experienced.
Is there anything else that you'd hope readers think about?
One thing that several people have mentioned to me is that they found the story very notable for its clarity and open way of talking about female anatomy. This has not historically been a strength of The Times or lots of other places. There is an issue with being able to describe women's bodies without euphemisms and without masking things. If we're able to do that, it contributes both to equality and to not giving a message that women should be ashamed or feel uncomfortable about their anatomy.
My editor, Celia Dugger, and I both felt that because these women are speaking openly, and they feel comfortable enough to talk about these very detailed things, we should write it the way they say it because that is the reality for the women. These are their bodies and there is nothing to be ashamed of.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - More than a dozen Democratic presidential hopefuls flocked to California on Saturday for the chance to make their cases to thousands of activists in the nation's largest liberal stronghold during a three-day gathering of the state party.
California's own Sen. Kamala Harris looked to make a show of force in the prime first speaking slot to kick off the day's main event, and her campaign even emblazoned the official convention lanyards with her name. But it was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who electrified the crowd the most among the early morning speakers, bringing the Democratic Party's most faithful voters to their feet repeatedly.
"Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses," Warren said in a thinly veiled shot at former Vice President Joe Biden, who has expressed hope the GOP will have "an epiphany" after President Donald Trump is gone. "But our country is in a crisis. The time for small ideas is over."
Biden was the only major candidate not attending the weekend gathering, opting instead to campaign in Ohio.
Harris has a deep connection to California voters; she has won statewide office three times, once to the U.S. Senate and twice as the state's attorney general. Before that, she was elected as San Francisco's district attorney. In her remarks, she reminded the crowd of their long history together, then brought the crowd to its feet with her call for impeachment hearings for Trump.
"We need to begin impeachment proceedings and we need a new commander in chief!" she declared.
Acting Pentagon chief slams China's tech policy in speech
SINGAPORE - U.S. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Saturday denounced China's efforts to steal technology from other nations and militarize man-made outposts in the South China Sea as a "tool kit of coercion," saying activities by Beijing the U.S. perceives as hostile must end.
In his first major speech on the international stage, Shanahan mixed sharp criticism of China and warnings of North Korea's "extraordinary" threat with vows that the U.S. will remain strongly committed to the Indo-Pacific region and is ready to invest billions of dollars in securing its stability.
While he didn't specifically name China in early parts of his speech, he made clear who his target was, making pointed references to Beijing's campaign to put advanced weapons systems on disputed islands in the region.
Justice Department preparing to investigate Google practices
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports.
The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.
Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company's search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Officials: 79 people injured in blast at Russia explosives plant
MOSCOW - Russia's health ministry says 79 people have been injured in an explosion in a plant manufacturing TNT.
The blast took place Saturday in Dzerzhinsk, 250 miles east of Moscow. An investigation is underway but the cause of the blast has not been determined.
The ministry said 38 employees at the plant and 41 local residents sought treatment after the blast. It said 15 were hospitalized, one in serious condition.
The blast broke windows in about 180 residential buildings near the plant, the state news agency Tass reported.
Dmitry Krasnov, deputy governor of the region that includes Dzerzhinsk, said earlier on state TV that two people were missing in the blast, but later said that information had not been confirmed.
Judge orders captain arrested in Danube sinking
BUDAPEST, Hungary - A Hungarian judge on Saturday ordered the formal arrest of a captain whose Viking river cruise ship collided with a sightseeing boat on the Danube River, sinking the tourist boat and leaving seven South Koreans dead and 21 people missing.
Authorities said water levels in Budapest are expected to fall quickly in the coming days, helping efforts to salvage the wreckage that may still contain victims' bodies.
The judge ordered the 64-year-old Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn cruise ship formally arrested for 30 days. He said the captain could be released on bail - subject to him wearing a tracking device and remaining in Budapest - but prosecutors are appealing that decision.
Divers so far have been unable to even approach the wreckage.
In speech to leaders, Saudi king slams Iranian attacks
MECCA, Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia's King Salman slammed Iran over recent attacks targeting the kingdom, describing the incidents on Saturday in a speech before Muslim leaders gathered in Mecca as "terrorist acts" that threaten global energy supplies.
It was the monarch's strongest words yet since tensions spiked in recent weeks between the two regional heavyweights.
Iran had a representative present at the 57-nation summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, but its top leadership did not attend.
The Islamic summit drew political figures and heads of state from countries spanning Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
They come with widely varying policies and priorities, but share a common reverence for the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem.
Lunch with Buffett: An anonymous bidder has offered more than $4.5 million to have a private lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett, shattering the previous record of nearly $3.5 million. An online auction that raises money for the Glide Foundation's work to help the homeless in San Francisco ended Friday night with a winning bid of $4,567,888. It's the 20th year the Berkshire Hathaway CEO has participated in the pricey lunch auction, giving the winner the chance to talk with the renowned investor and philanthropist. Bidding starts at $25,000. Buffett has raised nearly $30 million for the charity over the years. The winning bidder and up to seven friends get to dine with Buffett.

Iowa not immune to foreign threats on research

Texto completo: How would you feel about your tax dollars being spent on research projects that were targeted by foreign governments in an effort to steal U.S. intellectual property?
Taxpayer-funded research has been integral in keeping American medical, defense, information technology and many other products at the forefront of the world's market. Our scientists push the envelope to make crucial discoveries and better products, whether it be vaccines, biotechnology or other types of intellectual property. These projects can produce important breakthroughs for many of our industries, our country and the world.
However, American taxpayer-funded research is a constant target for foreign thieves. Though not the only threat, China is by far the most prolific.
Last year, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held a hearing on China's non-traditional espionage against the United States. During that hearing, I broached the issue of China's focus on our research institutions and taxpayer-funded research. Since then, more information has come to light about the extent to which the Chinese government is trying to steal U.S. intellectual property.
In 2013, Chinese nationals were charged with conspiring to steal research funded by a multi-million dollar National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant for the benefit of a Chinese governmental entity and a direct competitor of the American university where the research was conducted.
In an August 20, 2018, letter to NIH grantee institutions, NIH called attention to a series of threats posed by foreign entities to the integrity of U.S. biomedical research. In that letter, NIH warned that foreign actors have "mounted systematic programs to influence NIH researchers and peer reviewers," may have worked to divert intellectual property produced by NIH-supported research to other countries and may have contributed resources to NIH-funded researchers in ways which could impact the integrity of the research.
In January of this year, the Health and Human Services Inspector General notified me that NIH recently made 12 referrals to the IG, primarily involving the primary researchers on NIH grants conducting medical research at U.S. universities. Those researchers allegedly failed to meet NIH requirements to disclose foreign affiliations on their grant applications. That's a serious problem.
Researchers who are secretly supported by a foreign government while working on U.S. research projects can be more susceptible to influence and control of that foreign government. It's critical that we know who is financially supporting researchers.
This may not seem like an issue Iowans need to care about, but the fact is that foreign agents looking to steal taxpayer-funded research are operating in our own backyard.
In 2011, Chinese nationals tried to steal genetically modified corn seeds from an Iowa field with the intent to send them back to China. The New York Times reported that they worked for Chinese technology and seed companies. One was arrested and five others were indicted on charges of stealing trade secrets.
Whether in Iowa, or in other parts of the country, we must remind ourselves that there is an ongoing threat to taxpayer-funded research that targets American academic institutions, including the University of Iowa. And beyond pure research, the Chinese government in particular has tried other avenues to leverage itself in our society to their benefit and our detriment. Take for instance the Chinese Government's efforts to incorporate itself into our educational system via Confucius Institutes.
These Institutes are directly funded by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and are used as propaganda outlets to influence a pro-China view of the world. The University of Iowa has hosted one on its campus since 2006.
In a Senate intelligence committee hearing last year, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned of China's aggressive efforts at U.S. colleges and universities and specifically referenced the activities at Confucius Institutes. Despite concerns, the Dean of International Programs defended the University of Iowa's Confucius Institute, citing that the partnership "allows us to make every dollar go further." Since that time, the Board of Regents voted to close Iowa's Confucius Institute in order to save money the university was contributing toward its operating expenses.
However, the university has funds in an endowment from the Chinese government that the institute director has indicated could be used to keep the center open for five more years. The current contract with the Chinese government expires in July.
Foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research are real, aggressive and show no signs of slowing down. That's why this week, the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair, will hold a hearing on these threats and what can be done to strengthen the integrity of taxpayer-funded research and preserve the valuable work produced in this country.
Over the past several months, I've also sent oversight letters to NIH, HHS, and the HHS IG, as well as the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense, concerning current and potential threats to taxpayer-funded research.
Truly free collaboration and exchange of information is only possible when data and sources are credible, and the research process can be trusted.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In 1968, a young sportswriter named Brent Musburger wrote a column for a newspaper called The Chicago American on the protests of John Carlos and Tommie Smith, who raised their black-gloved fists on the podium after winning medals in the 200-meter sprint in the Summer Olympics in Mexico City.
The headline on Musburger's story, according to The Nation, was "Bizarre Protest by Smith, Carlos Tarnishes Medals." The notable line from Musburger, 29 at the time: "Smith and Carlos looked like a couple of black-skinned storm troopers."
Fifty-one years later, during a panel discussion Thursday about athletes and activism hosted by The Atlantic, Carlos was asked by moderator Jemele Hill whether he ever received an apology from Musburger for that column. Musburger, of course, went on to become a renowned sports commentator for ABC and ESPN, among others.
"Well you know, Brent Musburger doesn't even exist in my mind. So I don't even know," Carlos said to applause. "He didn't mean anything to me 51 years ago. He doesn't mean anything to me today. Because he's been proven to be wrong."
Musburger, 80, could not immediately be reached for comment. In a 1999 interview, he told The New York Times his column was "a bit harsh" while continuing to question the effect of the protest.
"Did it improve anything?" Musburger told the Times. "Smith and Carlos aside, I object to using the Olympic awards stand to make a political statement."
Musburger, who works for sports gambling network VSiN and is the radio play-by-play voice of the NFL's Raiders, referred to Carlos' and Smith's protests in his 1968 column as "a juvenile gesture by a couple of athletes who should have known better."
