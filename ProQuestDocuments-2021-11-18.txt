Texto completo: I’m convinced that God saved Tom Brokaw from multiple health scares in recent years just so he could be alive and bring sense to the ridiculous impeachment debate that occurred Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”
He did it so beautifully that to paraphrase his remarks would be a crime against humanity. So here is Brokaw's full quote, in contrasting the looming impeachment of President Nixon in the 1970s vs. the freak show happening in Washington right now:
The great, great difference is it was so much more methodical then on both parties. They knew how serious this was. This was not just, 'Oh, let’s put it on the calendar for Monday.’ An impeachment means that we remove the president from office. And there’s no more dramatic instance in the American Constitution or in the American political way of life than doing that. So, they went at it, both parties, in the most methodical, thoughtful way, and so they crossed every ’t’ and dotted every ‘i.’ They had discussions back and forth in public and privately. Now they just throw the word around like, ‘Let’s take a break and have an impeachment.’ I think that’s really, really inappropriate. And I think it cheapens the process, frankly.
Brokaw’s monologue was already perfect, but what made it even better was that it came just after Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson had been on the same show, befuddled that an impeachment hadn’t already taken place. Robinson was there to talk about his latest column, wherein he asked what exactly would Trump have to do to get impeached — as though removing a nationally elected president was a simple errand like picking up the dry cleaning or writing a lazy column.
“I’ve been back and forth on the wisdom of taking that step, but there’s one question that nags me,” wrote Robinson. “If the impeachment clause of the Constitution wasn’t written for a president like Trump, then why is it there?”
Impeachment, according to Robinson, is the “moral” thing to do.
Lest there remain any doubt that liberals in the national media work in concert (or at least borrow ideas when they get low), Charles Blow at the New York Times wrote just one day before Robinson, “What the hell is it going to take, Democrats?! What evidence and impetus would compel you to do the job the Constitution, patriotism and morality dictate?”
What it would “take,” as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., knows well, is a straight shot that can’t miss.
There's a reason impeachment and removal of a president is a political process and not a criminal one. It requires a clear reason beyond reproach (like a crime by the president), overwhelming public support, and the certitude that both chambers of Congress can follow through.
Democrats don't even have one of these three things.
Now-former special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of a conspiracy with Russia. The head of the Justice Department has said he didn’t see enough evidence to pursue obstruction of justice charges — in part because there was no initial crime that required justice-ing! Polls conducted after Mueller’s final report was released show that a majority of Americans — up to 61%, according to a CNN survey — are against impeachment and removal. Lastly, Republicans hold the Senate, where the effort to remove would die, for reasons both partisan and logical (no crime, no public support).
Impeachment is, of course, only half of the equation. Democrats can impeach without expecting Trump’s removal. And this is precisely what Brokaw was talking about — impeachment as a weapon to embarrass and, yes, harass a political opponent.
The hysteria from Robinson, Blow and others in the media over Democrats who have yet to embark on what should be a deadly serious constitutional procedure tells you everything you need to know about how little regard they have for American democracy.
Impeachment has become their plaything.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Just weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, new evidence emerged Thursday suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to white Republicans.
The evidence was found in the files of the prominent Republican redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller, who died in August.
It reveals that Hofeller "played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, 'Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,' " and that Trump administration officials purposely obscured Hofeller's role in court proceedings, lawyers for plaintiffs challenging the question wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman.
Furman was one of three federal judges who ruled against the question this year.
The letter drew on information discovered on Hofeller's hard drives, which were found by Hofeller's estranged daughter. Stephanie Hofeller Lizon then shared them with the organization Common Cause for a gerrymandering lawsuit it is pursuing in North Carolina.
The files show that Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census "would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats" and benefit white Republicans in redistricting. Hofeller then pushed the idea with the Trump administration in 2017, according to the lawyers' letter to Furman.
The evidence, first reported by The New York Times, contradicts testimony by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' expert adviser Mark Neuman and senior Justice Department official John Gore, as well as other testimony by defendants, the letter said.
The Commerce and Justice departments did not respond to questions about the new information.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in district court Thursday for "sanctions and any other relief the court deems appropriate, because of apparently untruthful testimony" by Trump administration officials in the earlier trials, said Dale Ho, who argued the case at the Supreme Court on behalf of the ACLU.
It is unclear how the information might affect deliberations at the Supreme Court. The ACLU on Thursday afternoon filed a letter with the court to "respectfully inform" it of the motion filed in New York District Court and that a hearing was scheduled for next week.
The letter repeated the charge contained in the earlier letter to Furman that Hofeller played a significant role in adding the citizenship question to the 2020 census to give white Republicans an advantage in redistricting "and that Petitioners (the government) obscured his role through affirmative misrepresentations."
The letter from Ho did not ask the court to take action, but it drew its attention to the new motion. The hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.
"Witnesses misrepresented the origin and purpose of their effort to add a citizenship question to the census," Ho said in a statement accompanying release of the letter. "Their goal was not to protect voting rights, but to dilute the voting power of minority communities. We look forward to Wednesday's hearing and will keep the Supreme Court aware of any further developments."
The Supreme Court heard the case April 23.
Evidence in the case concluded with oral arguments that day, and it appeared the conservative majority seemed inclined to agree with the government that the decision to add the question was within the authority of the commerce secretary.
The court, if it followed normal procedure, voted that week on the outcome of the case, and the justices are now writing the opinion.
The ACLU also asked the district court to allow previously redacted testimony from Neuman to be made public.
On Thursday, Furman ordered that the government must provide a response by 10 a.m. Friday; he called a hearing on the matter for Wednesday.
The new information indicates that blueprints for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census predated the Trump administration, but Donald Trump's election allowed them to become a reality, Ho said.
"It just shows that there was a long-standing plan to weaponize the census to dilute minority voting power to try to forestall the electoral effects of the demographic changes that this country is undergoing," he said.
Ho said sanctions could include fines imposed on witnesses or the government, a reopening of the case or an amendment of the final judgment to account for new evidence.
The population count from the decennial census is used to allocate $800 billion a year in federal funding and to determine congressional representation and redistricting. Opponents of the citizenship question have argued that it will suppress response to the survey among immigrant communities, resulting in an undercount in the areas where they live.

Meryl Streep's Big Little Truth; The movie star suggests that not all males are deplorable.

Texto completo: It may seem odd that an influential and respected artist can make news simply by urging people not to condemn half of humanity, but this week's commentary from film star Meryl Streep is welcome nonetheless.
Christopher Luu of InStyle magazine writes that while promoting an HBO television program called "Big Little Lies" with co-stars including Nicole Kidman, Ms. Streep went beyond discussion of the show's characters and plot:
During the talk, Streep said that she doesn't like the term "toxic masculinity," because it's not just guys who can be toxic, it's people in general.
The topic came up when an attendee shared a story about how Kidman was told by a male fan that he enjoyed the show. Streep chimed in, saying that she was glad he found something to like, even though he wasn't a woman. She added that the label of toxic masculinity is detrimental to everyone, because it's the individuals involved that are toxic, not an entire gender. That sort of generalization, she says, hurts men and women alike. What she thinks we all need is a little more communication.
"Sometimes, I think we're hurt. We hurt our boys by calling something toxic masculinity. I do. And I don't find [that] putting those two words together … because women can be pretty... toxic," Streep said. "It's toxic people. We have our good angles and we have our bad ones. I think the labels are less helpful than what we're trying to get to, which is a communication, direct, between human beings. We're all on the boat together. We've got to make it work."
Ms. Streep's words are encouraging not only because her credentials as a political leftist are impeccable but also because, given her enormous success in the motion picture industry, she surely has a keen sense of her audience. If Ms. Streep says it's time to return to the idea of treating people as individuals, there's every reason to hope that she's not just speaking for herself.
Perhaps corporate marketers are already getting there. Procter and Gamble's Gillette shaving brand made news in January with its television advertisement attacking "toxic masculinity." But within six weeks, perhaps with less fanfare, the company was also rolling out a deodorant advertisement taking a sympathetic view of a very traditional American male—a family man and soldier working to support his loved ones.
Barrett Brunsman of the Cincinnati Business Journal reported in February:
Procter & Gamble Co. has launched a new advertising campaign for Gillette deodorant that focuses on members of the military and their families.
The Cincinnati-based maker of consumer goods (NYSE: PG) created a commercial that resembles a short film to kick off the campaign, which uses the tag line: "Every Hero Sweats, Some Never Show it."
The 2-minute, 30-second video spotlights the commitment of service members to their country and families but also notes challenges they face when retiring or separating from the military and re-entering the private sector.
"Supporting and celebrating service members who are willing to fight for the freedoms afforded by our nation is an honor for all of us at Gillette Deodorant, and the inspiration behind our newest campaign," said Sara Saunders, P&G's associate brand director for the Personal Care division. "The campaign shows the duality that many service members experience: balancing commitments between work and family. It also shows the struggle many face when they have to re-enter civilian life and find a job."
Gillette continues to roll out new messages as it seeks to revive sluggish razor sales and settle on a marketable definition of masculinity. Today the trade publication AdWeek gushes in a headline , "Quietly Powerful Gillette Ad Shows a Dad Teaching His Transgender Son How to Shave."
Outside the business of personal grooming, the provocative online video producers at PragerU have been arguing for some time that America needs men to be more masculine, not less .

Meanwhile in Colorado today, President Trump was speaking to a group of males and females who intend to be highly toxic to tyrants and terrorists. The Denver Post reports :
A president known for off-the-script soliloquies, for making a conventional speech unconventional, instead stuck largely to his prepared remarks, telling 989 Air Force Academy graduates that the "sound of America's Air Force is the sound of righteous justice."...
"You truly make America proud," he told cadets. "You make us all proud, great job. Great job."

Texto completo: President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort and his political fundraising operation both received subpoenas from federal prosecutors this week for records related to Trump donor Cindy Yang, according to people familiar with the matter.
Ms. Yang is a U.S. citizen born in China who has drawn scrutiny for her alleged efforts to sell to Chinese citizens access to events with Mr. Trump and his administration at Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Fla., resort where Mr. Trump has spent a substantial number of weekends since he took office.
Ms. Yang also founded and then sold a massage parlor that was the center of what Florida authorities said was an illegal prostitution ring . Ms. Yang wasn't implicated in that sting, which began after she sold the business.
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and two dozen other men were charged in late February with soliciting prostitution at the parlor after local authorities say they videotaped activity at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter. Mr. Kraft pleaded not guilty.
This month, prosecutors moved to stay proceedings against Mr. Kraft, saying they couldn't effectively proceed to trial after "crucial evidence" in the case was suppressed by a judge .
A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, which owns Mar-a-Lago, declined to comment.
Lawyers for Trump Victory, a joint fundraising vehicle between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, also received a subpoena for records related to Ms. Yang. A Trump Victory official said the committee "makes every effort possible to ensure that all contributions are made in accordance with the law. While we can't comment on any possible ongoing investigations, of course our committee would comply with any request from law enforcement to ensure all contributions are made legally."
The subpoenas were earlier reported by the Miami Herald . There is no indication that either entity is a target of the investigation. The Justice Department didn't respond to a request for comment.
In March, top congressional Democrats asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate Ms. Yang, saying the allegations related to illegal prostitution and that her efforts to sell political access raised counterintelligence concerns.
Evan Turk, a lawyer for Ms. Yang, said his law firm hadn't been contacted about the subpoenas and declined to comment.
"China has frequently used non-traditional intelligence collectors and businesspersons to compromise targets," the Democrats wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, asking the FBI to conduct investigations "into credible allegations of human trafficking, as well as unlawful foreign lobbying, campaign finance, and other activities by Ms. Yang."
The Florida authorities initially described their investigation into the day spa as a probe into human trafficking, though prosecutors later conceded there was no evidence of human trafficking there.
Ms. Yang, who also goes by Li Yang, and her husband, Zubin Gong, started a business called GY US Investments LLC in December 2017, according to Florida business records. The company's now-deleted website describes it as working to "assist businesses in America to establish and expand their brand image in the modern Chinese marketplace" and trumpets its ability to connect clients with events featuring Mr. Trump, according to pages captured by internet archives.
Ms. Yang attended a December 2017 fundraiser for Mr. Trump in New York City. She was also photographed with Mr. Trump at a March 2018 re-election fundraiser at the club. Ahead of the event, she contributed $5,400 to a Trump re-election committee, according to Federal Election Commission reports.
The fundraiser's invitation said donors who raised $50,000 from their networks could be photographed with the president. The New York Times reported that at least nine people in Ms. Yang's orbit made the maximum campaign contribution and quoted a donor who declined to answer a question about whether Ms. Yang had reimbursed her. It is illegal to make a campaign donation in another person's name, and it is also illegal for foreign citizens to make contributions.

As Barr mulls declassification, a familiar tune from critics

Texto completo: In February 2018, the House Intelligence Committee released the so-called Nunes memo. In four pages, the document, from the committee’s then-chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, revealed much of what the public knows today about the FBI’s reliance on the Steele dossier in pursuing since-discredited allegations that the Trump campaign and Russia conspired to fix the 2016 election. Specifically, it revealed that the FBI included unverified material from the dossier in applications to a secret spy court to win a warrant to wiretap Trump foreign policy volunteer adviser Carter Page.
All that was classified. To release it, the committee appealed to President Donald Trump, who made a declassification order. That is the only way Americans know about the Page warrant. From that knowledge came later revelations about the FBI’s use of confidential informants and undercover agents to get information on Trump campaign figures.
It is good that the public knows such things, just as it is good that the public knows what is in the Mueller report. But in the days before the Nunes memo was declassified, many of the nation’s top current and former intelligence officials, members of Congress, and analysts in the press warned that declassification would do grave damage to American national security.
It didn’t happen.
Now, some of the same people are issuing somber warnings of the damage that will be done if Attorney General William Barr declassifies documents showing what else the nation’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies did in the 2016 Trump investigation.
In 2018, former CIA Director John Brennan said of the Nunes memo, "I never witnessed the type of reckless partisan behavior I am now seeing." In 2018, Rep. Adam Schiff, the current chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the Nunes memo "crosses a dangerous line." In 2018, former Attorney General Eric Holder called the Nunes memo "unheard of," "dangerous" and "irresponsible." Many others echoed Brennan’s and Schiff’s and Holder’s sentiments. The problem is, they were wrong then, and they are likely wrong again now.
The revelation that the FBI used the Steele dossier — the collection of unconfirmed anti-Trump dirt compiled for the Hillary Clinton campaign by the former British spy Christopher Steele — set off a tremendous argument about the dossier’s reliability. But there was no doubt that the Nunes memo was correct, that the FBI had indeed cited the dossier as evidence in its argument that Carter Page should be wiretapped. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that some of the loudest voices denouncing Nunes were angry about the exposure of the FBI’s questionable actions, and not the fact that the FBI’s actions were indeed questionable.
Now, there is another fight about declassification. Nunes himself has heard this all before. "These people simply use national security as a false justification to hide information that would reveal their abuses," he said in a text exchange.
Nunes summed up with one more line: "Democracy dies in darkness."
The resistance to declassification is likely to be ferocious. Almost immediately after President Donald Trump ordered intelligence agencies to cooperate with Barr and gave the attorney general "full and complete authority" to declassify information from the Trump-Russia investigation, the intelligence world struck back when The New York Times reported that Barr’s project could endanger one of the CIA’s most prized sources.
Attributing its story to "former officials," the Times said the source was someone "close to (Vladimir) Putin" who gave the CIA "information about (Putin’s) involvement" in U.S. election interference, and specifically turned over evidence to support the conclusion that "Putin himself was behind the Russia hack." The source had been "long nurtured" by the CIA and was highly valued by Brennan when he was director. All of that work might be at risk if Barr moves ahead, the Times suggested.
Now, if anything might endanger such a source, it would be exposure in The New York Times. But the story showed that the intelligence world will push back hard against this new effort to investigate its record. The fight could be messy. But Barr, like Nunes, has heard such threats before. It’s time to find out what the CIA, FBI and other agencies did in those difficult days of the 2016 campaign.

Ayala's transparency in announcing no re-election bid is too little, too late; ORLANDO SENTINEL EDITORIAL

Texto completo: When Aramis Ayala announced Tuesday she will not run for re-election as state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties in 2020, she was forthright about her reasons.
The candor was refreshing, but it raised an obvious and nagging question: Where was the candor in 2016?
When Ayala ran for state attorney, she owed voters transparency. Her lack of it led to the controversy that redefined her legacy in office.
Instead of being remembered as the first African-American elected state attorney in Florida, Ayala will be largely remembered as a state attorney who dropped a policy bombshell two months into the job, saying she would abandon death penalty prosecutions.
Ayala's behavior serves as a cautionary tale to political candidates: Be forthcoming, give voters credit for having common sense and don't think the ends justify the means.
Such traits were missing when Ayala announced her intent to never seek the death penalty. Period.
Not even when there's video of the alleged criminal standing over a police officer and pumping bullets into her while she was on the ground, helpless.
The officer was Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton. The alleged shooter, Markeith Loyd, also was charged with killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend.
To say Ayala's edict caught the public off guard would be an understatement. Ayala shrugged it off as a routine exercise of her prosecutorial discretion, not something voters might have been interested in knowing during the campaign.
Nobody was buying it then.
But we certainly buy the explanation Ayala posted on Facebook Tuesday, where she said her decision not to run next year.
"After the Florida Supreme Court's decision on the death penalty, it became abundantly clear to me that the death penalty law in the state of Florida is in direct conflict with my view and my vision for the administration of justice," Ayala said.
The decision she referenced was the one in which the court correctly ruled that former Gov. Rick Scott had the right to remove death penalty cases from Ayala and give them to prosecutors who would not summarily dismiss the state's death penalty law.
In the video, Ayala said she is proud of her work as state attorney, and she is only leaving because the state doesn't share her vision of justice.
"There will be those who have their thoughts and opinions about why I made the decision not to run," she said. "But I'm telling you right here, I'm giving you the facts."
Great, but where was this candor in 2016?
The fact is voters have a right to know candidates' views on pivotal issues. And whether you agree or disagree with the death penalty, nobody can argue with a straight face that voters don't care about it.
Ayala said she didn't make it an issue in her campaign because court rulings had put executions on temporary hold. That's pretty thin gruel. This is Florida. Everyone knew the death penalty would be back.
Besides, she said, nobody brought it up. On that, she might have a point. The media, including the Sentinel, did not make Ayala's death penalty philosophy an issue.
Of course, they also aren't asking Joe Biden if he'd be willing to command the armed forces or move to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Some things are presumed, like elected officials following the law.
As far as we can tell, no state attorney in Florida had ever made it policy not to pursue the death penalty.
Throughout the controversy, Ayala insisted her death penalty policy was based solely on legal interpretation, not personal views. Yet emails obtained by WKMG showed she consulted with anti-death penalty groups to coordinate a response to the Loyd controversy.
Her stance generated national attention and made Ayala a hero to death penalty opponents. A New York Times headline called it a "Bold Stand."
Eliminating the death penalty is a defensible stance for a politician to take, but there is nothing bold about hiding that goal from voters.
If she'd been upfront, Ayala might still have defeated opponent Jeff Ashton. She might have won without progressive benefactor George Soros giving her a seven-figure war chest for a race that usually cost about $100,000. But her willingness to play along made her look more like a scheming politician than a principled reformer.
It's too bad, since Ayala did some praiseworthy things like instituting a bond policy which spared poor, non-violent offenders from extended jail time. The office also reported impressive statistics in hiring diversity.
If she couldn't escape the shadow of Markeith Loyd, Ayala has nobody to blame but herself. So let that be a lesson to candidates in 2020.
The people who elect you deserve to know what they're voting for, even if there is no law against politicians duping the public.
If there had been, our outgoing state attorney would have needed a good lawyer.

Fortune Magazine to Add Paywall, Increase Cover Price

Texto completo: Fortune magazine is raising its cover price, launching a digital paywall and boosting its conference business, in its first decisive steps as an independent publisher.
The moves, which come about six months after Meredith Corp. sold the business magazine to Thai businessman Chatchaval Jiaravanon, are intended to cut Fortune's reliance on print advertising, which has been in decline.
"We're marching toward a premium model," said Alan Murray, Fortune's chief executive, in an interview. "The goal is to shift to a greater dependency on consumer revenue, the only way for serious journalism to survive in the current environment."
Fortune, which was championed by Henry Luce, co-founder of Time Inc., made its debut in 1930.
Mr. Murray, a former Wall Street Journal editor, said the digital paywall would be implemented later this year, and that early next year the print magazine would be relaunched with a higher cover price and better-quality paper. He declined to disclose the cost of an online subscription or the print magazine's future cover price, which currently is $6.99.
Paywalls have become attractive to publishers looking to boost their direct revenue from consumers. In January, magazine publisher Conde Nast, a unit of closely held Advance Publications Inc., said it would put all its titles behind paywalls by year-end. Business Insider and New York Magazine parent New York Media LLC are among others that have moved toward charging for digital subscriptions, following publishers such as the Journal and the New York Times.
"There is a danger that there could be paywall fatigue," said Clifton Leaf, Fortune's editor in chief. He said Fortune would court analysts, investors and strategists interested in what he described as "data-rich deep dives about companies," as well as readers concerned about the social role corporations should play.
Fortune also is expanding its conference lineup, Mr. Murray said, adding three conferences this year for a total of 20, seven of which are outside the U.S. -- including two in China. Its conferences cover topics including finance, technology and sustainability.
Fortune expects the conference business to generate between $40 million and $43 million this year -- or slightly more than 40% of its overall revenue.
Digital advertising is expected to contribute a bit north of 20%, with print-advertising and circulation revenue accounting for the remainder, said Anastasia Nyrkovskaya, Fortune chief financial officer. Mr. Murray said the company is profitable.

Texto completo: Thank you to the Post-Gazette for the recent coverage of lead exposure in Allegheny County, including the May 26 article "Partnerships Aim to Make Allegheny Safe from Lead Hazards."
Primary prevention is crucial. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, there is no safe level of lead. Lead exposure can cause serious damage to a child's developing brain. Decreases in cognition documented in children with levels as low as 5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in blood are permanent.
By continuing to highlight efforts of the Allegheny County Health Department, nonprofit organizations and municipalities, the PG is enabling us to understand the severity of this situation in our community and to provide a forum for discussion and action.
Thank you to the municipalities currently working with landlords to inspect for lead hazards and mitigate exposure.
For further information regarding lead prevention, visit gettheleadoutpgh.org or alleghenycounty.us/healthdepartment.

Renewable energy
In reviewing the recent Team PA Foundation report "Pennsylvania Energy Horizons," produced by a year-long, community discussion-based exercise led by Royal Dutch Shell, I was encouraged to see an increasing role for renewables and transition to a low carbon economy in Pennsylvania.
There is strategic importance to diversity in our energy sector and we should not rely solely on natural gas. Pennsylvania has more opportunities to grow energy efficiency and renewable-energy jobs than ever before, and the economic benefits would extend into rural, urban, and suburban communities across the commonwealth.
Additionally, research tells us natural gas can only become a bridge fuel to the needed, lower-carbon economy described in the report if appropriate policy is enacted. Otherwise natural gas expansion is predicted to slow renewable energy growth.
Just recently, a bipartisan group of state senators announced legislation that would update Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard to include a target of 30% energy from Tier 1 renewable sources by 2030. This piece of legislation, Senate Bill 600, is growing in support and has a House companion bill, House Bill 1195.
Additionally, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimates that currently pending bipartisan energy efficiency legislation in Pennsylvania could unlock 30,000 jobs and about $6.4 billion in net savings by removing barriers to energy efficiency investment. These jobs not only put Pennsylvanians to work, but they advance energy-efficiency projects that drive down energy bill costs.
The commonwealth's energy-efficiency and renewable-energy sectors are strong, poised for important growth, and must be part of the conversation.

Alabama bill
Alabama recently passed a controversial anti-abortion bill in an apparent attempt to challenge the Roe v. Wade (1973) Supreme Court decision.
Signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey, it makes performing an abortion a felony, except in the event of a medical emergency. The bill makes no exception for rape or incest.
The bill would not penalize the woman in any way for the termination of her pregnancy. It states: "No woman upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted to be performed shall be criminally or civilly liable."
However, doctors who violate the law could face up to life in prison.
These seemingly harsh penalties are consistent with other exisiting laws. For example, the penalty for euthanasia in Alabama is life in prison or the possibility of the death penalty.
The New York Times editorial board recently published a piece harshly criticizing the sweep of anti-abortion bills, stating, "America is in an era of extreme anti-abortion laws."
Despite the criticism of Alabama, The Times has yet to refer to third-trimester abortions as "extreme."
In the eyes of a pro-lifer, you must make this hard distinction - as pro-lifers see life beginning at conception. Though pregnancy can occur from rape/incest, the action of terminating a human life is unrelated to the methodology behind the conception.
This is not an "extreme" bill; this is merely a pro-life bill, and Alabama is the first state to realize that you can't float in the middle of polarizing issues while maintaining the integrity of your viewpoints.

Texto completo: What's on TV
DESUS & MERO 11 p.m. on Showtime. After merging her eye with Disney's in last year's "A Wrinkle in Time," the director Ava DuVernay is returning this week with "When They See Us," a Netflix series about the Central Park Five. She'll talk about the series as the guest on this episode of Desus Nice and the Kid Mero's recently reborn late-night show. Her Netflix drama, about the teenage boys wrongly (and infamously) convicted of rape in 1989 and the decades that followed, marks a return to the kinds of racial injustice issues DuVernay dissected in the documentary "13th" and her breakthrough feature, "Selma." The new series is due out Friday; her appearance here would make for a good preface.
BLACKKKLANSMAN (2018) 10:45 p.m. on HBO. Spike Lee finally shared his first competitive Oscar in February for his work on the screenplay for this feature, but he didn't need the academy's overdue recognition for it to be clear that "BlacKkKlansman" was a success. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott called the movie Lee's "best nondocumentary feature in more than a decade and one of his greatest." John David Washington stars as Ron Stallworth, the first African-American officer hired by the Colorado Springs Police Department, whose 2014 memoir was the basis for the movie. Stallworth infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan with the help of Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), a white detective who is Jewish, and manages to strike up a phone-based friendship with David Duke (Topher Grace).
What's Streaming
20TH CENTURY WOMEN (2016) Stream on Amazon and Kanopy; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Both Mike Mills and Annette Bening have been in the news recently: Mills for his collaboration with the indie rock band the National and Bening for her Tony-nominated performance in the current Broadway production of Arthur Miller's "All My Sons." Back in 2016, Mills directed Bening in this critically acclaimed story about a teenager, Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), who lives with his divorced mom, Dorothea (Bening), in a Southern California home. Also living there are a boarder played by Billy Crudup and an artist played by Greta Gerwig, who, along with Jamie's friend Julie (Elle Fanning), make up the ensemble of a movie whose overriding interest is in its mother-son relationship. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that the film is "a memory movie, one in which people are conjured up to bump against the larger world, exuberantly and uneasily."
NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Stream on Facebook. The National Symphony Orchestra will perform with the Swiss pianist Francesco Piemontesi under the baton of the orchestra's music director, Gianandrea Noseda, at a concert at the Kennedy Center on Thursday. The program includes works by Ottorino Respighi, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Alfredo Casella. It comes hot on the heels of the orchestra's concert at Carnegie Hall earlier this month, which Anthony Tommasini, in a review for The Times, called "exhilarating." Thursday's performance will be streamed live on the orchestra's Facebook page.

Texto completo: It’s going to be more difficult for Democratic presidential candidates to the make the stage of the third and fourth debates, according to new qualifying rules released by the Democratic National Committee Wednesday.
For debates scheduled for September and October, candidates will have to hit 2% in four qualifying polls and tally at least 130,000 individual donors, according to the DNC guidance. For the first and second rounds of debates, the DNC is requiring candidates to either hit at least 1% in three polls or receive campaign contributions from at least 65,000 donors.
The higher polling threshold could certainly narrow who from the nearly two dozen candidate field will make it to the stage. So far, eight candidates have hit received 2% or more support in four national or early-state voting polls: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke.
Can Biden's lead hold? 2020 frontrunner in May? It's probably not a good thing
Where things stand: What you need to know about the 2020 election so far
For the September debate, each poll must be publicly released between June 28, 2019, and August 28, 2019. The DNC said it will announce deadlines for qualifying polls ahead of the October debate will be released in the future.
The approved polling includes surveys conducted by the Associated Press, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Des Moines Register, Fox News, Monmouth University, NBC News, New York Times, National Public Radio (NPR), Quinnipiac University, University of New Hampshire, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Washington Post, and Winthrop University.
The DNC also announced Wednesday that the third debate will be hosted on Sept. 12 by ABC News, in partnership with Univision. A second night of debating will be held to accommodate a large field if necessary, according to the DNC.
The first debate is scheduled to be held over two nights on June 26 and 27 in Miami, and the second round is scheduled for July 30 and 31 in Detroit.
The campaigns of Biden, Sanders, Harris, Warren, Buttigieg, O’Rourke, Booker as well as entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, former Gov. Jay Inslee and Marianne Williamson, say they have met both the polling and donor qualifications to take part in the first two rounds of debates.
Klobuchar, former Rep. John Delaney, former Gov. John Hickenlooper, Gov. Steve Bullock, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Rep. Tim Ryan and Rep. Eric Swalwell report they’ve met one of the thresholds to take part in the first debate.
Rep. Seth Moulton, Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam, Sen. Michael Bennet and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio have yet to meet either qualifying threshold.
Delaney, who announced in July 2017 that he was running for the White House, wrote a pointed letter to DNC chairman Tom Perez Wednesday raising questions about how the committee put together the criteria.
Among the questions Delaney asked in the letter was who on the committee was involved with putting together the criteria and whether Perez or his staff spoke with any candidates or their campaigns about the new qualifying thresholds.
The DNC is capping participation at 20 candidates for the first two round of debates and says it will announce who will make it to the stage about two weeks before each scheduled debate.

Texto completo: How does someone who apparently delights in pulling the emergency brake and causing general chaos for riders keep getting allowed back on the subway?
"I like to create mayhem," Isaiah Thompson allegedly told police after he was arrested last week for thrill-riding outside a northbound 2 train, then climbing aboard and pulling the emergency brake, during evening rush hour no less.
He also is accused of subway surfing while exposing himself, plus two assaults, including slashing a man's arm at Brooklyn's Jay Street station. Police are investigating whether Thompson, 23, is connected to 750 subway delays since March.
The message to miscreants such as Thompson has been clear: Hang off the back of subway cars? Get back on the trains. Expose yourself? Get back on the trains. Jump the turnstiles? No problem!
Sherman Nelson of Fort Greene, Thompson's neighbor, told The New York Times that he has seen Thompson jump turnstiles. A year ago, on orders from the Manhattan D.A.'s office, the NYPD stopped arresting turnstile jumpers.
Hey, no need to traumatize and criminalize people for jumping a turnstile, right? I mean, who really suffers?
Um, how about you and me? The more people get the message that there's no penalty for fare evasion, the more people do it. Which means less revenue for the MTA. Which means fare hikes for guess who?
"Fare beating places a burden on law-abiding transit customers who do pay the fare, including low-income citizens who, despite financial challenges, still respect the rule of law," then-MTA chairman Joe Lhota wrote in a letter to Manhattan D.A. Cy Vance last year.
Second, it allows malignant mischief makers repeated entry into the system. How is someone with 16 arrests involving NYC subways still allowed to ride the trains? Isn't it time to rethink the D.A. office's permissive attitude?
After Thompson's arrest, subway officials said brake-pulling endangers not only subway riders, but also track workers.
"It's stupid, it's dangerous, it's selfish, and it's got to stop," said NYC Transit president Andy Byford. "These incidents illustrate why the law needs to allow recidivists who repeatedly target subway customers or employees to be banned from the property."

Goshay: Rich parents outsmarted themselves for kids who can't make the grade

Texto completo: Celebrities and multimillionaires are going down like bowling pins, all because they couldn't bear the thought of their offspring not being accepted at a top-tier school - or worse, landing at a public school, rubbing elbows with your kid.
What would drive a person to take such risk with their livelihood and reputation?
Because when you're a parent, you'll do almost anything for your child. But in this case, it also was the horror that for all their investment, all the private schooling, tutoring and special privileges, their children still turned out to be ordinary.
They needn't have gone to such lengths. A new study by the Georgetown University finds when it comes to success, being born into an affluent family counts for more than talent. It says, in short, "In America, it is often better to be rich than to be smart."
The report, which tracked a group of children to adulthood since 1989, found seven of 10 low-scoring kindergartners from wealthy families still ended up as wealthy adults. You're as thick as a plank, but your pop's a millionaire? You'll be just fine.
It also found that when a child stumbles academically, wealthy families spend five times more on support and enrichment programs than do working-class and poor families.
In the current college scandal, some entrance-exam "coaches" and proctors were commanding fat fees not to improve students' test scores, but to fix them.
During her court appearance, actress Felicity Huffman confessed she paid a proctor $15,000 to "correct" her eldest daughter's ACT test scores, which increased the result by 400 points.
Such nit-wittery failed take into account that once she got to college, Huffman's daughter wouldn't have been able to maintain the level of performance the score indicated and she likely would have washed out.
This isn't to denigrate people who honestly and genuinely earn their success, but we know we need only to turn on the TV to see a parade of people who wouldn't be where they are had they not won the womb lottery.
Case in point: The New York Times recently reported the president squandered $1 billion over a 10-year period. It takes a special talent to burn through $1 billion. Most people couldn't do it unless they set it directly on fire.
He would have been better off to deposit it in a Christmas Club account at the credit union. As it stands, he holds the distinction of losing more money than any American in history, but his father's wealth ensured he always had a soft place to land.
That same wealth likely paved his way into the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. His grades, however, have remained more secure than the Mueller report. But we know had he made the dean's list, every American with a mailbox would have received a copy of his transcripts by now.
Though the Georgetown report does not underestimate the power of talent and hard work to lift a child out of poverty, it notes that a low-income child with academic promise still has less opportunity, less of a chance at achieving success, than a low-performing wealthy child because of all the factors involving one's socio-economic status.
In short, some rich parents are heading to jail and disgrace for a caper they didn't even have to commit. You'd think they'd be smarter.

Fortune magazine is raising its cover price, launching a digital paywall and boosting its conference business, in its first decisive steps as an independent publisher.
The moves, which come about six months after Meredith Corp. sold the fabled business magazine to Thai businessman Chatchaval Jiaravanon, are intended to decrease Fortune's reliance on print advertising, which has been in steady decline.
"We're marching toward a premium model," said Alan Murray, Fortune's chief executive, in an interview. "The goal is to shift to a greater dependency on consumer revenue, the only way for serious journalism to survive in the current environment."
Fortune, which was championed by Henry Luce, co-founder of Time Inc., made its debut in 1930 with a cover price of $1, a tidy sum during the Great Depression. Mr. Luce wanted the magazine to appeal to "wealthy and influential people" and priced it accordingly, according to Fortune's website.
Mr. Murray, a former Wall Street Journal editor, said the digital paywall would be implemented later this year, and that early next year the print magazine would be relaunched with a higher cover price and better-quality paper. He declined to disclose the cost of an online subscription or the print magazine's future cover price, which currently is $6.99.
Paywalls have become increasingly attractive to publishers looking to boost their direct revenue from consumers. In January, magazine publisher Condé Nast, a unit of closely held Advance Publications Inc., said it would put all its titles behind paywalls by year-end . Business Insider and New York Magazine parent New York Media LLC are among others that have moved toward charging for digital subscriptions, following publishers such as The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
"There is a danger that there could be paywall fatigue," said Clifton Leaf, Fortune's editor in chief. He said Fortune would court analysts, investors and strategists interested in what he described as "data-rich deep dives about companies," as well as readers concerned about the social role corporations should play.
Fortune's competitors will include Apple News +, the new magazine- and newspaper-subscription product from Apple Inc. that costs $9.99 a month and whose offerings include Fortune. The Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Co., has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.
Fortune is also expanding its conference lineup, Mr. Murray said, adding three conferences this year for a total of 20, seven of which are outside the U.S.—including two in China. Its conferences cover a range of topics including finance, technology, design and sustainability.
Fortune expects the conference business to generate between $40 million and $43 million this year—or slightly more than 40% of its overall revenue. Digital advertising is expected to contribute a bit north of 20%, with print-advertising and circulation revenue accounting for the remainder, said Anastasia Nyrkovskaya, who recently joined Fortune as chief financial officer. Mr. Murray said the company is profitable.
Print advertising has shrunk steadily in recent years as marketers have moved ad spend to tech giants including Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.
Fortune sold 630 print pages of advertising last year, a 26% decrease from a year earlier. Part of the decline comes from the fact that Fortune published fewer issues in 2018 (12) than in 2017 (16). It also is selling fewer magazines. Newsstand sales averaged 8,206 copies per issue last year—less than half their 2015 levels, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.
Meredith, which publishes People and the Magnolia Journal among other magazines, acquired Fortune as part of its purchase of Time Inc. in January 2018. It quickly decided to part with Time Inc.'s news publications, selling Time magazine to Marc Benioff, co-chief executive of Salesforce.com, and Lynne Benioff for $190 million. Meredith on Monday said it sold Sports Illustrated for $110 million to licensing company Authentic Brands Group LLC.
Fortune assumed control of its payroll management in April, and expects to have full control of its digital properties by July. In early September, Fortune will leave Meredith's New York offices at 225 Liberty St. and move to 40 Fulton St. in lower Manhattan.
Mr. Murray said Fortune's business strategy has the blessings of Mr. Chatchaval, who bought Fortune last December for $150 million . Mr. Murray said Mr. Chatchaval has taken a low-key management approach, choosing not to interfere with editorial decisions but setting seven-year financial goals.
Efforts to reach Mr. Chatchaval for comment were unsuccessful.
Mr. Chatchaval is eager for Fortune to extend its reach in Asia, where it already publishes Fortune China and where it expects to expand its bureaus in Beijing and Shanghai, Mr. Murray said. "I think his thesis is that the power of the Fortune brand in China is exceptionally strong," Mr. Murray said. "He thinks that should be a business opportunity."

Trump disses Harriet Tubman; guest editorial

Texto completo: Maybe Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is correct when he says the reason for delaying the long-planned Harriet Tubman $20 bill is that he's got his hands full at the moment fighting counterfeiting. It's possible, right?
The same way it's possible that Barack Obama was born in Kenya without knowing it, or the same way it's possible that President Trump was denied a majority vote of the American people in 2016 because of rampant voting fraud.
In other words, hardly possible.
What is far more probable is that Trump's notorious petulance kicked in - or at least Mnuchin thought it might, so he made sure the Tubman bill would not replace the Andrew Jackson bill until long after Trump is out of office, if ever.
Tubman was the ex-slave and abolitionist whose image was chosen to bump Jackson's after an extensive public campaign to redesign the bill. The release date was to be next year, on the 100th anniversary of the constitutional amendment that acknowledged a woman's right to vote.
Trump hated the idea. As a candidate, he branded it "pure political correctness," sounding the dog whistle for his supporters uncomfortable with the notion that women and African Americans were the equals of white males when it came to establishing this nation of equal justice under law.
The proper place for Tubman, Trump said, was not the $20, but the rarely used $2 bill. You know - out of sight, out of mind.
Besides, the plan for the new bill arose under Obama, and Trump appears to have a pathological need to undo anything his predecessor did, whether it be enacting the Affordable Care Act, combating climate change, protecting public land - or diversifying the nation's currency.
The New York Times quoted senior Treasury officials as saying that Mnuchin was worried that Trump might cancel the Tubman bill altogether, so he opted to avoid the inevitable outcry by delaying the release of the bill from next year to 2028.
That will mean that Jackson, who led the deportation of Native Americans from their homes in the Eastern U.S. to Oklahoma and other territories, and to whom Trump compares himself, will continue to be in circulation without any competition as long as the current president is in office, even if he wins reelection next year.
It will also mean that for another eight years, the mini hall of fame that is the nation's paper currency will continue to be exclusively white and exclusively male. That's shameful. And it's petty.

Siri and Alexa fuel sexism, U.N. finds

Texto completo: Why do most virtual assistants that are powered by artificial intelligence - like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa system - by default have female names, female voices and often a submissive or even flirtatious style?
The problem, according to a new report released last week by UNESCO, stems from a lack of diversity within the industry that is reinforcing problematic gender stereotypes.
"Obedient and obliging machines that pretend to be women are entering our homes, cars and offices," Saniye Gulser Corat, UNESCO's director for gender equality, said in statement. "The world needs to pay much closer attention to how, when and whether AI technologies are gendered and, crucially, who is gendering them."
One particularly worrying reflection of this is the "deflecting, lackluster or apologetic responses" that these assistants give to insults.
The report borrows its title - "I'd Blush if I Could" - from a standard response from Siri, the Apple voice assistant, when a user hurled a gendered expletive at it. When a user tells Alexa, "You're hot," her typical response has been a cheery, "That's nice of you to say!"
Siri's response was recently altered to a more flattened "I don't know how to respond to that," but the report suggests that the technology remains gender biased, arguing that the problem starts with engineering teams that are staffed overwhelmingly by men.
"Siri's 'female' obsequiousness - and the servility expressed by so many other digital assistants projected as young women - provides a powerful illustration of gender biases coded into technology products," the report found.
Amazon's Alexa, named for the ancient library of Alexandria, is unmistakably female. Microsoft's Cortana was named after an AI character in the Halo video game franchise that projects itself as a sensuous, unclothed woman. Apple's Siri is a Norse name that means "beautiful woman who leads you to victory." The Google Assistant system, also known as Google Home, has a gender-neutral name, but the default voice is female.
Baked into their humanized personalities, though, are generations of problematic perceptions of women. These assistants are putting a stamp on society as they become common in homes across the world, and can influence interactions with real women, the report warns. As the report puts it, "The more that culture teaches people to equate women with assistants, the more real women will be seen as assistants - and penalized for not being assistant-like."
Apple and Google declined to comment on the report. Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The publication - the first to offer United Nations recommendations regarding the gendering of AI technologies - urged tech companies and governments to stop making digital assistants female by default and explore developing a gender-neutral voice assistant, among other guidance.
The systems are a reflection of broader gender disparities within the technology and AI sectors, UNESCO noted in the report, which was released in conjunction with the government of Germany and the Equals Skills Coalition, which promotes gender balance in the technology sector.
Women are grossly underrepresented in artificial intelligence, making up 12% of AI researchers and 6% of software developers in the field.

Trump considering pardons of soldiers accused of war crimes

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Friday that he has been considering pardons for several Amer.can military members accused of war crimes, including headline-grabbing cases of shooting unarmed civilians and killing an enemy captive.
Trump, leaving the White House for a trip to Japan, said he was "looking" at the pardons after being asked about reports that he was considering clemency for the soldiers around the upcoming Memorial Day holiday.
"Some of these soldiers are people that have fought hard and long," the president said. "You know, we teach them how to be great fighters and then when they fight sometimes they get really treated very unfairly."
But, Trump cautioned, "I haven't done anything yet. I haven't made any decisions."
"There's two or three of them right now," the president continued. "It's a little bit contrcversial. It's very possible that I'll let the trials go on, and I'll make my decision after the trial."
A number of veterans groups have registered opposition to the possible pardons, including one that could reportedly go to Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL. Gallagher is charged with killing a wounded Islamic State prisoner under his care in Iraq in 2017.
Prosecutors said Gallagher fatally stabbed a wounded teenage Islamic State fighter, shot two civilians in Iraq and opened fire on crowds. Gallagher has pleaded not guilty to all counts. His lawyers said that he did not murder anyone and that disgruntled SEALs made the accusations because they wanted to get rid of a demanding platoon leader.
Several major veterans groups said they had not been consulted by the White House about the possible pardons and were not provided with information they had requested about who was being considered and why.
Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, urged Trump to exercise caution and not rush to act before Memorial Day, expressing concern that pardons could be issued before trials were held or fully adjudicated.
"These are not the types of decisions to be rushed and should be made after long and careful consideration," he said. "We want to hear from the administration as to their rationale - what additional information they have and why they are taking this course."
The Vietnam Veterans of America said it was opposed to the idea of issuing pardons to those accused or convicted of war crimes, which they believe could sidestep justice. Officials there said they saw no reason for the U.S. to deviate from its norm of abiding by the code of conduct and the Nuremberg principles, as embodied in the Universal Code of Military Justice, for more than 70 years.
"It is mind-blowing that these are the persons this administration is considering for pardons," said Kristofer Goldsmith, an associate director for policy and chief investigator at Vietnam Veterans of America.
A number of influential Trump outside advisers have pushed the president to pardon the soldiers. Others believed to be considered for pardons are Mathew Golsteyn, a former U.S. Army commando being charged with murder for killing a suspected Taliban bombmaker in Afghanistan, and Nicholas Slatten, one of four former Black-water guards who were found guilty at trial in the fatal shooting of unarmed Iraqi civilians in a crowded Baghdad traffic circle.
The possible pardons were first reported by The New York Times.

The $135 million grande dame

Texto completo: The definition of “grande dame:”
A bigger-than-life lady with an ocean-to-lake mansion, the type of fascinating lady found only in Palm Beach.
Terry Allen Kramer, 85, filled those stilettos.
The perpetually tan Broadway producer and heiress died on May 2 in Manhattan, but her obituaries were quick to mention her Palm Beach life.
Here’s how The New York Times described her Palm Beach mansion, La Follia — which has its own website, lafolliapalmbeach, run by Douglas Elliman real estate:
“When La Follia, her (Kramer’s) Palm Beach estate, was put on the market last fall for $135 million, it was said to be the most expensive American property ever listed. An Italianate villa, facing both the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, the home covers more than 37,000 square feet, with 13 bedrooms,
a movie theater and its own fitness center.”
“I’ve been to it,” the New York Post gossip columnist Cindy Adams wrote at the time. “It’s larger than Utica.”
It covers nearly 5 acres, but La Follia is petite compared to Palm Beach’s 1920 boom-era mansions, such as President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago (17 acres) a half-mile north, and El Mirasol, long torn down, which covered 42 acres of land-to-ocean property.
Today, there are more than 50 homes on the El Mirasol property. Addison Mizner designed El Mirasol for socialite Eva Stotesbury, who was society’s queen bee in 1919.
Kramer was famous for the plays she produced — she won five Tony awards — and also for her society bashes, particularly her annual Thanksgiving dinner at La Follia.
Famous faces strolled the loggias at La Follia, including Kramer’s friends George Hamilton, Joan Collins and Ivana Trump.
Kramer’s own face was known for its tawny glow, set off by her mane of blond hair.
Her first Tony was for Edward Albee’s “The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?”, named best play in 2002. Her last Tony was for “Hello, Dolly” (2017), the Bette Midler production that was named best musical revival.
Kramer also won Tonys for “La Cage aux Folles” (2004), best musical revival; and “Kinky Boots” (2013), best musical. She also produced the family drama “The Humans” (2016), by Stephen Karam, which won four Tonys, including best play.
Her last Broadway production: “Escape to Margaritaville” (2018), a musical based on the songs of Jimmy Buffett.
The ultimate escape, of course, is La Follia.
Here’s how lafolliapalmbeach.com describes the mansion: “La Follia, the only direct ocean-to-lake estate on Palm Beach, is unparalleled as one of the most significant properties on the Island.
“Built 24 feet above sea level, with 210 feet of direct water frontage, this Italian Renaissance home is reminiscent of the Palm Beach’s heyday Fatio Era of the 1920s and offers staggering views of both the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway.
“The property echoes a feel of grandeur and glamour beginning with the entrance, marked by an opulent wrought-iron gate, decorative archway and stately elephant sculptures, leading through a canopy of Banyan trees to the porte cochere, and into a two-story coquina limestone entrance foyer.
“With thoughtful design and placement by renowned architect Jeff Smith, the main hall opens to reveal the multiple grand living areas on the first floor. Weaving elegant details such as tri-colored marble floors, intricate coffered paneled ceilings and custom millwork with the indigenous and natural materials of stone and coquina to anchor the structure to the surrounding terrain.
“All aspects of this spectacular waterfront compound give the home a true sense of formality and timeless appeal. The Italianate style main residence boasts 25-foot high ceilings, light-filled living spaces, substantial exterior loggias, and magnificent views of the ocean. Electronic glass panels in arcades off gentleman’s club room and dining room offer to provide a true sense of indoor/outdoor living at a moments notice. The H-shaped estate offers symmetrical facades to maximize the 360 degree commanding views. Off the main hall, the ornate guest wings, which overlook the pool, are entered through the Mizneresque Via and offer four private suites connected by arched courtyards and bronze fountains.
“Just beyond this halcyon arched walkway lies a luxury fitness center, perfectly set alongside the tranquil pool area to inspire health and wellness. The sun-drenched pool cabana, lined with the stepped terraces and lush landscaping of the descending gardens, frame the sensational views of Intracoastal Waterway and lend a sentiment of a true Italian country Villa. A small orchard of citrus, mango and banana trees hold court on a portion of the west side of the property, in addition to two acres of lush green space and private boat dock fit for the discerning boat enthusiast.”
The grande dame is gone ... but her mansion lives on.

Texto completo: The heart remains a place of mystery and intrigue. We love with all of our heart. Some have the heart of a lion. And, apparently, some may have the heart of a runner, while others have the heart of a swimmer. And still others – the heart of a rower.
It seems a reasonable estimate to say the average human's heart, who lives to the age of 70, will beat at least 2.6 billion times.
For runners, swimmers and other athletes that depend so much on aerobic and anaerobic capacity, the heart often defines their limits. VO2Max, stroke volume and maximum heart rate are just a few of the terms that drive training. Athletes constantly work to improve the heart.
And yet, as powerful an engine as this organ is, the leading cause of death in the US remains heart disease and the number five cause of death was stroke. And while we seem to be getting smarter in finding ways to treat and prevent heart disease, we are not fully implementing what we know because the bad numbers continue to grow and life expectancy in the U.S. continues to drop.
Despite the overwhelming evidence that exercise helps, too many people either don't exercise at all or just don't remain consistent about it.
There are of course also those who do all the right things and still suffer from heart issues such as high blood pressure, tachycardias, blocked arteries and veins and heart attacks. My own experience includes high blood pressure and a partial blockage of the left anterior descending artery (also known as the widow maker).
On the stroke side I was surprised to come across a number of reports about Olympic gold medalist Michael Johnson suffering a stroke. Prior to Usain Bolt, Michael Johnson was probably the best sprinter of all time or at least the best 200-400-meter sprinter.
He held the world record in both of these events and won 4 Olympic gold medals and 8 World Championship golds during his career. In September of 2018, however, he felt a tingle in his leg and numbness in his arm. Johnson, with pressure from his wife, was smart enough to rush to the emergency room where it was confirmed he had suffered a stroke.
"Angry that someone as determinedly clean-living as himself, with no obvious risk factors – he didn't smoke, ate healthily, kept fit and had no family history of cardiovascular disease – had suffered a stroke." Soon he was unable to walk. Johnson told The Guardian: "I did feel like: 'Why did this happen to me, when I was doing all the right things?'"
A project being undertaken by Frontier Cardiovascular Adjustments and Adaptations to Exercise: From the Athlete to the Patient is interesting. It begins by describing the general state of research.
A great bulk of evidence suggests that regular exercise confers protection against cardiovascular diseases, whereas physical inactivity is a risk factor. Furthermore, it has been found that exercise capacity is a strong predictor of risk of death from any cause in both healthy subjects and in those with cardiovascular pathologies.
Then, the journal moves forward:
However, the exact mechanisms by which regular exercise protects the cardiovascular apparatus is not completely understood.
Exercise probably acts at various levels in the cardiovascular system. The regulation and the integration of many cardiovascular functions are modified by exercise training. For example, exercise can improve baroreflex sensitivity, blood pressure regulation, organs perfusion and vascular reactivity. Moreover, at the cellular level, exercise can modify gene expression and molecule production. Finally, exercise also exerts anti anti-inflammatory effects.
Gretchen Reynolds, a New York Times writer started her review of this study by asking the question, "Do world class swimmers hearts function differently than elite runners?" In trying to answer this question, researchers focused on the left ventricle structure and function of the athletes during training. The study put 16 elite swimmers and 16 elite runners through a battery of tests.
The results as described by Ms. Reynolds demonstrated:
It turned out, to no one's surprise, that the athletes, whether runners or swimmers, enjoyed enviable heart health. Their heart rates hovered around 50 beats per minute, with the runners' rates slightly lower than the swimmers.' But all of the athletes' heart rates were much lower than is typical for sedentary people, signifying that their hearts were robust.
As expected, the athletes also had relatively large, efficient left ventricles. But there was also another unique finding. The runners' left ventricles tended to fill a little quicker than those of the swimmers (although both were better than average) and pumped blood (untwisted) more "emphatically."
The reason for the difference, some of the researchers hypothesized, might be related specifically to the type of exercise. i.e., swimmers exercised more in a horizontal position Their hearts do not have to fight gravity to get blood back to the heart, unlike in upright runners. Posture does some of the work for swimmers, and so their hearts reshape themselves only as much as needed for the demands of their sport.

George Will: Protectionism is iatrogenic government

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The cascading effects of U.S. protectionism on U.S. producers and consumers constitute an ongoing tutorial about what Daniel Patrick Moynihan called "iatrogenic government." In medicine, an iatrogenic ailment is one inadvertently caused by a physician or medicine. Iatrogenic government -- except the damage it currently is doing is not inadvertent -- was on display last week.
The Trump administration unveiled a plan to disburse $16 billion to farmers as balm for wounds -- predictable and predicted -- from the retaliation of other nations, especially China, against U.S. exports in response to the administration's tariffs. The $16 billion does not need to be approved by Congress because not much that presidents do nowadays needs to be. The president said the sum will be paid for by the billions of dollars the Treasury takes in from China. The evident sincerity of his frequently reiterated belief that exporters to the United States pay the tariffs that U.S. importers and consumers pay is more alarming than mere meretriciousness would be.
The $16 billion is not the first such tranche ($12 billion was disbursed last year) and the $28 billion probably will not be the government's final restitution, using other people's money, for damages it is doing. So, taxpayers who are paying more for imported goods covered by the administration's tariffs (which are taxes Americans pay) are also paying to compensate some other Americans for injuries inflicted on them in response to the tariffs that are injuring the taxpayers.
President Trump, who deserves Winston Churchill's description of U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (a "bull ... who carries his china closet with him"), has tweeted that the government could buy $15 billion worth of surplus commodities (for you keeping score at home, that would bring tariff compensation for farmers to $43 billion) from U.S. farmers ("@POTUS loves his farmers") and ship the commodities to developing nations. What could possibly go wrong?
In a masterpiece of understatement, Darci Vetter, President Obama's chief agricultural trade negotiator, told Politico that this could have "serious market implications" in recipient countries. Implications such as the devastation of local agriculture, the largest industry in many developing nations.
The administration might be pleased that some non-Chinese companies that manufacture in China are moving production elsewhere to avoid U.S. tariffs on goods from China, thereby slowing that nation's economy. What could possibly go wrong? Presumably the administration has thought through the consequences of promoting an economic slowdown in the country that buys many U.S. goods -- e.g., China is one of Boeing's biggest customers, and Cadillac sells more cars in China than in America.
Zachary Karabell, an investor writing in The Wall Street Journal, has noted that China is not as vulnerable to U.S. pressure as Japan was in the 1980s, when the U.S. purchased about a third of Japanese exports and supplied about half of its foreign investment and much of its national defense. "China has a $700 billion trade relationship with the U.S., including imports and exports, but it has a $3 trillion trade relationship with the rest of the world."
The New York Times recently reported that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a member of an administration that purports to be a dike against a rising tide of socialism, is "encouraging [U.S.] firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere" -- meaning, out of China. Capitalists believe that market signals, not political appointees with political agendas, give satisfactory encouragement for reasonable commercial behaviors.
Today's system is capitalism leavened by cronyism and administered by know-it-alls. What could possibly go wrong? A report by a Federal Reserve researcher and two University of Chicago economists has found that tariffs on washing machines raised their cost by $86 on average -- but also raised the prices of dryers by $92 as, The New York Times reports, "manufacturers of laundry equipment used the tariffs as an opportunity to raise prices on things that were not, in fact, affected by the tariffs." The tariffs, according to the report, have created about 1,800 American manufacturing jobs, but at a cost of over $817,000 a job.
This is the art of the deal as practiced by him who relishes his self-bestowed sobriquet "Tariff Man," and who explains tariffs this way: "When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so." Is that clear? Perhaps not, but this is: Protectionism is yet another example of government being the disease for which it pretends to be the cure.

Texto completo: On Memorial Day, James Holzhauer was busy defended his reign on "Jeopardy!" And he didn't exactly take it easy.
On Monday's episode, Holzhauer notched his 28th consecutive win with $130,222, building on the $74,400 that put him over the $2 million mark on Friday. Monday's tally was just shy of his one-day record of $131,127, set April 9.
And he did it in commanding fashion. By the end of Double Jeopardy, Holzhauer was miles ahead of his competitors, who finished the round with $6,600 and $6,200.
That made the Final Jeopardy clue about "Games" – presumably an easy subject for the champ – all but a formality. And the question, which all of the contestants knew – "What is Life?" – summed up everything.
When you're competing against a professional gambler with $72,022 in his pot, a usually tidy $13,195 just isn't going to win the day.
Holzhauer is just the second contestant to pass the $2 million mark in regular game play, joining Ken Jennings, who piled up $2,520,700 by the time his 74-win run ended in 2004.
Astoundingly, Holzhauer, a Las Vegas-based professional sports gambler, reached the $2 million threshold in just 27 episodes. His total after Monday's game now sits at $2,195,557.
Holzhauer explained his aggressive clue selection and wagering approach to The New York Times last month.
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game, I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said, likening his approach to a poker strategy. "There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament. You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Jennings, for one, is impressed with the 34-year-old's bold strategy, telling Wired that he is "gobsmacked" by Holzhauer.
"I thought I had seen everything on 'Jeopardy!' And this is something I would have thought was just impossible, these numbers," he marveled. "He’s maximizing money. He can make two or three times what any other player ever has with that same level of play, which again is top-shelf. "
Jennings said he loves Holzhauer's ambitious approach.
"I’ve always wanted to see somebody play that way, you know? I remember as a kid doing the math and figuring out how much somebody could win on 'Jeopardy!,' if they got every question, and got all the Daily Doubles last, and they bet everything on them," Jennings told Wired. "Like, wow, look at that number. Did I actually think we would see someone try that? No, I did not. "

Texto completo: Dance has been a part of Derek Hough's life since he was a child, but he is also an accomplished musician, actor and singer. In his new stage show, he showcases his many talents and opens up with audiences on a more personal level. "Derek Hough Live! The Tour" will visit Comerica Theatre on Sunday, June 2.
Hough is best known as a cast member on "Dancing With the Stars," a TV competition he has won six times. He won two Emmy Awards for his choreography on the show. He recently served as a judge alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo on the TV show "World of Dance."
He has played Corny Collins in "Hairspray Live!," been the male lead in a London production of "Footloose" and had a recurring role on the TV show "Nashville." His book "Taking the Lead: Lessons from a Life in Motion" was a New York Times bestseller.
This tour is a different experience for Hough, who is used to working with his sister. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he toured with Julianne Hough, also an accomplished dancer, actress and singer.
His new show isn't just him on stage alone, though. He has dancers and a band. The show crosses genres, presenting Motown, Latin, rock-and-roll, big band, hip hop and other styles of music and dance. Hough plays the guitar and drums, along with singing and dancing.
He talked about his solo tour during a recent telephone interview.
Question: How have audiences been responding to your tour?
Answer: The audiences' response, the reactions, the reviews have been overwhelming. I've worked so hard on this show, putting together something that appeals to such a wide demographic, everybody from kids to 90-year-olds and everybody in between.
I really get personal, and I get quite vulnerable in the show towards the end, having a chat. The response so far from everybody has been just beautiful. I'll sign autographs and sign posters after the show, and I ask a lot of people what's their favorite part.
What's so wonderful to hear is everybody has a different favorite part that they love the most. Some will be in tears from the emotional parts of the show, and some are having a blast, having fun, standing up and dancing. It captures all of the different emotions.
Question: Do you feel it's changed how people look at you?
Answer: There's a lot of singing in the show. I do "Singin' in the Rain," Michael Buble songs and some Top 40 stuff. It's wonderful to share that aspect of what I do as well.
For me to have done so many different tours and for people to come up to me and say that they really, really loved this one, it just makes me so happy. I'm always trying to get better and better, elevate and make the best show possible for these audiences.
Question: What went into choosing the dancers for your show?
Answer: I picked dancers that can do things that I can't. There's certain things that I'm an expert at, and there are certain areas that aren't necessarily my strongest areas. Every night, I'm blown away by what they are producing on that stage, just their technique, their grace and their athleticism.
Question: When you were getting ready for the show, did it feel different working with them compared to your sister?
Answer: The biggest difference was trying to figure out how I was going to be onstage for the entire time, or where I was going to not be onstage. It was very important for me to have dancers who were so good that it didn't matter if I was onstage or not.
Also, the one big change for this show is I have a live band. That was a big part of the process. It took a lot more thought, a lot more time. I did all the arrangements and was in the recording studio, putting together music. The band was rehearsing, and we were dancing in the room. What it has done is it has made the show feel more like a concert.
Question: How long did it take to put together the show?
Answer: It took a long time. The thing that took the longest was the music, getting the music and the set list together. I wanted such a big variety of music that covers the whole spectrum of genres and music that inspires us to move and dance. Also, I wanted to pick music that was meant to be played live. I wanted this music to really pop and really feel exciting when you hear it.
Question: How did you decide what music to use?
Answer: I picked music that I get excited about but also music that I know that my audience will love as well, infusing them, combining them, updating some of them, changing some of these songs and making them feel more contemporary. For me, what's awesome is after the show having a 6-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music and, in the same moment, having a 70-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music.
Question: Did you have to brush up on any dance styles for the show?
Answer: I tap a lot in the show. For me, I love tap dancing so much. I had to definitely work hard on brushing up on my tap. I do a really challenging routine in the show. It's very demanding, very physical. Fortunately, I keep sharp in my styles and what I do, and I work hard, train and practice a lot. When it came to rehearsal, I was ready to go.
Question: It sounds like you've really challenged and pushed yourself with this show.
Answer: This definitely is a challenging show for everybody, including our dancers. The dancers are working extremely hard. It's a full-out show. When people come and see the show, I think they're surprised by the amount of energy that is exerted on that stage.
Question: What do you hear consistently that audiences always love and get excited about?
Answer: There's a moment where I get really personal. I really open up about struggles that I've gone through and how we all share this vulnerability. We all share these thoughts, these doubts in our mind. I've really heard from a lot of people that it touched them. It really moved them tremendously. That's my goal. I really just want to inspire, motivate or connect with the audience.
Question: Have your dancers and band helped to shape the show?
Answer: A lot of the big moments, it could only happen because of the talent of the musicians or the dancers. Being a choreographer isn't just about creating moves that you want to see. It's about bringing the best out in who you have. A lot of times, I will say, "Do something amazing here," and they will do something that is in their wheelhouse and only they can bring that to the table. There are so many of those moments that each dancer brings that couldn't have happened without them.

Texto completo: "Have you read any good books lately?" has at times, and by some wits, been characterized as a question one resorts to when all other conversation gambits have been exhausted. To many of us, however, this is one of the most interesting questions you can ask a person.
Indeed, no lesser oracle than The New York Times submits this question may be asked on a job interview and recommends: "Unless you're up for a position in academia or as book critic for The New York Times, you're not expected to be a literary lion. But it wouldn't hurt to have read a handful of the most recent and influential books in your profession and on management.
"Consider it part of the work of your job search to read up on a few of these leading books. But make sure they are quality books that reflect favorably upon you and nothing that could even remotely be considered superficial. Finally, add a recently published best-selling work of fiction by a world-class author and you'll pass this question with flying colors."
Even the well-educated may have a problem.
An attorney, writing for the journal of the American Bar Association, states: "A law firm partner approached me. She had a problem. 'I can't read anymore. I've lost the ability. I used to read great literature but now I can't. Ever since I went to law school, I find myself scouring whatever I'm reading to find what's most relevant. I skim for the main point. But in literature, it's not there.' ""You say you once read literature voraciously?""Yes. Tolstoy. Dostoevsky. Dickens. Woolf. Hardy. I tried the other day to read Jane Austen, but I just couldn't do it. Can you help?""I recognized the syndrome she was talking about — in myself. Sometimes I'll start reading The New Yorker as if it were a typical law report. I have to consciously remind myself to slow down. Relish the language. Don't rush. Pay attention not just to what's being said but also to how it's being said."
I'm most fortunate in having many friends who are readers. We share books, recommend others or simply quote from and talk about what we've read.
Reading can be a tremendous resource for coping with the ups and downs of life. I've often felt the relief and escape from my own everyday problems while I'm reading a really compelling book. It's cheaper than a psychiatrist and a book is always readily available.
I've just finished reading "Having Our Say — The Delany Sisters first 100 Years." Sadie Delany, an American educator and civil rights pioneer and her younger sister Bessie, a dentist, were two black ladies living in upstate New York. Reading about their outstanding lives was an inspiration.
For lightweight reading, I enjoy mysteries by Stuart Woods. Predictably, all Woods says about reading is: "It seems to me that most people are interested in reading about characters who are richer than they are." He may be right.
More eloquently, philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "If we encounter a man of rare intellect we should ask him what books he reads." Mark Twain asserts more bluntly, "The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read."

Texto completo: NEW CASTLE – Andrew Cuomo is marching his way out of Westchester, but first he marched in the local Memorial Day parade.
The New York state governor's girlfriend, TV star Sandra Lee, is selling the New Castle house she shares with Cuomo, with the couple intending to move out of the county.
But Cuomo, a Democrat, marched alongside Bill and Hillary Clinton Monday in the annual parade in the town that also includes the tony hamlet of Chappaqua, where the former president and secretary of state live.
"We still have a lot of men and women who are serving, putting their lives in harm's way and this is this chance for every American to respect that, community by community," Cuomo told reporters. "And that's what's nice about this parade, it's community by community."
Former President Bill Clinton said the event made him think of four high school classmates of his who died in Vietnam.
"And then thinking of all the people that I sent around the world to defend our freedom, our interests, our values," Clinton said. "It's something — this is an important holiday ... Every American needs to observe it."
Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state, said it was an important tradition to honor everyone who made "the ultimate sacrifice for our country and our freedom ...
"And to do it where we live, with our friends and neighbors, makes it very special," she said
The parade was one of a few dozen Memorial Day observances scheduled in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam.
Also on Monday in the Bronx, during the seventh-inning stretch of a game between the New York Yankees and San Diego Padres, the Yankees honored Louis Forte, a 104-year-old World War II veteran who lives in Somers. The Yankees recognize veterans in the middle of the seventh inning and play "God Bless America."
The Clintons and Cuomo have participated in the New Castle parade and other events over the years as residents of the town.
Lee paid $1.2 million in 2008 for a six-bedroom Colonial on 3 acres at 4 Bittersweet Lane. Lee listed the house for sale earlier this month with an asking price of $2 million, with Cuomo saying his daughters moving out was the catalyst for the sale.
Both the governor and Lee denied rumors of a breakup, with Lee telling The New York Times the couple will split time between Manhattan, Albany and the Hamptons on Long Island.
The Clintons have lived locally since Bill Clinton ended his term as president in 2000. It was the couple's address as Hillary Clinton served as U.S. senator and secretary of state and twice ran for president.

Texto completo: Laurier "Larry" T. Raymond Jr., a former Lewiston mayor whose 2002 letter to Somali elders asking them to slow the arrival of refugees to the city touched off a firestorm of national attention, has died.
Raymond died Saturday at Androscoggin Hospice House in Auburn, according to an obituary provided by the funeral home handling his visitation services. He was 87.
A practicing attorney for 61 years, Raymond also served as the Androscoggin County attorney in the 1960s and as a probate judge for more than three decades, his obituary said. He was active in many civic and community organizations throughout his career.
But it was his stint as Lewiston mayor - a largely ceremonial position in 2002 - that brought Raymond into the national spotlight. He made nationwide headlines, including coverage in The New York Times and The Washington Post, when he penned an open letter to the Somali-American community saying that a rapid influx of Somali refugees was overwhelming city services.
According to an October 2002 Washington Post article, about 1,500 Somali refugees had arrived in Lewiston in a relatively short period, including about 300 between Memorial Day and Labor Day of that year, stressing the city's General Assistance and school budgets. Lewiston's population at the time was about 35,000, it said.
"This large number of new arrivals cannot continue without negative results for all," Raymond wrote in his letter. "The Somali community must exercise some discipline and reduce the stress on our limited finances and our generosity."
At the time, city officials defended the letter as a sincere plea from the mayor of a city that had been taxed to its limits by a rapid influx of new residents who were all seeking local government assistance. However, it was perceived by some members of both pro- and anti-immigration groups as being racially motivated.
ONE-TERM ONLY
According to news reports from the time, the letter angered many community leaders and residents, prompting some to speak out against Raymond, while others defended him. Raymond served just one term as Lewiston mayor, vowing not to run for re-election after the negative reaction his letter received.
A small group of white supremacists held a demonstration in support of Raymond in Lewiston in early 2003, which sparked a much larger counterdemonstration at Bates College involving about 4,000 people critical of his letter.
A documentary film about the incident called "The Letter: An American Town and the 'Somali Invasion,'" was released to critical acclaim in 2003.
Nearly two decades after Raymond's letter was published, even those who disagreed with him at the time now say Raymond did not deserve the scorn and allegations of racism he received.
"I disagreed with him in regards to the letter," said Larry Gilbert Sr., who served with Raymond on the board of directors at the Franco American Heritage Center. "But I understand why he did it. I think his intentions were good. I don't believe he was being hateful at all."
Robert MacDonald, another former Lewiston mayor, said when Raymond wrote the letter, he was doing what is expected of a mayor: He was looking out for the people he served by trying to keep city finances from falling into chaos.
'HE REALLY CARED'
"He got so much flak over it," MacDonald said. "And he didn't do anything other than to think about the people of Lewiston. He was a very good mayor. He really cared for this city."
Raymond practiced law with two firms: Marshall, Raymond and Beliveau and, later, Isaacson & Raymond. He served as Androscoggin County attorney from 1960 to 1965, and as judge of probate from 1965 to 1998.
According to Raymond's obituary, he is survived by his wife, Pauline; his children, Susan Geismar, L. Thomas Raymond III and Martha Venter; son-in-law J. Christopher Turner; stepson John St. Germain; eight grandchildren; one stepgranddaughter; and two great-grandchildren.
Visitation will be held at the Albert & Burpee Funeral Home, 253 Pine St. in Lewiston, from 2 to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday, it said. A Mass of Christian Burial will take place at 11 a.m. Wednesday in the upper church of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, 122 Ash St. in Lewiston. Burial and committal prayers will follow at St. Peter's Cemetery, 217 Switzerland Road, in Lewiston.
Condolences and donations may be given online at albert-burpee.com.

Women are more productive when office AC isn't cranked up, study finds

Texto completo: Unlike men, they tend
to perform certain skills better when it's warmer
Women have a new weapon they can use to make their case against the chilly office conditions many experience each summer, as their sleeveless summer work clothes do battle with cranked-up air-conditioning systems. A new study shows women tend to perform certain skills better when the temperature is a little warmer, making them more productive, while men tend to do better when the temperature is a bit cooler.
In a paper released Wednesday by the journal PLOS One, researchers at the University of Southern California and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center reported that in experiments, test scores on verbal and math skills improved for women as the temperature rose and were better for men when it declined (though to a lesser effect), opening a new front in the office thermostat wars.
The paper's release set off yet another round of attention and headlines to what's been called the "thermostat patriarchy," or the gender divide on where to set the thermostat in the office. A few years ago, a scientific paper in the journal Nature Climate Change turned up the dial of the debate when it offered physiological data for why women and men are comfortable at different indoor temperatures and spelled out how office temperatures may be based on the needs of a 40-year-old, 154-pound man.
Then last summer, it flared up again when Cynthia Nixon, Andrew M. Cuomo's Democratic primary opponent for New York governor, asked a TV station to set the debate hall thermostat to a warm 76 degrees, calling workplaces "notoriously sexist when it comes to room temperature," the New York Times reported.
When the PLOS One article prompted its own furious round of headlines and social media attention - "tweeting this while wrapped up in the blanket I keep at my desk," wrote one woman on Twitter as she shared a headline on the paper - researcher Tom Chang, an associate professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, wasn't surprised.
Not only did the Nixon-Cuomo flap break out when the paper was being wrapped up last year, "but for the past 10-plus years, I've been arguing with my wife about the thermostat at the house," Chang said. And at USC's business school, he said, "the female faculty have illicit space heaters under their desks; they wear sweaters; they have blankets," he said. "This is relevant for anyone who works in an office space."
What Chang was surprised by was the magnitude of his study's results. Chang and his co-author, Agne Kajackaite, tested verbal and math skills in tests of college students in Berlin. They found that for every one degree increase in Celsius, the number of math questions answered correctly by women went up by 1.76 percent. Put another way: Even within normal indoor temperature variations - increasing the temperature from the 60s to the 70s in the room - female performance on the math tests increased by 15 percent.
"This was a really large effect," Chang said. Performance by men, meanwhile, dropped by about 3 percent, on average, when the temperature rose over the same variance.
Chang said the explanation for the difference isn't entirely clear, but some research suggests the effect may be biological, or based on size - average surface area to body volume comparisons for men vs. women. "I haven't seen anything definitive," he said.
What's not likely to be the explanation, at least in this case, was clothing. Because the test was run on college students, he said, there weren't the same kind of sartorial differences between male and female participants. Rather than button-down shirts and pants or sleeveless blouses or dresses, both male and female students dressed in relatively similar ways, he said: "They were all coming in in shorts and a T-shirt."
Chang acknowledges that it's also unclear whether the same productivity effects would be seen in a workplace environment as the student participants, but suggests the results are still a reminder employers should be more mindful that indoor temperatures aren't just about making employees comfortable, but making them more productive.
What can employers do in response? The ubiquity of open office plans makes it more challenging, but Chang doesn't rule out the idea of having different temperature settings in different spaces. Most important, he said, is to recognize that something should be done if people are complaining or actively making their own accommodations to cold temperatures.
"Everybody is latching on to the battle of the sexes, but I don't think that's the right lesson to take away from our work," Chang said. "I think the two lessons are, first, that these environmental factors matter more than people think they do when it comes to productivity. The other is one size doesn't fit all. . . . If half of the people in your office are sneaking space heaters under their desk or talking about how it's hot all the time, you should take that more seriously."
In places with good climate like Los Angeles, some fresh air might even be something to consider. His own office, Chang says, is in a modern building designed by the recently deceased architect I.M. Pei, with beautiful glass windows overlooking a rose garden. But some issues with the air conditioning have meant temperatures have fluctuated, at times, between 55 and over 90 degrees. "If we had windows that would open, it would be 73 degrees all the time."

Texto completo: Headnote More than 80 women have accused former Hollywood insider of wrongdoing; many of those complaints involve sexual harassment
Harvey Weinstein and his former studio's board members have reached a tentative $44 million deal to resolve lawsuits filed by women who accused him of sexual misconduct and by the New York state attorney general, according to three people briefed on the matter.
The outcome of the settlement talks will be especially notable because the lawsuits are one of the main avenues by which Weinstein could be held responsible for his alleged actions.
He is facing criminal charges in New York for allegations of sexual violence against two women. But more than 80 women have accused him of wrongdoing, and many of those complaints involve sexual harassment, which is a civil violation, not a criminal one. So the details of any settlement - such as whether it includes an admission of wrongdoing by Weinstein - would carry significant symbolism.
The proposed sum is less than half of what was initially discussed as a victims' fund as part of conversations last year between an investor group that was interested in buying assets of The Weinstein Co. and Eric T. Schneiderman, who was then New York's attorney general. That proposed deal, which fell apart at the last minute, included a victims' fund worth up to $90 million.
Under the proposed terms of the new deal, about $30 million would go to a pool of plaintiffs that includes alleged victims, creditors of Weinstein's former studio and some former employees, according to the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the agreement was private. The balance would go to legal fees for associates of Weinstein, including board members named as defendants in lawsuits.
Insurance policies would cover the $44 million if the current agreement is finalized.
Weinstein did not return calls for comment. A spokeswoman for the office of the New York state attorney general declined to comment. A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the tentative deal.
Weinstein was long one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, known for backing boundary breaking films like "Pulp Fiction" and Oscar winners like "Shakespeare in Love." But in October 2017, investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed allegations that he had sexually harassed or abused numerous current or former employees and other women over several decades.
The Weinstein Co., the Hollywood studio founded by Weinstein and his brother and business partner, Bob Weinstein, filed for bankruptcy in March 2018. The movie and television studio, once known for Oscar-winning films like "The King's Speech" and "The Artist," had less than $500,000 in cash at the time and was facing a mountain of debt and a swelling number of lawsuits, including the one by New York's attorney general.
Lawyers for women who say they were victims of Harvey Weinstein have been in mediation since last year with representatives for the former studio mogul. Also involved in the talks were lawyers for the former board members and the New York attorney general's office, which last year sued Weinstein and his brother for violating state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual abuse and coercion. The goal was to reach a settlement that would cover all of the suits pending against the former Hollywood mogul, his now-defunct movie studio and associates.
The Weinstein Co. is seeking to liquidate. In a recent bankruptcy filing, lawyers for the studio said the efforts to resolve legal claims by some of the women had stalled in recent months, and put additional strain on its dwindling resources.
A separate bankruptcy filing on May 15 described the mediation process as "highly adversarial" and said at least 11 separate sessions had been held over a year.
Harvey Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges in New York.
He was initially indicted in state Supreme Court in Manhattan on sex-crime charges involving three women, including one who said that Weinstein raped her inside a hotel room at a DoubleTree in midtown Manhattan in March 2013. The woman has not been identified in court papers.
He was also charged with forcing two other women to engage in oral sex with him. Lucia Evans, a marketing executive, said she was assaulted in his Tribeca office in 2004, and Mimi Haleyi, a production assistant, said Weinstein assaulted her at his apartment in 2006.
The judge, James Burke, dismissed the charge related to Evans after the Manhattan District Attorney's Office acknowledged that the lead detective on the case, Nicholas DiGaudio, did not disclose information from a witness who said Evans had provided a conflicting account of the alleged assault. But DiGaudio, who has since been reassigned, has maintained that he did inform prosecutors.
Weinstein has denied the allegations and has said the relationships were consensual.
Earlier this year, Weinstein also replaced his longtime defense lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, with a new "dream team" of lawyers who have a history of representing celebrity clients. His criminal trial is expected to begin Sept. 9.
Soon after Weinstein built his new defense team, one of his star lawyers, Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., a law professor and a faculty dean of an undergraduate house at Harvard University, came under fire by students there for representing the Hollywood producer. This month, Harvard decided to end Sullivan's term as dean on June 30, following months of pressure from students. Later, Sullivan withdrew from Weinstein's defense team.

Texto completo: For decades, journalists have received and published government secrets in the public interest with the protection of the First Amendment.
Think of the Pentagon Papers, which told Americans about their government's hidden (and often unsavory or illegal) behavior during the Vietnam War. The New York Times and The Washington Post received the highly classified information from a former Pentagon official, Daniel Ellsberg, and - though legal battles raged - were able to publish them.
Or think of The Post's reporting (along with that of the Guardian) that exposed the National Security Agency's massive global surveillance programs, with much the information supplied by the former government contractor Edward Snowden.
Or, years earlier, the Times reporting about how the government was secretly monitoring the calls and emails of people inside the United States without court-approved warrants.
All won Pulitzer Prizes, and all informed citizens about activities their secrecy-obsessed government didn't want them to know.
That kind of reporting - perhaps the most important journalism there is - may have become an endangered species Thursday with a new indictment of WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange under the Espionage Act.
For good reason, press-rights advocates are far more alarmed now than they were last month when Assange was initially indicted.
"This is unlike anything we've seen before, and it crosses a bright red line for journalists, said James Risen, a longtime national security reporter for the Times and now director of the First Look Press Defense Fund. While a Times reporter, Risen (co-author of the warrantless wiretapping story) struggled for years to avoid testifying about his confidential source during the leak investigation of Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer.
The expanded indictment goes after Assange for his role in obtaining and publishing secret military and diplomatic documents in 2010.
What's alarming about the indictment is the way it would criminalize some of the basic functions of newsgathering and publication.
"The message of this indictment is that national security journalism is possibly criminal, said Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.
And no matter what happens with the case, he said, "it's hard to see how that message won't change how news organizations operate. That is very much the intended message, he said.
And, in turn, that chilling effect would deprive the public of information it should know. Using examples from the recent past, Jaffer mentioned the long-secret American drone program and the abuse and torture of prisoners at the CIA's so-called black sites.
If whistleblowers are afraid to leak information and if news organizations fear receiving and publishing it, citizens will know only what the government wants them to know, through what he sardonically called "executive grace.
In other words, the architects of secret, and possibly illegal or immoral, government programs would be the same people who get to decide whether information about them is made public.
Underlying all of this is the monumental overclassification of government information that drastically increased after 9/11 - a system that's almost universally acknowledged to be badly broken.
That means that journalists and citizens are caught in a tighter-than-ever squeeze: Far too much that they should know has been labeled secret, and the accepted ways of informing the public are at risk of being criminalized.
The Trump administration's aggressive antipathy toward journalists is an undeniable element, too.
"The administration has gone from denigrating journalists as enemies of the people' to now criminalizing common practices in journalism that have long served the public interest, Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said in a statement.
Or as Risen put it: "It's very obvious that the White House and Trump are pressuring and politicizing the Justice Department to go after the press.
Julian Assange is such a divisive, even hated figure, that a straw-man argument often crops up when he is threatened with prosecution.
Assange isn't really a journalist, goes this thinking, so journalists and others who care about press rights shouldn't be worried about what happens to him.
In this case, nothing could be further from the truth.
Assange may be an easier target because he is such a lightning rod - and, for some, because of his role in publicizing Democratic National Committee emails that damaged Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign against Trump.
The ever-more-political Justice Department - and the press-baiting president - are no doubt well aware of his vulnerability.
But that is very far off the main point.
No one should diminish the danger or the importance of this despicable indictment because they don't approve of Assange.

Texto completo: As busy people, we often sprint from one obligation to the next. The mandatory client meeting, the business lunch, the kid's soccer game ... all while keeping your seven social media streams up to date, your boss happy and your family fed. In the modern age, we can feel overwhelmed with all the things we just have to do.
When the events in our lives are more duty-bound than optional, our vitality can take a nosedive. Running from one commitment to another, how can we possibly bring our best selves forward?
In his 2013 TED talk, Bert Jacobs (founder of the Life is Good apparel brand) offered up a simple yet incredibly powerful approach to flipping your perspective. He suggests changing out a single word to instantly shift your outlook:
What if you change "have" to "get?" In other words, instead of, "I have to go to this big supplier meeting," it becomes "I get to go to this big supplier meeting."
When you make this easy language shift, your entire attitude improves. It reminds us how lucky we are to be alive. How fortunate that we are healthy enough to take on responsibilities in the first place.
We quickly realize that many people in the world would do anything for the opportunity to live the way we do. That compared to the majority of civilization throughout history, our air-conditioned, mobile-connected, airbag-protected lives are something others only dreamed of.
Since watching Jacobs' TED talk, I've caught myself many times bemoaning something I had to do. But when changing the one word, my mindset instantly shifted to gratitude.
I realized that I get to prepare a financial model. I get to conduct research. I get to exercise and eat healthy food. I get to serve on a corporate board. I get to go to the grocery store to pick up milk for my kids. And yes, I get to sit in traffic ... in a safe, comfortable car that transports my lucky behind way faster than walking or riding a horse.
In your complex world, try this surprisingly simple shift. When we make our haves into gets, we melt away angst, frustration, and dread while liberating gratitude and energy.
I hope you get to do many things this coming week. For me, I'm truly happy I get to take out the garbage. Better than not being able to, no?

Texto completo: When he was a National Guard soldier serving in Afghanistan, Derrick Miller loomed over a civilian who was being interrogated and fired a bullet into the man's head. Then Miller turned to another soldier and said, "I shot him. He was a liar."
Miller was sent to prison eight years ago for that premeditated murder after a prosecutor urged a military court to make "a statement about how soldiers should behave."
President Donald Trump will also make a statement about how soldiers should behave — one utterly misguided and corrosive to military order and good discipline — should he follow through on tentative plans reported by The New York Times to pardon, on or around Memorial Day, troops accused or convicted of war crimes.
Miller, since released on parole, hopes to be among those pardoned. Others include:
Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused by platoon members of wanton violence, including stabbing to death a teenage boy, and gunning down a girl and an old man from a sniper's nest. Gallagher is said to have boasted about his kills and labeled as traitors those who reported his alleged crimes. In a March tweet, Trump moved him to less restrictive confinement in "honor of his past service to our country."
Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, a Green Beret charged with summarily executing a man suspected of being a Taliban bomb-maker who had been ordered released after an interrogation. Golsteyn admitted the crime only after undergoing a polygraph while trying to join the CIA. Trump called him a "U.S. military hero" in a tweet last year.
Former Blackwater contractor Nicholas Slatten, convicted of instigating the slaughter of 14 Iraqi civilians and the wounding of 17 with a cadre of Blackwater gunmen at a Baghdad intersection. Trial evidence revealed Slatten viewed Iraqis as "animals."
Holding these men accountable for wartime barbarities has somehow been misconstrued by elements of Trump's base as justice gone awry. Trump, who trafficks in a culture of pseudo toughness that endorses torture or the killing of terrorist families, has caught their drift.
Pardoning a convicted war criminal is not out of character for Trump. Earlier this month, he pardoned a former Army first lieutenant serving time for "unpremeditated murder in a combat zone." He had been convicted of ordering an Iraqi prisoner to strip naked before shooting the man to death.
War by its nature is brutally dehumanizing. The U.S. military copes by working to instill order and discipline, and it has been largely successful in a human history of armies that have ruthlessly slaughtered civilians and defeated combatants alike.
"Although military necessity justifies certain actions necessary to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible," reads the Defense Department's Law of War Manual, "military necessity cannot justify actions ... such as cruelty or wanton violence."
Trump would turn this military maxim on its head if he chooses to issue these pardons, with the added blasphemy of doing it on a holiday honoring all that Americans cherish about the sacrifices of those in uniform.

Texto completo: Fifty years ago this spring, Harvard students occupied the school's administration building, demanding that the university end its complicity in the Vietnam War by kicking ROTC off campus. The student demands also included creating a black studies program and ending evictions of working-class people from property the university wanted to develop.
We didn't realize at the time that we were also raising another issue that continues to resonate today: whether the 1st Amendment protects the publication of "stolen" documents -- a question back in the headlines today with the Trump administration's indictment of Julian Assange, publisher of WikiLeaks, for espionage.
In 1969, the building occupation ended when Harvard called in the police, who not only arrested the occupiers but also beat hundreds of students who came to see what was going on. After that, 10,000 students met at the stadium and voted to strike.

What the police and the administration didn't know at the time was that, before leaving the building, one of the occupiers removed files from the office of the president and dropped them off outside the office of the Old Mole, a Cambridge underground newspaper (whose name came from Karl Marx: "Our old friend, our old mole, who knows so well how to burrow underground, suddenly to appear: the revolution"). I was a member of the Old Mole collective and a Harvard graduate student at the time.
The trove included letters sent by Harvard Dean Franklin Ford to the college's president, Nathan Pusey, and they documented the university's ties to the CIA and the Pentagon. More important for the strike, however, was one letter from Ford to Pusey suggesting different strategies for undermining faculty support for ending ROTC. We decided to publish several of the "liberated" documents, under the triumphant title, "Reading the Mail of the Ruling Class."
Many on the faculty were outraged at the dean, and soon ROTC left Harvard. But the mainstream media, led by the New York Times, denounced the Old Mole as "lawless" for publishing the purloined papers. There was a certain irony to that given that, just two years later, the New York Times published a different set of "stolen" documents. They called them "the Pentagon Papers."
The documents obtained and published by the Times (as well as by other publications including this newspaper and the Washington Post) were a secret Defense Department history of the Vietnam War that had been copied by Daniel Ellsberg from files at the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica. The Nixon administration tried to stop publication, claiming it would "endanger national security," and the Times went all the way to the Supreme Court arguing that the 1st Amendment protected its right to publish. The court ruled for the Times. (Nixon then went after Ellsberg, putting him on trial for "espionage," but the charges were dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct.)
Fifty years after the Old Mole controversy, debate over publishing stolen documents has been renewed with the Trump administration's indictment Thursday of Assange on 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act. In 2010, WikiLeaks posted on its website devastating material that Army intelligence officer Chelsea Manning had copied from Iraq war logs and diplomatic documents, most notably video shot by American soldiers in an Apache helicopter in 2007 of them killing at least 18 civilians, including two Reuters journalists, on the streets of Iraq -- something I believe should have been prosecuted as a war crime. The video made headlines around the world -- including in the New York Times.
In 2013, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison for espionage. Obama commuted her sentence in January 2017. The Obama Justice Department never brought charges against Assange, after concluding that what WikiLeaks did was the same thing the New York Times had done in 1971 with the Pentagon Papers -- and what news publications around the world do all the time: work with sources to publish documents the government would like to keep hidden.
Back in 1969 Harvard did not press charges against anyone for removing and publishing the files from University Hall. Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign was even more gleeful than we were back in 1969 about the publication of secret documents. "I love WikiLeaks!" he declared -- because it published emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee.
The espionage charges against Assange on Thursday by Trump's Justice Department are for the same acts that the Obama Justice Department considered and then decided against prosecuting. The new indictment alleges that Assange "repeatedly encouraged sources with access to classified information to steal it" and give it to WikiLeaks for publication. That's a major escalation of the indictment brought by the government in April, which charged Assange only with conspiring with Manning to break into a government computer.
But both indictments describe similar acts, accusing Assange of having urged Manning to provide classified material and working with her to keep her identity secret -- including helping Manning create a password that might preserve her anonymity while trying to get into an Army computer.
All that was public information back in 2011, when the Obama administration decided not to prosecute Assange. The April indictment claimed that "Assange actively encourag[ed] Manning to provide more information." During an exchange, the indictment tells us, Manning told Assange that "after this upload, that's all I really have got left." Assange allegedly replied, "curious eyes never run dry in my experience." But that's not a crime -- encouraging sources to get more information is something journalists do all the time.
At the Old Mole we argued that we had a right to publish those "liberated" documents under the 1st Amendment, and that the information they contained was important for the public to know. That's not just a dated idea from the 1960s underground press. Democracies require informed citizenries, because if people don't know what officials are doing, they can't lodge objections. Sometimes that involves publishing classified information that has been leaked. As the Washington Post's motto puts it: "Democracy dies in darkness."
If the Trump administration succeeds in extraditing Julian Assange, the Supreme Court will eventually be asked to decide whether the ordinary news gathering process can be treated as espionage.

Texto completo: Andriko Farreau, 9
People think that my favorite Nintendo character, Sonic the Hedgehog, sucks. I feel that Sonic should get more popularity. Sonic needs to get the respect he deserves. I think that with a brand-new Sonic game, Sonic will be the No. 1 most popular character in all of Nintendo.
Apple is a great company, but in my opinion, they are slowing down their products. Every time I do an update on my iPhone 6S, I have noticed that my battery gets weaker and my phone gets slower. This is causing buyers to spend more money on technology.
Brooklynn Perez, 9
I would like for all grades and all kids to get less homework, because you could have more time with your family. In my opinion, it would be great to have a break after school. I feel that less homework would give you better grades, because you're more relaxed, and you're not worried about not finishing your homework.
Adrian Lacayo, 9
I think kids should be allowed to head the ball in soccer leagues, because if they grow up to be professional soccer players, they will be used to it. This will give you more control and muscle in your neck. Also, if you get in a fight and you get hit in the head, it will not hurt as much.
celia rundlet, 9 The fifth grade and up have a better cafeteria than we do. I know this because I have seen it. The one for pre-K through fourth doesn't have a microwave. We also don't have vending machines. Their seats are cushioned, and ours are hard. They can sit with any of their friends. In pre-K through fourth, you can only sit with your classmates. I think all kids should have these privileges.
Nico Provisero, 10
School should go from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. I was thinking three days of 12 hours. That's only one more hour than our current 35 hours! Then you would get four days of break.
Aubrey Douglas, 10
I think adults shouldn't have guns, because some people can get mad and kill people, and if they are in a school, they can hurt kids. We should take the guns away from people who are not police officers, Army people or people who need to keep themselves safe.
Marian Gomez, 10
My opinion is that we should control guns. There are shootings because bad people are allowed to have guns. People get hurt or die. In schools, we have drills to prepare in case something happens. Students shouldn't be scared to go to school.
nyla haynes, 9 We need to save the Everglades. For example, in the Pine Rocklands, there is only 2 percent of it left. For this reason, we need to spread the word to people. Otherwise all the animals will be endangered. We need to ask the government to take care of the Everglades.
samuel matos, 10 I think kids don't need phones, because they will become addicted. Also, they will start to have poor spelling, and they will use short words. Kids might disagree, but it will be more healthy for them. My friends are on their phones instead of playing with me, and that is annoying.
Tess Pelletier, 10 I think that kids should do their gym in school for two hours, and then they get out of school and do a sport that they love, like soccer, gymnastics and tennis. They should follow their passion.
Ava Saury, 10
I think we should pass laws to stop animal abuse. It's just cruel. You wouldn't like it if you were hit as hard as some animals are hit. If people abuse animals, their punishment should be to donate to animal organizations.
francesca allegro, 10
I think we should make a law that grocery stores should stop using plastic bags. We can use bags made of fabric, so they won't harm sea animals. Or Publix has paper bags. Next time you get a plastic bag from a grocery store, think about the animals you could be harming. ◊
hanna sultz, 10 Kids should be allowed to drive. Both of my parents work at my school, and when I'm ready, my parents are usually still in the shower. There would be modifications to allow kids to reach the pedals and the steering wheel. I can also go get Starbucks without having to wait for my parents.
gianna stubbe, 10 I think people should stop building in the wild. Animals are losing their habitats because people are constructing roads and houses. If animals can't be in their habitat, they can't live. We should stop building in the wild. This should be a law.
leonardo figueredo, 9 I do not like duplicate names. I feel that there should be a machine that tells you if a name is taken. To be honest, I've met like 10 other Leos and Leonardos in my lifetime. It makes me feel like a clone.
shayna steiger, 9 I think that kids should have their own national president and government, because adults get to vote and have the chance to do a lot more stuff than kids. Kids should be over 10 to be president or work in the government, but to get a job you would have to be over 7. We need kids to have their own rights.
sindy perez, 10 If people want to use plastic, they should get approval from the government. Animals are dying because of all the plastic things. In the ocean, all the marine animals, like sea turtles, are eating plastic bottles, bags and pieces of plastic. It can hurt everyone.
franco diller, 9 People should stop keeping animals in zoos. Imagine you're doing what you like with your family, and you are taken from your life and your family and put into a cage, and you're watched for entertainment. You wouldn't like it! The government should pass a law saying that zoos should have to let animals roam free. FOR EACH ISSUE of The New York Times for Kids, we visit a different fourth-gradepublic-school class somewhere in the United States. So far we have visited schools in San Francisco; Annandale, Va.; Chicago; Oklahoma City; New Orleans; and Bridgeport, Conn., among others. For this issue, I visited a class in Miami and talked with students about the difference between a reported article and an opinion. Then I asked them to come up with a subject that they felt passionately about and to write an opinion of their own. They wrote about all kinds of subjects, including gun control, cafeteria privileges, plastic bags and more. Here are short excerpts. Amber Williams

Texto completo: The routine was the same as it has been every three months or so for the past seven years. Analysts, investors and a smattering of media types dialed in Thursday to listen to Best Buy's top executives shed light on its quarterly earnings.
This was Best Buy Chief Executive Hubert Joly's final earnings call, and he carved out a notable chunk of time to talk about turning the company over to veteran Corie Barry, the current chief financial officer, on June 11.
Though scripted, Joly and Barry took the moment both to assure analysts of their "seamless transition" and to state their mutual respect.
He commended the new leadership team, which includes promoting Chief Operating Officer Mike Mohan as incoming president, not just for its talent but, in true Joly form, for its "culture, heart and soul."
Joly, the intense, French-born executive, became known for his high-fives, exuberance and employment of words not often discussed at the Harvard Business School, such as using "human magic" to fuel the company.
"The company is in good hands," he said.
Barry, 44, becomes the fifth chief in Best Buy's 53-year history and one of just seven female CEOs of Fortune 100 companies.
She commended the board for its "stunningly good decision" to hire "a Frenchman with no retail experience to save this company."
Said Barry: "He brought his remarkable brain, boundless energy and deep passion to the job."
It's not a denouement for Joly, exactly. He remains an employee of the company, and will continue to lead the board of directors, serve as Barry's strategic adviser and do government-affairs work on behalf of the retailer.
Best Buy still faces challenges from Amazon, a trade war with China and the inherent volatility of being in the business of selling technology to consumers. But Joly leaves the post having resolved its most pressing issues: restoring Best Buy to profitability and returning respectability to the brand.
At a town hall meeting with employees on Thursday, Joly noted that he had started packing up his office. He will likely be within shouting distance of Barry's office.
"My main goal is to do everything I can to support Corie and the team," he told reporters Thursday. "I don't believe for a nanosecond that Corie needs training wheels. But I think it's good from the continuity standpoint [and I] think it's important for the investment community that I be available to her."
Best Buy is undergoing a search process to replace Barry as top financial officer.
"I'm clearly passing the baton -- which is a French word -- to Corie and her team with a very happy and a full heart and with the strong conviction that the right team is in place for this pivotal moment in Best Buy's history," Joly said. "I very much look forward to watching Corie and her team do their magic."
Quick sellout on Vineyard Vines' Target collection
Target's latest embrace of an upscale fashion brand turned into another frenzy.
The retailer and Vineyard Vines, the maker of preppy fashion that got its start on Martha's Vineyard, last weekend debuted a collection of about 300 apparel and home goods.
As usual with a fashion partner, Target produces and sells the product at lower prices than through department stores and other outlets. The results were also typical: a stampede of customers in stores and online leading to a rapid sellout.
"Altogether, the Vineyard Vines launch is already one of the most successful in our history," Target's Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton said Wednesday as the firm announced its fiscal first-quarter results.
The Vineyard Vines collection was geared toward summer and most of the items were priced less than $35, which is less than the $45 that a Vineyard Vines T-shirt costs in department stores. The quick sellout led to complaints on social media that Target had underestimated demand and forced consumers to go to extremes to get the merchandise.
A Target spokeswoman said the retailer had geared up with extra inventory, compared to other limited releases, based on early chatter on social media. The company has had more than 175 such designer partnerships since it first launched the concept in 1999, with recent collaborations including Lilly Pulitzer, Hunter, Marimekko and Victoria Beckham.
Target and Vineyard Vines marketed the partnership heavily, especially on the East Coast. The firms built a pop-up store in Brookfield Place, a mall in lower Manhattan, and paid for an eight-page wraparound advertisement in the Sunday edition of the New York Times. Target also dispatched a traveling truck that dispensed whale stickers and helped generate buzz.
Because of their limited size, Target's fashion partnerships tend to generate bigger marketing buzz than additional pop to the bottom line. Target CEO Brian Cornell said Wednesday that the financial effect of the Vineyard Vines partnership "will show up in our second-quarter scorecard."
For those who missed out, Target officials said some Vineyard Vines items are still available on target.com. Others might trickle back to stores through merchandise returns.
Then there are the bevy of resale sites where online sellers seek premium markups, in many cases asking for double Target's price. At least for now.

Texto completo: President is putting us into time of chaos Mr. Trump is calling on Americans to use the power of prayer to end violence. I find this quite humorous since as the top official of the United States, he does more to incite violence than anyone else.
The hatred and violence that is erupting in our country, and the inequality in our justice system is appalling. Mr. Trump says he has done more than any other president. Hmmm, he has managed to introduce white nationalism into the White House and is quite vocal about it; has managed to bring our country down in the eyes of our patriotic citizens and our allies; is managing to bring our country back in time rather than going forward and is ignoring all scientific research on climate change because he knows more than any of the scientists.
He has absolutely no interest in saving our planet for future generations. He wants to bypass congress and go to war with Iran. Now he has the audacity to say he wants to bring those that "spied" on his campaign up for treason and sent to jail. This coming from someone who values Putin’s input over his own advisers.
I cannot think of anyone else that has committed so many acts of obstruction of justice and is getting away with it. We want Congress to act, but then how can they when McConnell, Trump and Barr cut them down every time they can, including telling folks to just ignore the subpoenas they receive?
How is this even possible!
I now realize we are under a dictator who wants nothing more than chaos. If we don’t stop this at the polls, prayer will not help. We are living in very frightening times. Every time I see him raise his right hand in a fist all I can think of is Hitler. Scary folks, very scary.
Sandra Alter Hoffman Estates Barr’s curious comments about judges It was interesting to read William Barr’s comments regarding federal judges and some of their rulings in cases where Trump’s commands were blocked. He took umbrage at the fact that a single judge could block the president’s policies.
I guess it never occurred to Mr. Barr that the president could have proposed policies that addressed the concerns of all Americans. And it didn’t seem to occur to Mr. Barr that he took it upon himself to shape public opinion regarding the Mueller investigation without even a second thought as to what it would do to the public’s confidence in the judiciary system.
Mr. Barr should just accept the fact that once all the arguments were made in the cases, the "baby" then belonged to the judges. It was heartening, though, to see that Mr. Barr is very intelligent when he figured out that the 37 blocked attempts since Trump took office were more than one a month.
Tom Frampton Streamwood Commentaries seek to set up Democrats Taking credit when things go well and blaming someone else when things go poorly isn’t new to Donald Trump. It has long been a part of the conservative playbook, long enough to be honed into an art.
Recently the Daily Herald had a conservative columnist, Byron York, who wrote, "Amid good news can Democrats talk down the economy" and on May 14, the paper published a cartoon that shows the Democratic national headquarters talking about hiring the 3.6% unemployed to trash talk the economy.
Putting aside the stupidity of the concept of creating full employment to trash an economy, it is obvious that they are both setting the stage to blame Democrats when the economy turns down.
In Mr. York’s column he quotes an economic reporter, a columnist, an economic adviser, a financial reporter, and two Republican strategists. Nothing from a Democratic politician or official.
Grabbing Mr. York’s lead, the cartoonist feels free to suggest Democratic officials without naming names or indicating a basis for the observation.
There is no doubt that given time, the economy will hit a slump. How fast and how hard will depend on many factors, including fiscal and social policies and legislation. But to suggest that the Democrats are trashing the economy when the Republicans control so much of our government is weak intellectually and lazy artistically.
Mike Vandeleur Bolingbrook Dog-and-pony show The Daily Herald’s May 9 headline "Trump formally blocks report" is quite misleading. According to the New York Times, what was blocked (redacted) from Mueller’s report is: 69% dealing with ongoing investigations, 18% grand jury testimony that cannot legally be released, 8% classified material and 5% that would infringe on personal privacy rights.
The Justice Department offered 12 congressional leaders — party leaders and the heads of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees — and a staff member each the ability to view a version of the Mueller report that only contained redactions of grand jury material, which the Justice Department has argued it is prohibited by law from sharing without a court order.
While no Democrat has taken the opportunity, six Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham have taken up the offer, along with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Doug Collins, Need more proof that Nadler is running a dog-and-pony show?
Joan Baillie Volo Testing teachers I am a retired teacher. I had contact with teachers who should not have been in a classroom. Now the state is looking to eliminate the Basic Skills test for certification. A fourth grader could pass that test. If a person cannot pass a basic skills test, do you want that person teaching your child?
Doris Aussin Lake in the Hills Vigilance needed to control spending With one week left in Springfield’s regular legislative session, the wheels are spinning. Madigan’s supermajority wants new gas, gambling and pot taxes; will increase property taxes through unfunded local school mandates; and will escalate fees. Notwithstanding the May 31 budget deadline, no proposed budget bill exists, because proposed new spending requires billions of new taxes.
The proposed "graduated" income tax amendment to eliminate the Illinois Constitution’s equal tax treatment has an army of tax lobbyists salivating over opportunities to grease connected insiders’ wheels.
Utterly missing from the debate are bipartisan proposals to amend the Illinois Constitution to reform and restructure what drives the structural deficits: the Illinois pension system.
There is some hope — federal reforms improved our state tax base, generating $1.5 billion dollars in extra revenue for this fiscal year. The governor was rightly pressured by stakeholders on both sides of the aisle to abandon his plan to short the teacher, police and firefighter pensions this year. That doesn’t mean he won’t try again next year.
Illinois’ Department of Revenue estimates $800 million more will arrive in the next fiscal year.
I urged fellow legislators to try something new under the dome: control spending, not raise taxes; and encourage natural economic growth to help balance our budget.
We know the way; we just need the will. We must be vigilant to advocate and insist that the state use all newfound revenues to dig Illinois out of its fiscal hole. Please call our office to learn how you can help.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration formally proposed on Friday to roll back Obama-era civil rights safeguards that had banned discrimination against transgender medical patients and health insurance customers.
The Department of Health and Human Services's proposed regulation would replace a 2016 rule from the Obama administration that defined discrimination "on the basis of sex" to include gender identity. The Trump administration rule would no longer recognize gender identity as an avenue for sex discrimination.
Without the Obama-era language, health care workers would be free to object to performing procedures like gender reassignment surgery, and insurers would not be bound to cover all services for transgender customers. The new rule would fit into a broader agenda pushed by religious activists and is consistent with administration actions to limit civil rights protections for gay and transgender Americans in a variety of domains, including education, employment and housing.
The Obama administration adopted the health care discrimination rule to carry out a civil rights provision of the Affordable Care Act. It prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in "any health program or activity" that receives federal financial assistance.
The Obama administration included "gender identity" as an aspect of sex, and specified that the term means a person's "internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female, and which may be different from an individual's sex assigned at birth." The Obama-era definition of discrimination also protected women who had terminated a pregnancy.
Under the provision, health care services for transgender patients and patients with a history of abortion had to be offered by hospitals and covered by patients' health plans.
But a group of states and religious medical providers sued, and in December 2016, a federal judge in Fort Worth blocked that section of the rule on a temporary basis, writing that "Congress did not understand 'sex' to include 'gender identity."' The judge, Reed O'Connor, has yet to issue a final ruling, and a nationwide preliminary injunction remains in place. Cases challenging the rule on similar grounds are pending in North Dakota.
President Trump's Justice Department told Judge O'Connor in court filings this year that it agreed with him.
"What we're doing today conforms with the court injunction as well as the position of the Department of Justice, but most importantly conforms with the text of the law itself," Roger Severino, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday in a call with reporters. "That's all we are doing here, is making sure we're being fully consistent with the law the people's representatives passed and being faithful to it."
But three other courts have found that the provision in the health law does protect transgender patients against discrimination by health care providers.
Transgender rights groups contended that the preliminary injunction in Texas could have been contested once a final ruling was made, and possibly overturned. But the new rule is in keeping with a broader agenda, they said.
"The Trump-Pence administration's latest attack threatens to undermine crucial nondiscrimination protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people provided for under the Affordable Care Act," David Stacy, the government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. "The administration puts L.G.B.T.Q. people at greater risk of being denied necessary and appropriate health care solely based on their sexual orientation or gender identity."
Last year, Mr. Severino pushed for a legal definition of sex under Title IX, the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination in education programs that receive government financial assistance.
"Sex means a person's status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth," the health department proposed in the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times. "The sex listed on a person's birth certificate, as originally issued, shall constitute definitive proof of a person's sex unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence."
But Mr. Severino said Friday that the agency would not seek to define sex.
Another case on the meaning of sex discrimination is before the Supreme Court this term. The court will consider whether similar language in Title VII bars discrimination against gay and transgender people in the workplace. The administration argues that it does not.
And a proposal this week from the Department of Housing and Urban Development would allow homeless shelters to require transgender clients to use bathrooms or sleeping accommodations that match their biological sex.
The health department's proposed rule came two weeks after Mr. Severino announced a separate, expanded "conscience rule" to protect health care workers who oppose abortion, sterilization, assisted suicide and other medical procedures on religious or moral grounds. That rule established guidelines for punishing health care institutions with a loss of federal funds if they fail to respect the rights of such workers.
On Friday, Mr. Severino emphasized that the proposed revision of the civil rights rule, too, would protect health care providers and insurers from performing or paying for abortions.
Asked how the proposed rule would assure continued access to health care for transgender people, Mr. Severino said it did not mean providers would be "in any way restricted in how they provide their health care."
"We have a lot of diversity in health care -- a lot of options for people," he said. "Nothing in the rule prevents any entity from providing a whole range of services to any individual according to their medical judgment, and that includes services related to gender identity."
But advocates for transgender people warned that the rule would allow and even encourage providers who are biased against transgender people to deny them treatment. Taken with the recent rule protecting religious health care workers, they said, the administration's policies shift the civil rights landscape away from patients who may be subject to discrimination and toward clinicians who have objections to treating them, or insurers who do not want to pay for their care.
"What this does from a very practical point of view is that it empowers bad actors to be bad actors," said Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.
She added that already, transgender people "are turned away from E.R.s, dismissed by insurers and mocked by untrained hospital staff, all while trying to seek the care every American deserves."
Beyond affecting transgender people, the new rule could also open the door to discrimination in health care on the basis of sex stereotypes, said Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, a senior lawyer and health care strategist at Lambda Legal, a gay rights group. "That may mean whether somebody conforms to expectations about their sex as perceived by others with regard to behavior, clothing, with whom they associate romantically or how they present their identity," he added. "That applies writ large to people who are L.G.B.T.Q., but also to straight people who are gender nonconforming in their presentation."
Jocelyn Samuels, who ran the Office for Civil Rights under President Barack Obama, said the revised rule would "undermine Congress's intent to expand access to health care and health coverage," adding that it would "inflict extraordinary damage on vulnerable Americans."
Under the federal rule-making process, the public will have 60 days to submit comments, concerns or suggestions on the proposed revision before it becomes final.

Texto completo: The need for secrecy was so great that CIA Director John Brennan hand-delivered information from a critical informant close to Russian President Vladimir Putin in an envelope to President Barack Obama in August 2016.
Now, one day after President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr "full and complete authority to declassify information" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the New York Times reports this source is in jeopardy.
The declassification order, celebrated by GOP allies and derided by Democrats as a "plot to dirty up the intelligence community," could put the Justice Department at odds with the CIA over the protection of the identity of this key informant who provided information about the Kremlin's role in interfering in the 2016 election.
Specifically, this informant was the U.S. intelligence community's source in determining that Putin personally "ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election" to undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in favor of Trump. Former President Obama made this public before he left office.
The informant is described as being a long-nurtured source who rose up the Russian ranks. Believed to still be alive, the well-being of the informant is one concern as Barr digs into earliest days of the Russia investigation. Former national security officials and Democratic lawmakers are also worried that Trump may be putting other sources and methods at risk as part of a politically motivated effort to "investigate the investigators."
Overseen by Brennan, the information delivered by this high-placed informant was treated with the utmost care, but done so outside of the norm.
Word of this high-placed informant first came out in June 2017 in a Washington Post story that said Brennan began feeding this material to Obama and a small group of aides with a report in an envelope to be read and promptly returned to the CIA. The material was deemed so sensitive that it was kept out of the President’s Daily Brief due to concerns that too many people would be made aware of its contents.
Although the Post report said a courier was used to deliver this information, the Times piece said Brennan himself gave it to Obama.
As a former official would tell it, Obama "was deeply concerned and wanted as much information as fast as possible" and "wanted the entire intelligence community all over this." A covert task force was put together by Brennan that coordinated with operations specialists at the CIA, National Security Agency, and FBI on Russia intelligence gathering and kept Obama apprised of their work.
Brennan, an outspoken critic of Trump's who lost his security clearance last year, has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks for actions he took in the around the genesis of the counter-intelligence investigation into Trump's campaign.
With Barr sending a shock-wave through Washington by asserting "spying did occur" against the Trump campaign and enlisting U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead an investigation into the Russia inquiry's earliest days, Brennan went on the defensive. "Does the CIA spy? Yes," he told MSNBC. "Do we spy against our foreign adversaries? Yes. Do we spy against domestic individuals? No we do not. We work very closely with the FBI. And when the Russians were trying to interfere in that election and to change the outcome of it in their favor, the CIA and the FBI worked very collaboratively to see what the Russians were doing and who they were working with."
Republicans believe the impending declassification of Russia investigation documents will show an email exchange between Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey discussing the use of British ex-spy Christopher Steele's unverified dossier in the U.S. intelligence community's assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, who claims to have seen the classified material, said this puts Brennan in jeopardy more than it does Comey.
Although the Times report's sourcing is anonymous, Rep. Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally and lead GOP investigator, said the timing of its publication on Friday is very revealing and a potential effort to burn a CIA informant as a means of protection. "The Brennan/Clapper/Comey and Co.'s house of cards is falling. And they know it," the North Carolina Republican tweeted, referring also to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.
Barr has been reviewing the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign for weeks now. Not only has he tasked Durham with reviewing the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, but he has also enlisted the help of CIA Director Gina Haspel, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, and FBI Director Christopher Wray.
Although Trump said his order empowering Barr could lead to the declassification of "millions of pages of documents," Coats tamped down expectations about the scope of what can be made available to the public.
"Much like we have with other investigations and reviews, the Intelligence Community will provide the Department of Justice all of the appropriate information for its review of intelligence activities related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election," Coats said in a statement Friday. "As part of that process, I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the IC in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk."
If the identity of the CIA's informant is revealed as part of Barr's newly obtained declassification authority, it would follow last year's leak that the FBI had an informant in Stefan Halper, an American professor at Cambridge University who met with associates of Trump's campaign.
This happened after top House Intelligence Republican Devin Nunes subpoenaed the Justice Department for documents concerning an American who was a confidential intelligence source for special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The DOJ fought back, warning that providing the information would threaten the life of the source and jeopardize national security.
Halper is a focus of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's FISA abuse investigation. In April it was revealed a woman who said her name was Azra Turk and posed as an assistant to Halper when meeting with Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was working undercover for the FBI.

Living in California is a 'moral choice'

Texto completo: The apparent ease of California life, Joan Didion wrote in "The White Album," is an illusion, and those who believe the illusion real live here in only the most temporary way. Didion was speaking at the time about the water crises of the late 1970s, specifically, but the truth is that the people of California have always been of pretty hearty stock. You live in a place where the very ground you stand on is, at best, temporary and you recognize that choosing to live here means choosing to live in flux, always a bag at the ready, in case you need to flee. We don't expect empathy from the lattice-work of fault lines, reason from the wild fires, decency from the sun. But we do from the people of the state and, increasingly, that means that living in California is a moral choice.
You have to want California. Now, you may need it, too. Because we'll be the place that defends your liberty, even if you don't live here. We'll be the state that sues for your rights. We'll be the state that fights for your clean air. It may be too expensive to live here; it may be too ethically taxing to live anywhere else. When Alabama outlawed abortion in the most craven and punishing fashion last week, it was no surprise in a functional sense. Red states have been cutting into women's rights at a shocking pace since 2016, abetted as they are by a White House whose brand is cruelty. Alabama's Constitutional overreach was meant to illicit lawsuits, meant to force Supreme Court action, meant to dehumanize and scare women, to let them know that the government can and will demand control of their bodies. Before that, it was Georgia. After that, it will be Missouri. And then ... and then ... and then, the center indeed not holding, nor the south.
The obvious goal is to overturn Roe vs. Wade, but the long view is even more insidious, which is the systematic removal of human rights (not merely civil) for the most vulnerable segments of our society. We've already seen it with immigrants. We've seen it with the LGBTQ community. We've seen it in the shocking rise of white supremacy in national governance. We've seen it in the flouting of the rules of law from the highest office.
The "free-love" ethos of California may have been well-earned in the 1960s, but five decades on, the result is a state that values personal autonomy but also views our representatives as having the capacity to make life better, to embrace modernity, to fight for equality, not backslide into our worst Puritanical instincts. Thus, the stereotype of going west to find your dreams exists not because life here is easy, but rather because life here isn't about tolerance as much as it is about acceptance. The distance between the two is more than semantic, it is the very fabric of empathy.
I'm not so naïve as to believe everyone in the state shares my values. Nor even everyone in my neighborhood, particularly when my neighbors have a strange tendency to warn me about suspicious people of color doing things like walking down the street, or sitting by the pool, or driving their own cars. But as the country tilts and shivers with the whims of conservative lawmakers, every day a new intentional horror placed upon human beings in the name of greed and public policy, I can't help but think of California as a firewall of basic decency, the last retardant before the flames reach the sea.

Weinstein Said To Reach Deal With Accusers

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein and his former studio's board members have reached a tentative $ 44 million deal to resolve lawsuits filed by women who accused him of sexual misconduct and by the New York State attorney general, according to three people briefed on the matter.
The outcome of the settlement talks will be especially notable because the lawsuits are one of the main avenues by which Mr. Weinstein could be held responsible for his alleged actions.
He is facing criminal charges in New York for allegations of sexual violence against two women. But more than 80 women have accused him of wrongdoing, and many of those complaints involve sexual harassment, which is a civil violation, not a criminal one. So the details of any settlement -- such as whether it includes an admission of wrongdoing by Mr. Weinstein -- would carry significant symbolism.
The proposed sum is less than half of what was initially discussed as a victims' fund as part of conversations last year between an investor group that was interested in buying assets of the Weinstein Company and Eric T. Schneiderman, who was then New York's attorney general. That proposed deal, which fell apart at the last minute, included a victims' fund worth up to $ 90 million.
Under the proposed terms of the new deal, about $ 30 million would go to a pool of plaintiffs that includes alleged victims, creditors of Mr. Weinstein's former studio and some former employees, according to the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the agreement was private. The balance would go to legal fees for associates of Mr. Weinstein, including board members named as defendants in lawsuits.
Insurance policies would cover the $ 44 million if the current agreement is finalized.
Mr. Weinstein did not return calls for comment. A spokeswoman for the office of the New York State attorney general declined to comment. A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the tentative deal.
Mr. Weinstein was long one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, known for backing boundary breaking films like "Pulp Fiction" and Oscar winners like "Shakespeare in Love." But in October 2017, investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed allegations that he had sexually harassed or abused numerous current or former employees and other women over several decades.
The Weinstein Company, the Hollywood studio founded by Mr. Weinstein and his brother and business partner, Bob Weinstein, filed for bankruptcy in March 2018. The movie and television studio, once known for Oscar-winning films like "The King's Speech" and "The Artist," had less than $ 500,000 in cash at the time and was facing a mountain of debt and a swelling number of lawsuits, including the one by New York's attorney general.
Lawyers for women who say they were victims of Mr. Weinstein have been in mediation since last year with representatives for the former studio mogul. Also involved in the talks were lawyers for the former board members and the New York attorney general's office, which last year sued Mr. Weinstein and his brother for violating state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual abuse and coercion. The goal was to reach a settlement that would cover all of the suits pending against the former Hollywood mogul, his now-defunct movie studio and associates.
The Weinstein Company is seeking to liquidate. In a recent bankruptcy filing, lawyers for the studio said the efforts to resolve legal claims by some of the women had stalled in recent months, and put additional strain on its dwindling resources.
A separate bankruptcy filing on May 15 described the mediation process as "highly adversarial" and said that at least 11 separate sessions had been held over a year.
Harvey Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges in New York.
He was initially indicted in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on sex-crime charges involving three women, including one who said that Mr. Weinstein raped her inside a hotel room at a DoubleTree in Midtown Manhattan in March 2013. The woman has not been identified in court papers.
He was also charged with forcing two other women to engage in oral sex with him. Lucia Evans, a marketing executive, said she was assaulted in his TriBeCa office in 2004, and Mimi Haleyi, a production assistant, said Mr. Weinstein assaulted her at his apartment in 2006.
The judge, James Burke, dismissed the charge related to Ms. Evans after the Manhattan district attorney's office acknowledged that the lead detective on the case, Nicholas DiGaudio, did not disclose information from a witness who said Ms. Evans had provided a conflicting account of the alleged assault. But Detective DiGaudio, who has since been reassigned, has maintained that he did inform prosecutors.
Mr. Weinstein has denied the allegations and has said the relationships were consensual.
Earlier this year, Mr. Weinstein also replaced his longtime defense lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, with a new "dream team" of lawyers who have a history of representing celebrity clients. His criminal trial is expected to begin Sept. 9.
Soon after Mr. Weinstein built his new defense team, one of his star lawyers, Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., a law professor and a faculty dean of an undergraduate house at Harvard University, came under fire by students there for representing the Hollywood producer. This month, Harvard decided to end Mr. Sullivan's term as dean on June 30, following months of pressure from students. Later, Mr. Sullivan withdrew from Mr. Weinstein's defense team.

Texto completo: Just imagine that last night, the New York Yankees won baseball’s World Series with a grand slam in the ninth inning of Game 7. Wow! The town explodes. But this morning, The New York Times reports only that “at a ballgame last night, 350 fans complained that the hot dog stands ran out of mustard.” Furthermore, it is reported that “multiple mustard shortage suits were to be filed, along with requests for investigations by Major League Baseball and multiple governmental bodies.”
The excitement of the Yankees’ World Series victory becomes overshadowed by the “mustard crisis.”
Impossible? Not at all.
What makes this possible is the ability of the media to bury what is important while creating a narrative that supports a particular cause or point of view.
The Mueller report is a perfect example. The special counsel was tasked to look into “Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.” The big and most prominent issue was the possibility that President Donald Trump conspired with the Russians to influence the election. For two years, the national press and the Democrats were fixated upon Trump’s “obvious” guilt — just salivating with the joy that the proof was coming in the special counsel’s report.
Whoops! The Mueller report has spoken: The "investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."
No worry! About 330 individuals —235 in the U.S. House of Representatives, 47 in the U.S. Senate and 50 or so leaders of national media outlets — stood ready to change the narrative and focus on the equivalent of a mustard crisis and not Trump’s innocence.
The outcry was overwhelming. The world, they said, needs an unredacted report, interviews with hundreds of possible conspirators, impeachment hearings, all of Trump’s tax returns, etc., etc.
In 24 hours, the narrative that failed to crush Trump was replaced by nonsense. The big loser: the American people. What a sad state for our country.
My thoughts return to former President Ronald Reagan. He described today’s situation perfectly. This new narrative promises a pony underneath all the “mess,” if only you dig and scream enough.
The bottom line: Proof of the existence of a crime is no longer needed, it seems. Just keep looking and looking, and you will surely find something. The rule of law is totally ignored.
Our fundamental, constitutionally provided protections are being eroded and trampled. Every citizen — Republican, Democrat or independent — should be concerned.
The major downside of this ridiculous political environment is the crippling of our federal government. The very individuals perpetrating these witch hunts and wild goose chases are the very individuals who should be concentrating on issues and problems that really matter to U.S. citizens.
Immigration, infrastructure, opioid addiction and armed conflicts around the world represent just a few of the things that matter and need attention at the highest levels of our federal government.
There is great cost to the unnecessary diversion of our taxed and borrowed dollars. Thousands of hours of the time of highly paid executives and elected officials are commandeered. Congress becomes focused not on the needs of our people, but on a hopeful search for incriminating evidence.
This has become a gigantic public rip-off of our nation’s wealth and ability to focus on reality.
Lost in this whole charade, too, is the emotional drain on our elected officials, the legislative process and our nation at large. Honest discussions about real problems become twisted, and hardened positions make compromise virtually impossible. Civility becomes a word without meaning.
Yes, I believe it is time to move on. Let the presidential election of 2020 speak for itself. Let us hear the ideas of the multiple Democratic candidates and learn about possible competition for Trump from within the Republican Party. This is the real way that Americans can influence the direction of our country.

Noting Injustice Isn't Abandoning Zionism

Texto completo: IF YOU KNEW nothing about the conflict occurring here, you would describe this breathtaking hilltop as idyllic.
But it is not. We walk to the village's olive fields, recently vandalized by Jewish residents of a nearby Israeli settlement. On the side of some large rocks, I spot bright red graffiti that spells out, in Hebrew, Chag Ha'Ilanot, or "The festival of trees." Chag Ha'Ilanot is another name for the festival of Tu B'Shevat, the day on the Jewish calendar in which we honor our connection to trees and their produce. The fact that to other members of my Jewish family, this inscription could celebrate the uprooting of trees, horrifies me.
I have been living and studying in Israel this past year as part of my rabbinical school training through Hebrew College, and I have spent countless hours in the study hall poring over ancient Jewish wisdom and exploring the rich and diverse Jewish tradition.
I know the power of words - both the force they have to bring communities together for common good, and their power, when used maliciously, to hurt and destroy.
I have also been learning outside the study hall, in visits all over Israel and in the occupied West Bank with T'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights' Israel Fellowship. This fellowship focuses on civil and human rights within Israel and the occupied territories, and this visit to Al-Tuwani is just one of numerous encounters with a diversity of Israelis and Palestinians.
The villagers of Al-Tuwani tell us they were devastated when they learned of the vandalism to their trees. One of the community elders explains to us that olive trees are a major source of livelihood for the village and their damage puts a number of families at financial risk. Secondly, he explained "An olive tree, in our tradition, is a symbol of rootedness, of belonging. When these trees are uprooted, we know that we are being told we have no place here."
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is unfortunately not uncommon. And it is increasing dramatically. As The New York Times reported earlier this year, ideologically motivated crimes committed by Israeli settlers grew by 50 percent in 2018. Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organization, reports that only 8 percent of the cases reported ever result in an indictment, and most cases simply go unreported because local police stations are located exclusively in Jewish neighborhoods, making them difficult for Palestinians to access.
These statistics are staggering, and they illustrate the unsustainable nature of Israel's occupation of the West Bank, for both its Jewish and Palestinian residents. The Israeli occupation as it operates today means that Palestinians are unprotected and left exposed to further violence in their communities. Under these conditions, no one, no Jew or Palestinian, is truly able to live in peace.
When I reflect on the vandalism I saw, my heart breaks, because I have loved Israel since my first visit in high school, when I learned about Israel's ancient history and saw religion alive in a new way.
I remember sitting outside at a kibbutz one night, looking at the stars, and thinking about the miracle that my people have this state. When I started learning more about the complexity of Israel, I began to question this commitment to Zionism. If Zionism looked out for Jewish people only, I was not sure that I could be a part of it. I love this place, but I also know that an Israel that does not see the humanity of all of its residents will simply not be able to stand. Before applying to rabbinical school, I knew that in some way I wanted to devote myself to fighting for justice in the world.
After this year, I see even more clearly that my responsibility to Israel's wholeness will involve standing with and loving our Jewish state, while not being afraid to speak out against injustice against Israelis or Palestinians. Calling out injustice should not be seen as an abandonment of Zionism, but rather the fostering of a deeper commitment. I know that a Jewish state is a state that provides security to all, that takes seriously the Jewish proposition that all people (yes, even Palestinians) are created in the image of God.
I am returning to the United States soon, but my experiences with T'ruah, my chance to speak honestly with Israelis and Palestinians has reinvigorated my belief that peace is possible. I know now that the work of peacebuilding happens not only at the negotiating table but also in the olive grove. *

Gillibrand sets sights on health care for rural women

Texto completo: To promote her new policy plan to support children and family, Democratic candidate Kirsten Gillibrand will stop in Iowa for a West Des Moines roundtable with Iowa women and lawmakers and visit Iowa Falls, which has struggled with child care options and had its hospital recently stopped delivering babies.
The New York senator's policy plan focuses on children and aims to tear down obstacles that American families, particularly low-income residents, face when caring for their younger children.
"My new proposal, the Family Bill of Rights, will make all families stronger — regardless of who you are or what your zip code is — with a fundamental set of rights that levels the playing field starting at birth," Gillibrand said in a statement.
The Democratic presidential candidate's plan addresses the challenges rural Iowans face when seeking health care, particularly the lack of gynecologists and medical professionals that can care for women in labor.
She proposes developing training for rural medical facilities and providing more grants for health providers in less-populated areas.
Gillibrand will visit an Iowa Falls coffee shop Saturday to discuss those ideas.
In Iowa Falls, a town of around 5,000 residents, Hansen Family Hospital stopped delivering babies in 2018 because of a shortage of funds and available medical professionals. The nearest hospital that offers delivery services, according to the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, is in Mason City — about 40 miles away,
From 1973 to 2018, half of the Iowa hospitals that had provided maternity services stopped doing so, leaving only 70 available medical facilities for expecting moms, according to The Gazette.
Family-focused policy isn't new to Gillibrand or her campaign. She has tried for years to pass a paid family leave law through Congress that would allow workers to maintain cash flow while taking time off to care for themselves or their families. She introduced it again this year, according to the New York Times.
During a January visit to Iowa, Gillibrand advocated for universal pre-K and family pay leave during the Women's March in Des Moines.
More recently, she's been outspoken about the abortion laws passed in Georgia and Alabama. She also condemned Iowa Republicans' efforts to stop funding for Planned Parenthood.
Kirsten Gillibrand's public Iowa stops: Friday, May 24 West Des Moines: 10 a.m. (doors open at 9:30 a.m.), "Family Bill of Rights" Roundtable at the Community Room, West Des Moines Public Library, 4000 Mills Civic Pkwy.

Gillibrand wrote her thesis on Chinese oppression in Tibet but has been silent about it in Congress

Texto completo: U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad is scheduled to make a rare visit to Tibet this week to raise concerns about Chinese restrictions on Buddhist practices and to advocate for the preservation of Tibetan culture. If he wanted, he could seek knowledge and advice from a surprising source: Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who wrote her college thesis on Tibet, but has been strangely quiet about the issue while in Congress.
Gillibrand is proficient in Mandarin and interviewed the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, as part of her 1988 senior thesis at Dartmouth College on the history of Tibetan resistance to Chinese occupation. The New York senator was an Asian Studies major at Dartmouth and studied abroad in China and Taiwan.
A young Gillibrand thought that compromise rather than full independence could be the answer to the friction, an idea suggested by the Dalai Lama.
“[A] substantial change in China’s policies toward religious and cultural freedom could provide for an acceptable arrangement between the Tibetans and the Chinese,” Gillibrand wrote in her thesis, obtained by the Washington Examiner.
Tweet
But despite her knowledge and experience, Gillibrand has not been vocal about the relationship between China and Tibet since she joined Congress in 2007.
Unlike some of her Democratic colleagues, including 2020 primary rivals Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Gillibrand did not sponsor a number of bills or resolutions relating to human rights or culture in Tibet, such as a measure that became law last year to deny visas to Chinese officials who keep Americans from accessing Tibet and a resolution expressing support for the people of Tibet. Her staff did meet with representatives from Students for a Free Tibet lobbying for a bill last year.
Gillibrand is, however, a co-sponsor of a bill to "condemn gross human rights violations of ethnic Turkic Muslims," or Uighurs, in China. China denies that it is trying to eliminate the presence of Uighurs.
Gillibrand’s Senate office and presidential campaign did not respond to requests for comment relating to her actions and thoughts on Tibetan issues.
In one chapter of her thesis, Gillibrand detailed the horrors of China’s “socialist transformation” of Tibet in the '60s and '70s.
“In order to find the ‘hidden enemies of the people’ and lead Tibet on the socialist path towards class struggle, the Chinese imposed thamzing or struggle sessions,” Gillibrand wrote. “Tibetans were brought in front of a tribunal of Chinese officials and were made to bend at the waist in a cowed position. The tribunal official would read off the ‘crimes’ the prisoner had committed in front of large gatherings of fellow Tibetans and Chinese ... A witness to the prisoner’s nd suggest further punishment.”
Suggested punishments included burning alive, hanging, beheading, stoning, or forcing small children to shoot their parents, according to Gillibrand’s thesis.
“Another step to encourage the development of socialism was to discourage Tibetans’ devotion to religion since religion opposed the communist ideology,” Gillibrand wrote. “... In order to create ideologic hegemony and therefore a stable government, there could be no difference between the beliefs, goals, and values of the Tibetans and the Chinese.”
The Chinese imprisoned people for reciting Tibetan mantras, turning prayer wheels, and having photographs of the Dalai Lama, Gillibrand explained. Most of those who went to prison died due to the severe conditions.
Today, Gillibrand brushes off the term “socialism” in relation to policies that she supports, telling New York Magazine in March that “the country is very well aware of the difference between capitalism and greed.” She advocates for Medicare for All with the expectation of essentially eliminating private insurance and has said that there is “nothing socialist” about the Green New Deal.
In 2009, Gillibrand suggested that her knowledge of China and experience traveling in Asia could help her be pragmatic in dealing with human rights in China.
"Our relationship with China is extraordinarily complicated, and when you do understand the culture better, having that appreciation means you can hopefully find compromises," she told the New York Times.

Second judge rules President Trump can't block Congress's subpoenas of his banking records

Texto completo: NEW YORK — A federal judge on Wednesday denied President Donald Trump's effort to block subpoenas from Democratically-controlled House committees that seek records from two financial companies for investigations of him, his family, his businesses and others.
In a decision that dealt Trump a second defeat on similar congressional efforts this week, U. S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos ruled that the subpoenas passed constitutional muster, had a “legitimate legislative purpose,” and were in the public interest. Ramos also ruled that Trump lawyers had made sufficient arguments that allowing the committees to obtain at least a decade of Trump financial dealings transacted through Deutsche Bank and Capital One Financial Corp. could cause “irreparable harm” to the president and his companies. However, the judge said that impact was outweighed by the constitutionally enshrined investigative authority of the federal government’s legislative branch.
Separately, Ramos denied the request by the Committee on Financial Services and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to consolidate his ruling by applying it to the underlying merits of the lawsuit.
Citing a lengthy list of U. S. Supreme Court rulings and other legal precedents, the judge said he felt it was unlikely that Trump would ultimately prevail in the legal fight. “Accordingly, the court will not enjoin the committees’ efforts to enforce the subpoenas,” said Ramos as he concluded a nearly hour-long reading of his decision in a packed lower Manhattan courtroom. Ramos denied Trump lawyer Patrick Strawbridge’s request for an immediate stay of the ruling.
Rep. Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, praised Ramos' decision, calling it a victory for Congress.
“Congress’ authority to conduct relevant oversight has been repeatedly challenged by this Administration," the two Democratic lawmakers said in a statement. "The decision made in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today is a victory for the role of Congress as a co-equal branch of government and for the important work our Committees are doing in protecting and serving the interests of the American public. ”
Strawbridge told the judge “it’s probably a safe bet” that the Trump legal team would immediately ask the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review the ruling and issue a stay that would delay or block any immediate release of the records to the congressional panels.
Trump, his three eldest children, The Trump Organization and other businesses had argued that Deutsche Bank and Capital One Financial should not be required to turn over the information because subpoenas issued by the House panels "have no legitimate or lawful purpose. "
"The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family, and to ferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage," Trump lawyers argued in the Southern District of New York federal court complaint they filed on April 29.
U. S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D. C. , rejected a similar argument on Monday, ruling that Trump cannot block his longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, from providing his financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee. The panel subpoenaed the records to compare them with testimony from Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and with government disclosure forms.
Trump's lawyers filed a notice of appeal of that ruling on Tuesday with the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Ramos and Mehta were nominated for their federal court appointments by President Barack Obama.
During legal arguments in New York on Wednesday, Strawbridge and Douglas Letter, an attorney for the House committees, largely echoed legal arguments in their previous court filings.
The House panels argued in a May 10 court response that the Trump records are needed for "wide-ranging investigations of issues bearing upon the integrity of the U. S. financial system and national security, including bank fraud, money laundering, foreign influence in the U. S. political process, and the counterintelligence risks posed by foreign powers' use of financial leverage. "
However, Letter told Ramos on Wednesday that the committees also have issued similar subpoenas to nine or ten others unrelated to Trump.
The case represents a legal end-run around a Republican president and businessman who, breaking with decades of federal government tradition, has refused to make public his tax returns. As a result, the House committees subpoenaed records from the two major financial institutions frequently used by Trump and his companies.
Trump's legal team, in turn, filed the lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One. The financial companies have not taken any position of their own in the dispute, and have signaled they would comply with any court orders. Attorneys for the companies declined to comment specifically on Wednesday's ruling.
Trump's attorneys argued the congressional committees' subpoenas had failed to identify "any legislative purpose — let alone a potential piece of legislation — that their requests are designed to advance. "
They also contended that the subpoenas violate the federal Right to Financial Privacy Act and would cause Trump and other plaintiffs "irreparable harm" if the confidential records in question are released.
The House panels argued that the Trump plaintiffs haven't established a likelihood of irreparable injury, and contended that the Right to Financial Privacy Act doesn't apply to Congress.
Contending that congressional committees have constitutional rights to investigate, lawyers for the House panels cited a 1975 U. S. Supreme Court ruling that said the scope of Congress's power of inquiry "is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution. "
The Deutsche Bank financial records are of particular interest to both Trump and congressional investigators.
Deutsche Bank loaned more than $2 billion to Trump and his businesses during a long relationship in which the German financial institution financed Trump skyscrapers and other ventures and in return used Trump projects to build its investment banking business, The New York Times reported in March.
Regardless of the outcome, Deutsche Bank has started providing some Trump financial records to the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, CNN reported in late April. James subpoenaed the records after former Trump attorney Michael Cohen claimed that Trump had inflated the value of his assets.

Texto completo: Her great-grandfather, the Rev. Joseph Taylor, was a Presbyterian minister who started a school in nearby McIntosh County in 1867 to educate freed slaves. Her father, David J. Griffin, was the first black physician and surgeon in Brunswick.

"I am from a family of trailblazers ... It's who I am," said Elaine Griffin, who travels the world as an acclaimed interior designer and was ranked as one of House Beautiful magazine's Top 100 American Designers. "But it's not necessarily something I would think about."

Recently she has.

Thursday she will be the first black designer to receive an honorary doctorate from New York School of Interior Design as well as address one of the school's graduating classes.

Griffin, 54, is building on her family's lauded heritage and her own. She's had

other design-world recognition as "the first," but this one is different, she said. This one is at her prestigious alma mater, consistently at the top of interior-design school rankings.

"I'm so honored. It's huge," she said. "Just to be part of it, a hall of fame pantheon of designers, just to be included ... when you think about all the professionals who will not receive this award is humbling."

Griffin said she is also looking forward to giving a few words of wisdom to the "next generation of budding designers," Griffin said.

"You all have been given gifts ... You have a vision most people don't have," she said, quoting some of her planned remarks. "Go out into the world of design ... and share it in the service of others. There is nothing more fulfilling than using your gifts to serve others."

Founded in 1916, the New York School of Interior Design has bestowed the honorary degree honor for 21 years, selecting recipients "from a distinguished pool" of nominees, according to the school. Griffin and fellow 2019 honoree Nate Berkus, an interior designer and television personality, "each have demonstrated values that are consistent with the goals of the college's mission and higher education and are outstanding examples of how far education, professionalism and gumption can take the students who will become tomorrow's designers."

School President David Sprouls said, "This year's commencement speakers ... demonstrate the immense heights and levels our graduates can achieve by using the skills they mastered in college combined with drive, focus and determination. We look forward to welcoming and honoring these individuals as they will inspire our graduates to achieve their own milestones and change the world of design socially, culturally and economically."

Early on Griffin was a creative soul who wanted to spread her wings far beyond Coastal Georgia.

"I wanted to get to see up North," she said. "I was very passionate about ... seeing things from the broadest possible perspective. You can't do that in the South. It was about broadening my point of view as much as I could. I wanted to meet people from all over the world."

After graduating from Glynn Academy, a Brunswick high school, Griffin headed to Yale University and obtained a bachelor of arts degree in art history. In her first career she worked as a publicist in New York and Paris for nine years. She began her design career in the Manhattan office of architect Peter Marino and opened her eponymous firm there in 1999.

Then her firsts began. She was the first black contributing editor at Elle Decor magazine. She was the first black designer to participate in the Kips Bay Decorator Showhouse and her solo Georgia show house for Southern Accents magazine was the only one produced by an African-American decorator.

She also worked as contributing editor for design at Better Homes & Gardens magazine and designed the Good Works Makeovers for Oprah's O at Home magazine.

Griffin has appeared regularly on the "Today" show and was a cast member and third-place winner of NBC's 2014 design competition reality show, "American Dream Builders," hosted by Berkus. Her private client work has been featured in Elle Decor, House Beautiful, The New York Times, Daily News and New York Post, Southern Accents and New York magazine and her 2009 book -- "Design Rules: The Insider's Guide to Becoming Your Own Decorator" published by Gotham Books -- is still in print.

Long based in new York, she now lives on St. Simons Island, having returned to Coastal Georgia in 2015 to be near her ailing mother. But she has maintained her business and one of her next projects is updating her book, which she described as a "The Joy of Cooking"-type instruction manual for interior design.

"Very few people use designers in America. It's a wonderful feeling to say, ‘I did it myself.' But there are rules," she said. "Homes should look like the people who live in them."

Also, don't focus too much design weight on the view outside.

Coastal Georgia, for instance, is "blessed with breathtaking landscape, phenomenal views," she said, but you can't see them in the dark.

"Then you're back to what's within the four walls," she said.

Texto completo: Actress Julianna Margulies says she had to stop reading the news before going to bed because, starting with Trump's 2016 election, she would have nightmares about President Trump and wake up in a sweat.
"One of the things I stopped doing was I do not read the news at night because I was waking up in the middle of the night from nightmares," Margulies told CBS host Stephen Colbert.
"I was in a boardroom, there was a long table, and it was just a guy who's in the Oval Office right now, sitting there and I walked in and I screaming, screaming ... I mean I was going crazy and screaming," she said.iFrame Object
The "ER" actress explained she then made the decision to read the New York Times in the morning and listen to NPR so she could be informed, while occasionally watching PBS in the evening.
Margulies, who is now known for her most recent role as Alicia Florrick in CBS' legal drama "The Good Wife," will be appearing in National Geographic's "Hot Zone" miniseries that will air on Memorial Day.

As trade war escalates, Minnesota soybean farmers wonder: What’s the plan?

Texto completo: Soybean farmers in Minnesota are struggling amidst an escalating trade war between the Trump administration and China, with virtually no information from Federal officials as to what will happen next.
This month, long term trade negotiations between the U.S. and China fell apart, with President Donald Trump announcing additional taxes on $200 billion of Chinese imports. In turn, China responded with $60 billion in tariffs.
The tariffs have impacted a variety of American goods, like beer and swimsuits, but they’ve been particularly brutal for one industry: soybean farmers. Minnesota is the third largest producer of soybeans in the country after Illinois and Iowa. In 2018, the state produced 389 million bushels of soybeans, with a total value of $3.328 billion. China has been the largest purchaser of the U.S soybean crop has been in recent years, which spells trouble for Minnesota farmers looking to access those same international markets.
“That’s a market that farmer’s have literally built with their own funds to be able to trade with the Chinese,” said Jamie Beyer, a soybean farmer from Wheaton, Minnesota. “And that trade was completely stopped last year.”
The President insists that China pays for the tariffs, but soybean farmers are being candid about the impact of the taxes on their day-to-day lives. For Beyer, the price she can get for a bushel of soybeans is down, selling at about 2 dollars a bushel. That means around $200,000 dollars of lost income that her farm needs to pay for land maintenance, tractors and seeds.
“These tariffs are definitely hurting Minnesota farmers right now,” said Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen . “Losing any market is incredibly painful, and it’s resulted in farm income is at an historic low.”
Industry advocates say it took U.S. soybean farmers about 40 years to expand into the international soybean market in China. The American Soybean Association, which represents soybean farmers around the country, has remained staunchly opposed to tariffs to address any trade deficits with China.
The trade conflict between the U.S. and China took root well before last week. President Donald Trump complained about China’s trading practices throughout his campaign, and began the process of imposing tariffs in 2017. The anxiety from the farm community in the state has been palpable since, but the tolerance that many farmers had when the trade war began may be starting to wane.
“We had no way to prepare for the significant disruption to our markets that was brought on by trade disputes last year,” said Mike Peterson, a family farmer who owns 800 acres of corn and soybeans near Northfield, Minnesota, told the House Agriculture Committee on May 9.
“While I originally supported the goals of securing better trade agreements and holding bad actors accountable, the approach to these trade disputes has caused damage that I’m afraid will take us decades to overcome.”
What’s the plan?
Last July, in her role as the Vice President of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, an affiliate of the The American Soybean Association, Beyer went visit Sen. Amy Klobuchar to talk about the conflict. Seeing behind the curtain, Beyer’s concerns about how trade decisions were being made weren’t assuaged at all.
“She was pulling her hair. Literally,” Beyer said of Klobuchar. “She said: ‘There’s no plan. No one’s talking to the USDA. There’s no one talking to us. There’s no one working on this trade deal.’”
Since then, Beyer said that there has been some success with programs to aid farmers throughout the conflict, but that farmers are still in the dark prior to trade escalations like the one this month.
“Our biggest frustration is that the tariffs gets announced prior to any announcement prior about keeping farmers afloat,” she said. “It seems to be in a backwards order, in my opinion.”
From inside the halls of government in Washington, there isn’t much more clarity on when or how this trade war will end.
“Our country needs to get back to the negotiating table, and making trade policy one tweet at a time is not going to get us there,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. “Bushels of soybeans are sitting in silos and farm families are paying the price. This is real, people are suffering, and small farms are going under.”
Senate Agriculture Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, seems to have run out of patience with the President’s insistence on the trade war as well.
“I’m no fan of tariffs,” Grassley told the New York Times last Tuesday. “I’m disappointed by the news of additional tariffs out of Beijing and here in Washington. Both countries are going to be hurt.”
In the House, Minnesota Republicans are supporting the President’s tariffs and saying blame should be placed on China. “Our trade negotiation with China is at a the cross-road,” Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn, who represents the soybean dense region in the southern part of the state, said in a statement. “China has been one of our strongest trading partners and also the most difficult. China has long cheated, manipulated their currency and stolen our intellectual property.”
But House Agriculture Chair Collin Peterson, a Democrat who represents another soybean rich region in the western part of the state, mirrored Grassley’s criticism.
The additional tariffs do “nothing but use our farmers as political pawns and further ourselves from a real solution,” Peterson said in a statement earlier this month. “While I understand that the President believes he has good intentions on this, he’s doing it without understanding the impacts this has on farmers and our rural communities.”
Beyer said that she appreciates that legislators are always willing to listen and understand the gravity situation. She said that the conversation with many legislators in Washington used to be: “This is what a soybean is and this is why it’s important to Minnesota.” Now legislators actually have nuanced questions like: “What’s happening on your farm? What does the market look like? What cuts are you making?’”
But no matter how optimistic she remains, for her, there is a certain resignation in the reality of the economic downtown for soybean farmers, whose ability to make a living is now at the mercy of the Federal government.
“In Minnesota we’re on our fifth year of record decreasing incomes. You can only sustain those losses for so long. You’re either dipping into your savings, you’re dipping into equity, or your borrowing from banks,” Beyer said.
“There’s no magic money tree here.”

Texto completo: This is to Pottsville and Barnesville or anyone else too lazy to research information: We did owe Iran the money Obama paid back to them. They gave us that money in a business transaction for military goods they wanted to purchase from us. We never fulfilled the order and we were paying interest on that money we owed them until we paid it back in full. It was a wise decision to pay that debt. Research the info or stay stupid.

How presumptuous and insulting that Democrats would think it would take Russian interference to make sane people detest Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders or any other Democrat for that matter. I was always going to vote Republican but when Donald Trump emerged as the front runner, I was elated. A crude, obnoxious man is perfect to tell D.C. to shove it. Re-elect Trump.

All the elected Democrats say that Trump is corrupt. The Dems will lie about any Republican president. Doesn’t matter which one. Like they did about Romney’s taxes in the last election. We have to find out who started this false collusion that tried to overthrow the president and grind his agenda to a halt. This is very serious corruption. Even a New York Times reporter said that Fox News may have had it right all along.

Texto completo: Fat cats should pay fair share
The inequality that exists between the have-a-lots and the rest of us has some spectacular details, which reveal why Social Security trust funds may run out.
What’s it like, for example, to get paychecks at the level of some corporate CEOs? The New York Times publishes an annual CEO pay list, topped by a compensation package of $108 million for calendar year 2017 for the CEO of Broadcom, a semiconductor manufacturer, which breaks down to over $2 million per week. In addition to that whopper, Weight Watcher’s CEO’s salary in 2017 was almost 6,000 times the pay rate of her company’s median employee. And a third unsung CEO (TripAdvisor) got a “raise” that year of 3,400%. He must have been so underpaid the previous year.
Perhaps more appalling: My pay, and probably yours, is taxed for Social Security at 12.4%, but big earners pay only a teeny-tiny rate. For instance, the guy at the very bottom of the Times’ Top 200, the CEO of DowDuPont, paid only a fraction of 1% for his contribution to Social Security, so he contributed zero to the Social Security trust fund on over $13 million of his earnings.
FICA is the clearest example I know of a regressive tax: It is backward that rich individuals contribute to Social Security at a much lower rate than we do. This is because the Social Security portion of FICA has a salary cap of $132,900 in 2019, above which no taxes are levied.
This could be changed. If high earners were to pay the same rate of Social Security tax as we do, the looming deficit in this program would simply evaporate. The arithmetic I did a couple of years ago on the Times’ Top 200 list suggested that just these 200 fattest cats paying their fair share of FICA would bring the Social Security trust fund close to sustainability.
This seems reason enough to vote Republicans out of their seats, so legislation for the public good could pass, and make FICA taxes progressive instead of regressive.

Cafeteria worker was wronged
The disdainful termination of Bonnie Kimball is part of a larger whole (“Mascoma lunchroom firing causes uproar,” May 14). The “terminate-at-will” law is a direct conflict with “Live Free or Die.” The fact that every employee can be terminated at will means that every employee in New Hampshire is living under daily bondage. They are not being permitted to “live free.”
There’s another national trend that reinforces the above hypocrisy: “You’re fired!” Gee, where did that come from?
Please note that cafeteria workers, people that deliver fuel oil, office workers, cashiers, etc., are all people who are not available to function in politics because they must go to work every day. The people who have the freedom, the liberty, to run for office (the bosses) are the ones most represented in the state Legislature. Hence, we have this very disdainful law on the books.
Enter Cafe Services. Wouldn’t you think, with all the school contracts they have entered into, that they would have developed a more pro-active and civilized method of dealing with the recurring problem of hungry kids who forgot to get their lunch money? Wouldn’t it seem that they, in concert with the school and the employees, would have an agreement as to how to deal with this to the benefit of everyone involved?
And now ... more disdain, this time from the School Board. Vice chairman Timothy Josephson’s perspective is, “The person is a Cafe Services employee.” No concern evident that there may be a better way to handle this. No concern about what’s best for the school and the community. Wouldn’t you think that the representatives of the school would want a mutually beneficial solution?
Someone in authority should step up. If not the vice chairman, how about the chairman, the principal, the administrator of Cafe Services? Somebody please do the right thing here. God bless Bonnie.

Here are some proactive steps can we take on gun safety
The tragic school shooting at Colorado’s STEM School Highlands Ranch raises the question: Are we willing to tolerate “more of the same” when it comes to gun violence in our society?
I worry that we have become inured to these incidents, showing remorse over the tragedy, but little willingness to deal with deeper issues of gun violence. Even after the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, we failed to devise a system of gun control. Richard Hofstadter asked the question: “How far must things go? Fifty years later, we continue to experience horrifying incidents with no end in sight.
How should we respond to the repeated pattern of mass shootings?
For one, we must limit the accessibility of guns. Our gun culture allows access to guns of all sorts and, with the Second Amendment, legitimizes gun ownership as a right. The United States has the largest arsenal of personal firearms, the fewest regulations and one of the highest homicide rates in the world. Enumerating many societal dangers, the National Rifle Association argues that more guns make us safer. This position is untenable. For another, we can focus on the shooter’s mental illness, as many responses to the recent Colorado shooting recommend. However, with millions fitting the profile of a potential assailant, predicting a future shooter is improbable. Finally, we can shore up school safety. But this is a very defensive strategy.
What proactive steps can we take? First, publicize the Supreme Court’s affirmation of state bans on assault-style weapons. Second, confront the NRA and its role in heightening the climate of fear. More guns do not make the country safer. Third, challenge the politics of guns. A majority of Americans now support banning AR-15s and similar weapons, tightening gun laws and background checks and preventing those with a mental illness from owning guns. Demand that legislators follow our lead.

Pointing to polyester allergy as possible source of itch
column by Marlene Cimons (“For some people, an irritating itch can’t be scratched,” May 13) missed another possible cause of itching: polyester. I learned this when my young child wouldn’t wear pajamas with buttons. A friend told me he was probably allergic to polyester, and that buttons were often made of polyester.
I prevent an itch in the middle of my back like the one Marlene experiences by wearing bras that don’t have a soft polyester pad under the hook. My itch was worse — similar to a mild case of shingles I once had. Bra manufacturers, please take note: That soft polyester pad can be torturous.

Goodbye, Columbus. Now we must end St. Patrick’s Day
The recent decision in Vermont to rename Columbus Day and celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ Day set me thinking. Not only are general principles involved, but we must also consider particular events. While acknowledging the courage and navigational skill of Christopher Columbus, few will defend his conduct toward Native Americans. Nor are such acts defensible. On this basis, the next target for abolition must be St. Patrick’s Day.
St. Patrick’s greatness as a Christian missionary is undoubted. But, according to well-attested legend, he cursed and cast into the sea the snakes who were disturbing his religious devotions. That is why there are no snakes in Ireland. To us living in a more ecologically sensitive age, this was a most deplorable action. Some of us actually like snakes, and eliminating them only serves to give mice and rats free rein.
Besides, St. Patrick was in reality British not Irish, and green beer is a disgusting perversion of an otherwise excellent beverage. For all these reasons, on behalf of all reptile enthusiasts, I demand the abolition of St. Patrick’s Day and its replacement in 2020 by Indigenous Species Day.

Texto completo: In the years since World War II broke out in Europe and President Franklin Roosevelt foreshadowed support for France and England in a radio fireside chat, presidents have spoken to the American people at length about conflicts threatening to involve the nation.
As tensions rise precipitously between the United States and Iran — with bombers set on hair trigger alert and naval battle groups on the move — that’s not what we’re getting from President Donald Trump. Standing in the front door of the White House last week he blurted out, “I hope not,” to a reporter’s shouted question about the prospect of war with Iran.
Then on Sunday, he seemed to contradict that sentiment in a tweet, “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!”
As tightening sanctions cripple the Persian Gulf nation, an American carrier group is rushed to the region and nonemergency personnel are evacuated from the U. S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U. S. Consulate in Erbil — a step not taken even when Islamic State terrorists were rampaging across Iraq in 2014 — Trump needs to explain what he is trying to achieve.
The commander in chief is preparing the military for the outbreak of violence, but he’s not fulfilling his role in preparing the public. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford will brief the House of Representatives in a secure auditorium. The New York Times reports that military officials expect Middle East commanders to ask for a fresh wave of American forces to deter Iran.
The White House and the Pentagon say the moves are a response to intelligence that Iran is planning attacks on U. S. troops in the region. But this conflicts with threat assessments by allies.
OPPOSING VIEW: Donald Trump replaces Barack Obama’s mirage with containment
Beyond this immediate urgency, confusion persists about the broader endgame behind the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions, levied against Iran ever since Washington last year withdrew from a 2015 agreement that was successfully containing Tehran’s nuclear program.
Now Iran threatens to resume stockpiling enriched uranium that could be the precursor to a nuclear warhead.
There’s no question Iran is a bad actor in the Middle East, growing its ballistic missile program and using proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to provoke violence and instability. But how Trump intends to change this is not at all clear.
The sanctions are aimed at making Iran “conform to the normal things that normal nations do,” Pompeo said this month. But he clearly doesn’t believe this himself. “I just don’t see it,” the secretary of State said earlier about Iran moderating its behavior.
And Trump’s other leading foreign policy consultant, national security adviser John Bolton, has made a career out of advocating force against Iran.
Is regime change the goal? This hasn’t worked in Venezuela, where a weaker dictator with a devastated economy still resists U. S. -led efforts to install a new government. And Iran has resisted U. S. efforts to moderate its behavior for 40 years.
Trump, who relishes summitry, has repeatedly offered to meet with Iranian leaders and cut a “deal” to curb their behavior and accept tougher nuclear restrictions. Tehran has thus far shown zero interest.
Trump has long promised to avoid foreign entanglements and has told the Pentagon that his wish is no war with Iran. Then why did he hire Bolton?
And what is the plan? Soundbites shouted at reporters and belligerent tweets can’t convey to Americans the risks Iran poses and what the United States is compelled to do about it.
If there is to be a face-off that includes the prospect of a wider conflict, President Trump owes it to the American people to speak before the saber rattling becomes a sobering reality.

Wildly popular mobile game lets players kill a reporter

Texto completo: The mission is called "Breaking News." It's the seventh mission in the game, and it comes after you've upgraded your sniper rifle to shoot at a distance of nearly 1,000 feet with accuracy.
By now, you've already taken out, among others, a gunman who allegedly killed several people at a pizzeria last year, someone who stole a backpack from a tourist, a sniper who (without a trace of irony) is killing innocent people, and three men guarding a gang's weapon arsenal.
"Breaking News" has a clear goal: kill a reporter.
"A journalist bribed a cop and will pick up a briefcase from the cop," the mission says. "The briefcase is full of sensitive documents. Make him famous in a different way." (In reality, journalists don't pay sources for information or material. There would certainly be no bribing.)
"Sniper 3D Assassin" is a mobile game on iOS and Android. It has a rating of about 4½ stars, with a combined 12 million reviews on both platforms. The app launched in 2014 and reached 10 million downloads in the first month, according to the developer, TFG Co., which is based in Brazil. In 2016, the developer claims it was the most-downloaded game in the App Store.
"Take your sniper, aim and start shooting your enemies," the game description reads.
New York Times editor Jamal Jordan shared an image of the game on Twitter and said his nephew invited him to play. "My nephew is 10, and we had a very long talk after," Jordan told HuffPost.
The Apple Store has guidelines that address violence in games, and it notes that "if you're looking to shock and offend people, the App Store isn't the right place for your app."
Specifically, the guidelines say "apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste." As examples, the guidelines cite "realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused, or content that encourages violence. 'Enemies' within the context of a game cannot solely target a specific race, culture, real government, corporation, or any other real entity."
Neither Apple nor Google responded to email inquiries. TFG Co., did not immediately respond to an email inquiry.
Attacks and threats against journalists have skyrocketed since 2017, when Donald Trump became president. Trump has continued to call journalists "the enemy of the people," despite criticism and fear that he is stoking tension and violence.
Last June 28, a man shot multiple journalists at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. Five people died and two were injured. Before the shooting, the alleged killer had sent letters to courthouses and a law firm stating: "I further certify I then did proceed to the office of respondent Capital-Gazette Communications ... with the objective of killing every person present," according to the Baltimore Sun.
In October, a pipe bomb was found in the CNN mailroom at the Time Warner Center in New York. The package was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan, who works as an analyst for NBC News and MSNBC.
Charging documents included details suggesting that the suspect was critical of the media. The suspect's van was "covered with images including images critical of CNN," the complaint said.
Trump later told reporters that he didn't think he was responsible in any way for stoking the suspect's rage at the news media. "No, not at all," Trump said. He then attacked CNN on Twitter for suggesting that he was inciting violence against journalists.
The same month, Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was killed by Saudi government agents. The Post later confirmed that the CIA determined Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had personally ordered the killing. Trump has denied the intelligence, despite having been shown evidence. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, "enjoys a close relationship" with the crown prince.

What's on TV
INDEPENDENT LENS: WRESTLE (2019) 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This moving portrait follows four members of a wrestling team at a high school in Huntsville, Ala., as they train for the state championship and battle personal woes along the way. One student worries about having to graduate and provide for his pregnant girlfriend; another ignores the four medications his doctors prescribed for behavioral issues and turns to marijuana instead. Keeping them on track is a tough-love coach, Chris Scribner, who hopes the students won't be denied college scholarships because of race or class. Jeannette Catsoulis named the documentary a Critic's Pick in her review in The New York Times. "'Wrestle' isn't slick or impartial, and doesn't claim to be," she wrote. "Yet the movie has a raw honesty that disdains forced uplift."
THE LATE LATE SHOW CARPOOL KARAOKE PRIMETIME SPECIAL (2019) 10 p.m. on CBS. Celine Dion joins the late-night host James Corden in this fifth annual "Carpool Karaoke" special, based on the popular segment from Corden's "Late Late Show." As the two cruise around Las Vegas, they sing their hearts out and revisit some of Corden's favorite "Late Late Show" moments from the past year. When Adele joined for a singalong in 2016, it was a viral hit -- what will happen on this latest ride?
THE ENEMY WITHIN 10 p.m. on NBC. This spy drama series wraps up its first season. Shepherd (Jennifer Carpenter) heads to Cuba to thwart an assault that Tal (Lev Gorn) ordered on a secret C.I.A. detention center. But after she arrives, it's unclear where her motives lie.
What's Streaming
JESUS' SON (2000) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. The director Alison Maclean reimagines a collection of short stories by Denis Johnson in this trippy drama. Set in the American heartland in the 1970s, it focuses on an aimless, innocent drug user, who goes by F.H. (Billy Crudup), and his drifter friends. The center of the story is an intense relationship between F.H. and his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Michelle (Samantha Morton). Like the source material, the movie is fragmentary and is told through nonlinear storytelling. And it works: In his review for The Times, A.O. Scott wrote that its "loose, improvisatory rhythm" gives it "a keen edge of surprise."
PRINCE OF PEORIA Stream on Netflix. In this fluffy family sitcom, Emil (Gavin Lewis), a teenage prince from an island nation, moves to the United States to live incognito as an exchange student. For much of the first part of the series, Emil desperately tries to become buddy-buddy with Teddy (Theodore Barnes), a robot-obsessed student whose family takes Emil in. In Part 2, the pair are officially best friends, and to celebrate, Emil makes a list of 100 summer activities for them.

Texto completo: Kobe Narcisse plays high school football mostly because his friends are on the team, but he would rather crush drives than deliver crushing hits.
He was introduced to golf at age 5 by his father, Robert, who took up the sport as an adult after Tiger Woods' victory at the Masters in 1997. And this spring, Kobe Narcisse, who is African-American, recruited five other students, most of them baseball players, to form a golf team at his public high school outside New Orleans.
But by the time the scholastic regional championships started, Narcisse, 14, a freshman, was the only golfer left.
Most of his teammates, he said, "decided they weren't ready to play."
There were supposed to be scores of Kobe Narcisses by now, at every level of golf - minority children who coursed into the sport after Woods burst the dam with his dominant play as a junior and with his peerless career as a pro - or at least a lot more than there are.
Woods, who is Thai and African-American, brought mockturtlenecks, celebratory uppercuts and the chiseled physique to golf, changing plenty about how the game looks. But predictions that his superstardom would diversify the sport have not come true.
A lack of easy access to golf courses and the high costs associated with competing have proved to be problems that even the rise of a once-in-e-century star like Woods, or the everyday benevolence of teaching professionals, cannot solve.
Woods said on Tuesday that golf's time investment limited its appeal to today's children, regardless of background. "There's so many different things that kids can get into and go toward that honestly, playing 5 hours, 5½ hours, of a sport just doesn't sound too appealing," said Woods, who could have been talking about his daughter and son, both soccer players.
Twenty-two years after Woods' 12-stroke victory at Augusta National, there are only three players of African-American descent out of 250 active players on the PGA Tour (and four with status on the LPGA Tour or its minor league circuit, including Woods' niece, Cheyenne Woods).
According to statistics provided by the NCAA, 6% of all NCAA golfers were Black, Latino or Native American. Asians are the only minority group to have seen a significant increase in participation numbers; they represented 5.9% of all players in 2018, compared with 3.1% in 2008.
The pipeline is sputtering even as some 2.6 million people tried golf for the first time in 2018, the fourth consecutive year that the number of beginners increased, according to the National Golf Foundation.
Narcisse, who recently played in a pro-am with Jason Day, the 2015 PGA champion, is a product of the FirstTee, a program aimed at underserved children, especially girls and minorities. There are others like it, including U.S. Kids Golf and Youth on Course, and they are having an impact: 35% of the newcomers last year were women, 26% were nonwhite, and 70% were 34 or younger. Yet, while golf has made progress in introducing the game to new players, keeping them has been a challenge.
"It's a hard sport," Narcisse said.
Woods was not a country-club kid. He learned on a par-3 public course in Long Beach, California, and his father, Earl, said he took out a second mortgage to support his prodigy's development.
The First Tee, a partnership of the PGA and LPGA Tours, the U.S. Golf Association, Augusta National Golf Club and the PGA of America, the host organization of this week's PGA Championship at Long Island's Bethpage State Park, offers free instruction and free access or deeply discounted rates at affiliated courses. But the very people these programs are meant to serve often face major hurdles to pursuing the sport consistently.
Consider the First Tee chapter in Kansas City, Missouri, which is 7 miles as the crow flies, but more than an hour away as the public buses drive, from the impoverished east side where Chris Harris, 50, grew up. A natural athlete, Harris gravitated to basketball, football and baseball, but never played golf. "Because I had no access to it," said Harris, who has moved earth to change that landscape.
In the past two decades, Harris has bought distressed properties in his old neighborhood. With help from donations and free time from his job finding housing for the homeless, he has developed the land into a sports complex that includes a pitch-and-putt course. The facility will become the local First Tee headquarters.
But exposing children to the game is just the headwaters in the money stream of development. There are tournament fees and travel costs for a seemingly endless schedule. And a set of clubs, even at discount, costs considerably more than a basketball or a tennis racket.
When Woods started traveling for tournaments, his father booked their hotel for the day the event started to eliminate an extra night's lodging. Earl Woods loosened the purse strings after his son said he felt at a disadvantage because he could not see the course ahead of his first round.
Alexis Vakasiuola, 11, and her sister, Alyzzah, 17, know that feeling. Alexis took her first flight in April, and only then because her travel was covered by event organizers, after she qualified for the finals of the Drive, Chip and Putt contest at Augusta National. The Vakasiuolas, who are of Tongan descent, are used to driving to tournaments with their father, Danny. Until recently, the family vehicle was a 1992 Toyota 4Runner that doubled as their sleeping quarters.
"We'd go to a gas station, park and sleep and hit a McDonald's in the morning and eat breakfast and wash in the restroom," the father said.
They now are able to stay in budget hotels because Steve Dallas, who owns two Phoenix-area public courses, subsidizes their travel costs through donations for scholarships that are then distributed by the Junior Golf Association of Arizona. Dallas, who was the first instructor to the Hall of Famer Fred Couples, also lets them practice and play free at his courses, Las Colinas and Apache Creek, and he is their nearest thing to a swing coach.

Harvard sends wrong message in removing professor

Texto completo: Last week, Harvard University sent the message to its students — and the world — that administrators at the prestigious university are either ignorant of, or care nothing about, one of the most fundamental principles in our entire criminal justice system: the constitutional right of every person accused of a crime, no matter how horrible the allegation, to be represented by a criminal defense lawyer.
The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that right, which is as basic and bedrock a principle as the presumption of innocence and due process. At least, it is supposed to be.
Ronald Sullivan is a professor at Harvard Law School and a highly sought-after criminal defense lawyer. Sullivan has helped to free prisoners who were wrongfully convicted. Sullivan was also, for a decade, the faculty dean of Winthrop House, a dormitory at Harvard. As faculty dean of Winthrop House, Sullivan was tasked with assisting students as a counselor, adviser and in a variety of other supervisory roles.
But when student activists learned that Sullivan was going to be one of the lawyers on the defense team representing Harvey Weinstein, those students immediately went after Sullivan, with the obvious goal of getting Harvard University to remove him as faculty dean.
Some student activists claimed Sullivan made them feel "unsafe" because he was representing Weinstein. Other students said Sullivan's choice to represent Weinstein was "trauma-inducing."
What crime did Sullivan commit? Well, none. Sullivan was actually fulfilling a role the Constitution enshrines for everyone — no matter whether the person is poor or rich, as in the case of Harvey Weinstein. As a former public defender, Sullivan is well aware of the importance of representing the poor.
Weinstein is, without question, one of the most hated figures of our time. Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women and, in some cases, sexual assault. He is emblematic of the #MeToo movement.
Although Weinstein is supposed to be presumed innocent — another bedrock principle of our system many people seem far too willing to forget or ignore — if Weinstein is ultimately convicted of sexual assault, then he will rightfully be scorned.
But based upon the reactions of some of our country's supposedly "best and brightest" Harvard students, one might think Sullivan had committed the crimes his client, Harvey Weinstein, is accused of committing.
Harvard student activists demonstrated against Sullivan, carrying signs that read "Remove Sullivan" and "#MeToo." Vandals spray-painted the doors of Winthrop House, with messages such as, "Down W Sullivan!," "Our rage is self-defense," "Whose side are you on?" and "Silence is violence."
According to the New York Times, a student named Danu Mudannayake who supported the removal of Sullivan, wrote, "Do you really want to one day accept your diploma from someone who for whatever reason, professional or personal, believes it is O.K. to defend such a prominent figure at the center of the #MeToo movement?"
Although the student protesters at Harvard are mostly adults, they are young. Perhaps one could chalk up their ignorance of the Constitution to youthful ignorance. We can hope the students will one day learn it is just as important that the most unpopular people accused of the most heinous crimes get zealous representation as anyone else.
But what is inexcusable, and frankly, embarrassing, is the way that the Harvard University administrators caved to the pressure this week when it was announced that Sullivan would no longer serve as faculty dean.
The dean of Harvard College, in an email to students in February, said that she "take[s] seriously the concerns that have been raised from members of the College community regarding the impact of Professor Sullivan's choice to serve as counsel for Harvey Weinstein on the House Community that he is responsible for leading as faculty dean."
It would be interesting to ask the Harvard administrators how they feel about Abraham Lincoln, who was once a criminal defense lawyer and represented people accused of all kinds of crimes, including murder. What if Lincoln were a Harvard faculty member and made students feel "unsafe" because he chose to represent an accused murderer?
Or what about John Adams?
Adams was our nation's second president and helped write the Declaration of Independence. But before that, Adams was a criminal defense lawyer who represented British soldiers accused of murdering Bostonians in the "Boston Massacre." At the time, the accused British soldiers were as unpopular and as reviled as any terrorist group in existence today. But Adams wrote that his vigorous defense of the British soldiers was "one of the best Pieces of Service I ever rendered my Country."
The administrators at Harvard University have done a great disservice to their students.
By capitulating to the demands of the misguided student activists, Harvard has acquiesced to the ignorant and dangerous position that some people are accused of such a horrible crime that they not only do not deserve the presumption of innocence, but their lawyers should be attacked and destroyed as well.

At David's 388, bistro influences and rock-solid dishes At the larger David's, the dining experience is wobblier, but the splendid carrot cake redeems much.

Texto completo: Find one person with a bad thing to say about David Turin. Go on, I challenge you. It's harder than you think.
A transplant to Maine in 1992, Turin quickly established himself as one of Portland's most important and most beloved restaurateurs. If we had a culinary version of Mount Rushmore carved into the hillsides of the Western Promenade, David's bespectacled face would be there, grinning at visitors crossing the Fore River.
As Portland's food scene has grown since his first eponymous restaurant opened on Monument Square 27 years ago, Turin has been there every step of the way, sometimes adapting to keep pace with its rapid evolution, and sometimes spurring it along by adding new businesses to his roster, including David's 388 in South Portland in 2005, and seven years later, Opus Ten, a seasonal, fine-dining restaurant snuggled into the back rooms of David's.
Along the way, Turin has also developed a reputation for being a terrific boss, mentoring highly regarded local chefs - everyone from Brett Cary (Big Tree Catering) to Bo Byrne (TIQA and The Broad Arrow Tavern) and Mike Smith (Scales and Tipo) - and standing up for his employees when things go awry, as they did when all of his Kennebunkport restaurants were shuttered by his former business partners in 2017.
Remarkably, in an environment where nearly every chef I speak to tells me what a struggle it is to retain staff, Turin's employees stick around. "I don't really get a lot of turnover," he said. "I've worked with a few chefs, like Kelsey O'Connor (chef de cuisine at David's 388) who came to me when they were in culinary school. I've just had really good fortune keeping people like him around for a long time."
And behind-the-scenes consistency matters, giving Turin, O'Connor and Ian Yencha, the chef de cuisine at his 105-seat Portland restaurant, time to sync up their cooking styles and creative processes. "I really see a certain similarity between the way we all do things." Turin said. "It happens all the time with Kelsey, and it's happening more with Ian now. It's fun for me when I see them cooking or put something new on the menu, and I say, 'That's exactly how I would have done it.'"
Such harmony of perspective plays out especially well at David's 388, a 44-seat neighborhood restaurant that offers a concise and well-focused menu of New American brasserie-style dishes. Five years ago, our then-critic raved about the kitchen staff's attention to detail and precise coordination with servers in his four-and-a-half-star review.
From that perspective, little seems to have changed. Servers remain knowledgeable about the menu, offering cautions about portion sizes ("Proteins are about the size of a deck of cards here - not like a Flintstone's steak," one said to a neighboring table) and even an impromptu poem about the appetizer list ("I like the Brussels and the mussels, not just because they rhyme, but because they're both so great," another told me with a laugh).
I was charmed, so I put in an order for the Brussels sprouts ($11). Deep-fried golden and topped with pulverized Marcona almonds, bleu cheese and a sweet soy glaze, these are the sort of vegetables whose salinity strong-arms the diner into ordering something tart to drink to help balance things out. A glass of flinty Caposaldo Pinot Grigio ($9) does the trick and pairs equally well with an order of the salmon, hake and sweet-potato cakes that the kitchen cozies up to a nest of bright, tangy cabbage slaw.
While David's 388 doesn't serve tapas-style plates, portions are indeed on the small side. That's a feature, not a bug when dishes are executed flawlessly, like Turin's miniature riff on a classic Southern pie, the pecan-bourbon tartlette ($8), aromatic from amaretto liqueur in a chocolate cookie crust and dripping with caramelized brown sugar.
When something is off, like the weirdly aerated texture of overcooked buttermilk risotto that cradles slices of fantastic crispy duck breast ($22), there is so little else on the plate, it leaves you wishing you had ordered something else.
One safe bet will always be the bacon-and-cheddar-draped "Classic" burger ($15.50), served on a broad slice of homemade rosemary focaccia. When my rhyming server told me that she had a table the previous week where all six people ordered the burger, and every one of them finished it, I wasn't surprised.
"For me, the biggest challenge in the business is execution," Turin later told me. "On my menu, there is not one ingredient that makes you say, 'What's that?' I'm much more concerned with doing it well, the exact same every time."
That credo seems to fit well with David's 388 and its terse list of dishes. On Monument Square, where David's offers a menu that, including pizzas and nightly specials, is twice as large, it sometimes feels more like theory than practice.
Everything at David's is larger than it is across the bridge: the bar, backed by an open wine rack holding more than 100 bottles; vaulted ceilings hung with efficient sound-dampening baffles that look like school gym mats; even the open kitchen, recently livened up with cheery wrought-iron fish that double as pot racks.
But most especially, the portions - something our then-reviewer noted in her three-star write-up of David's nearly 13 years ago, describing one dish as "designed to feed four."
"Oh my god!" squealed a little boy at the next table when his server brought out a chocolate-chip ice cream sandwich as big as his face ($9). I had nearly the same reaction when I caught sight of my dinner guest's entree, a mammoth slab of juicy, brown-sugar-and-bacon-crusted meatloaf ($22) topped with cumin-spiced fried onions. Underneath: a serving of gorgeous buttermilk-garlic mashed potatoes so large that it could have been portioned with a shovel.
My calamari ($15) wasn't much smaller, though it technically counts as an appetizer. But whereas my guest happily took home the leftovers from his meatloaf, I left most of the fried squid behind, never fully warming to the salty imbalance of savory breading, briny black olives and feta cheese.
Sadly, I also left behind most of my (not-so) "small" Cajun Reggae pizza ($14), a bizarre cultural mashup of blackened chicken strips, caramelized onions, cilantro and fistfuls of arugula. The crust was fantastic and the pizza blistered and beautifully cooked, but it bore no connection to its name. Neither Cajun nor Caribbean, the dish was more like a bistro-style, goat cheese salad on a flatbread.
And I didn't really need another salad, having earlier ordered a grilled romaine and lardon "wedge," served in the style of a buttermilk-ranch-drizzled steakhouse standby ($13.50). It was another decent-enough dish, marred only by the questionable inclusion of tomato wedges that tasted like nothing - exactly what you'd expect from a dinner in late April, but a baffling choice from the same restaurant that plays host to the ultra-seasonal Opus Ten during the summer months.
I had come close to ordering an item that sounded suitable for springtime: a prosciutto and pea-shoot salad special ($14.50), but was dissuaded by my server. "Hmmm..." she murmured, "I'd go for something else. That's a little salty. It's not quite there yet." As grateful as I was for her help, it made me wonder about the alignment between the restaurant's front-of-house staff and kitchen. It is never a good sign when a server warns you away from a dish.
Similarly, I couldn't figure out what the back-of-house staff must have thought when they were plating up my my butternut squash arancini ($13), two cheesy, deep-fried risotto balls that were so wet inside, they arrived at my table slumped and spreading lazily into crumb-crusted puddles.
An order of the springy carrot cake roulade ($9) was all it took to right the ship, however. Tender and fragrant with warm spice, the caramel-drizzled, cream-cheese-icing-filled spiral was both baked perfectly and an appropriate size for one person.
Say what you will about his Portland restaurant's rambling, often random-seeming culinary viewpoint and hit-or-miss execution, when it comes to dessert, David Turin has calculated the experience out to several decimal places.
"I have always really loved carrot cake," he said. "But it's not light, and my complaint was that if you don't get a bite of frosting, it's disappointing. So that's how we came up with the roulade. It's not heavy, and every bite comes with frosting."
To quote the man himself: That's exactly how I would have done it.

Texto completo: In 2011, upon visiting Taavo Somer's erstwhile Brooklyn restaurant Isa, the New York Times critic Eric Asimov wrote that he "couldn't help noticing many people eating a few small plates, or sharing a main course." He wondered, "Is this really how people want to eat nowadays?"
Sharing food has been both a boon and a boogeyman to the restaurant industry since the 1980s, when "grazing" restaurants such as the Casual Quilted Giraffe thrived in Manhattan. Spanish-inspired tapas were chic in the '90s, and then came Chinese and Middle Eastern restaurants that were -- and always will be -- meant for family-style eating. Asimov wasn't the first to bemoan sharing, but his inquiry presaged a decade in New York dominated by a new type of cuisine, one defined less by provenance or a chef's palate than by the way it was meant to be consumed, with each diner taking a single bite before relinquishing the plate. At Estela, which opened in 2013, there were hedgehog-like piles of pale endive crowned with anchovies; at Wildair, opened in 2015, beef tartare hidden beneath a blizzard of white cheddar. Both iconic dishes, they adhered to a symmetrically circular plating style and highlighted ingredients (oily fish, raw meat) that exhausted taste buds after just a few forkfuls.
Living in the "sharing economy," we are accustomed to apportioning cars, offices and, yes, plates of food. Lately, though, chefs and diners seem to have grown weary of the communal experience. Two of the most exciting restaurants to have opened in New York within the past year are Benno and Oxalis, both of which serve casual-leaning prix fixe menus. Elsewhere -- at Rocco DiSpirito's revamped Standard Grill and Adam Leonti's eponymous restaurant -- one finds modern renditions of Continental cuisine such as stuffed rabbit and truffled poussin (a young chicken), which can technically be shared but seem designed for one, their textures and flavors varying from bite to bite. At King, an Italian-inspired restaurant that opened in 2016, dishes like quail with braised chicories and tiny potatoes are pointedly, deliciously unsharable. "Sharing is often to the detriment, because then awkward social interactions get in the way of having dinner out together," says King general manager Annie Shi. "Everyone is staring at the plate -- no one wants to touch it."
Food is always political, and yet this debate seems particularly aligned with our era. With socialism back in the national discourse, what could be a better use of collective resources than collaborating on a meal? But that, like socialism itself, is an impure ideal, as it's impossible to get through a shared supper without someone (or everyone) feeling like an autocrat: There is the bully who orders for the entire table, the allergy sufferer who regrets forcing her sensitivities upon friends, the hungry person who snags the last lobster ravioli and is then filled with shame. If in other realms it is prudent to share, here is an opportunity for everyone to feel heard by doing the opposite. In that sense, at least, ordering -- and eating -- for one's self is downright democratic. -- Kurt Soller

Texto completo: When veteran political scribe Elizabeth Drew collected the Washington Press Club Foundation's Lifetime Achievement Award in March, she did not lavish treacly bromides upon the crowd. That was never going to happen. Drew was upset at how women have been treated in her business - at how she has been treated, especially in recent years. "And I'm going to name names tonight. Why not?" she shrugged before the nearly 700 journalists and politicians assembled to hear her speak.
She did name names. And sometimes she didn't, but it was easy to connect the dots. While there have been great advances in the industry, "things are still not ideal for women in journalism," she said. "There are still problems of equal pay and maternity leave, paternity leave. And these issues need to be perfected, but they've been recognized, and they're being worked on."
She was not done, though, not by a long shot. "But something else is going on, and I don't think it's been recognized, but I sure have been seeing it," she cautioned. "It's what I call 'atmospheric discrimination.' " There, she had named it. "Men who treat us with condescension, unkindness, rudeness," she said. Slight her at your peril.
Her speech was greeted with sustained silence, then a standing ovation. "She was just a pistol," says political analyst Charlie Cook. "No, not a pistol. It was more like an Uzi."
Drew, 83, was somebody before much of the crowd was in nursery school, when women in journalism were researchers and receptionists and instructed to keep quiet. Drew did not keep quiet.
After launching her career at Congressional Quarterly as a six-month temp, she wrote for the New Yorker for almost two decades, the last as Washington correspondent. She is the author of 14.5 books - the .5 being the expanded 40th anniversary edition of "Washington Journal: Reporting Watergate and Richard Nixon's Downfall." She was a fixture on PBS and early political chat shows. A clip of her interrogating then-Attorney General Richard Kleindienst makes a cameo in the movie "All the President's Men." She did stints at the Atlantic and the New York Review of Books. She has been fired a couple of times, she told the audience.
A week later, Drew sits in her Georgetown living room, decorated in beige and tomato-bisque red, a Calder print above the fireplace, a covered swimming pool out back, the sort of elegant home found in Allen Drury novels. She is less than happy that her speech didn't receive much coverage, but there is another point she wants to make.
"If a woman objects to an edit, she's 'difficult.' But you don't hear men being described as difficult," she says, drinking tea from a china cup bordered with roses. "With a man, he's ambitious, tough, relentless." She notes, "You know, people don't want to be corrected by a woman. I mean, a lot of men don't. They can't take it."
"First, we've got to air it, and get it out there," she says of workplace sexism. "Management has to pay more attention to it. Their editors should not be able to mistreat writers."
Conversations with Drew go on scenic peregrinations, salted with piquant asides. She makes several suggestions as to how this article should be written. Her recall is exquisite. She's active on Twitter and collects young talent, insistently curious about the now. Twice widowed, she goes out constantly.
Half her Wellesley Class of 1957, she estimates, graduated to marriage. "Ring fever," she calls it. She, in contrast, took secretarial classes and arrived in Washington a couple of years later. Journalism just sort of happened. "I mean, I'm a series of accidents. It evolved," she says, meaning her remarkable career. "It was something to do."
In her 50s, Drew was dismissed from the New Yorker by its then-editor, the queen of buzz, Tina Brown. In her 80s, after 16 years, she was fired by then-New York Review of Books editor Ian Buruma. After nine months of writing a piece a week, she left the New Republic in 2018 following repeated disagreements with a new editor. Does she believe that her treatment was also about age? "It wasn't," she says. It was about being a woman with strong opinions. Discussion over.
"You will always know exactly what Elizabeth thinks," says Time national political correspondent Molly Ball. "She's wonderfully straightforward."
In her speech, in conversation and in previous interviews, Drew has referred to herself as "little Lizzy Brenner from Cincinnati," which seems patently ridiculous. She's a force, the redoubtable Ms. Drew. "There is this certain assumption where people think, 'She must be a diva' because I've had a certain amount of success," she says. But, she notes, "I don't take anything for granted."
She's still game, writing for the New York Times opinion page, the Daily Beast, the Vanity Fair website, the Columbia Journalism Review, an organization called Project Syndicate . "I mean, I'm big in the Hindustan Times," she quips. Mention retirement, and her look is a slap. "Why?" she asks, as if she's never heard such an absurd notion. "It's too interesting."
In 1973, in the midst of Watergate, the story that defined her early career, Drew warned legendary New Yorker editor William Shawn, "I think we're going to change vice presidents and presidents within a year," she recalls. "Nobody was saying that." Now, she doesn't feel as prescient. President Trump, she believes, is far worse than Nixon. "You couldn't imagine anything like this," she says. "It's very sad, actually. Where are we going to be when he's gone, after he's so coarsened things?"
A little later that afternoon, the long-awaited report from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III - or at least Attorney General William Barr's synopsis of it - drops. Once again, Drew is busy making calls. She has two assignments to deliver by early the following week.
Karen Heller is a Washington Post Style writer.

Texto completo: Jean, Rachel and Moy Moy left this world after making it a better place.
Jean Vanier died May 7 at 90. "Savior of People on the Margins" the New York Times headline proclaimed. He doubled down on his desire to help people, founding two worldwide organizations for people with developmental disabilities.
L'Arche has 154 communities in 18 countries. Faith and Light has 1,500 communities in 83 countries. People with intellectual and physical disabilities live in communities where they can feel they belong.
After visiting a noisy, depressing and violent institution for mentally disabled men in France in 1963, Vanier studied how people with mental disabilities were being treated throughout the world, and he resolved to create a community where they could live with one another with dignity.
He bought a run-down house 65 miles northeast of Paris, and invited two men to live with him. Raphael had meningitis as a child. He could speak only about 20 words. Philippe had encephalitis. He talked incessantly about the same things. Both were also physically disabled.
Living with them, Vanier began to understand what it meant to be human. "Before meeting them, my life had been governed largely from my head and my sense of duty. I began to live from my heart."
It was not a given that Vanier should devote his life to people at the margins. He was born into a prominent, well-to-do Canadian family.
We're called to move, he said, "from repulsion to compassion and from compassion to wonderment."
The late Bishop of Bethlehem Mark Dyer knew Vanier. Perhaps from that friendship, he said the Kingdom of God is "where everybody is somebody."
Rachel Held Evans died May 4 at 37. An Atlantic article by Emma Green called her a "hero to Christian misfits."
She was an author unafraid to challenge conservative Christianity, wading into issues such as the role of women, science, LGBT and politics.
Her evangelical church's activism on a Tennessee campaign to ban same-sex marriage eventually led her to leave that church.
She became an Episcopalian, saying she was done trying to end the church's culture wars and wanted to focus instead on building a new community among the church's "refugees": women who wanted to become ministers, gay Christians and "those who refuse to choose between their intellectual integrity and their faith."
Eliza Grizwold has written insightfully about her in The New Yorker, May 6, 2019, The Radically Inclusive Christianity of Rachel Held Evans.
Two of her best friends wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post: "Rachel was for Jesus; she would have gotten in much less trouble if she hadn't believed so deeply that Jesus meant what he said. She was especially for Jesus' table. At every conference she hosted, the table was open, especially for those told they had no business imbibing the bread and wine."
Moy Moy Chopra-McGowan died in July 2018 at 28. She was born on the side of a road, 12 weeks premature, weighing just 2 pounds. She was adopted by Jo McGowan and her husband, Ravi Chopra. Diagnosed with cerebral palsy at 4, Moy Moy had a much more debilitating neuromuscular disease.
"Though she had once been mobile, independent, verbal [and very funny]," her mother recently wrote (Commonweal, Jo McGowan, May 8, 2019), "starting at the age of five, she gradually lost all her skills.
"Living in India, her mother started a school for her here in 1994. It grew from two children to 300. Thousands of families benefited from services in assessment, diagnostics, training, awareness, and advocacy.
"Without speaking a word or lifting a finger, Moy Moy changed the world. She drew people to her in ways we couldn't understand or explain - things happened around her and because of her that one could only call miraculous."
At her funeral, however, the priest clung "to a conventional, useless understanding of disability [deprived, abnormal, definitely not lucky]."
"We were lucky beyond belief," her father said at the funeral. "Moy Moy constantly reminded us never to dismiss anyone as unable to accomplish the amazing."
Canon Bill Lewellis, blewellis@mac.com, an Episcopal priest, retired since 2010 served on the bishop's staff of the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem for 24 years and on the bishop's staff of the RC Diocese of Allentown for 13 years before that.

Texto completo: "Saturday Night Live" Season 44 comes to an end. And "Fleabag" is back on Amazon Prime Video.
What's on TV
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Paul Rudd closes out the season as host with DJ Khaled as the musical guest. Rudd has hosted three times before; his most memorable character is Austin Vogelcheck, whose "kissing family" takes awkward to a whole new level.
SMALLFOOT (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. This animated adventure stars Channing Tatum as Migo, a yeti from a village that defiantly believes humans -- that is, smallfoots -- don't exist. When Migo meets a nature-show host, Percy (voiced by James Corden), he brings word to his fellow bigfoots and is banished from the community for standing by his story. Percy, down on his luck, hopes to win fame for his discovery, even if the 18-foot-tall Migo seems terrifying from his point of view (the two can't understand each other, which makes for a cute running joke.) If you gloss over the forgettable musical numbers, there's much to enjoy here. LeBron James, Danny DeVito and Common round out the cast.
What's Streaming
FLEABAG Stream on Amazon. It's been nearly three years since this dark comedy series debuted in the United States, but it's hard to forget the protagonist. The writer, creator and star, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, plays a grieving, self-destructive owner of a failing guinea pig-themed cafe in London. She has sex to numb the pain of her best friend's death, loves aggravating her cruel godmother (a glorious Olivia Colman) and struggles to connect with her perfectionist sister (Sian Clifford). In the second and final season, set a year after the first, Fleabag (we never learn her real name) starts seeing a counselor (Fiona Shaw, who appears in Waller-Bridge's other wildly popular show, "Killing Eve") and falls for a "hot priest" (Andrew Scott). James Poniewozik named the return a Critic's Pick in his review for The New York Times, writing that Waller-Bridge puts on a "spellbinding performance." If you've yet to give this a try, know that it demands very little commitment: Each season comprises only six half-hour episodes.
THE KID WITH A BIKE (2012) Stream on Hulu or Mubi; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes or YouTube. While Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne unveil new work at the Cannes Film Festival this month, this earlier heart-wrenching drama from the brothers, which was a hit at the festival in 2011, is resurfacing on Mubi. The kid in question is Cyril (Thomas Doret), an 11-year-old boy in Belgium who is abandoned by his father and left to live in a children's home. He runs away and ends up in the hands of a caring hairdresser, Samantha (Cécile de France). She shows him what unconditional love looks like, yet it's not always enough to heal the wounds left by his father. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie "a quietly rapturous film about love and redemption."

Prosecutors Take Up M.T.A. Overtime Pay

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
A vulnerability to payroll abuse at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is coming under the scrutiny of federal prosecutors in Manhattan after revelations that some employees were able to claim staggering amounts of overtime last year.
One worker at the Long Island Rail Road, asserting that he logged about 74 hours of overtime every week atop his regular duty, was paid $ 461,646 last year -- more than the combined salaries of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed pay records for that worker, Thomas Caputo, and more than a dozen other employees at the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Transit, according to three people with direct knowledge of the investigation. The three who spoke with The New York Times this week declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
Beyond those individuals, prosecutors plan to review the 19th-century time keeping practices used in some departments of the Long Island Rail Road: handwritten records submitted by employees.
Modern machines, better able to detect fraud, were installed but not used because, managers said, they feared pushback by employees. Some areas of New York City Transit, which oversees subways and buses, use timecards with mechanical punch-clocks, technology that dates to the early 20th century.
The inquiry is being led by prosecutors in the public corruption unit of the United States Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. The Queens District Attorney's office has also started a separate investigation along with the authority's inspector general, which looks into wrongdoing at the agency.
Mr. Caputo, who recently retired as a senior track worker after three decades with the railroad, did not respond to requests for comment.
James M. Margolin, a spokesman for the Southern District, declined to comment.
John Samuelsen, the international president of the Transport Workers Union, which represents city subway and bus workers, said he was unaware of a criminal investigation.
"There is no evidence of systematic abuse or criminality or fraud at New York City Transit," Mr. Samuelsen said in an interview. "This is putting the cart before the horse."
Mr. Samuelsen encouraged prosecutors to examine the authority's "incestuous relationships with outside consultants" to find "the real fraud and corruption." The union has criticized the agency's reliance on consulting firms, which are often filled with former transit officials.
Anthony Simon, the general chairman of a major union that represents many Long Island Railroad workers, said he did not know about the investigation and could not comment on it.
"I have said all along we do not condone bad behavior," Mr. Simon said in a statement. "We are going to focus on working hard to deliver the service our riders want and deserve."
The governor's office and a spokesman for the transportation authority declined to speak about the investigation.
Several cases of huge overtime payments for Mr. Caputo and others -- first revealed to the public last month in an annual report from the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscal research group -- have highlighted failures by the authority to modernize the time keeping systems for its 70,000 employees.
Officials at the authority say many Long Island Rail Road workers are paid based on handwritten documents they submit listing the number of hours claimed, with little to no review before payment.
Employees of the railroad are, by far, the highest paid of any workers at the region's transit agencies; 19 people whose pay rate was around $ 50 an hour or less made $ 300,000 or more with overtime in 2018.
Mr. Cuomo, who controls the authority, and one of his representatives on the M.T.A. board have said that the overtime hours suggest fraud, sparking an angry standoff with union leaders who said employees had been invited or pushed to work long hours so the system could be fixed.
Five years ago, the Long Island Rail Road installed about 120 biometric clocks, which would require employees to sign in with their thumbprints at the start and end of shifts. Despite this, the paper time keeping system remains in use for union workers in the department that maintains tracks, signals, buildings and bridges.
Management feared that insisting on the use of the automated clocks would have "an adverse impact on employee productivity," according to an internal memo by the transit agency's inspector general, which was described to The Times.
Maintainers at the railroad have the lowest productivity among maintainers at the five biggest commuter rail lines in the country, according to a report published in April by the Citizens Budget Commission.
Last week, transportation authority officials presented plans for the installation and use of biometric clocks for all employees on the Long Island Rail Road and the agency's other commuter railroad, Metro North, within 90 days. The subway and bus systems, which still use time clocks with cards at many locations, would change in six months.
Overtime has become a pressing issue for the authority as its payroll costs have been rising faster than the fares and tolls that support them. Officials say the agency is facing a nearly $ 1 billion deficit by 2022 and they are considering layoffs and other measures to reduce costs.
Not surprisingly, overtime soared as leaders scrambled in recent years to catch up with basic maintenance that had been ignored or deferred and led to poor service. Both management and union officials say that most of the higher bills resulted not from fraud, but from an urgent need for more work.
Union workers on Long Island also enjoy generous overtime provisions, some a century old, under contracts agreed to by their 10 unions with the authority and its predecessors.
Though reform of the work rules on the railroad was a leading goal of the M.T.A. in its most recent round of contract negotiations, none of them were changed under the resulting agreements. They were signed in 2014 after intervention from Mr. Cuomo, who was then running for a second term as governor.
The Long Island Rail Road was embroiled in scandal more than a decade ago, when an investigation by The New York Times found that nearly every career employee who retired received a disability pension, though many continued to enjoy vigorous, active lives. A total of 33 people -- railroad workers, doctors, and a union official -- pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges.
An emergency M.T.A. board meeting last Friday to discuss overtime turned into a series of brawling arguments between union representatives and Lawrence Schwartz, an ally of the governor on the board. Union leaders blamed management for assigning the overtime and even raised the prospect of a subway strike, something not seen in New York City since 2005.
The authority has started contract negotiations with its largest union, Transport Workers Union Local 100, which represents the city's subway and bus workers.
While its leaders have been close to Mr. Cuomo and contributed more than $ 275,000 to his political campaigns, they face internal political challenges from insurgents critical of their relationship with the governor.
Mr. Samuelsen, the union leader who is also a transportation authority board member, has recently taken a decidedly harsher tone with the governor, expressing outrage over Mr. Cuomo's comments on overtime fraud and comparing him to President Trump.

Texto completo: BALTIMORE -- On Oct. 24, 1887, the United States House of Representatives adjourned so the distinguished gentlemen could come to the old racetrack in Baltimore to watch a horse named Parole beat Ten Broeck and Tom Ochiltree in what has become known as the Great Race.
It is odds on that future generations will not be talking about the 144th running of the Preakness Stakes on Saturday. The colt that crossed the finish line first in the Kentucky Derby -- Maximum Security -- is not here. Nor is the one who became the winner of that race through a disqualification -- Country House.
The Preakness Stakes will still be run, of course. It will be the first time since 1951 that the second leg of the Triple Crown will not include the first four horses that crossed the finish line in the Kentucky Derby.
[Need help choosing a Preakness winner? Read our experts' picks.]
There are 13 contenders signed on to race for $ 1.5 million in prize money. Some are trained by familiar faces, like the Hall of Famers Bob Baffert and D. Wayne Lukas; one is trained by a new and intriguing one: Kelly Rubley, who is trying to become the first female trainer to win the Preakness.
She is an unlikely race tracker. Rubley grew up Pulaski, N.Y., a small town near Lake Ontario that no one will mistake for horse country.
She rode hunter-jumpers through high school but abandoned the equestrian life for one of an educator, earning bachelor's degrees in biology and chemistry and master's in secondary education and administration at the State University of New York at Oswego.
Rubley taught science and biology for four years near her hometown. She was an administrator another three. But she never could really kick her love for horses.
So in 2009, she headed south to Fair Hill, a bucolic, European-style training center in Elkton, Md. It is definitely horse country, and she fell hard for it. She found work as an exercise rider for Barclay Tagg, an old school and taciturn trainer who won the Derby and Preakness with Funny Cide in 2003.
Within two years, she was Tagg's assistant, overseeing a string of horses in Florida, New York and the Mid-Atlantic. She missed Fair Hill, though, and when Jimmy Toner, another traditionalist, asked her to run his operation there, Rubley jumped at the opportunity.
Five years ago, Rubley decided she was ready to strike out on her own. She cultivated enough owners to operate a 40-horse stable. She fell into a gelding named Alwaysmining, which has brought her to Baltimore and a go at history.
He had run four races, winning one, when Runnymede Racing bought him privately from another owner. It so happened that Rubley was in the right place at the right time. She was renting a barn from Runnymede at Fair Hill, and they gave her the horse.
Now, Alwaysmining has won six consecutive races at Laurel Park near Washington and has been given a respectable 8-1 shot to win the Preakness.
Fifteen other women have brought horses to Baltimore seeking a Triple Crown event victory. Nancy Alberts posted the best finish when Magic Weisner ran second in 2002. Alberts and Magic Weisner were Maryland-based, too.
Rubley does not want to get too caught up in history.
"I think it's more about the horse rather than me being a woman trainer," she said. "The horse brought me here. I'm very fortunate to have him in my barn."
While Maximum Security may be recovering at Monmouth Park on the Jersey Shore from his wild and taxing race in the Kentucky Derby, his owners, Gary and Mary West, are attempting to salve their broken hearts with an attempt at having the disqualification overruled in federal court. Country House is a no-show because of an infection that will keep him out of the Belmont Stakes at well.
Still, there are some pretty good horses running in the Preakness.
The 5-2 morning line favorite, Improbable, finished fifth in the Derby but was moved up to fourth after the disqualification of Maximum Security. He has not won a race this year after going undefeated last year as a 2-year-old.
"I feel like we're favored by default this year," conceded Elliott Walden of WinStar Farm, which co-owns Improbable. "But this horse has a good résumé. He ran very well in the Derby without hitting the board."
Improbable is also trained by Baffert, who campaigned American Pharoah (2015) and Justify (2018) to Triple Crowns. Baffert is trying to win a record-setting eighth Preakness.
War of Will, the 4-1 second choice, also is coming out of a memorable Derby effort. His jockey, Tyler Gaffalione, seemed to have found another gear with the colt as they turned for home at Churchill Downs, but they tangled with Maximum Security when the leader veered out. His trainer, Mark Casse, said War of Will bounced out of the Derby stronger.
"This horse has a lot of energy, and he's extremely tough," he said.
Rubley said she knew what she had in Alwaysmining. History or not, she likes her chances.
"We're just here to have fun with our horse," Rubley said. "I think ours is a great story. There's been a lot of negative press in the racing world of late, and this is kind of a hometown horse that proved to be pretty special."

Accused Navy SEAL's attorney to file ethics complaint against prosecutor over email tracking allegations

Texto completo: The defense attorney for a Navy SEAL accused of murdering an ISIS prisoner plans to file an ethics complaint against the Navy prosecutor for allegedly sending emails containing tracking software.
Navy SEALTimothy Parlatore, who represents Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, told the Washington Examiner he suspects Cmdr. Chris Czaplak embedded tracking software in emails to defense lawyers and a reporter in an effort to root out leaks to the media.
Marketing companies use similar tracking techniques to learn things such as which customers read promotional emails and how they respond. Every device has a unique Internet Protocol address, and Parlatore said the prosecutor used an image embedded in a signature line to track IP addresses so he could monitor the flow of information shared in the discovery process. He said the tracking device follows the next IP should an email be forwarded. If he forwarded an email from the Navy prosecutor embedded with the tracker to a journalist, for example, the software would show that it went from the Navy's IP to Parlatore's and then the journalist's.
"They are able to now track what the defense is doing with their stuff," Parlatore said.
The alleged tracking emails were sent as the Naval Criminal Investigative Service looks into leaks to the media regarding the high-profile murder case. The judge overseeing the case has placed strict limitations on court documents and information.
NCIS spokesman Jeff Houston told the Military Times Thursday that "during the course of the leak investigation, NCIS used an audit capability that ensures the integrity of protected documents. It is not malware, not a virus, and does not reside on computer systems. There is no risk that systems are corrupted or compromised."
Czaplak did not respond to the Examiner's requests for comment.
The New York Times reported in April that Gallagher has been accused of a litany of war crimes throughout his career, citing a confidential Navy report. Parlatore said it would not make sense for his office to leak such damning information to the press.
"I have a vested interest in not leaking anything harmful to my client," he said.
Gallagher, 39, has pleaded not guilty to the stabbing murder of an injured teenage ISIS fighter while deployed to Iraq in 2017. He also denies shooting two civilians and opening fire on crowds. His court-martial begins May 28 in San Diego. Gallagher's platoon commander, Lt. Jacob Portier, was charged with conduct unbecoming of an officer after he allegedly conducted Gallagher's reenlistment ceremony next to the fighter's corpse.
The case snowballed into a national news story that caught the eye of President Trump, who ordered the transfer of Gallagher from a Navy brig to a hospital complex. "In honor of his past service to our Country, Navy Seal #EddieGallagher will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court," Trump tweeted in March.
While Gallagher's trial will be held in California, Parlatore told the Washington Examiner he plans to file an ethics complaint with the grievance committee for the state supreme court of New York, where he says Czaplak is barred.
The New York State Bar Association issued an ethics opinion in 2001, stating, "Lawyers may not ethically use available technology to surreptitiously examine and trace e-mail and other electronic documents."
New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said the prosecution's email tracking as described in an Associated Press article, if true, "risks serious sanctions by a disciplinary committee in New York unless authorized by a judge." He added there could also be constitutional violations involved, given that the right to counsel is protected by the Sixth Amendment.
"While government investigators are given wide latitude to use undercover informants to detect and solve crimes, invading the defense camp, physically or electronically, as the article describes, is forbidden without a warrant," Gillers told the Washington Examiner.
The Military Reporters & Editors Association released a statement this week demanding "that U.S. government officials provide answers and accountability." Navy Times editor Chris Prine, a member of the organization, was the reporter sent the allegedly tracked emails.
"We have much more to learn about this alleged incident, but if it happened as reported, then this is a profoundly disturbing situation," said John Donnelly, president of the association.

Nike to Change Pregnancy Policy in Athlete Contracts; Sneaker giant says it won't reduce pay during pregnancy after criticism from Olympian Alysia Montaño

Texto completo: Nike Inc. said it is adding language to new contracts for female athletes that will protect their pay during pregnancy, after coming under fire for cutting compensation for some athletes.
The sneaker giant said Friday it had adopted the policy last year but was now writing the terms into its future endorsement deals. Previously, the contracts gave Nike the right to reduce pay if runners failed to meet performance thresholds for any reason, including pregnancy or childbirth.
Although Nike isn't changing existing contracts, the company said current athletes would receive similar protections. "We will provide appropriate assurances for existing contracts to reinforce our policy," a Nike spokesman said Friday.
The move comes days after one of its former runners, Alysia Montaño, criticized Nike and its rivals for their policies around pregnancy.
In an op-ed published in the New York Times , Ms. Montaño said that when she told Nike several years ago that she wanted to have a baby during her career, the company told her it would pause her contract and stop paying her. She changed sponsors and signed with Asics.
"The sports industry allows for men to have a full career and when a woman decides to have a baby it pushes women out at their prime," she said in a video published on Mother's Day .
Ms. Montaño, an Olympian and U.S. national champion, couldn't immediately be reached for comment. After switching sponsors, she famously competed in the 2014 U.S. championships when she was eight months pregnant. After having her daughter, she said in the video that Asics also threatened to end her contract.
Nike acknowledged it had reduced pay for a few female athletes, but said that last year it changed its policies so women would no longer be penalized financially for pregnancy. However, that change wasn't written into contracts.
"Moving forward, our contracts for female athletes will include written terms that reinforce our policy," the Nike spokesman said. "We recognize we can do more and that there is an important opportunity for the sports industry to evolve to support female athletes."
A spokesman for Asics said the company "honors the contracts of our athletes during the duration of their pregnancy and return to competition."

Hail damage: What to do if you find it, and how to prevent it

Texto completo: The storms that blossomed over wide swaths of Iowa on May 16 prominently featured hail, sometimes as large as ping pong balls. That likely means Iowans — if the rain would stop for a minute — will be finding damage to roofs and vehicle bodies Friday.
The largest recorded hailstone in the U. S. was in South Dakota in 2010. It weighed nearly 2 pounds. Whether dropped on your car, home or head, hail is not to be taken lightly.
The cost of hail damage may come as a surprise: Farmers Insurance reports that hail accounts for 42% of all comprehensive auto claims during this quarter each year, and hail-related claims are heaviest in April, May and June.
What to do if your property was damaged
There are several things consumers should be aware of as they seek to fix property damage following a storm, Andy Fisher, president and CEO of a Better Business Bureau office in Louisiana told the Shreveport Times.
Fisher said it's important to research and read reviews before doing business with a particular company. Consumers can look up reviews of businesses at bbb. org.
It’s also smart practice for customers to get at least three estimates in writing from different companies, and to be wary of very low estimates.
“While most contractors abide by the law, be careful allowing someone you do not know to inspect your home damage,” the BBB warns. “An unethical contractor may actually create damage to get work. ”
The BBB also recommends: getting a written contract for work to be done, being wary of door-to-door contractors, resisting high-pressure sales and not paying for a job in advance.
Consumers are also encouraged to pay for service by credit card if possible, which can possibly provide additional protection if there’s a problem.
More tips from the BBB:
Check with BBB, www. findacompany. org and request quotes from accredited businesses.
Don’t sign a contract that has blanks.
Only pay a contractor in full or sign a completion certificate when the work is actually complete.
Avoid paying a down payment, unless special materials need to be ordered.
Find out if the company uses its own workers or if hires third-party subcontractors.
Verify licensing and permits with your city and county.
If your automobile is under warranty, follow the manufacturer’s requirements to keep your warranty in effect.
When receiving an estimate, ask the service consultant to explain all work that will be completed.
Be sure warranty information is included in writing on the repair order.
Facts about weather-related insurance claims
Hail isn't the only damage-causing phenomenon. Severe storms that bring heavy winds, rain and hail to the Plains and Midwest typically form when warm air from the Gulf of Mexico makes its way north and clashes with cooler temperatures.
"Hail season comes early in the Deep South, in January and February. As spring and summer arrive, it moves north to the Midwest, and in July and August, into the Dakotas and Minnesota," according to Paul Quinn, head of claims and customer experience at Farmers.
Tens of thousands of auto claims are processed during this time of year because of hail damage. Hail breaks windows and dents auto bodies, never mind the hazards it poses to drivers. Homeowners, too, are at risk.
The Farmers Insurance Seasonal Smarts Digest, which details the leading causes of insurance claims and the most at-risk states, reveals that spring accounted for more than one-third of all homeowners' claims nationally during the most recent two-year period.
Homeowners claims increased by 52% from April through June compared to the January through March period. Water-related claims were the largest cause of claims at 24%, while hail accounted for 21% of all homeowner claims in springtime.
You can take preventive steps at home as well:
Stay inside during a hailstorm and away from skylights and doors. Close drapes, blinds or window shades to prevent the wind from blowing shattered glass inside.
Move outdoor furniture to a safe place, especially glass furniture.
Arrange a roof inspection.
Immediately repair any broken windows or other openings that resulted from the storm. This will keep other storm ramifications, such as wind and water, out and prevent further damage.
To prevent or avoid hail damage to your vehicle, consider the following:
Use covered parking. Try to park in a garage or under a carport if hail threatens.
Plan ahead. If the weather calls for hail, stay put. Driving is dangerous when it hails, and stormier weather — such as tornadoes — might be in the area, too.
Take alternative transportation. Public transit is a good option when you know severe weather is on its way.
Use hail blankets or specialized car covers. They can mitigate damage.
Inquire about paintless dent repair. Paintless dent repair means heating your vehicle's metal and then gently pushing from the inside to remove dents without damaging the paint on your car

Texto completo: Teenagers need melodrama. They always have. It seems its big, sweeping emotions are somehow the only things that can match the high-stakes, hormone-enhanced teenage feelings. Director Ry Russo-Young excels at rendering those emotions with a singular sense of artfulness. In "The Sun is Also a Star," Russo-Young swirls together sun-dappled selfies, luscious skin, urban grittiness and hip-hop beats, the aesthetics perfectly matched to emotion. She creates a heady, knee-buckling mood that nearly conceals the weaknesses in story and performances.

The film is the feature adaptation of Nicola Yoon's second novel. Her first, "Everything, Everything," also went on to success as a movie adaptation, starring Amandla Stenberg and Nick Robinson in a swoony take on a Bubble Boy story. The sick teen genre is a well of deep potential with its heightened stakes and ticking clock. And in the structural sense, "The Sun is Also a Star" is also a sick teen movie -- without sickness. But the stakes are high and the clock is ticking -- on a mandatory deportation from the United States.

Yara Shahidi (of "black-ish" and "grown-ish") stars as Natasha, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants but a New Yorker through and through. The day before her family is set to be deported back to Jamaica, she makes a last-ditch attempt to change their fate by pleading their case to an immigration lawyer. She's spotted in Grand Central Station by Daniel ("Riverdale" star Charles Melton), who notices she's staring at the starry ceiling, and he interprets her "Deus Ex Machina" jacket as a sign.

Daniel is a poet, a dreamer and believer in destiny, and he takes off after her. First he saves her from a speeding BMW in Chinatown, then persuades the science-driven Natasha to spend some time doing the "36 Questions" love study from the New York Times. "Give me a day," he says, "and you'll fall in love with me."

Easy for the easy-on-the-eyes Melton to say! Shahidi and Melton both possess an otherworldly kind of beauty, and combined with Russo-Young's lush, rhythmic cinematic style, you could just watch them bop around the city for hours, all shiny hair and plush lips. But then, they open their mouths and the spell is broken. The dialogue (the script is by Tracy Oliver) just grinds things to a halt, with speeches that are a bit too on the nose, and too-grand declarations of love. Then again, all those things seem so profound and meaningful at that age.

As pretty as Shahidi and Melton are, they just don't share a palpable chemistry. Shahidi is undoubtedly a star, and while Melton is charming and gorgeous with a goofy puppy-dog energy, the more dramatic moments demonstrate the upper limitations of his range. Shahidi's few short scenes with immigration lawyer John Leguizamo are far more riveting.

That's somewhat covered up by Russo-Young's impressive filmmaking. A New York City native, she captures the arresting energy of the city while imbuing the film with a sense of lyricism and grace, as if the streets are sprinkled with magical fairy dust.

The world looks the way it feels when you're falling in love, like everything is at its best, and everything makes sense. When you're looking at the world through love-colored glasses, destiny doesn't seem so far-fetched, and Russo-Young offers up a glimpse.

1 hour, 40 minutes. PG-13 for suggestive content, language. Two and a half stars out of four.

Texto completo: Rupert Murdoch has a couple of small quibbles with "Ink," the British play about his rise as a media mogul, which he saw Tuesday night on Broadway.
Mr. Murdoch was there at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater with an entourage of past and present editors of The Sun, the British tabloid at the heart of the play. Other attendees included Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's News UK, who was embroiled in the infamous phone hacking scandal; David Dinsmore, another News UK executive; and Tony Gallagher, the editor in chief of The Sun. Also there was Col Allan, a former editor of The New York Post who was recently brought back to help run the paper.
James Graham's play focuses on Mr. Murdoch's 1969 takeover of The Sun and its transformation into an influential mass-market tabloid. It had its premiere on Broadway this spring after opening in London in 2017, and has been nominated for six Tony Awards, including best play.
A spokeswoman for the production said on Wednesday that a representative from News Corporation, Mr. Murdoch's media company that publishes The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal, had reached out to Rupert Goold, the play's director, to say they were buying tickets to the play and wanted to meet the cast.
After the show on Tuesday, Mr. Murdoch and the other editors met with many of the performers -- including Bertie Carvel, the actor who plays him -- onstage. Mr. Carvel was unavailable for comment on Wednesday, but in a statement he thanked Mr. Murdoch for being "generous with his time."
He said that he asked Mr. Murdoch whether there was anything about the play he would change. Mr. Murdoch, according to the statement, said no but added that there were "one or two points of fact about which he'd quibble."
"I can't say it was the most relaxed performance I've ever given," said Mr. Carvel, whose performance has earned him a Tony nomination, "but there was definitely electricity in the air."
Ben Brantley, in his New York Times review, compared the Murdoch character to Mephistopheles.
"As drawn with Dickensian relish by Bertie Carvel, this Murdoch is indeed a man of wealth and taste, with a surprising touch of the prig," Mr. Brantley wrote. "And by artfully tapping into the most primal instincts of those he would have do his bidding, Mr. Carvel's Murdoch is someone to whom it is all but impossible to say no."
Through a spokesman, Mr. Murdoch declined to comment. The play's spokeswoman said that, when Mr. Murdoch drew close to the set pieces onstage, he marveled at how similar the newsroom desks looked to the ones they worked at in the 1960s.
This was Mr. Murdoch's first time at "Ink" on Broadway, though he had seen it in London, the spokeswoman said.
The play may be set in the past, but it foreshadows the present era in which one man controls Fox News Channel, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. The Sun remains powerful in Britain, where it is thought to have influenced the country's vote to leave the European Union.

Hacking? What hacking?

Texto completo: Floridas governor is facing calls to name the two local elections offices he says were hacked ahead of the 2016 election. But based on his own comments, hes not the only one in Florida choosing to keep that information secret.

In the weeks since Robert Muellers report on Russian interference in the 2016 election revealed that hacking efforts by Russian intelligence outfit GRU were in fact successful in at least one Florida county despite years of public information to the contrary, the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times have contacted each of the states 67 elections offices to ask whether their offices were hacked.

And all but a handful of Floridas elected supervisors have said in interviews or in public statements that they have no reason to believe their offices were involved  even though the FBI told Gov. Ron DeSantis recently that they notified the victims years ago.

We have not been told we are (among the hacked counties), Assistant Suwanee Elections Supervisor Jennifer Kinsey said Wednesday. Were kind of wondering who it is, too.

Elections offices in Gadsden and Hardee counties either declined to comment or failed to respond to requests for information, although theres no information to suggest that either of those two counties were hacked. Sumter County Supervisor Bill Keen said in an interview Wednesday morning that he has no reason to believe his office was hacked, but an elections coordinator in his office later responded to an email seeking comment by saying information about hacking was exempt from disclosure because our answers

could either directly or indirectly allow yourself or others, including nation states trying to do harm to our elections process, to ascertain details harmful to national security ...

At least 11 elections offices received malware-laced emails from hackers. But officials in Floridas largest counties say they have no reason to believe they were hacked.

The widespread denials continue to cloud an already muddy controversy that refuses to fade even as Floridas senior-most politicians assert that no elections data was manipulated by the hackers who tricked their way into local registration databases. They also undercut trust in Floridas elections security, given that only a few weeks ago the same people who are now assuring that successful hacking attempts had no consequence on the 2016 election were insisting that, in fact, those hacking attempts had all failed.

It is absolutely shameful and ridiculous that the federal government will not tell the citizens of the state of Florida and the public officials all they know about the hack, said Ion Sancho, a former Leon County elections supervisor who went public in September of 2016 with the details of a private conference call between elections officials, Homeland Security and the FBI on hacking attempts . Certainly, the Russian GRU, they already know which counties theyve penetrated. The only ones that are being kept in the dark are the citizens, the voters themselves.

Until Tuesday, and even after the release of Muellers report, all indications were that the FBI and Homeland Security had consistently told state and local officials that hacking threats in 2016 were widespread but unsuccessful.

Information that Russian intelligence agents spoofed emails made to appear as if they came from elections vendor VR Systems and tried to trick Florida supervisors into opening malware-laced attachments has been public for two years. But going back to an initial conference call with the FBIs Jacksonville office in September of 2016, elections officials in the nations largest swing state have said they were told those efforts all failed because no one opened the attachment.

What information that did exist publicly to suggest that any hacking attempts had succeeded anywhere in the U.S. was limited to vague references without geographical information in a January 2017 Director of National Intelligence report and a May 2018 U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report. When then-Sen. Bill Nelson warned last summer that hackers had gained access to voting systems in Florida and had free rein to move around, he was ridiculed by his opponent, Floridas then-governor Rick Scott, and questioned by elections supervisors.

Theres no information to support that hackers still had access in 2018, as Nelson warned, but it now appears that he was at least partially correct. And it also appears that the FBI left the state in the dark even though it had, in fact, informed two local offices that they had been hacked in 2016  offices that either remained quiet or lied publicly about whether they had been breached.

This was something the counties knew about prior to the 2016 election as they worked with the FBI, DeSantis said Tuesday during a hastily called press conference. Im not allowed to name the counties. I signed a disclosure agreement (with the FBI). I would be willing to name it for you guys but they asked me to do that so Im going to respect their wishes.

The FBI did not specifically answer questions Wednesday about why it deemed the identity of the hacked elections offices as classified, but a spokesperson noted that nondisclosure agreements are required under the terms of a 2003 executive order when people without security clearances, such as DeSantis, are briefed on sensitive or classified information. The spokesperson also said that the FBIs victim notification policy was followed in this case.

Before DeSantis revealed details of his Friday briefing, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, suggested to the New York Times that the FBI had likely chosen not to inform elections officials whod been hacked in order to protect sensitive information. Also on Wednesday, the chief operating officer of VR Systems disputed DeSantis assertion that the reason why those counties got affected was not necessarily those counties but it was because of a private vendor they were using.

After receiving a media inquiry based on Gov. Ron DeSantis comments, we immediately called our contact at the FBI, who confirmed what as weve said all along, VR Systems was not the source of any penetration into any county supervisor of elections systems, said COO Ben Martin. Based on this information, we stand by our assessment that a spear phishing email impersonating our company was the likely source.

DeSantis said Tuesday that hes trying now to determine why Florida officials were left unaware that hacking had been successful. He said he was told during his briefing that there were state agents of a task force who knew about the hacks and its possible that information should have been transmitted to the governor. In the meantime, some elections watch organizations say theyre less concerned with who was hacked three years ago than with the question of whether Florida is prepared to stop hacking efforts in 2020.

2016 proved that foreign governments have much to gain from meddling in our elections, said Liza McClenaghan, chairwoman of the Florida board of voting advocacy group Common Cause. More attacks are on the way.

A spokeswoman for Floridas Division of Elections confirmed that Secretary of State Laurel Lee also signed a nondisclosure agreement during the same meeting attended by DeSantis. But she said the FBI was very clear that there was no manipulation of voter data, vote counts or election results in 2016, and said there were zero successful hacking attempts during last years midterm elections.

State, local and federal officials also stress that the voter registration networks that were breached dont connect to the systems that tabulate votes, although hacking into a registration database would potentially allow for other kinds of mischief.

Former Gov. Scott, now a U.S. senator, met Wednesday with the FBI, and Floridas Democratic delegation has scheduled a press conference to follow their own FBI briefing today. Calls have grown for officials to make public what the FBI is keeping classified. And as more people are informed about the extent of hacking in 2016, its possible that more information will be forthcoming as well.

Texto completo: Appalachians sometimes get pegged as suspicious of outsiders. Maybe that's because so many have come here and screwed people over.
Back in 2017, the Gazette-Mail reported on the nonprofit Mined Minds, a tech-training startup based out of Pennsylvania with operations in West Virginia that promised to teach coding skills to enrollees in order to help them obtain marketable skills for high-paying jobs. The organization, which had shut down its Pennsylvania operations because it wasn't licensed as a school, was being sued for allegedly misleading its students.
The lawsuit is ongoing, and The New York Times wrote about the organization on Sunday, laying out the familiar details of how Mined Minds made big promises that had people in West Virginia quitting their jobs for a new opportunity. Complaining of vague class structure and no pay, many wound up quitting. Others who graduated into apprenticeships were fired by the organization - the workers believe this is because Mined Minds couldn't pay them. Few, if any, found work in the tech sector.
Roger Frame, a coal miner and husband of one of the participants in the Mined Minds program in Beckley, put it to the New York Times like this, "They're coming here promising stuff that they don't deliver. People do that all the time. They've always done it to Appalachians ... it repeats itself. It's like a never-ending cycle.
Although co-founder Amanda Laucher told The Times the program is still going, the company's website now says it is no longer taking applicants, and offers no information on Mined Minds itself. Its Twitter account has been deleted. Laucher hasn't posted anything on her own Facebook page, which has the Mined Minds logo as its profile picture, since 2018.
Many angry with the company left links and quotes from the Times article as comments on Laucher's most recent posts from last year. Laucher didn't help herself by telling the Times that most of the nonprofit's problems could be pinned on Appalachia's drug crisis and "poverty culture.
This was a program welcomed by West Virginia politicians and given public funding to work with. It was viewed as a salvation from a dead-end job or, maybe that rarest of unplucked gems, a program that could give coal miners in a dying industry training in a new field that would pay them well without destroying their bodies. It seems now everyone was fooled. Again.
Maybe the expectations for Mined Minds were too high. But the company, with its alleged party culture, elusive structure and seemingly random firings, at the very least over-promised on a gigantic scale. According to the Times, the one student who did graduate from the program in Beckley is now delivering takeout.
Sadly, it's a familiar tale. As one miner who quit his job to join the program and was later fired told the Times, "It was a too-good-to-be-true kind of deal. Just false hope. He's now back working as a miner.

President Trump to Attleboro third-grader: 'I am listening and will always work hard for you'

Texto completo: The Attleboro third-grader who recently got a letter back from President Trump after writing him in November had eagerly anticipated a reply for months, sometimes checking his school's main office twice a day to see if any mail from the Beltway came in, his principal said.
In an e-mail this week, Joanne DiPalma, principal of A. Irvin Studley Elementary School, provided a copy of the form letter on White House stationary that her student, Adam Turner Jr., 8, received last week at school.
She also provided additional background on Adam's presidential correspondence.
“Adam did receive a letter from President Trump last week after writing to him back in November as part of a letter writing assignment they had been given in class," DiPalma wrote in an e-mail. “Though most of his classmates wrote to relatives, Adam decided to write to the president. In his letter, Adam expressed his support of President Trump and also his excitement over the two of them sharing a birthday. Adam came to the principal's office each day, sometimes twice a day, in the hopes that the president had responded."
For a while, there was nary a word from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
“At first, he would be disappointed and frustrated but eventually accepted the fact that he would need to be patient and may never receive a response," DiPalma wrote. “Both his classroom teacher Mrs. Larouche and I attempted to reach out to the White House as well on his behalf. Our letter carrier would check each day as well to make sure it would be delivered first thing if it arrived. Everyone was hopeful for him. There was even a day that he came in not feeling his best just so he would be able to check the mail."
When the letter did arrive, DiPalma wrote, “it almost went unnoticed due to the amount of time that had passed and the fact that everyone was looking for a standard sized envelope but it came in a large yellow envelope instead. When our clerk realized what she had in her hand she was very excited and called in to his classroom to ask him to come to the office. He was extremely happy as you can imagine!"
Turner's father, Adam Sr.,told the Globe Wednesday that his son was “extremely excited" to hear back from the commander-in-chief. “He's waited a very long time for that letter," the father said.
Here's what Trump wrote to Adam Jr. in the White House note dated May 3:
“Dear Adam, thank you for taking the time to write to me. I always enjoy hearing from young Americans like you.
“As your President, I want you to know that I am listening and will always work hard for you. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many years to come, and we will create a better future for you and your family.
“I encourage you to do your best in school each day, never stop learning, and look for ways to make positive changes in your community."

What if Trump loses in 2020, but doesn't leave?

Texto completo: In a historic change of mind, President Donald Trump has found a reason to support reparations — for President Donald Trump.
The president retweeted this bright and, oh, yes, unconstitutional idea on Sunday after Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, proposed that Trump deserved an additional two years in office to make up for the time allegedly lost in the Russia investigation.
I have a counterproposal. I think the president should leave office two years early — as in, right now — to make up for the "executive time" that he reportedly has spent golfing, visiting his personal properties and watching "Fox & Friends" instead of keeping up with his daily intelligence briefings.
Just kidding. Falwell was just kidding, too, I am told. Trump? I'm not so sure.
"Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President," Trump tweeted Sunday, "including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stolen two years of my (our) presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back....
"The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Could this be a sign that the president doesn't expect to win four more years in office by the normal constitutional route?
As Trump's and Falwell's tweets went out, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was warning in a weekend New York Times interview that, even if the president fails to be re-elected in 2020, he won't want to leave — especially if he loses by a narrow margin.
The party needs to "inoculate against that," she said, by not only winning but winning "big" enough to convince Trump to step aside voluntarily, as every other sitting president has.
Pelosi didn't sound like she was kidding at all. Similar fears that Trump would "poison the public mind" and "challenge each of the races," motivated her in last year's midterms, she said. In the end, Democrats picked up a net gain of 40 seats, their biggest gain in the House since the historic post-Watergate wave election of 1974.
She's not the first to speculate about a Trump who won't go away. When comedian Bill Maher floated that notion last year on his HBO program, not as a joke but as a serious concern, my personal reaction was, hey, don't give him any ideas.
Yet Trump has said more than a little to feed the notion himself. In his final 2016 presidential debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, less than a month before Election Day, Trump promised to "totally accept" the election results, "if I win."
Since he did win the Electoral College, Trump's threat went away. But he went on to complain anyway, tweeting blame on some sort of a ghost-voting conspiracy for allegedly robbing him of the popular vote, "if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."
"In many places the same person in California votes many times," Trump said at the official White House event in West Virginia on tax cuts in April 2018. "They always like to say, 'Oh that's a conspiracy theory.' It's not a conspiracy theory." Again, he offered no evidence to back up that claim.
Speaking at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee in April, Trump cast suspicion on the close elections that Democrats won in 2018. "There's something going on," he said, telling his audience that they needed to "be a little bit more paranoid than you are, OK?" Again, he offered no proof to back that up.
And, requiring no proof are the jokes Trump has casually dropped about somehow extending his constitutional term in office. "Well, this is really beautiful," he said, accepting a gift from the Wounded Warrior Project in April. "This will find a permanent place, at least for six years, in the Oval Office. Is that OK? I was going to joke, General, and say at least for 10 or 14 years, but we would cause bedlam if I said that, so we'll say six."
Right. I, too, have an award for the president. It's a copy of a fine old song by Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks: "How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away?"
It's got a good beat and he can dance to it.

"Vassar is working to advance nuanced discussions of complex issues, and many students are interested in issues of social justice," Vassar College President Elizabeth Bradley said. "Van Jones has had a career of working on issues of social justice, most recently in working across the aisle with both political parties in Washington to improve the criminal justice system. This is a perfect example of something we are doing at Vassar, which we called engaged pluralism. Engaged pluralism demands that different groups not merely tolerate each other: They engage each other."

Senado de Alabama aprueba el proyecto de ley de aborto más restrictivo de Estados Unidos

Texto completo: El Senado de Alabama aprobó el martes una medida que prohibiría casi todos los abortos en el estado, estableciendo un desafío directo a Roe v. Wade, el caso que reconoció el derecho constitucional de una mujer de interrumpir un embarazo, reporta The New York Times.
La legislación prohíbe los abortos en todas las etapas del embarazo y criminaliza el procedimiento para los médicos , que podrían ser acusados de delitos graves y enfrentar hasta 99 años de prisión. Incluye una excepción para los casos en que la vida de la madre corre un grave riesgo , pero no para los casos de violación o incesto, un tema de feroz debate entre los legisladores en los últimos días
Ahora se traslada al escritorio del gobernador Kay Ivey , un republicano. Aunque el gobernador no se ha comprometido públicamente a firmar la legislación, muchos legisladores republicanos esperan su apoyo.
Hasta ahora, no había posibilidad de revertir a Roe “, dijo a NYT Eric Johnston , quien fundó la Coalición Pro-Vida de Alabama y se desempeña como su presidente, y ha pasado más de 30 años tratando de prohibir el aborto.
Johnston, quien redactó el proyecto de ley de Alabama y se considera un purista en el tema del aborto, dijo que no apoyaba la serie de leyes restrictivas que otros estados han promulgado en los últimos meses, incluidas las llamadas cuentas de latidos fetales. Estos proyectos de ley esencialmente prohíben los abortos a partir de las seis semanas posteriores a la concepción, un momento en el que muchas mujeres aún no saben que están embarazadas.
Los demócratas y los defensores de los derechos de aborto dicen que la medida de Alabama conduciría el procedimiento a la clandestinidad, poniendo en peligro las vidas de mujeres y niñas y afectando de manera desproporcionada a los residentes pobres y de minorías de Alabama.

Texto completo: Una serie limitada de MetroCards entrarán en circulación mañana para conmemorar el 17 aniversario de la conclusión en 2002 del esfuerzo de recuperación después del ataque del 9/11 en las torres del World Trade Center, informó The New York Times.
La fecha también coincide con el día que el “9/11 Memorial and Museum” tiene programado para inaugurar el “Memorial Glade”, un camino con enormes monolitos de piedra.
La Autoridad Metropolitana de Transporte (MTA) emitirá 250 mil de esta serie especial de MetroCards . Estarán a la venta especialmente en estaciones cercanas a donde se alzaban las Torres Gemelas.
Son cuatro diseños , cada uno con una fotografía de trabajadores en la Zona Cero en las semanas posteriores al colapso de las Torres Gemelas en septiembre 2001.
Las fotografías muestran a bomberos, policías y trabajadores humanitarios buscando víctimas entre las toneladas de escombros y cenizas.
Estas MetroCards “nos invitan a todos a recordar el coraje y la abnegación de los trabajadores de rescate, recuperación y socorro que respondieron después del 9/11”, dijo Alice Greenwald, directora ejecutiva del museo.
“Seguimos aumentando conciencia de los desafíos que aún enfrenta esta comunidad al compartir sus historias con millones de visitantes globales”, agregó.
El viernes pasado, 47 oficiales de la policía de Nueva York que fallecieron los últimos años a causa de enfermedades relacionadas con los ataques terroristas de 2001 fueron honrados por autoridades y parientes en el “Salón de los Héroes”, en la sede central de NYPD.
Casi 3 mil personas murieron en los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001 en Nueva York, Washington y Pensilvania, en el peor ataque terrorista en la historia de Estados Unidos.
No todas las víctimas de ese día han sido identificadas. Y muchas más han fallecido o reportado enfermedades en años posteriores, a consecuencia de los hechos.

Eric Swalwell's Tweet About Georgia's New Abortion Restriction Only Slightly Off-Key

Texto completo: “The so-called ‘heartbeat’ law outlaws abortion before most women even know that they’re pregnant. This is one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in our country.”
Eric Swalwell on May 8, 2019, in a tweet.
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law Tuesday the state’s latest abortion restriction. Political reaction to the measure, which prohibits the procedure once a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat — usually at about the six-week mark — was swift.
This fact check was produced in partnership with PolitiFact.

Abortion opponents applauded the measure, which puts Georgia
in the company of
Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota and Iowa. (Courts have blocked the
Iowa
and
North Dakota
laws.) Reproductive rights activists are widely expected to challenge the Georgia law, which many legal experts say violates the abortion standard set by the Supreme Court in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision.
Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, was among the critics who weighed in.
“The so-called ‘heartbeat’ law outlaws abortion before most women even know that they’re pregnant,” Swalwell posted on Twitter. “This is one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in our country.”
Swalwell’s claim is an argument we’ve heard often about the six-week abortion ban. We emailed his press team, who redirected us to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, describing the law’s passage. But we wanted to dig deeper.

‘Most Women’?
Swalwell’s claim has two components: First, he said the law bans abortion “before most women even know that they’re pregnant.”
This is a tricky one. We contacted four reproductive-law experts, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. We also looked at information from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy organization that supports abortion rights but whose research is widely cited.
None of those sources could point us to data showing when “most women” know they’re pregnant.
Maggie McEvoy, an ACOG spokeswoman, said the organization doesn’t track that information, and it isn’t clear anyone does.
And about Swalwell’s statement:
“Is it empirically true? I don’t know that the medical literature supports that,” said Katherine Kraschel, who runs the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale Law School.
But even without that data, experts said, it is abundantly clear that women who are not trying to conceive are much less likely to be aware of a pregnancy until well after six weeks.
That’s because “six weeks” really means “six weeks after a woman’s last menstrual cycle.” Typically, a cycle is about 28 days, or four weeks, long. But many women are accustomed to having irregular periods, and delays can be exacerbated by everyday factors such as stress and fatigue, which could stretch a cycle to 30 or 40 days. At this point, though a woman may not yet be aware that she is pregnant or be experiencing any symptoms, a physician may be able to discern a fetal heartbeat.
Most women don’t realize they’re pregnant until missing at least one period, said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an OB-GYN at Rutgers Medical School. Often, it takes two.

Generally, medical experts say, women who are actively trying to conceive tend to track their cycles very closely and know much sooner if they are pregnant. But for women whose pregnancies are unintended, and who may be more likely to contemplate an abortion, Swalwell’s statement is more accurate.
About two-thirds of women seeking abortions usually come in around eight weeks since their last menstrual period, per the most recent Guttmacher statistics.
In other words, the six-week restriction would cut off access to abortion at a point in the pregnancy when “there’s a high level of women who might not know,” Kraschel said.
‘One Of The Most Restrictive’
The second half of Swalwell’s claim is easier to verify.
He said this is “one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws” in the country, a characterization experts say is certainly accurate. The phrase “one of” is a crucial distinction. The Georgia ban is no more stringent than those approved in the five other states that have passed heartbeat laws.
In Alabama, lawmakers are considering a bill that would effectively criminalize all abortions — treating physicians who perform the procedures as felons. If it were to become law, Alabama’s would be the most stringent in the nation. But voting in the state Senate on that legislation was postponed after a debate erupted over whether to include an exemption for rape or incest.
Legal experts also suspect that, as conservatives pursue new abortion legislation, heartbeat restrictions are among the likeliest to end up in front of the Supreme Court. Conservatives believe the judicial makeup favors a ruling that could overturn or scale back the abortion protections outlined in Roe v. Wade.
Our Ruling
Swalwell runs into data obstacles with the first half of his claim. He says a six-week ban prohibits abortion before “most women” know that they are pregnant, but there isn’t any research that conclusively says that’s correct.
Some clarification would help him here.
Most women who aren’t trying to conceive are less likely to know this early that they are pregnant. They probably aren’t taking pregnancy tests or closely monitoring their periods. And women seeking abortions are generally coming in after six weeks.
To be fair to Swalwell, his broader point here is true: The women more likely to seek abortions are, six weeks from their last period, less likely to realize they are pregnant.
The second half of this claim is unequivocally correct. Georgia’s law is indeed among the nation’s strictest.
This claim is correct but could use more context and clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

Texto completo: Most Americans might not realize this, but the democratic process of having your federal government answer tough questions — live, on television — is an act of accountability fast becoming extinct.
Once upon a time, a chief spokesman for the White House or Pentagon or State Department would go before cameras every day, certainly every week, and take any and all questions about government policies impacting millions of American lives.
No more.
Come Friday, it will be 67 days since White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a "daily press briefing. " That's a record dry spell. And it has been nearly a year since the last, on-camera news conference by a Pentagon spokesperson. The State Department sometimes goes weeks without a "daily" briefing.
Meanwhile, news cycles keep generating vital questions: Is a New York Times report accurate that plans are being prepared to send up to 120,000 troops — a force like the one used to invade Iraq in 2003 — to counter Iranian threats? Does President Donald Trump expect Americans to endure weeks or months of tumbling stocks and rising prices as his China trade war drags on? Why does he keep saying China pays billions of dollars in tariffs when it's actually American companies and consumers footing the bill?
FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN: Access to the president is more important
To his credit, media-savvy Trump makes himself available for shouted media questions as he boards Marine One helicopter on the South Lawn or during heads-of-state meetings more than many of the prior presidents. And the Pentagon offers up experts to answer questions on specific topics or does occasional briefings with cameras turned off.
"But access is not the same thing as transparency," says Martha Joynt Kumar, an emerita professor at Towson University who studies the history of presidential press relations as director of the White House Transition Project.
Necessary follow-up questions during Trump's blustering Q&A's are all but impossible. And the absence of regularly scheduled briefings denies reporters the chance to dig deeper into broader aspects of administration policy, forcing the White House to explain its plans and be openly accountable for governing decisions.
The lack of transparency is of a piece with other acts of concealment such as curtailing the release of White House visitor logs, breaking with the norm of releasing tax returns, refusing to make administration officials available for congressional oversight hearings, and denying a government watchdog the necessary metrics for judging the success or failure of the Afghanistan War.
While Trump continues to denigrate the media with his "fake news" mantra, journalists serve a purpose so vital to the Founding Fathers that press freedom was forever enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution.
It's not possible for every American to walk into the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department to ask questions that matter to them. This is why they rely on journalists to do the asking. The least the American people can expect from the Trump administration is to do the answering.

Texto completo: The Portland String Quartet has been celebrating its 50th anniversary this season, and the finale, on Sunday afternoon at Woodfords Congregational Church, presented two clear messages. The first is that, after half a century, the ensemble remains at the top of its game, playing with energy, focus and a sense of purpose. The second is that it is devoted not only to revisiting the great 19th-century scores, but to playing contemporary works and rarities as well.
Two of the players, violist Julia Adams and second violinist Ronald Lantz, have been with the quartet from the start, when it was a side project of the Portland Symphony Orchestra's principal string players. Dean Stein, the first violinist, joined in 2012, and the group's current cellist, Andrew Mark, joined the quartet this year, and seems to be a good fit.
The centerpiece of its program on Sunday was a vivid, virtuosic set of folksong transformations by Florence Price, a fascinating figure who was unknown to many concertgoers only a year ago. But she had some success in her day: When the Chicago Symphony Orchestra gave the premiere of her Symphony No. 1, in 1933, it was the first time the orchestra - or, for that matter, any major orchestra - played the music of an African-American, female composer.
But Price lived in a segregated America, at a time when works by women of any race rarely got as far as her symphony did. After her death, in 1953, she was quickly forgotten, and much of her music was lost until a couple renovating an abandoned house in Illinois found a cache of scores and papers bearing Price's name.
Fortunately, instead of discarding the stacks of music, the couple contacted musicologists at the University of Arkansas, who in turn contacted the Center for Black Music Research in Chicago. The center engaged an editor to put the music into shape and get it published, and this season, Price's music has been turning up all over the country, just as the classical music world is taking a fresh look at the canon and searching for ways to make it more diverse in terms of both race and gender.
Whether every composer and work revived during this period of reconsideration will prove durable, only time will tell. But Price, who studied at the New England Conservatory with George Whitefield Chadwick, is certainly a contender, and her "Five Folksongs in Counterpoint" (1951) proved a knockout on Sunday.
Price did not simply create a set of variations on the folk melodies she chose - "Oh My Darlin' Clementine," "Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes" and "Shortnin' Bread," framed by the spirituals "Calvary" and "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot." Instead, she presented the melodies succinctly at the start of each movement, often in the viola, with other instruments taking them up in different registers and occasionally modulating to different keys as the music unfolded.
But though it was easy to keep track of the tunes, the work's more salient feature was the dense, adventurously chromatic counterpoint with which Price cloaked these themes. Nothing was predictable, and usually, the textures were so busy and changeable that by the time you grasped the direction Price was taking, she was already pushing the music elsewhere.
It would be hard to imagine a more vigorous case for the work than the performance the Portland players presented. The group's pacing and balances, to say nothing of the energy they brought to the set, were illuminating and persuasive enough to make a listener eager to search out more of Price's music.
The excitement of a new discovery sometimes overshadows the more familiar works on a program, but the ensemble seems to have been prepared for that, and took the precaution of digging into Beethoven's Quartet in A major (Op. 18, No. 5) and the Brahms Piano Quintet in F minor (Op. 34) with the same exploratory zeal they brought to the Price.
The Beethoven, composed in 1801, catches the composer nearly at a point of transition. Only three years later, his "Eroica" Symphony would explode the old notions of compositional propriety, but in his Opus 18 quartets, Beethoven is still observing them, for the most part. The performance, carefully phrased and sculpted, captured the niceties of that style (in the shapely Menuetto, for example), but also picked up on Beethoven's nascent iconoclasm in the zesty finale.
Brahms' development was steadier and more gradual, and by the time of his F minor Quintet, he had already found the voice he would refine through the rest of his work. The piano line provides the motivation for much of this work, and pianist Laura Kargul's contribution brought the right balance of precision and power to a performance that tapped fully into the work's supercharged Romanticism.

Texto completo: Last week the New York Times published some of President Trump’s 1980s and 1990s tax return information.
The information detailed President Trump’s financial difficulties during that time. While you would not know it from reading some media reports, this is old news. In fact, President Trump openly discussed his financial difficulties on his popular reality television show.
What should be of great concern is the possibility that the person who leaked the returns — who the paper says has legal access to President Trump’s tax records — is an IRS employee seeking to undermine the president. This would hardly be the first time an IRS employee has leaked confidential information because he disagreed with the taxpayer’s politics. In 2014 the agency had to pay the National Organization for Marriage $50,000 dollars after an IRS employee gave names of the group’s donors to the group’s opponents.
In 2014-2017, my Campaign for Liberty group was repeatedly threatened by the IRS because it refused to give the agency the names of and other information about its top supporters. Fortunately, the IRS rescinded the regulation forcing groups like Campaign for Liberty to violate supporters’ privacy or face legal penalties. However, campaign finance reform legislation that recently passed in the House of Representatives would require the IRS to resume collecting this information, and the New York attorney general is suing the IRS to force the agency to reinstate the regulation.
The right of groups like Campaign for Liberty to protect their supporters’ privacy was upheld by the Supreme Court in NAACP v. Alabama. As Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, “Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.”
Traditionally, presidents have used the IRS to harass their political opponents instead of presidents’ opponents using the IRS against them. Franklin Roosevelt audited people critical of the New Deal and supportive of the America First movement. Lyndon Johnson ordered audits of opponents, and John Kennedy shared tax return information with Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.
During the Obama administration, the IRS targeted groups opposing Obamacare. The agency went after anti-Iraq War groups during the George W. Bush years.
If the Times did obtain Trump’s tax returns information from an IRS employee, that employee is not in the same category as whistleblowers like Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning who exposed government wrongdoing. The leaker or leakers of President Trump’s information are releasing private tax information.
The IRS regularly violates the civil liberties of taxpayers. In fact, the income tax system forcing taxpayers to reveal potentially incriminating information on their tax returns violates the principles of a free society. Americans’ liberty and prosperity will never be secure until Congress repeals two great mistakes of 1913: the income tax and the Federal Reserve.
Dr. Ron Paul is a former member of the House of Representatives. This article was written for and published by the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.

Texto completo: On Thursday, the Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%, and on Monday China retaliated by announcing $60 billion in tariffs on U.S. items. Here are some reactions:
President Donald Trump tweeted that tariffs will make the country stronger and bring "far more" wealth than before. He also offered companies an option on how to avoid the new tariffs.


NPR's Yuki Noguchi wrote that we in the U.S. will feel the cost of the tariffs.

- "The prices of the things we buy, from floor lamps to canoes and bicycles, are slated to go up, literally overnight, as the Trump administration makes good on a promise to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese products."

Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted out his support of the tariffs, saying we need to "accept short term pain for long term gain."


Forbes contributor John Brinkley commented that tariffs always end up hurting the consumers and countries tend to find a way around them to get what they need.

- "Trade sanctions always victimize consumers. And farmers. When other countries react to what they consider unfair trade practices by the United States, they almost always hit back where it hurts — in farm country. Since China imposed a retaliatory tariff of 25 percent on American soybeans, farmers who had been exporting most of their beans to China are now storing them in grain bins, where they’re in danger of spoiling. China has made up for the loss by buying more soybeans from Brazil."

The official GOP twitter account praised Trump for taking action against China's "unfair" trade practices.


Catherine Rampell, a columnist for the Washington Post, said that tariffs hurt the U.S., especially in red counties.

- "Two separate studies by separate teams of all-star economists have found that 100 percent of the tariffs Trump has imposed so far are being passed along to, and paid by, U.S. consumers. One of those studies also found that workers in heavily Republican counties were being hurt the most by Trump’s trade wars, thanks to both the tariffs the president has imposed on our imports and the tit-for-tat retaliation other countries have slapped on our exports."

David French , vice president for government relations for the National Retail Federation, told the New York Times that the U.S. may lose jobs if these tariffs are implemented.

- “A sudden tariff increase with less than a week’s notice would severely disrupt U.S. businesses, especially small companies that have limited resources to mitigate the impact. If the administration follows through on this threat, American consumers will face higher prices and U.S. jobs will be lost.”

In reaction to China's retaliation, Roger Johnson , the president of the National Farmers Union, told the Wall Street Journal this announcement came at a terrible time for U.S. farmers who are already suffering due to this trade war.

- “These retaliatory tariffs from China could not come at a worse time for family farmers and ranchers, who are already coping with depressed commodity prices, environmental disasters, and chronic oversupply.”

Here's what the critics are saying about the latest episode of 'Game of Thrones'

Texto completo: Judging by the Twitter reaction, you're forgiven if you thought the latest episode of “Game of Thrones" would be roundly panned by critics. But writers who have been following the show — particularly those writers who have read George R.R. Martin's books — have a more nuanced take on Sunday night's scorching of King's Landing. Warning, spoilers.
The Boston Globe's Matthew Gilbert
“There were 'touching' moments everywhere in this well-lit battle episode — and I put quotes around that word because, with the final season's hasty pace and sudden personality shifts, only a few of them truly landed. There were pairings from beginning to end, one-on-one confrontations and farewells that had been brewing for much if not all of the series." Read the full review.
The New Yorker's Sarah Larson
“For every minute of Arya stabbing the Night King, or of Tormund Giantsbane sloshing his wine horn around the Merriment Hall, we have a million years of exquisitely wrought character arcs being shattered into ice cubes and forgotten about, recently deflowered and sobbing in a courtyard, unceremoniously flambéd on the shores of Dragonstone, or vanquished by falling rubble." Read the full review.
The Washington Post's Alyssa Rosenberg
“As 'Game of Thrones' rushes to its hasty conclusions, there are plenty of things to quibble over. The show is revealing just how many of George R.R. Martin's plot threads were the most scarlet of red herrings. This inexplicably mad dash to the finish line is forcing characters through wild transitions that would have been allowed to flower more naturally in previous seasons. And some much-hyped encounters between characters couldn't possibly live up to years of breathless Internet speculation. But 'Game of Thrones,' and Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' novels have always been about family. And on that score, the final season, and this episode in particular, are hitting many, many high marks." Read the full review.
Vanity Fair's Joanna Robinson
“A Daenerys heel turn from hero to villain was always going to hurt no matter what, and it makes for bad, gendered optics when coupled with Cersei's terrible leadership and Sansa's austere suspicion of Daenerys's (and her paranoia in return). But could the show have given viewers a bit more warning? Without the benefit of the internal monologue from the books, how could the HBO series have better prepared us for this?" Read the full review.
The New York Times' Jeremy Egner
“But just because the outcome wasn't surprising, that doesn't mean the result wasn't spectacular. While the siege that led up to the King's Landing apocalypse was plagued with some of the same strategic implausibilities and geographical confusion that has been an issue for much of this season, what followed was a terrifically and terrifyingly rendered decimation of a city." Read the full review.
AV Club's Miles McNutt
“The fact that Daenerys Targaryen committed these acts does not betray the arc of her character, but it is the kind of development that requires nuance that the ensemble spectacle of the series just might not be built for, and which the show certainly never achieved." Read the full review.
The Atlantic's Lenika Cruz
“In its rush to deliver a wild reversal—or, if you want to be charitable, subversion —of everything the show had established about Dany's deep-seated goodness and sense of justice, Game of Thrones all but destroyed her character. Where some viewers might see a satisfyingly awful upending of expectations about Dany's supposed goodness, I see an unearned negation of the identity she spent years building for herself." Read the full review.
The Atlantic's Spencer Kornhaber
“With just six episodes this season and seven in the previous, there hasn't been a long enough runway for Dany's murderous departure. Still, the pieces of her decision-making apparatus were all on-screen, even if the show hasn't put them together all that sturdily. Yes, there's her 'Mad Queen' lineage; yes, there is the quite noxious suggestion that she scoured King's Landing out of some emotional jag. More important, though, is the strategic principle that Dany has learned time and again: Fear works." Read the full review.

Texto completo: Each week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.
Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:
Stop me if you've heard this before: The chief executive of a huge tech company with vast stores of user data, and a business built on using it to target ads, now says his priority is privacy.
This time it was Google's Sundar Pichai, at the company's annual conference for developers. "We think privacy is for everyone," he explained on Tuesday. "We want to do more to stay ahead of constantly evolving user expectations." He reiterated the point in a New York Times Op-Ed, and highlighted the need for federal privacy rules.
The previous week, Mark Zuckerberg delivered similar messages at Facebook's developer conference. "The future is private," he said, and Facebook will focus on more intimate communications. He shared the idea in a Washington Post op-ed just weeks before, also highlighting the need for federal privacy rules.
Google went further than Facebook's rough sketch of what this future looks, and unveiled tangible features: It will let users browse YouTube and Google Maps in "incognito mode," will allow auto-deletion of Google history after a specified time and will make it easier to find out what the company knows about you, among other new privacy features.
Fatemeh Khatibloo, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, told The Times: "These are meaningful changes when it comes to the user's expectations of privacy, but I don't think this affects their business at all." Google has to show that privacy is important, but it will still collect data.
What Google and Facebook are trying to do, though, is reshape the privacy narrative. You may think privacy means keeping hold of your data; they want privacy to mean they don't hand data to others. ("Google will never sell any personal information to third parties," Mr. Pichai wrote in his Op-Ed.)
Werner Goertz, a research director at Gartner, said Google had to respond with its own narrative. "It is trying to turn the conversation around and drive public discourse in a way that not only pacifies but also tries to get buy-in from consumers, to align them with its privacy strategy," he said.
Politics of privacy law
Facebook and Google may share a voice on privacy. Lawmakers don't.
Members of the Federal Trade Commission renewed calls at a congressional hearing on Wednesday to regulate big tech companies' stewardship of user data, my colleague Cecilia Kang reported. That was before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, on which "lawmakers of both parties agreed" that such a law was required, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Sounds promising.
But while the F.T.C. was united in asking for more power to police violations and greater authority to impose penalties, there were large internal tensions about how far it should be able to go in punishing companies. And the lawmakers in Congress "appeared divided over key points that legislation might address," according to The Journal. Democrats favor harsh penalties and want to give the F.T.C. greater power; Republicans worry that strict regulation could stifle innovation and hurt smaller companies.
Finding compromise will be difficult, and conflicting views risk becoming noise through which a clear voice from Facebook and Google can cut. The longer disagreement rages, the more likely it is that Silicon Valley defines a mainstream view that could shape rules.
Uber's I.P.O. day
The most hotly anticipated initial public offering of 2019 saw Uber trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.
The company hit the markets valued at $ 82.4 billion, after pricing its shares at $ 45 a share. That was below the $ 100 billion that Uber had forecast to some investors, and far below the $ 120 billion that some bankers suggested. (It was, however, above the $ 76 billion that an August fund-raising round pegged it at.)
Uber's was one of the largest I.P.O.s ever, but its sliding valuation suggests that this darling disrupter has lost some of its charm. That could spell trouble for other unicorns, like Slack and WeWork, that are expected to make I.P.O.s this year.
Uber's concern now: avoiding the fate of its rival, Lyft. Lyft's shares quickly fell after its I.P.O. in March, and on Friday were 29 percent below the offering price.
[Bonus: How today's tech I.P.O.s differ from the dot-com boom's.]
Antitrust in the App Store
Here's a story: Company makes smartphone. Company encourages third parties to build services for smartphone, to encourage adoption. Smartphone sells. Third parties prosper. Smartphone sales plateau. Company decides to build services.
We're living the next chapter, and it's messy.
In March, Spotify filed a complaint with European regulators, accusing Apple of using its App Store to squash rivals of its own services, like Apple Music. A focus: the 30 percent fee that Spotify and others pay for using the Apple's payment system for subscriptions sold via the App Store. (Other app makers have made antitrust complaints about the App Store, too.)
Unidentified sources told The Financial Times that the European Union's competition commission would open an investigation into Spotify's complaint. That would result in a lengthy process that could result in Apple's being fined as much as 10 percent of its global turnover, or forced to change its behavior.
If Apple is found at fault, the correct response is unclear. Pablo Ibáñez Colomo, a professor at the London School of Economics who specializes in competition law, said regulators would struggle to know how far to go. Acting strictly may require the App Store to be micromanaged -- but who polices that? If a response doesn't go that far, what happens about the inevitable flood of complainants wanting their own justice?
A can of worms is set to explode, though it comes with a long fuse.
And some stories you shouldn't miss
■ A Facebook founder wants it broken up. Chris Hughes, who left the company a decade ago, says it is now "a leviathan that crowds out entrepreneurship and restricts consumer choice."
■ Investors don't dig climate start-ups. Venture capitalists want returns within years, and many clean-tech start-ups work to longer timelines, which means they struggle to secure funding.
■ Chinese spies captured the National Security Agency's weapons. They intercepted the tools from an N.S.A. attack on their own computers, "like a gunslinger who grabs an enemy's rifle and starts blasting away," and then used them against ally nations.
■ How will Elizabeth Holmes defend herself? The lawyers for Ms. Holmes, the former Theranos chief executive, look set to take the high-risk strategy of going after the government.
■ Amazon had a rough week. It admitted to having been hit by an "extensive" fraud, got federal discrimination complaints from three Muslim workers and has been accused of violating a child privacy law.
■ Europe's clampdown on Big Tech is proving controversial. Critics are sounding alarms because, as I've argued, it risks limiting free expression and undercutting the ideals of an open web.
■ What do you do when you get rich in San Francisco? For the millennials whom companies like Uber and Lyft have turned into millionaires, the answer is: Move somewhere with lower taxes.
■ Unimpressed by service at the Apple Store? So is its staff. Some of its members told Bloomberg that brand building had become more important than serving shoppers.
■ Don't buy a 5G phone yet. The phones are currently bigger and heavier than their 4G counterparts, and the networks won't really be worth using until 2020 or 2021.

Texto completo: In 2012, when novelist Celeste Ng was feeling pressure to join Twitter, she found that she couldn't use her own name.
"Everyone said, you know, as an author you need to do this," Ng said during a phone conversation from her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "My name had already been taken by someone else whose name doesn't actually appear to be Celeste Ng."
Ng said she's not sure what her name means to that person, but it forced her to pick something else. And, just for fun, she settled on @pronounced_ing.
"No one ever seems to know how I pronounce my name and I figured this would just answer the most frequently asked question," Ng, 38, said. "And actually it works really well. Now people know how to pronounce my name, which is awesome."
She published her first book, "Everything I Never Told You," in 2014, and her second, "Little Fires Everywhere," in 2017. Both were New York Times best sellers, with the latter spending 48 weeks on the list.
Ng is coming to Madison for the annual Lunch for Libraries, a $125-per-ticket fundraiser for the Wisconsin Book Festival Wednesday at Monona Terrace. The event will feature her talking with local author Chloe Benjamin.
May is a particularly busy month for Ng, as she tours with the paperback version of "Little Fires Everywhere," doing 17 events in 15 cities.
"I was looking at my calendar with some apprehension this morning," Ng said in late April. "It's going to be sort of a whirlwind tour of going to a bunch of cities actually that I haven't been to or I didn't get to go to when the book first came out."
Madison is one of those new-to-her cities. "I've only heard really nice things about Madison, actually. Everyone seems to like it."
Ng said she's excited to be talking with Benjamin, who wrote the 2018 novel "The Immortalists" in which four siblings learn the dates of their deaths from a traveling psychic.
"We met each other through our work basically, but we've become friends. So, it's always fun to be in conversation with another writer and especially another writer who you know," Ng said.
Interviewing another author
Ng interviewed Amy Tan, one of her writing role models, last month for the Washington Post.
For the 30th anniversary of Tan's debut novel, "The Joy Luck Club," editors at the Post were interested in having an "up and coming Asian-American writer" talk with Tan, Ng said.
"I grew up reading her work. So she is a hero of mine and it was just an amazing opportunity to get to talk to her and I was incredibly nervous," said Ng, who's never been a reporter.
Without saying whom she was interviewing, Ng poked fun of herself in front of her 108,000 Twitter followers by revealing that she had put on lipstick and perfume to talk by phone with this person.
Ng said the reason she didn't say to whom she was speaking on Twitter was because she didn't want to jinx anything.
"That was actually sort of the first official interview that I had done," Ng said. She was glad the Post editors asked her to make it a conversation. "That's what it ended up turning into. I mean, that's how I think of my role as a writer a lot."
For her writing, Ng said, she asks questions and then listens to people, to find out what they are "explicitly saying, but then also maybe not saying, or talking around. So that was how I tried to imagine myself into the role of a journalist."
One of the main characters in "Little Fires Everywhere" is a suburban newspaper reporter married to a lawyer. Ng's husband is also a lawyer, and Ng said he didn't offer any critique of the two lawyers in her book.
She said she usually doesn't show him her work until it's finished, and, in the interest of marital harmony he generally knows to be positive. The couple have an 8-year-old son.
Ng said her husband was a litigator, and is now working for a nonprofit. "So maybe that led him to be more open minded about it," she said.
Star power
Not only have her books turned up on many "best of lists," "Everything I Never Told You" is being made into a film starring Julia Roberts, and "Little Fires Everywhere" is being turned into a Hulu series with Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington.
Ng said the woman who wrote the movie script did a great job and she's thrilled that Julia Roberts is starring. "I think the question is sort of them putting all the pieces together. I know they're looking for a director and I'm learning about the film industry, that it just involves a lot of moving pieces."
While Ng isn't an official adviser, the filmmakers have welcomed her input. She's glad to give them space and allow them to put their own spin on the story. "That's for me what's fun about an adaptation. I sort of looked for people who I felt had the right vision for the project."
With the "Little Fires Everywhere" series, Ng's one of the producers, so she gets to sit in the writer's room, read all the scripts and give the writers notes. The writers need to take the material in the book and build on it to fill all the hours of a TV series. So far, they've done an amazing job, she said.
The series could start filming in the next couple of months and will begin airing late this year or early next year, Ng said.
?Little Fires Everywhere'
"Little Fires Everywhere" tells the story of the six-member, seemingly perfect Richardson family in Shaker Heights, Ohio, a rich Cleveland suburb. The family's life gets upended after a free-spirited mother and her teenage daughter come to town and move into their rental property.
Central to the plot is a custody battle that ensues after a Chinese mother tries to get custody of the baby she's abandoned. Meanwhile, friends of the Richardsons have taken the baby in with plans to adopt her.
Ng said she's not sure where the original idea came from, but she knew she was interested in the question of what it meant to be a mother and of transracial adoption and of adoption in general.
"Just sort of all of the complicated gains and losses that can happen in that kind of situation," she said.
Once she settled on the adoption storyline, she did some research into major contested adoption cases and borrowed from two of them.
One was "Baby M," which, in 1987, became the first American court ruling on the validity of surrogacy. A surrogate mother had given up the child to the father and his wife, and then decided she wanted to keep the infant. The father was awarded custody, with the surrogate getting visitation rights.
The other case was "Baby Jessica" from the early 1990s, in which a baby had been given up for adoption by a poor single mother. Then, the biological father, initially kept in the dark about the baby's paternity, came back in the picture and, with the birth mother, tried to get the baby back days after her birth. The adoptive couple fought to keep the child for more than 2 years, but ultimately lost.
"It was really a question of affluence," Ng said. "The baby had been given to a very affluent adoptive family and the mother and the biological father were very poor. They were working class, and public sentiment was really heavily on the side of the adoptive parents, the wealthy couple."
?Science nerd'
In her Twitter bio Ng describes herself as a "science nerd" and "embarrassingly sincere." She said she comes by the science nerd part pretty honestly through both of her parents. Her late father was a physicist at NASA and her mom was a chemist until she retired.
She said she grew up with a real interest in science and still thinks like a scientist. The embarrassingly sincere part "is something that I'm finally sort of just owning for myself, which is that I am just very earnest."
Ng said she shows so much enthusiasm about life that when people meet her they sometimes say, "Oh, you're so nice."
"I kind of want to know what they expected," she said, laughing. "But, I always take that as a compliment."

Will: 'Heartbeat bills' are wholesome provocations in abortion debate

Texto completo: Six states have passed "heartbeat bills" to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, approximately six weeks after conception. Such bills are, indeed, unconstitutional given the court's Roe ukase that abortion cannot be restricted before a fetus is viable outside the womb - which means, presumably, before the fetus is a child.
But why should "viability" be the dispositive criterion? Viable means capable of surviving outside the womb, which no infant can do without constant help that others must give. Must. No infants are "viable" in that all are helpless, and the law requires that help be given by those responsible for the infant.
A New York Times editorial opposing the idea that "a fetus in the womb has the same rights as a fully formed person" spoke of these living fetuses - that they are living is an elementary biological fact, not an abstruse theological deduction - as "clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings."
Now, delete the obfuscating and constitutionally irrelevant adjective "viable," and look at a sonogram of a ten-week fetus. Note the eyes and lips, the moving fingers and, yes, the beating heart. Is this most suitably described as a "cluster of cells" or as a baby? The cluster-of-cells contingent resembles Chico Marx in the movie "Duck Soup": "Who ya gonna believe, me or your own eyes?"
The "heartbeat bills" are wholesome provocations: One of their aims is to provoke thinking about the moral dimension of extinguishing a being with a visibly beating heart. Furthermore, pro-life people are being provoked in different ways.
Last month, Kansas' Supreme Court found in this from the state constitution - "All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" - a reason to overturn the state's ban on D&E (dilation-and-evacuation) abortions that involve dismemberment of the living fetus.
In February, after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order to enforce taxpayer-funded abortions, Democratic legislators decided that not even that was enough. They introduced a bill to create a right to abortion for any reason at any point in a pregnancy, a bill similar to legislation enacted or advancing in other Democratic-controlled states.
In February, all but three Democratic U.S. senators opposed, thereby killing, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse's Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that would have required, in the rare cases in which a child survives a botched abortion procedure, that the survivor receive the standard professional care that would be given to any child born alive at the same gestational age.
The 1850s debates that propelled Abraham Lincoln to greatness concerned not whether slavery should be abolished forthwith, which was neither a constitutional nor political possibility. Rather, the debates concerned two other questions: Would national policy stigmatize slavery as a tragic legacy and a moral wrong? And: Would policy confine slavery to its existing dominion by banning it from the territories, thereby, Lincoln thought, putting it on a path to ultimate extinction?
Temperate pro-life advocates, practicing Lincolnian prudence, consider the abortion debate akin to the slavery debates for three reasons: Abortion shrinks the scope of the concept of personhood. The issue has been inflamed by judicial fiat (Roe v. Wade as Dred Scott v. Sandford). And confining a morally objectionable practice is a worthy, albeit not fully satisfying, objective.
The changed composition of the Supreme Court, and the supposed imminent danger that Roe will be overturned, is the excuse that pro-abortion extremists have seized upon to do what they want to do anyway: to normalize extreme abortion practices expressive of the belief that never does fetal life have more moral significance than a tumor in a mother's stomach. (Most European nations restrict abortions by at least week 13. France and Germany are very restrictive after 12, Sweden after 18.)
The court's new composition has encouraged some pro-life advocates in their maximum hope, that Roe can be overturned, which would not proscribe abortion but would restore its pre-1973 status as a practice states can regulate. This is not a foreseeable possibility; a more nuanced abortion regime is.

Remembering a modern prophet

Texto completo: When Christian author Rachel Held Evans died unexpectedly last week from brain swelling, it set off a wave of lament online. After the announcement of her passing, the hashtag #becauseofRHE trended globally on Twitter as people retold stories of how Evans and her work had impacted their lives. A GoFundMe campaign launched to help cover her family's medical expenses set a goal of $70,000. It has raised more than $200,000.
The widespread outpouring of grief is a testament to the reach of her words, but it also raises questions about why Evans' passing has struck such a nerve. At a mere 37 years old, her entire career began only in the early 2000s. But the reason that a writer as young as Evans mattered to so many is that, religiously speaking, she was not just a writer. Evans was a prophet with a pen.
In the most formative moments of both Jewish and Christian history, prophets play critical roles in birthing faith's future. They often emerge in the midst of oppressive situations, when religious leaders have been co-opted by earthly rulers and politicians. In such times, prophets appear from within the religious community to critique it and call it into a new reality.
As Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann says, "Prophets are people who, because of their roots in the theological tradition and because of some emancipatory experience in their own life, refuse to accept the definitions of reality that are imposed upon us by the socioeconomic political power structure."
Evans: A writer by the church door Evans was raised as an evangelical Christian in the South and experienced the many affectations that come with such an upbringing. She sprouted from the soil of the blogosphere in 2008, when the tectonic plates of traditional Christianity in America were shifting. Yet it was her 2010 memoir, "Faith Unraveled," that gained her a broad hearing among Christians. The book recounted her struggles with the fundamentalism of her childhood and charted out her adult quest to make peace with doubt, science and other religious boogeymen. Evans' "emancipatory experience" and religious roots resonated with the disillusioned masses with similar stories. She made disillusioned believers feel less alone.
I've referred to Evans as a writer who sat by the church door. For those just beginning to explore Christianity, her work greeted you with a reminder that not every Christian resembles the caricatures so often encountered in the news media and entertainment. If you were a believer who was ready to call it quits and walk away from it all, her work beckoned you to stay and reimagine the faith alongside of her.
As Evans matured, her voice grew louder and her opinions became more pointed. Like the prophets of old, her ire was often aimed at the religious aristocracy and political powerbrokers whom she perceived to be agents of injustice and marginalization. Evans spoke out against Christians who ignored the rise of white supremacy, decried pastors who propped up Donald Trump after he was revealed to be a sex abuser, and championed the full inclusion of LGBTQ Christians in the life of the church. Untethered from any institution with power to censure her, Evans was free to say what other Christians were thinking but felt too afraid to say aloud. Over time, she sparked courage in others to add their voice to hers.
Evans used her life to show the truth "The folks you're shutting out of the church today will be leading it tomorrow. That's how the Spirit works," she once declared. "The future's in the margins."
One of the notable characteristics of prophets in the Jewish Scriptures is their desire to dramatize the truth rather than just preach it. To illustrate God's coming judgment in their day, Jeremiah smashed a jar and Isaiah wandered naked for three years. Ezekiel ate a scroll to remind people that God's word is inside our bodies rather than just on the page. It's not that surprising then that in 2011, Evans took a vow to obey all of the Bible's instructions for women literally for 12 months. She made her own clothes, stayed silent in church, awoke before dawn, covered her head, and camped out in her front yard while menstruating.
Her experience during this period was cataloged in her New York Times best-selling book, "A Year of Biblical Womanhood," and it exposed the weaknesses and inconsistencies of conservative Christian views of womanhood and sparked a wide conversation about how to read the Bible's teachings on gender.
Evans eventually left evangelicalism altogether and became an Episcopalian, but she refused to leave Christianity.
Instead, she reimagined what a life of faith could look like. She penned a book rethinking how to relate to the church and another reimagining how to read the Bible.
From her new perch in mainline Protestantism where she wrote, Evans regularly critiqued conservative Christian leaders and exclusionary churches. Indeed, critiquing a community from within its walls is an earmark of prophets. Her opponents came to fear her razor wit, but Evans claimed that her critiques were born out of her desire to see Christianity become a more positive presence in the world.
The prophet has penned final words Of course, when someone dies in the prime of their life, the temptation is to lionize them like Elvis. But Evans was far from perfect, and she'd be the first to tell you that. In her infamous social media spats, her passion sometimes seemed to get the best of her.
On more than one occasion, she was forced to issue an apology online for something she said or the way she spoke it. Of course, this willingness to admit her own fallibility only made her more endearing to her followers.
I knew her first as a colleague, and I admired the way her words sparked like struck flint off pages and screens. To spiritual seekers wandering in the dark cave of doubt, Evans wrote as a torchbearer to be trusted. To Christian leaders intoxicated by power and complicit in injustice, she was an arsonist to be feared.
She and I did not always agree, and we had a disagreement or two online. Yet we guarded our friendship first, and I never questioned her love for the faith we shared.
As the Catholic mystic Richard Rohr says, "The dualistic mind presumes that if you criticize something, you don't love it. Wise people like the prophets would say the opposite."
In a time of resurgent bigotry and hatred during which many Christians seem content to side with the oppressors over the oppressed, we need Rachel Held Evans more than ever. But she is gone, never to return. The prophet has penned her final words. For more than a decade, she spoke truth to power, never seeking to establish a legacy or ensure that she would be remembered.
Maybe that's why she is so impossible to forget.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Facing withering attacks accusing him of seeking foreign assistance for President Trump's re-election campaign, Rudolph W. Giuliani announced on Friday night that he had canceled a trip to Kiev in which he planned to push the incoming Ukrainian government to press ahead with investigations that he hoped would benefit Mr. Trump.
Mr. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, explained that he felt as if he was being "set up" by Ukrainians critical of his efforts, and he blamed Democrats for trying to "spin" the trip.
"They say I was meddling in the election -- ridiculous -- but that's their spin," he said.
Mr. Giuliani said on Thursday that he had hoped to meet in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, with the nation's president-elect and urge him to pursue inquiries that could yield new information about two matters of intense interest to Mr. Trump. One is the origin of the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The other is the involvement of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s son in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.
The trip raised the specter of a lawyer for Mr. Trump pressing a foreign government to pursue investigations that his allies hope could help him win re-election. And it comes after Mr. Trump has spent more than half of his term facing scrutiny about whether his 2016 campaign conspired with Ukraine's hostile neighbor, Russia. Mr. Giuliani had planned to leave on Sunday.
Mr. Trump has suggested he would like Attorney General William P. Barr to look into the material gathered by the Ukrainian prosecutors. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump intimated he was considering speaking to Mr. Barr about the overlap between Mr. Biden's diplomacy in Ukraine and his son's involvement with the gas company.
"Certainly it would be an appropriate thing to speak to him about, but I have not done that as of yet," Mr. Trump told Politico in an interview. He suggested that he intended to speak to Mr. Giuliani about the matter before the planned trip to Kiev.
After The New York Times published a report about the trip on Thursday, Democrats assailed Mr. Giuliani, accusing him of activity evoking that at the center of the recently concluded special counsel's investigation.
"Today, Giuliani admitted to seeking political help from a foreign power. Again," tweeted Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He called the plan "immoral, unethical, unpatriotic and, now, standard procedure."
Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter to the panel's Republican chairman asking for an investigation of Mr. Giuliani's activities. Mr. Giuliani's engagement with the Ukrainians amounted to "private foreign policy engagement," Mr. Murphy wrote, adding, "I am deeply concerned about the implications of this for United States foreign policy."
On Friday night, Mr. Giuliani rejected that characterization, asserting in a brief interview, "My only purpose was to make sure the investigation continued."
The change of plans came as advisers were urging the incoming Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian and political newcomer, not to meet with Mr. Giuliani, according to a person familiar with the conversations.
Mr. Giuliani had requested the meeting with Mr. Zelensky through intermediaries, but it had not been confirmed.
Mr. Giuliani's foray into Ukrainian politics comes at a delicate moment for the country, which is deeply reliant on the United States for financial and military aid. The current Ukrainian government has sought to distance itself from matters related to the special counsel's investigation.
Mr. Zelensky is set to take office on June 3.
The investigations had been opened by Ukrainian prosecutors during the term of the country's current president, Petro O. Poroshenko. He lost his re-election bid last month to Mr. Zelensky, who has said that he would like to replace the country's top prosecutor, who oversaw some of the matters.
Mr. Giuliani and other Trump allies had been working behind the scenes with the prosecutor to gather information about the investigations.
Mr. Giuliani said he feared he would have been "walking into a trap" had the meeting with Mr. Zelensky occurred. He predicted that it would have been misrepresented by advisers of Mr. Zelensky who have criticized the top prosecutor, singling out a member of Ukraine's Parliament, Serhiy A. Leshchenko, who has advised the incoming president.
Late last year, an administrative court in Ukraine faulted Mr. Leshchenko for calling attention in 2016 to documents related to earlier work in Ukraine by Mr. Trump's campaign chairman at the time, Paul Manafort. The documents, which were released by a Ukrainian law enforcement agency and first published in The New York Times, led to the resignation from the campaign of Mr. Manafort, who has since pleaded guilty to charges brought by the special counsel related to his work in Ukraine, and is serving a seven-and-a-half-year prison sentence. Mr. Giuliani has called for additional inquiry into Mr. Leshchenko's scrutiny of Mr. Manafort.
Mr. Leshchenko, who is appealing the Ukrainian administrative court's finding faulting him, said in an interview on Saturday that the case against him related to the Manafort documents was politically motivated, and not supported by the law. He said he did not advise Mr. Zelensky to skip the meeting with Mr. Giuliani. But he also said that Mr. Giuliani had been "misinformed" by the Ukrainian prosecutor, whom Mr. Leshchenko accused of being "corrupt."
Mr. Giuliani said the requested meeting with Mr. Zelensky was a recent addition to a previously planned trip to Kiev to deliver a paid speech about Middle East policy to a Jewish group.
On Friday, Mr. Giuliani said that group "felt overlooked" by all of the scrutiny on his efforts to try to advance Mr. Trump's interests in Ukraine. He said they would reschedule his speech for the fall.

Texto completo: Headnote Race and Politics
A few years ago I had a conversation with a young female political activist from Bogota, Colombia who had risked her life revealing the corruption and systemic use violence in her native country.
Her harrowing story resonated with me deeply, and not just because I am a native son of one of the most violent cities in the world.
Her story also sparked something in me because more than a decade earlier (I believe it was 1991) I wrote and performed a monologue for an avant garde play at Maryland Art Place, which focused on political corruption, genocide and general mayhem in Latin America.
For my part, I briefly examined the brutal regime of Augusto Pinochet, the diabolical dictator of Chile from 1973 to 1990.
The point is I had a peripheral understanding of ubiquitous violence wielded by dictatorial regimes in many Latin American countries in the 20th century, prior to my encounter with my colleague from Bogota. But, her message to me was clear; violence is not unique to Baltimore or the United States, violence is a phenomena gripping much of the Western Hemisphere.
A harrowing and magnificently crafted report in the New York Times this past weekend really brought that fact back to full rememberance forme.
The story titled, '"Either They Kill Us or We Kill Them,'" reminded me instantly of a recurring narrative many of our young men in Baltimore live and tragically die by. The story generally goes like this: one young man hears another young man is coming to get him, for reasons contrived or real. The plot to attack may or may not be true. Yet, the threat, real or imagined is enough for most terrified young men who dwell in the hollowed out, blighted neighborhoods of East and West Baltimore to adopt the mantra, "I'm gonna get him before he gets me." Fear and lack is palpable in many of our neighborhoods, just like the barrios of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, Los Cabos, Mexico and San Salvador, El Salvador.
Although Baltimore has endured more than 300 homicides a year for four years in a row, the plague of murder in our city is dwarfed by several towns and cities in Latin America and the Caribbean.
According to the Times reporting, most of the world's most dangerous cities are in Latin America. Specifically, the Times reports there have been 2.5 million homicides in Latin America and the Caribbean since 2000. "The region accounts for just 8 percent of the global population, yet 38 percent of the world's murders. It has 17 of the 20 deadliest nations on earth," according to the Times.
In the 21st century, more Black and Brown young men throughout the Western Hemisphere probably have more in common because they are forced to grapple on a daily basis with the specter and reality of violence, instead of a common love of baseball, or basketball, or soccer. And of course that all encompassing violence thrives upon a foundation of poverty, inadequate education and governmental corruption in cities like Baltimore, Chicago, San Salvador and Tijuana.
In the Times story, a young man they call "Reinaldo," 22, who belongs to the Honduran neighborhood gang, "Casa Blanca," succinctly sums up his perilous plight.
"Lots of people ask me why we're fighting for this little plot of land," he said. "I tell them I'm not fighting for this territory. I'm fighting for my life."
Far too many of our young men and a growing number of young women in Park Heights and Edmondson Village and Belair-Edison and Middle East and Sandtown-Winchester share Reinaldo's reality in Honduras. They aren't fighting over dilapidated strips of Baltimore turf, they are fighting for their lives.

U.S. pushes for way to enforce China trade deal

Texto completo: U.S. pushes for way to enforce China trade deal
WASHINGTON — In trying to hammer out a trade agreement with China, the Trump administration may be drawing inspiration from classic rock, specifically The Who’s anthem “Won’t Get Fooled Again.”
Fed up with China for breaking past promises, the administration is insisting on provisions designed to force the Chinese to live up to any commitments they make in trade talks that entered an 11th round on Thursday.
In fact, top U.S. trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this week accused the Chinese of already reneging on concessions they’d made earlier in the negotiations.
In retaliation for that alleged backsliding, the United States is poised to dramatically escalate the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies at 12:01 a.m. Friday Eastern time — by raising import taxes on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10% to 25%.
And President Donald Trump said he’s preparing to slap 25% tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese imports, covering everything China ships to the United States.
Juul’s ‘switch’ campaign for smokers draws scrutiny
WASHINGTON — The young models and the candy-colored graphics that helped propel Juul to the top of the e-cigarette market are gone. In their place are people like Carolyn, a 54-year-old former smoker featured in new TV commercials touting Juul as an alternative for middle-age smokers.
“I don’t think anyone including myself thought that I could make the switch,” Carolyn says, sitting in a suburban living room as piano music quietly plays in the background.
The tagline: “Make the switch.”
Under intense scrutiny amid a wave of underage vaping, Juul is pushing into television with a multimillion-dollar campaign rebranding itself as a stop-smoking aid for adults trying to kick cigarettes. But the strategy is raising concerns from anti-smoking experts and activists who say the company is making unproven claims for its product.
On Thursday, six anti-tobacco and health groups called on the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates e-cigarettes, to investigate Juul’s marketing efforts across TV, radio and other formats.
Nike’s plan for better-fitting kicks: Show your feet
NEW YORK — Nike wants to meet your feet.
The sneaker seller will add a foot-scanning tool on its app this summer that will measure the length, width and other dimensions of customers’ feet after they point a smartphone camera to their toes. The app will then tell shoppers what size to buy each of its shoes in, which Nike hopes will get you in the right fit and cut down on costly returns as it seeks to sell more of its goods through its websites and apps.
But Nike will also get something it has never had before: a flood of data on the feet of regular people, a potential goldmine for the shoe maker, which says it will use the information to improve the design of its shoes. Nike mainly relies on the feet of star athletes to build its kicks.
“Nikes will become better and better fitting shoes for you and everyone else,” says Michael Martin, who oversees Nike’s websites and apps.
Nike won’t sell or share the data to other companies, Martin says. And he says shoppers don’t have to save the foot scans to their Nike accounts. But if they do, they’ll only have to scan their feet once and Nike’s apps, websites and stores will know your dimensions every time you need to buy sneakers. Workers at Nike stores will also be equipped with iPods to do the scanning, replacing those metal sizing contraptions.
Uber shifts into lower gear, prices IPO at $45
SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is about to embark on a wild ride on Wall Street with the biggest and most hotly debated IPO in years.
The world’s leading ride-hailing service set the stage for its long-awaited arrival on the stock market by pricing its initial public offering at $45 per share late Thursday.
The price is at the lower end of its targeted range of $44 to $50 per share, a decision that may have been driven by the escalating doubts about the ability of ride-hailing services to make money since Uber’s main rival, Lyft, went public six weeks ago.
Even at the tamped-down price, Uber now has a market value of $82.4 billion — significantly more than century-old automakers General Motors and Ford Motor.
Uber will face its next test Friday when its shares begin trading the New York Stock Exchange.
Facebook co-founder: Time to break up company
Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes says it’s time to break up the social media behemoth.
In a New York Times opinion piece published on Thursday, Hughes said CEO Mark Zuckerberg has turned Facebook into an innovation-suffocating monopoly.
Hughes called Zuckerberg’s power “unprecedented and un-American” and said his co-founder’s focus on growth “led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks.”
Hughes roomed with Zuckerberg at Harvard and left Facebook in 2007 to campaign for Barack Obama. Hughes said he no longer has any ownership in Facebook or any other social media company.
“I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,” he wrote, lamenting the company’s “slow response to Russian agents, violent rhetoric and fake news.”
Trump calls for end to ‘surprise medical bills’ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Thursday called for an end to “surprise medical bills,” the astonishingly high charges insured patients can face when a member of a medical team that treats them is not in their insurer’s network.
“Not a pleasant surprise,” Trump said of bills that arrive in the mail and run to tens of thousands of dollars. “A very unpleasant surprise.”
The administration threw its support behind efforts by lawmakers of both parties to address the problem, laying out a set of goals for legislation.
With polls showing that voters trust Democrats over Republicans on health care, Trump has been hitting pocket-book medical issues that resonate with the middle-class, like prescription drug costs. He was joined at a White House event by patients, one who got a $110,000 bill after a heart attack, and another who got a bill for $17,850 for a test her insurer would have paid $100 for.
More states call porn a public health crisis
PHOENIX — More than a dozen states have moved to declare pornography a public health crisis, raising concerns among some experts who say the label goes too far and carries its own risks.
The Arizona Senate approved a resolution this week calling for a systemic effort to prevent exposure to porn that’s increasingly accessible to younger kids online. At least one legislative chamber has adopted a similar resolution in 15 other states.
“It is an epidemic in our society, and this makes a statement that we have a problem,” said Arizona Sen. Sylvia Allen, a Republican who blamed pornography for contributing to violence against women, sexual activity among teens and unintended pregnancies.
The resolution that passed Monday doesn’t ban pornography or create any other legal changes, but it could signal future action. Similar declarations have been passed in GOP-controlled states ranging from Tennessee to Montana and been adopted in the Republican Party’s national platform.
Many of the resolutions are based on a model written by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an anti-porn group that cites research linking it to a range of problems and argues that it’s become too ubiquitous for individuals to combat alone.
But others say the public-crisis label is a misguided approach.

Rudy Giuliani cancels Ukraine trip

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani announced Friday evening that his trip to Ukraine is off.
During an interview on Fox News, the Trump lawyer said he made the call to cancel the trip, which raised concerns about 2020 election meddling, due to what he claimed was a set-up.
"I will get out of it — in order to remove any political suggestion I will step back and I'll just watch it unfold," he said.
"No trip because I believe I was walking into a bunch of people, one of whom was already found to be involved on this, and I think this was a set up. The whole thing, by the way, is a set up. From the very beginning," Giuliani added.
On Thursday it was revealed Giuliani planned to travel to Ukraine soon to encourage the incoming government to push forward with investigations that “will benefit” President Trump.
Speaking to the New York Times, Giuliani said he planned to visit Kiev and meet with president-elect Volodymyr Zelensky to ask that Ukraine pursue investigations into two matters: the origin of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the involvement of Joe Biden’s son in an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. Last week Giuliani called for Biden to be investigated for a trip he made in 2016 when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not dismiss Viktor Shokin, the country’s then-prosecutor general. Biden’s son, Hunter, stood to gain financially from having Shokin removed.
Although Giuliani stressed that he did not intend to meddle in a campaign — Biden is now a 2020 candidate — Democrats raised concerns.
"Today, Giuliani admitted to seeking political help from a foreign power. Again. His defense: 'We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation ... Somebody could say it’s improper.' Yes. It is. Immoral, unethical, unpatriotic and, now, standard procedure," tweeted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., went so far as to call for a Senate investigation.
Giuliani would not dismiss the possibility of getting involved in the Ukraine matter in the future.
"I don't know, I will play it by ear. I will see what is going on. I am actually quite confident that the facts with regard to former vice president Joe Biden are so compelling there is no way he gets from here to the election without this being investigated," he said.
Trump mentioned to Politico that he was "curious" to hear from Giuliani about the trip. “Certainly it would be an appropriate thing to speak to" Attorney General William Barr about it, Trump said in an interview that was published before Giuliani backed out of the excursion. "It could be a very big situation."
Trump's 2016 campaign was the subject of a years-long investigation of Russian interference that wrapped up this year. Special counsel Robert Mueller was unable to turn up sufficient evidence to show criminal conspiracy between the Trump camp and the Kremlin.

Texto completo: What if Buck Showalter had never agreed to become the first manager of the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks? What if he instead chose to return to the New York Yankees?
As explained by New York Times reporter Bill Pennington in his recent book titled "Chumps to Champs: How the Worst Teams in Yankees History Led to the 90s Dynasty," Showalter was visited by former Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and offered the New York managerial job just hours after agreeing to join the Diamondbacks in 1995.
Pennington explains that, just days after replacing Showalter with Joe Torre, Steinbrenner flew to Pensacola, Fla. to meet Showalter and his wife, Angela, at their home. Showalter, however, would be late to the meeting; he was flying back from Phoenix after shaking hands with Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo.
Steinbrenner apparently offered the job back to Showalter after what Pennington writes was a public outrage over Showalter's exit on Halloween night in 1995. But Showalter stuck to his handshake with Colangelo, turned down Steinbrenner and managed the Diamondbacks through the 2000 season.
"The play-by-play of what really went down that day hasn't really been reported before," Pennington said when reached by phone Thursday. "The idea of starting something from scratch in (Arizona) was really appealing to (Buck)."
Showalter, by that point in his baseball life, had essentially been a Yankees lifer.
After never reaching Yankee Stadium as a player and fourth-round draft pick, Showalter instead worked his way up the managerial ranks starting in 1985 until he joined the MLB staff in 1990, eventually being named manager in 1992.
As Pennington illustrates, the decision by Showalter to turn down Steinbrenner was not an easy one for Showalter to make. And it was not a decision Steinbrenner took well.
"He had a little giddy-up – he thought he was going to get Buck back," Angela told Pennington of Steinbrenner. "But I knew Buck had been impressed by his trip to Arizona and by what he had heard there because he had been calling me to talk about it."
After Steinbrenner implored Showalter to return, Pennington says that Showalter had a 10-minute meeting with his agent, Jim Krivacs, and eventually emerged to deliver the bad news to Steinbrenner, who on a whim had travelled down the east coast to make amends.
"He couldn't understand what the big deal was – he didn't understand why there was anything to stop me," Showalter told Pennington.
Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo remembers playing in the Yankees organization during that time and recalled Showalter's extraordinary attention to detail.
"There were a couple of times where he asked me if I had changed my uniform, and why I changed it," Lovullo said.
Lovullo, who was mostly stationed in Triple-A during his tenure with the Yankees, explained that he was wearing an extra layer of garment under his pants due to some irritation. The change did not get past Showalter.
"He asked me, 'Hey, your pants look a little bigger today.' And I'm like, 'How does he know?' There was definitely a change in my uniform for a personal reason and he noticed it. When he noticed it, it kind of blew me away and made me feel good that he was paying attention and that focused on something."
What happened after Showalter left is history. Many of the players indoctrinated by Showalter and Yankees General Manager Gene Michael – Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Mariano Rivera and others – went on to lead the Yankees to three of the next four World Series titles.
Meanwhile, Showalter was starting from scratch in Arizona and led the team to its first NL West title in its second season in 1999. But the Diamondbacks moved on from Showalter prior to the 2001 season, which eventually led Showalter to watching the Yankees and Diamondbacks – two clubs he had helped build – battle it out for a world championship with Showalter worked as an analyst for ESPN.
Lovullo remembers how the Yankees struggled in the early 90s and how Showalter helped them rebuild into a dynasty.
"The pieces that were missing during the years I was (with the Yankees) were pieces he quickly put back in place," Lovullo said. "That was one of his gifts. He had that (in Arizona) from ground zero. He built it with some of the young players as well as veterans who were brought in.
"He deserves a lot of credit for what was built in two places where he didn't win world championships."
Buck Showalter was the Diamondbacks' first manager, going 250-236 from 1998-2000.

Chevron drops bid for Anadarko Petroleum in face of Occidental offer
The energy giant Chevron on Thursday dropped its bid for Anadarko Petroleum, ending the industry's fiercest takeover battle in at least 15 years and leaving Occidental Petroleum, a much smaller rival, poised to become the dominant force in the largest oil field in the United States. Chevron's decision to abandon its $33 billion offer for Anadarko and instead walk away with a $1 billion breakup fee came less than a month after the two companies reached a deal. The agreement was upended when Occidental stepped in a short time later and offered to acquire Anadarko for $38 billion, most of it cash. Its bid was fortified with a commitment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to invest $10 billion in the company. By acquiring Anadarko, Occidental will almost double in size and gain a significant foothold in the Permian Basin, which straddles West Texas and New Mexico and has been the principal driver of the shale-oil revolution that has made the United States a major oil exporter over the past three years. Occidental would also become a major producer in the Gulf of Mexico offshore field. — NEW YORK TIMES
SOCIAL MEDIA
Facebook cofounder says company should be broken up
Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes says it's time to break up the social media behemoth. In a New York Times opinion piece published Thursday, Hughes said CEO Mark Zuckerberg has turned Facebook into an innovation-suffocating monopoly. Hughes called Zuckerberg's power "unprecedented and un-American" and said his cofounder's focus on growth "led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks." Hughes roomed with Zuckerberg at Harvard and left Facebook in 2007 to campaign for Barack Obama. Hughes said he no longer has any ownership in Facebook or any other social media company. "I feel a sense of anger and responsibility," he wrote, lamenting the company's "slow response to Russian agents, violent rhetoric and fake news." — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Fox Sports to include betting predictions in broadcasts
Fox Sports viewers tuning in to some broadcasts this fall will not only see the game, but also will get betting predictions. The network announced a partnership Wednesday night with the parent company of the PokerStars online gambling giant. Fox Sports is buying just under 5 percent of Stars Group for about $236 million. Both companies will offer real-money­ sports betting this fall in states where it is legal and they are licensed. Stars Group says it has market access through licensing in 13 states, and is seeking licensing in others. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
SHAVING
Harry's sold to Schick for $1.36 billion
Harry's, the upstart shaving company, is being acquired by the owner of Schick razors for $1.37 billion. Harry's has bedeviled brands like Schick and Gillette for years using innovative subscription plans and sleek packaging. Under the agreement announced Thursday, investors in Harry's Inc. will take a stake of about 11 percent of Edgewell Personal Care Co., which manages Schick and other brands. Edgewell gets the Harry's brand and access to the company's prized direct-to-consumer marketing base. The Harry's brand steps on to a much larger stage, a global one, and will be marketed through Edgewell's enormous distribution channels. The company has a footprint in 50 markets. Outside of the United States, Edgewell has operations in Canada, Mexico, Germany, Japan, and Australia. Edgewell also owns the brands Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic and Wet Ones wipes. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
STREAMING MEDIA
Netflix acquires StoryBots in a challenge to Disney
Netflix Inc. acquired the StoryBots children's media brand as the world's largest streaming service prepares to challenge rival Walt Disney Co.'s kid-friendly online platform scheduled to start in November. Under the deal, StoryBots creators Gregg and Evan Spiridellis will produce more original content including series and short-form specials, Netflix said Thursday, without disclosing terms. Buying StoryBots and expanding its programming may help Netflix draw more children and parents, a battleground market as family-focused Disney plans to start offering movies and shows from its Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars franchises online later this year. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
SNEAKERS
Nike to launch foot measuring app this summer
Nike wants to meet your feet. The sneaker seller will launch a foot-scanning tool on its app this summer that will measure and remember the length, width, and other dimensions of customers' feet after they point a smartphone camera to their toes. The app will then tell shoppers what size to buy each of its shoes in, which Nike hopes will cut down on costly online returns as it seeks to sell more of its goods through its websites and apps. But Nike will also get something it has never had before: a flood of data on the feet of regular people, a potential gold mine for the shoe maker, which says it will use the information to improve the design of its shoes. Nike mainly relies on the feet of star athletes to build its kicks. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MORTGAGES
Rates fall for a second week
Long-term mortgage rates declined this week for a second straight week, reversing the upward trend in April as a lure to potential home buyers. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage fell to 4.10 percent from 4.14 percent last week. By contrast, a year ago the benchmark rate stood at 4.55 percent. The average rate for 15-year, fixed-rate home loans eased this week to 3.57 percent from 3.60 percent last week. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
INVESTMENTS
Fidelity 401(k) accounts soar in the past decade
Investors who've had 401(k) accounts at Fidelity for a decade saw their average balance increase sixfold to almost $300,000 since the market bottomed after the global financial crisis, the company said. Workers saving for retirement saw their 401(k) balances crater in the 2008-to-2009 market meltdown. Ten years ago, in the first quarter of 2009, investors had an average account balance of $52,600, according to a report Thursday by the Boston-based firm. In March of that year, the S&P 500 index hit a low. It has more than quadrupled in value since. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
CREDIT CARDS
Ocasio-Ortez, Sanders want credit card interest rates capped at 15%
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accused banks of acting as “modern-day loan sharks" and called on Congress to enact a federal limit of 15 percent on credit card interest rates. The two self-identified democratic-socialists proposed legislation on Thursday capping rates on credit card and other consumer loans and letting post offices offer low-cost basic financial services, such as checking and savings accounts and loans. An outline of the plan released ahead of their formal announcement sharply criticized banks for charging an average 17.17 percent interest on credit card balances while they are able to borrow money at less than 2.5 percent. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump said Thursday that he would leave it up to Attorney General William Barr to decide whether Robert Mueller, the special counsel, may testify before Congress on the Russia investigation.
His comments were a seeming reversal, since Trump wrote over the weekend on Twitter that Mueller should not be allowed to appear before Congress. Barr has told lawmakers that he has no objection to letting Mueller talk to them.
Trump's comments came in a surprise, 45-minute news conference in the Roosevelt Room, his first since the release of the special counsel's report.
New York Times
Coauthor says Trump memoir should be fiction
Decorated in eye-catching gold lettering, President Trump's 1987 memoir — a self-described "common sense guide to personal finance" — is touted as "a firsthand account of the rise of America's foremost deal-maker."
But following news this week that Trump reported more than $1 billion in financial losses to the IRS during a perceived high point in his business career, the ghostwriter of "The Art of the Deal," once called an "unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur," has another description for the book: fiction.
"I'd be fine if Random House simply took the book out of print," Tony Schwartz, a vocal critic of the president, tweeted on Wednesday. "Or recategorized it as fiction."
Schwartz's tweet comes after The New York Times found that Trump reported staggering losses between 1985 and 1994 — a period of time in which the president, largely due to the success of his book, had achieved widespread fame for appearing to be a self-made billionaire gifted with seemingly unrivaled business acumen. The Times report, however, painted a starkly different picture.
"In fact, year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer," the Times wrote, pointing out that by the time the best-selling memoir was released, Trump was already in "deep financial distress."
On Wednesday, the book's portrayal of Trump's business prowess once again came under fierce scrutiny from Schwartz, who has openly expressed remorse for ghostwriting it.
In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, Schwartz reiterated that if he were to rename the book he would call it "The Sociopath."
"He has no guilt," Schwartz said of Trump. "All he wants to do is make the case that he would like to be true. While I do think he's probably aware that more walls are closing around him than ever before, he does not experience the world in a way that an ordinary human being would."
Washington Post
Crowd at Trump rally cheers violent suggestion
A roar rose from the crowd of thousands of Trump supporters in Panama City Beach, Fla., on Wednesday night as President Trump noted yet again that Border Patrol agents can't use weapons to deter migrants. "How do you stop these people?" he asked.
"Shoot them!" someone yelled from the crowd, according to reporters on the scene and attendees.
The audience cheered. Supporters seated behind Trump and clad in white baseball caps bearing the letters "USA" laughed.
"That's only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement," Trump replied, smiling and shaking his head. "Only in the Panhandle."
Though Trump didn't explicitly endorse the suggestion, his joking response raised concerns that he was tacitly encouraging extrajudicial killings and brutality against asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants. The president has long been accused of endorsing acts of violence through his incendiary rhetoric and allusions to the potential for violence at his rallies, a charge that members of his administration deny.
Reached for comment by The Washington Post on Trump's reaction at the Florida rally, Matt Wolking, deputy communications director for the Trump campaign, pointed to a response he had given to many critics on Twitter. The president, he noted in his tweet, had said specifically that Border Patrol wouldn't use firearms to stop migrants from entering the country.
The incendiary remark from the crowd came as Trump, standing before roughly 7,000 people who had gathered at an outdoor amphitheater in the hurricane-damaged Gulf Coast town, railed against what he described as an "invasion" of migrants attempting to enter the United States. Often, he claimed, only "two or three" border agents will contend with the arrival of "hundreds and hundreds of people."
"And don't forget, we don't let them and we can't let them use weapons," Trump said of the border agents. "We can't. Other countries do. We can't. I would never do that. But how do you stop these people?"

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The best parts about traveling with presidential candidates on the campaign trail are the interactions with voters, who are as diverse as our country and come to the events with hope and optimism that an individual candidate can speak to their most pressing problems.
The worst parts, without question, are the jokes.
You hear a candidate make the same jokes over and over. The part of Senator Elizabeth Warren's stump speech where she jokes about being the "accidental" baby in her family, the part of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's story where she says there were "more cows than Democrats" in her first House district. It's indicative of the privileged position of many of us reporters, who get the incredible opportunity to hear some of the nation's most powerful people speak dozens of times. But it also confirms another, equally salient truth: Politicians aren't that funny.
As a national political reporter for The New York Times, I have a lot to balance on a daily basis. The presidential campaign among Democrats is already in full swing, more than eight months before the first Iowans will cast their vote in the presidential caucus. I have been covering Ms. Warren, who has been releasing policy proposals at a blistering place, including big ideas such as breaking up Facebook, increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans and canceling student debt. That has meant being nimble and available at any moment, ready to jump on a story from a bar (as I did Wednesday) or an airport (last week), or during your favorite soccer team's most important match (don't worry, they won).
On the road, candidates often publicize a day of travel, which can include multiple events that crisscross Iowa or New Hampshire or Nevada, sometimes within a single day. Your rental car is sometimes your office. Your cellphone is sometimes your cubicle.
There are also other challenges, including ones posed by the sheer number of candidates in the race. Last Sunday, for example, I attended services with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., at Brookland Baptist Church in West Columbia, S.C. But by evening, I needed to be in Detroit to see a speech by Senator Kamala Harris of California, who told a crowd of more than 10,000 people that President Trump was "not making America great again. He's making America hate again." Earlier this year, I flew to South Carolina to see Ms. Harris on one day, then drove to Georgia to catch Ms. Warren the next.
The job can be such a blur I often pinch myself. I'm 26 years old, and when Senator Ted Cruz became the first major candidate to announce his presidential campaign in the run-up to the 2016 election, I remember watching from my college library at Marquette University in Wisconsin. This time, I'm at the epicenter of an election that will put the country at a crossroads, and the current Democratic primary has brought fraught questions of identity and ideology to the forefront.
In essence, the party is asking itself, "Who do we want to be?" and "What does it mean to be a Democrat?" Those two questions can elicit wildly different answers in different parts of the country. As we saw in last year's midterm elections, liberal Democrats like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York can capture the country's imagination with leftist policies and uncompromising rhetoric, but the same party is home to centrist Democrats who helped make the party's current House majority, and senators like Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana, who both won re-election by explicitly rejecting the leftist lurch.
On an individual level, I see this tension play out voter by voter. Candidates emphasize different issues in different places: In New York, Ms. Warren talked about the tech industry; in the South, she emphasized housing policy; in the West, she prioritized a proposal about protecting public lands. (Although some things, like health care and climate change, are of universal interest.)
I think reporters have a pressing responsibility to tell the diversity of these stories, and elections are a great vehicle to do so. At a campaign rally, you'll see the rich and the poor, people of different races and genders and sexual orientations -- each of whom has a single, equal vote in the ballot box.

Texto completo: The former C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame, whose cover was blown in a leak that touched off a political scandal during the George W. Bush administration, said Thursday that she plans to run for Congress as a Democrat.
Ms. Plame, 55, is running for the northern New Mexico seat being vacated by Representative Ben Ray Luján. Mr. Luján, who had been regarded as a possible successor to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has announced that he plans to run for Senate to replace the retiring Senator Tom Udall.
Ms. Plame, who moved to Santa Fe after leaving Washington more than a decade ago, has recently worked as a speaker and writer, but she is best known for the circumstances of her departure from the C.I.A., where she had served for two decades.
When her husband, the American diplomat Joseph C. Wilson IV, wrote an opinion essay in The New York Times in 2003 raising questions about a central underpinning for the invasion of Iraq -- that President Saddam Hussein was acquiring nuclear weapons there -- Ms. Plame's identity was leaked to the news media.
The columnist Robert Novak disclosed Ms. Plame's undercover status in The Washington Post, quoting unnamed administration officials, in what was regarded as an effort by some in the administration to discredit Mr. Wilson's opinions.
No one was ever prosecuted for the leak, but the ensuing investigation led to the conviction of I. Lewis Libby Jr., a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. Mr. Libby, who goes by Scooter, was pardoned by President Trump in 2018.
In congressional testimony, Ms. Plame said she blamed the Bush administration for intentionally disclosing her identity and undermining her career. And in a news release Thursday, she repeated that contention.
"My career in the C.I.A. was cut short by partisan politics, but I'm not done serving our country," she said.
The congressional seat in New Mexico's Third District, which leans Democratic, has already attracted interest from several other candidates.
In the news release, Ms. Plame indicated that health care would be a central focus of her campaign.
"The high cost of health care and prescription medicine is hitting everyone," she said. "Everyone is losing under the health care system we have today except for insurance and drug companies."
Ms. Plame's 2007 memoir, "Fair Game," was made into a 2010 movie starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. She is also the author of two spy thrillers, "Burned" and "Blowback."

Spielberg Unit Severs Its Ties To CBS Show In Abuse Deal

Texto completo: Steven Spielberg's production company is cutting ties with the CBS prime-time show "Bull," six months after it was reported that an actress on the show was paid millions to settle her sexual harassment claim against its lead actor.
"We can confirm that we are no longer associated with the show," a spokeswoman for Mr. Spielberg's company, Amblin Television, said on Thursday.
In December, The New York Times revealed that CBS paid the actress Eliza Dushku $ 9.5 million to settle her claim that she was sexually harassed by the show's star, Michael Weatherly.
At the time, CBS said in a statement that Ms. Dushku's allegations were evidence that the network's attempts to create "a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace" were "far from done."
Amblin severed its ties to the show on the day the network announced that it had renewed "Bull" for a fourth season. Mr. Spielberg's company had previously been one of the program's producers, along with CBS Studios.
Ms. Dushku was Mr. Weatherly's co-star in a run of episodes during the show's first season. She said Mr. Weatherly's inappropriate remarks included comments on her appearance, references to a threesome and a rape joke. Ms. Dushku also said that, shortly after she confronted Mr. Weatherly about his behavior, she was written off the show, despite plans to make her a series regular.
Ms. Dushku's allegations were included in a draft report prepared by two law firms that examined CBS's workplace culture last year. The firms were hired after the CBS Corporation's chief executive, Leslie Moonves, was accused of sexual misconduct. Mr. Moonves was fired by CBS in September 2018, after a dozen accusers described their claims to The New Yorker.
In a statement to The Times last year, Mr. Weatherly said he made jokes to Ms. Dushku "mocking some lines in the script" and he was "mortified to have offended her." He denied that he had anything to do with her being written off the show.
Ms. Dushku said she had told Leslee Feldman, an executive at Amblin, about her experience with Mr. Weatherly.
"If Steven ever knew about this, he would be so horrified," Ms. Feldman said, according to what Ms. Dushku told the law firms.
Ms. Dushku went into a mediation process with CBS and was paid $ 9.5 million in 2018. The network said the figure matched what she would have "received for the balance of her contract as a series regular."
During the mediation process, a CBS lawyer produced video that he thought would discredit Ms. Dushku, because it showed her cursing on the set, according to a draft report prepared by the outside law firms.
Instead of having its intended effect, the law firms wrote, the footage supported Ms. Dushku's claims, because it "actually captured some of the harassment on film."
As part of her settlement agreement, Ms. Dushku was allowed to discuss the situation with Mr. Spielberg. In an interview with Deadline in March, Ms. Dushku said she met with Mr. Spielberg and people affiliated with the Time's Up organization to discuss "possible solutions for this systemic imbalance of power" in the entertainment industry.
Deadline first reported the news of Mr. Spielberg's departure. CBS declined to comment on Amblin's decision.
When asked if Amblin would refuse any future remuneration resulting from back-end deals, in addition to removing its name from the show, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spielberg's company declined to comment.

Uber's ex-CEO still in picture; Co-founder will cheer the firm's stock market debut as he nurtures a venture that may one day compete with it.

Texto completo: Travis Kalanick built Uber in his own image.
Under his leadership, the company smashed into markets, flouting local transportation rules, circumventing law enforcement and clashing with regulators as it grew into the world's biggest ride-hailing business. His brash style was seen as the reason for Uber's rise and his own undoing in 2017 when, after a series of scandals, Kalanick was forced to resign under pressure from investors.
Since Kalanick was pushed out, Uber has been working hard to tidy its reputation and appear more subdued and well-behaved. New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has worked hard to move beyond Kalanick's legacy, doing away with his predecessor's 14 company tenets, replacing principles such as "super pumped" and "always be hustlin' " with credos such as "we do the right thing" and "we persevere."

But with Uber's much-anticipated initial public offering, Kalanick isn't out of the picture by any stretch.
He still sits on Uber's board and holds an 8.6% stake in the company, accounting for about 117.5 million shares, according to the IPO filing. With the IPO priced Thursday at $45, his holdings amount to more than $5 billion. Uber shares begin trading publicly Friday.
Kalanick plans to be at the New York Stock Exchange when the company begins trading on public markets, but the co-founder won't be on the balcony when Khosrowshahi rings the opening bell -- he'll be on the floor.
Kalanick wanted to be on the balcony with his father in tow when the bell was rung, according to the New York Times, but Khosrowshahi rejected his request. The CEO and others in the company reportedly considered Kalanick a liability and wanted to keep him at arm's length. The company said the plan was always for drivers and early employees to stand with Khosrowshahi on the podium, according to The Times.
Uber and a spokesperson for Kalanick declined to comment, citing regulatory rules prohibiting promotional efforts before an IPO.
Born and raised in Los Angeles, Kalanick dropped out of UCLA in 1998 to work on his start-up called Scour, which allowed people to virtually share music and media files. (The company was sued and eventually filed for bankruptcy.)
Kalanick founded Uber with friend Garrett Camp and Ryan Graves (who got his job by tweeting at Kalanick) in San Francisco in 2009. At the time it was called UberCabs, but the company dropped "Cabs" from its name after receiving a cease-and-desist order from city authorities in 2010.
"We just wanted to push a button and get a ride," he said at a Business Insider conference in 2013. "And we wanted to get a classy ride. We wanted to be baller in San Francisco. That's all it was about."
After his departure from Uber, Kalanick set up an investment fund and purchased for $150 million a controlling stake in the real estate company City Storage Systems, a move that made him the firm's chief executive.
Kalanick has worked quietly on one of its holdings, CloudKitchens, a Los Angeles-based venture that primarily focuses on kitchen rental services -- like WeWork but for kitchen space.
CloudKitchens has been ramping up: It already works with brands such as Sweetgreen and Canter's Deli, and plans to open shop in San Francisco and Chicago, Bloomberg reports.
In March 2018, when Kalanick tweeted about his investment fund, he said its overarching theme would be "large-scale job creation, with investments in real estate, e-commerce, and emerging innovation in China and India." The South China Morning Post reported in February that Kalanick also plans to bring CloudKitchens to China.
CloudKitchens and Uber could compete, should Uber Eats make further inroads in the "virtual restaurant" business. But Khosrowshahi last year tweeted congratulations to Kalanick, calling CloudKitchens a "super-interesting partner of @UberEats."

Outed CIA spy Valerie Plame to run for Congress in New Mexico

Texto completo: Former CIA operative Valerie Plame, a Democrat, is running for an open House seat in New Mexico.
Plame, whose CIA cover was blown in 2003, was considering running for the Senate but is instead aiming for the seat held by Representative Ben Ray Lujan, who is seeking to fill the Senate vacancy created by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Udall.
“My career in the CIA was cut short by partisan politics, but I’m not done serving our country,” Plame said in a Thursday statement.
Plame, 55, shot to fame when she was during President George W. Bush’s administration after her husband Ambassador Joe Wilson wrote in the New York Times that he believed “some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.” Plame and Wilson divorced in 2017.
Conservative columnist Robert Novak revealed Plame’s identity in a 2003 column, attributing the information to “two senior administration officials.” Plame maintains that the leak was “payback” from the Bush administration for her then-husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, writing an op-ed questioning the validity of the administration’s intelligence used as a basis for the Iraq War.
Lewis “Scooter” Libby, former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted in 2007 of perjury and obstruction of justice over the leak of Plame’s identity. It emerged that former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage was the primary source for Novak’s story, but he was never charged. President Trump pardoned Libby in 2018, saying he was treated unfairly.
Plame has since written two spy novels and a memoir.
“When my career in national security intelligence was ended prematurely, through no fault of my own, there was only one place my heart wanted to be — Sante Fe,” Plame said in her statement. “I moved the day after Vice President Cheney’s chief aide Scooter Libby was convicted for his role in outing my true CIA identity. … New Mexico was the first place that felt like home and that’s what it has been ever since.”
Plame said healthcare access and prescription drug costs were the primary reasons she is running.
In 2017, Plame was forced to apologize after sharing on Twitter an anti-Semitic article from the UNZ Review entitled "America's Jews Are Driving America's Wars." The article stated that Jews "own the media," that they should wear labels while on national television, and that their beliefs were as dangerous as "a bottle of rat poison."
Her initial response was: "First of all, calm down. Re-tweets don't imply endorsement. Yes, very provocative, but thoughtful. Many neocon hawks ARE Jewish." But she later added: "OK folks, look, I messed up. I skimmed this piece, zeroed in on the neocon criticism, and shared it without seeing and considering the rest."
She later apologized and resigned from the board of the Ploughshares Fund, which provides grants for projects aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. But in the space of three years, she had posted nine UNZ articles, including one titled "Why I Still Dislike Israel" and another about "Dancing Israelis" on 9/11.
Plame has been an outspoken critic of President Trump, launching a GoFundMe effort to buy a stake so she could ban Trump. It raised $89,719 toward its $1 billion goal. She has been active in Democratic politics since moving to Santa Fe, N.M., in 2007. She hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton’s super PAC in 2014 and another fundraiser for Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2015.

Texto completo: A ship got seized. The pope spoke out. And 1,000 guns were found in a home near the Playboy Mansion. It's Ashley. It's Thursday. Here's what to know.
But first, an albino cyclops shark: You never know what you might catch or encounter while fishing, such as this terrifying one-eyed sea creature.
Denver shrugs off hallucinogenic 'shrooms
It’s a big day for 'shrooms. Denver decriminalized “magic" mushrooms by the slimmest of margins, making the city the country’s first to deprioritize enforcement of laws against the hallucinogen. Once the results are officially certified this month, Denver police will be formally ordered to make enforcement of drug laws against psychedelic mushroom users their lowest priority. Don’t get too excited: The plan doesn’t permit the sale or purchase of the mushrooms. And opponents could pay for a recount if they want, potentially delaying implementation.
US to North Korea: We took your ship
Looks like North Korea’s ship called the Wise Honest wasn’t so honest after all. U. S. authorities seized the massive North Korean ship in connection to a coal exporting scheme violating international sanctions, according to court documents filed Thursday. The 17,061-ton carrier also was allegedly used to smuggle heavy machinery into the rogue nation. Foreign authorities intercepted the ship last month as it carried a shipment out of Nampo, North Korea. It's the first time the United States has seized a North Korean cargo vessel for sanction violations.
What else is North Korea up to? Launching a barrage of unidentified projectiles, South Korea said Thursday.
Student shooting survivors walk out: They're 'not a statement. '
Students who survived Tuesday's school shooting in Denver walked out of a gun control rally Wednesday in anger and tears over concerns the event politicized their grief. Billed largely as a vigil to honor victim Kendrick Castillo, most speakers at the 2,000-person rally were politicians and gun control advocates pushing to change gun laws. After about 30 minutes, hundreds of students from the STEM School stormed out, yelling, "This is not for us" and "We are people, not a statement. " Outside, interview requests made by a USA TODAY reporter were rebuffed. Multiple students said they had agreed not to talk to journalists. Castillo, 18, was killed and eight were wounded Tuesday when two teens opened fire at the school.
Also heartbreaking: The STEM school was warned about 'a repeat of Columbine' months before the shooting.

Pope: Report sex abuse, but not to police
Pope Francis issued a groundbreaking law Thursday making the world’s Catholic priests and nuns mandatory reporters of sex abuse and its coverup. The law requires officials to inform church authorities of any “well-founded motives to believe” that a cleric or sister has engaged in sexual abuse of a minor, sexual misconduct with an adult, possession of child pornography – or that a superior has covered up any such crimes. The church law doesn’t require them to report to police. The move is the latest by Francis to respond to the sex abuse crisis that’s engulfed the Catholic Church for the better part of two decades.
Facebook's co-founder: Zuckerberg's power is 'un-American'
Chris Hughes, Zuck’s old Harvard roommate, the lesser known co-founder of Facebook, said the government must hold the social giant accountable and break it up after a series of missteps. In an opinion piece published by The New York Times, Hughes said he feels "a sense of anger and responsibility" for Facebook's direction, which included a massive privacy scandal involving access to user information. Hughes said the power of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is "unprecedented and un-American," citing his control of 60% of voting shares and his direct role in configuring News Feed algorithms. In a statement obtained by USA TODAY, Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president of global affairs and communication, said a breakup is not the way to force Facebook to be accountable.

Texto completo: Over three days of hearings last month, Elaine Wynn looked on stoically as Massachusetts regulators grilled Wynn Resorts executives about her ex-husband's alleged sexual offenses, a litany of accusations that drove the casino mogul out of the business.
The details were painful, exhausting. For Elaine Wynn, surely, the long hours of testimony must have been doubly difficult. It raised the obvious question: Why was she doing this at all?
She could have avoided it all easily enough by selling off most or all of her shares in Wynn Resorts, the Las Vegas company she cofounded with Steve Wynn in 2002. But no, she told the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, she's not going anywhere.
“I'm here because I am team Wynn," she said.
Her resolve to stick it out reflects her devotion to the firm that has her name, her friends say.
“Elaine cares about the company and her people, about the legacy of that organization," said Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments in Chicago and a longtime friend of Wynn.
Wynn is a top company shareholder, with a 9 percent stake worth about $1.3 billion.
Her long career includes a 1999 induction into the American Gaming Association's Gaming Hall of Fame. She was number nine last year on the Forbes list of “America's Richest Self-Made Women." For her accumulated knowledge and mentoring, Wynn has earned a special status among women at the highest levels of US businesses, Hobson said.
“The joke among our friends is we call her our godmother," Hobson said. “A godmother is someone looking out for you, who is nurturing and supporting you. I have a bunch of friends and that's what we call her."
Wynn, 77, has also been called the Queen of Las Vegas. Now, with the imminent debut of the company's Encore Boston Harbor resort casino, she is about to become part of the local civic landscape, too.
On Monday, she was at the Celtics playoff game at TD Garden. The Celtics were bad, but it is a good bet Wynn will be back. She is, in her own words, “a crazed basketball fanatic." She sits on the board of governors for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, in Springfield.
The Encore Boston Harbor, the first Las Vegas-style casino in Greater Boston, is set to open in about six weeks. It is the largest single-phased private development in state history, a $2.6 billion resort hotel on the Mystic River in Everett, stuffed with more than 3,000 slot machines, an array of table games, event space, 671 hotel rooms and suites, and 15 new bars and restaurants. The Encore will employ some 5,500 people and is expected to draw millions of customers annually, ensuring it will have a strong pull on the cultural gravity of the region.
State regulators last month ruled that Wynn Resorts could retain its Massachusetts casino license, though they fined the company $35 million after state investigators found that former executives covered up misconduct allegations against Steve Wynn.
Steve Wynn left the company and sold his Wynn Resorts stock early last year, after The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2018 that he had been accused of a pattern of misconduct. He has denied any nonconsensual sexual relationships.
Elaine Wynn declined to be interviewed for this story but told The New York Times last May, “My mission is to resurrect the integrity of this extraordinary company that is really the capstone of my professional life."
Sallie Krawcheck, cofounder and CEO of the investment company Ellevest and former chief executive of both Smith Barney and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, said Elaine Wynn “is, for generations of women, really iconic."
“She continues to be in the game every day, and she was part of creating a valuable company," Krawcheck said. “As I look toward extending my career through decades, she's a great role model and example."
Elaine Wynn was born in New York City and graduated from George Washington University with a degree in political science. She married Steve Wynn in 1963, when she was 21. They divorced in 1986 and then remarried in 1991. They cofounded Wynn Resorts in 2002, and Elaine Wynn served on the company's board of directors until 2015. The couple divorced again in 2010, and Steve Wynn married his current wife, Andrea Hissom, in 2011.
Elaine Wynn testified in April before the Gaming Commission because it needed to assess her fitness to hold a position of influence in a casino. Much of the questioning revolved around a $7.5 million settlement Steve Wynn paid in 2005 to a former manicurist at Wynn Resorts who had accused him of rape.
In 2009, during Steve and Elaine Wynn's second divorce, one of Elaine Wynn's lawyers received an e-mail from a woman who alleged that Steve Wynn had raped her stepdaughter and had signed a multimillion-dollar settlement with her, state investigators found. Elaine Wynn told investigators that reading that e-mail was “one of the single most upsetting things that's ever happened to me."
She said she confronted her husband, who denied the accusation and suggested he had been blackmailed. She said she reported the accusation in 2009 to the company's general counsel.
Elaine Wynn did not tell the board of directors at the time but later raised the existence of the settlement in litigation with the company in 2016.
The Wall Street Journal revealed the nature of the settlement in 2018.
The Gaming Commission, while affirming Elaine Wynn is suitable to be a major shareholder in the company, said certain aspects of her behavior raised concerns. Her failure to inform the board of directors or state regulators about the rape allegation and settlement was “particularly troubling," the board wrote in its report. “The various conflicting facts she learned concerning whether the event was consensual and Ms. Wynn's reaction thereto showed a concerning lack of diligence to further investigate or address an extremely troubling event."
The commission concluded, however, that while Wynn could have done more to instigate an investigation into the allegation, she was not legally obligated to do so.

Texto completo: Award-winning author and Madison-county resident Philip Shirley will be signing his latest crime thriller, "The Graceland Conspiracy," at Barnes & Noble Renaissance in Ridgeland on May 19, during a 60-day book tour touching Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida, according to a news release.
The book signing will be 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Barnes & Noble is located at 1000 Highland Colony Parkway. "The Graceland Conspiracy" is being published by Mindbridge Press.
"The Graceland Conspiracy" delivers a coming-of-age story wrapped in a crime thriller. A rebellious young man becomes caught in a 1990s conspiracy in which the government will stop at nothing to prevent the release of sensitive information about a 1970s crime that could still bring down many powerful government figures and rewrite American pop-culture history.
A review in The Clarion-Ledger called the book "a fast-paced page turner" and "a great read." Michelle Richmond, New York Times Bestselling author of "The Marriage Pact" and Truman Capote Prize recipient, said, "The Graceland Conspiracy" is crazy good fun, a pacey, globe-trotting thriller with a Southern twist."
This is Shirley's third book of fiction. His first book of fiction, "Oh Don't You Cry for Me," was honored as a finalist for the Jefferson Prize in 2008. His last novel, "The White Lie," was described by Dayne Sherman, author of "Welcome to the Fallen Paradise" (Booklist's Best Crime Debut of the Year), as "... a crime novel par excellence, a story worthy of the late Elmore Leonard."
Shirley lives the town of Lost Rabbit near Madison. He is executive chairman of Godwin, the South's oldest advertising agency, and busy on his next novel.

TRUMP USED TAX BREAKS HE NOW SLAMS; President has attacked Amazon but whittled his own bills similarly.

Texto completo: President Trump complains that large corporations such as Amazon.com Inc. are shirking their tax responsibilities. Yet for at least a decade, Trump paid none or very little in federal income taxes by exploiting some of the same generous tax breaks that the online retail giant and others have used to reduce IRS bills.
Trump's businesses generated huge losses, and his hotel and casino properties were eligible for large depreciation write-offs that meant he paid taxes for only two years from 1985 to 1994, according to tax records obtained by the New York Times. Trump, then a real estate developer, racked up $1.17 billion worth of losses in that time, according to the documents.
Trump defended his real estate business tax strategy Wednesday after publication of the Times report, saying he was "entitled" to the benefits.

"Real estate developers in the 1980's & 1990's, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases," Trump tweeted. "Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered 'tax shelter.'"
Before he ran for president, Trump complained that corporate America wasn't paying enough in taxes. He first tweeted in 2015 "if @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag." Since then, he's sent at least a dozen tweets critical of how little the company pays in taxes.
Trump used parts of the U.S. tax code to whittle down his tax bill to nothing for several years, the same sections that Amazon has used to pay no federal income taxes for the last two years. The company -- led by the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos -- has been able to get a tax refund for the last two years despite turning a profit. It tapped losses that occurred before it was profitable for write-offs from building warehouses and distribution centers, in addition to other legal tax breaks.
Trump's tax information shows he paid taxes only during two years during the decade the New York Times examined, according to the newspaper's report. It pegged a large chunk of the losses to the April 1990 opening of the Trump Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., which the paper said left his company stuck with more than $800 million in debt, mostly at very high interest rates.
He faced a liability -- for a combined total of about $1.5 million in taxes -- because of the alternative minimum tax, a backstop that prevents the wealthy from claiming so many tax credits and deductions that they don't pay any tax.
Trump's 2017 tax overhaul eliminated the alternative minimum tax for corporations, but the Trump Organization is made up of a series of pass-throughs and was not affected by that change. The AMT for individuals was largely scaled back so it hits far fewer taxpayers.
Trump has boasted that paying no federal taxes makes him "smart." He emphasized his business acumen in the 2016 presidential campaign and during his presidency. However, according to the Times report, Trump's losses during 1990 and 1991, which totaled $250 million a year, were more than double those of the nearest individual taxpayer in the Internal Revenue Service's database of high-income filers.
New reports of Trump's low tax bills are likely to fuel House Democrats' anger at not being able to view his more recent tax returns. The Times said its reporting was based on figures from his tax transcripts and the figures from his tax returns, but not the returns themselves.
Trump broke with more than 40 years of tradition by refusing to release his tax returns before the 2016 election. Last month, House Ways and Means Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) requested that the IRS release Trump's personal and business tax returns, but Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin on Monday refused.
Neal is consulting with legal counsel on how to proceed, and the clash is likely to turn into a protracted legal battle.
Trump sold himself to voters as a master deal-maker who could bring the same success to the country as he says he did to his businesses. The Times report underscores the steep losses and frequent failures of his deals. Although he never personally filed for bankruptcy, his businesses sought bankruptcy protection four times.
Trump has defended his refusal to release his tax returns by saying people "don't care" about them and "wouldn't understand" what they contain anyway. About 51% of voters said they supported Democrats' efforts to obtain the tax returns, according to an April Morning Consult/Politico poll.

New York Senate passes bill to allow release of Trump's state tax returns

Texto completo: Legislation still needs Assembly's approval, governor's signature
The New York State Senate passed legislation Wednesday that would allow President Trump's state tax returns to be turned over to congressional committees, a move that could pave the way for House Democrats to obtain the president's closely guarded financial records.
The bill must still be approved by the State Assembly and signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D-N.Y.), but Cuomo has expressed support for the measure and Democrats have a majority in the legislature's lower chamber.
The legislation comes after the New York Times published a report, based on data from 10 years of Trump's federal tax returns, showing he took more than $1 billion in losses and lost more money than almost every other taxpayer in America from 1985 to 1994.
House Democrats have sought more recent records, from 2013 to 2018, citing the need to oversee how the Internal Revenue Service audits the president's tax returns. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin officially denied House lawmakers' request for Trump's tax returns.
"One period of taxes that has been leaked shows many inconsistencies," said Brad Hoylman, the Democratic state senator who is spearheading the legislation. "A lot of Americans want to know what else there is."
Trump refused to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign, breaking decades of precedent.
New York's legislation would not give House Democrats access to the six years of federal tax returns sought by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.). But the state returns could provide an unprecedented look into Trump's New York business dealings, his income and a range of other personal financial information, according to legal experts.
"The New York state tax returns likely contain information that is similar to what is in the federal returns," said Harry Sandick, former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, noting his business losses and income probably would be similar at the federal and state levels.
The Trump administration has rejected Democrats' requests for the president's tax returns as violations of taxpayer privacy, with congressional Republicans echoing similar concerns. Leading Republicans in New York state have similarly ridiculed Hoylman's bill as a partisan attempt to embarrass the president.
In his letter earlier this week, Mnuchin said of House Democrats' request for Trump's records, "in reliance on the advice of the Department of Justice, I have determined that the Committee's request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose, and . . . the Department is therefore not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information."
Under the legislation, the state tax returns can be released only if requested by any of three committees: the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation. It probably would not contain any information about IRS audits into Trump's tax returns, a key part of Neal's request, as those would not be filed in the state returns.
Federal law limits the kind of federal tax information that states are permitted to disclose, which could translate into criminal penalties if New York state's Department of Taxation and Finance does not adhere to statute should Neal request Trump's returns.
"They're bound by the confidentiality agreement that applies to all federal tax information," said George Yin, a tax expert at the University of Virginia who has briefed congressional officials on Trump's returns. "They have to be very, very careful in what they're doing."
Hoylman, the state senator, said he had consulted extensively with counsel about his legislation and was confident of its legality.
The Treasury Department did not return a request for comment about the New York legislation. Trump's attorneys also did not return requests for comment.

Texto completo: Strawberries were dying. The red berries were once a profitable crop in Sussex County, but by the 1920s, the soil was so depleted that many farms could no longer support strawberries as cash crop.
Many growers were abandoning strawberries when help came from an unexpected source.
In 1874, the New York Times reported, "Strawberries, which next to peaches are the great fruit crop of the (Delmarva) peninsula."
Strawberries do not ripen after they are harvested; the fruit needs to be left on the vine until it is at the peak of its juicy freshness. Consequently, the berries had to be picked and shipped quickly.
When the strawberries began to ripen, crowds of pickers were recruited from the slums of the big cities to harvest the fruit. The pickers often arrived in the fields at three in the morning; and working by the light of oil lamps, they spent hours hunched over, plucking strawberries and loading them into small baskets.
The baskets were packed onto horse-drawn wagons which carried the delicate fruit to Selbyville, Millsboro, and other southern Delaware rail depots, where the berries were loaded into newly-developed refrigerated railroad cars.
The cold-packing in the refrigerated cars was the secret to keeping the fruit from rotting.
When strawberries were being harvested, buyers flooded into Selbyville, where they erected tents along the town's streets so that they could be ready at sunup, when the first wagonloads of strawberries arrived in town.
The wagons lined up at the auction block on Church Street and from there, the berries were taken to the railroad station for shipment to big city markets.
Raising strawberries in Sussex County peaked in the early years of the 20th century. The soil had become depleted, and by the beginning of the 1920s, many growers had turned to other crops.
The completion of the Du Pont Highway in 1923, however, revived the strawberry crop in southern Delaware.
Two years after the highway was finished, the Wilmington Sunday Star reported, "Rumors from Georgetown that Sussex County farmers were going to abandon the raising of strawberries because ... the soil had failed to properly nourish them, are laughed at by the farmers whose crops of strawberries for years have one of their best paying enterprises."
Strawberry growers had learned to fertilize their strawberry patches to prevent the nutrients in the soil from becoming depleted. In addition, the completion of the Du Pont Highway provided growers a way to truck their berries to market.
Instead of shipping strawberries in refrigerated railroad cars, growers packed the berries in large "cold-packed" barrels which were loaded onto trucks.
According to the Sunday Star, "The cold pack process is one that each farmer keeps a secret unto himself. They each have their own particular way of packing the berries into huge barrels, the same size as vinegar barrels.
"The general method followed is to pack sound berries between successive layers of granulated sugar. The barrel is sealed and made airtight, and if properly done, it is said the berries will last indefinitely.
"These are the strawberries you eat in November and December in your ice cream and sometimes in your sundae over the soda fountain. But only good sound berries are used, because if the fruit should be soft or the least bit decayed, it might spoil the entire barrel."
The unexpected combination of the new Du Pont Highway and sugary cold-packing enabled the strawberry crop to remain an important crop in southern Delaware for the next 15 years, when it was no longer a major crop in southern Delaware.

DeVos offers new definition of 'public education'

Texto completo: BALTIMORE – While the media may focus on U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, she told the nation's education reporters Monday that the focus should be on students and families.
"As much as many in the media use my name as clickbait or try to make it all about me, it's not," she said. "Education is not about Betsy DeVos nor any other individual."
Defining herself as a conservative with a distrust of government, DeVos used her appearance at the Education Writers Association annual conference to promote her Education Freedom Scholarships and to continue her call for a redefinition of public schooling.
"It should surprise no one that I am a commonsense conservative with a healthy distrust of centralized government," she said. "Instead, I trust the American people to live their own lives and to decide their own destinies. That's a freedom philosophy."
For DeVos, a wealthy former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman whose Cabinet term has been marked with controversy, that means giving students and families the choice to move between schools. She says this will force traditional public schools to innovate and get better.
It's a familiar mantra for DeVos, who pushed the establishment of charter schools in Michigan and helped to push an unsuccessful school vouchers ballot question in Michigan.
She has proposed an Education Freedom Scholarship, which would use private scholarships to allow students who couldn't normally afford it to go to private schools.
It ties in with DeVos' broader philosophy.
"Let's stop and rethink the definition of public education," she said. "Today, it's often defined as one type of school, funded by taxpayers, controlled by government. But if every student is part of 'the public,' then every way and every place a student learns is ultimately of benefit to 'the public.' That should be the new definition of public education."
DeVos furthered her push for school choice under questioning from New York Times reporter Erica Greene.
"More choices and more freedom in education will ultimately mean" better schools overall, even a neighborhood traditional public schools," DeVos said.
"Having the ability to direct where resources go on the child or family level helps families become wise consumers."
During the question-and-answer period with the reporters, a Michigan-based reporter asked DeVos about Detroit schools and the charter schools in the city, which have a generally poor record, as does the Detroit traditional school system and why DeVos hadn't visited the city to talk to families.
DeVos was instrumental in pushing Michigan's charter school law, including through political action groups and donations to Michigan legislators.
DeVos said she had been to Detroit schools before she was education secretary.
She also said she doesn't think Michigan has true education "freedom." She added she hoped that would change.
DeVos was also asked about private, for-profit companies that run charter schools and make profits off doing so, sometimes by skirting laws.
DeVos said all public schools — charter and traditional — must follow laws, but said the bigger thing to focus on is why there are waiting lists in many places for charter schools and why more of those schools aren't available.
In other news, DeVos said:
She hasn't met recently with any sexual assault survivors. Her department has proposed a major overhaul of how colleges and universities handle sexual assault complaints, with many sexual assault survivors complaining she is protecting those who are accused of sexual assault.
She said the recent scandal of parents paying bribes to get their children into elite universities showcases the belief among many that the college system is unfair to most average people.
When asked whether she would serve another four years in her role if Donald Trump was re-elected and wanted her to stay, DeVos didn't directly answer, instead quipping that her husband probably wouldn't like her to.

Texto completo: Ryan Reynolds is one of the hottest actors in Hollywood. However, Reynolds said in a New York Times interview that he is not big on the vanity side of celebrity, saying his wife, Blake Lively, jokes about him only needing a drawer for his clothes rather than a closet. Reynolds, who stars as the voice of Pikachu in the "Detective Pikachu" film opening this weekend, revealed that one of his favorite articles of clothing is a T-shirt — and it happens to be from Michigan.
"I have an old T-shirt that I've had for maybe 18 years," he told The New York Times. "It was black, but is gray now. And on the front it says Zukey Lake Tavern. I don't even know where that is, but it's a real tavern somewhere in the United States. I've had a couple of people say, 'No way! That's from my hometown.'"
Zukey Lake Tavern is in Pinckney, a village in Livingston County. The bar sells various kinds of merchandise in different styles and colors, such as tie-dye hoodies and T-shirts, tank tops, women's V-neck shirts and hoodies with phrases such as, "Zukey Lake Tavern, it's on the way to Hell, Michigan."
Zukey Lake even has a section on its website called, "ZLT Around the World," with people from Pittsburgh to Scotland donning a tavern shirt.
"We're honored and privileged to have our name out there," said Jeff Plante, co-owner of Zukey Lake Tavern. "My partner and I are big fans of Ryan Reynolds. We even have a picture up of him wearing the shirt at the 'Smokin' Aces' premiere in 2007."
The tavern got its name from Zukey Lake, and was built after the end of Prohibition in the early 1930s by Maggie and Baldy Girard. The brothers also built several houses on the north shore of the lake, and the road where the tavern is located would be named after them, Girard Road.
In addition to its clothing, the bar is known for its roof deck tiki bar, "Lobster tail Tuesdays" and a Sunday breakfast buffet.
Plante said the tavern started selling retail in the early 1980s. Customers would get a free T-shirt when they ordered a large pizza.
Plante hopes to get in touch with Reynolds soon to offer him a new Zukey Lake Tavern T-shirt.

1 million species at risk of extinction, U.N. says

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Humans are transforming Earth's natural landscapes so dramatically that as many as 1 million plant and animal species are now at risk of extinction, posing a dire threat to ecosystems that people all over the world depend on for their survival, a sweeping new United Nations assessment has concluded.
The 1,500-page report, compiled by hundreds of international experts and based on thousands of scientific studies, is the most exhaustive look yet at the decline in biodiversity across the globe and the dangers that creates for human civilization.
A summary of its findings, which was approved by representatives from the United States and 131 other countries, was released Monday in Paris. The full report is set to be published this year.
Its conclusions are stark. In most major land habitats, from the savannas of Africa to the rainforests of South America, the average abundance of native plant and animal life has fallen by 20% or more, mainly over the past century.
With the human population passing 7 billion, activities like farming, logging, poaching, fishing and mining are altering the natural world at a rate "unprecedented in human history."
At the same time, a new threat has emerged: Global warming has become a major driver of wildlife decline, the assessment found, by shifting or shrinking the local climates that many mammals, birds, insects, fish and plants evolved to survive in.
As a result, biodiversity loss is projected to accelerate through 2050, particularly in the tropics, unless countries drastically step up their conservation efforts.
The report is not the first to paint a grim portrait of Earth's ecosystems. But it goes further by detailing how closely human well-being is intertwined with the fate of other species.
"For a long time, people just thought of biodiversity as saving nature for its own sake," said Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which conducted the assessment at the request of national governments. "But this report makes clear the links between biodiversity and nature and things like food security and clean water in both rich and poor countries."
A previous report by the group had estimated that, in the Americas, nature provides some $24 trillion of non-monetized benefits to humans each year. The Amazon rainforest absorbs immense quantities of carbon dioxide and helps slow the pace of global warming. Wetlands purify drinking water. Coral reefs sustain tourism and fisheries in the Caribbean. Exotic tropical plants form the basis of a variety of medicines.
But as these natural landscapes wither and become less biologically rich, the services they can provide to humans have been dwindling.
Humans are producing more food than ever, but land degradation is already harming agricultural productivity on 23% of the planet's land area, the new report said. The decline of wild bees and other insects that help pollinate fruits and vegetables is putting up to $577 billion in annual crop production at risk.
The authors note that the devastation of nature has become so severe that piecemeal efforts to protect individual species or to set up wildlife refuges will no longer be sufficient. Instead, they call for "transformative changes" that include curbing wasteful consumption, slimming down agriculture's environmental footprint and cracking down on illegal logging and fishing.

Two U.S. senators who lived lives of honor and courage

Texto completo: Let us now praise two almost-famous men who served in the Senate for a combined total of 74 years and died recently within three weeks of each other. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, and Ernest "Fritz" Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, both took a bipartisan approach to legislating and left their country a stronger, safer place.
Today, lawmakers who dare to reach across the aisle are branded as heretics and threatened with primary challenges. So it’s important to remember a time when working with political rivals to solve problems was not just possible, but popular.
Lugar was compact and colorless, known for his early-morning runs around Capitol Hill, even in lousy weather. A political ally, William Ruckelshaus, once joked about him, "Dick has maintained that childhood capability of walking into an empty room and blending right in."
Hollings was tall and lanky with a crackling wit that sometimes got him in trouble. When a political opponent challenged him to take a drug test, Hollings fired back, "I’ll take a drug test if you’ll take an IQ test." The New York Times once wrote, "Providence has blessed him with an appearance so striking that rank strangers assume he must be important."
In many ways, however, their political lives took similar paths. Both were military veterans. Hollings won a Bronze Star as an artillery officer in World War II. Lugar was too young for the war, but time as an intelligence officer briefing the Navy’s top brass deepened his interest in defense and foreign policy.
Hollings was elected governor of South Carolina at age 36. Lugar became mayor of Indianapolis at 35. Both lost their first tries for the Senate, and ran for president with abysmal results. And both represented vanishing political breeds that are sorely missed in Congress today.
Hollings was a pragmatic Southern Democrat in a state that was rapidly turning Republican, and after he retired in 2004, he was replaced by hard-edged conservative Jim DeMint. Lugar, a dedicated internationalist, was defeated in a GOP primary in 2012 by a doctrinaire right-winger, Richard Mourdock.
But the most important trait they shared was a capacity to change, grow and apply their new knowledge to practical legislative solutions. In 1986, Lugar led 31 Republicans in joining 47 Democrats to override President Reagan’s veto of a bill imposing economic sanctions on South Africa. The Republican’s most enduring success was working with Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, to enact legislation that financed the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. The Washington Post editorialized, "the program ranks as among the most successful congressional foreign policy initiatives in a generation."
One of Lugar’s protÃ©gÃ©s was a young first-term Democrat from Illinois, Barack Obama, who said of his mentor: "In Dick, I saw someone who wasn’t a Republican or a Democrat first, but a problem-solver — an example of the impact a public servant can make by eschewing partisan divisiveness to instead focus on common ground."
Hollings grew up in the segregated South, but as governor, he presided over the peaceful integration of Clemson University. "This General Assembly," he told state lawmakers, "must make clear South Carolina’s choice: a government of laws rather than a government of men."
As a senator in the late 1960s, he toured poor areas of his state and became a strong supporter of federal programs like food stamps. "There is hunger in South Carolina," he told a Senate committee. "I know as a public servant I am late to the problem, (but) we’ve got work to do in our own back yard ."
In the 1980s, he worked with Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire to enact the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, which placed strict limits on congressional expenditures. It worked for a time, but eventually, clever congressional budget-busters found ways around the restrictions.
Perhaps the most memorable moment of Hollings’ career came in 2015, when he proposed that a federal courthouse named in his honor be renamed for Judge J. Waties Waring, an early and isolated voice for racial equality. "I just got the money for the building, he made history in it," Hollings explained.
The senator was being too modest. Fritz Hollings and Dick Lugar both made history. And today’s lawmakers can learn a lot from their lives of honor and courage. .

Texto completo: Let us now praise two almost-famous men who served in the Senate for a combined total of 74 years and died recently within three weeks of each other. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, and Ernest "Fritz" Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, both took a bipartisan approach to legislating and left their country a stronger, safer place.
Today, lawmakers who dare to reach across the aisle are branded as heretics and threatened with primary challenges. So it’s important to remember a time when working with political rivals to solve problems was not just possible, but popular.
Lugar was compact and colorless, known for his early-morning runs around Capitol Hill, even in lousy weather. A political ally, William Ruckelshaus, once joked about him, "Dick has maintained that childhood capability of walking into an empty room and blending right in."
Hollings was tall and lanky with a crackling wit that sometimes got him in trouble. When a political opponent challenged him to take a drug test, Hollings fired back, "I’ll take a drug test if you’ll take an IQ test." The New York Times once wrote, "Providence has blessed him with an appearance so striking that rank strangers assume he must be important."
In many ways, however, their political lives took similar paths. Both were military veterans. Hollings won a Bronze Star as an artillery officer in World War II. Lugar was too young for the war, but time as an intelligence officer briefing the Navy’s top brass deepened his interest in defense and foreign policy.
Hollings was elected governor of South Carolina at age 36. Lugar became mayor of Indianapolis at 35. Both lost their first tries for the Senate, and ran for president with abysmal results. And both represented vanishing political breeds that are sorely missed in Congress today.
Hollings was a pragmatic Southern Democrat in a state that was rapidly turning Republican, and after he retired in 2004, he was replaced by hard-edged conservative Jim DeMint. Lugar, a dedicated internationalist, was defeated in a GOP primary in 2012 by a doctrinaire right-winger, Richard Mourdock.
But the most important trait they shared was a capacity to change, grow and apply their new knowledge to practical legislative solutions. In 1986, Lugar led 31 Republicans in joining 47 Democrats to override President Reagan’s veto of a bill imposing economic sanctions on South Africa. Lugar, reported the Los Angeles Times, "was credited by the liberals with masterminding the president’s defeat."
The Republican’s most enduring success was working with Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, to enact legislation that financed the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. The Washington Post editorialized, "the program ranks as among the most successful congressional foreign policy initiatives in a generation."
One of Lugar’s protÃ©gÃ©s was a young first-term Democrat from Illinois, Barack Obama, who said of his mentor: "In Dick, I saw someone who wasn’t a Republican or a Democrat first, but a problem-solver — an example of the impact a public servant can make by eschewing partisan divisiveness to instead focus on common ground."
Hollings grew up in the segregated South, but as governor, he presided over the peaceful integration of Clemson University. "This General Assembly," he told state lawmakers, "must make clear South Carolina’s choice: a government of laws rather than a government of men."
As a senator in the late 1960s, he toured poor areas of his state and became a strong supporter of federal programs like food stamps. "There is hunger in South Carolina," he told a Senate committee. "I know as a public servant I am late to the problem, (but) we’ve got work to do in our own back yard ... I’d rather clean it up than cover it up."
In the 1980s, he worked with Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire to enact the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, which placed strict limits on congressional expenditures. It worked for a time, but eventually, clever congressional budget-busters found ways around the restrictions.
Perhaps the most memorable moment of Hollings’ career came in 2015, when he proposed that a federal courthouse named in his honor be renamed for Judge J. Waties Waring, an early and isolated voice for racial equality. "I just got the money for the building, he made history in it," Hollings explained.
The senator was being too modest. Fritz Hollings and Dick Lugar both made history. And today’s lawmakers can learn a lot from their lives of honor and courage.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a leading contractor for President Trump's inaugural committee and a former adviser to the first lady, Melania Trump, has publicly disputed accounts of her departure from the White House last year, rejecting claims from officials that she was dismissed.
Ms. Winston Wolkoff specifically took issue with suggestions by White House officials that she had been forced out because of reports that she had profited excessively from her role in helping organize inaugural events. She gave her account of what happened in a statement to The New York Times more than a year after she parted ways with the White House, where she had served as an unpaid adviser to Mrs. Trump after the inauguration.
"Was I fired? No," Ms. Winston Wolkoff said in the statement. "Did I personally receive $ 26 million or $ 1.6 million? No. Was I thrown under the bus? Yes."
It was the first time Ms. Winston Wolkoff has provided extensive public comments about the events around her split from the White House, including characterizations at the time by White House officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, that she had been forced out because of reports about lavish spending on the inauguration.
Her lawyer recently informed inaugural committee officials that she had been cooperating since last fall with federal prosecutors in Manhattan who are investigating the committee's spending and fund-raising.
In breaking so publicly with the White House, she became the latest in a growing group of former aides or employees who have begun speaking out about feeling mistreated by Mr. Trump, his family and his advisers and who have documentation to back up their statements.
Ms. Winston Wolkoff was one of Mrs. Trump's earliest advisers, a friend from the first lady's days in New York and one of the few trusted aides who helped put together initiatives for her official government portfolio. Ms. Winston Wolkoff, a New York socialite who is best known for her role in producing the Met Gala, joined the planning for the inauguration, along with others from the president's orbit, including most of his adult children, in a hastily arranged setup after Mr. Trump's surprise victory, all of them forced together by circumstance.
The inaugural committee was led by Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a financier and a longtime friend of Mr. Trump's. He was assisted by Rick Gates, who had been a deputy campaign chairman for Mr. Trump in 2016, working under Paul Manafort. The inaugural committee raised more than any other in history, $ 107 million, and spent lavishly on events, including two major dinners.
Ms. Winston Wolkoff worked mostly behind the scenes with the Trumps, primarily Mrs. Trump, until February 2018, when the presidential inaugural committee filed a financial disclosure statement showing that an entity she had incorporated, WIS Media Partners, was paid roughly $ 26 million. Of that, officials said at the time, her own firm received $ 1.62 million, which was spread among more than a dozen contractors.
Ms. Winston Wolkoff said she could not discuss the inaugural spending, saying that she had signed a nondisclosure agreement with the committee that had no expiration date. If the committee "were to release me from this obligation, I would be able to speak freely without the fear of legal or financial repercussions," she said. "Otherwise, I am regrettably unable to provide any substantive comment."
But documents reviewed by The Times showed that she had personally received about $ 500,000, a figure first reported by Vanity Fair. The documents show that a further $ 425,000 went to three producers, two of whom are associated with Mark Burnett, the creator of the reality-television show "The Apprentice," which brought Mr. Trump fame over 14 seasons. And $ 2 million of the WIS money was used to cover costs related to the events-planning firm Hargrove, the committee's second-largest vendor, the documents show.
The bulk of the $ 26 million to WIS, which handled a range of production issues including the broadcasting rights, was spent on an entity created by two of the three producers, called Inaugural Productions, the documents show. Other top vendors were David Monn, a New York-based events planner, who received nearly $ 4 million. He worked with Ms. Winston Wolkoff on the first Governor's Ball at the White House, according to a person close to her.
Another top vendor, PRG, was paid $ 2.7 million, a cost that merely covered the staging for a group of performers who worked with the casino magnate Steve Wynn, according to people briefed on the spending.
After the initial round of articles in The Times and elsewhere about Ms. Winston Wolkoff and the money received by WIS, senior administration officials privately said she had been ousted from her job, primarily because the president and the first lady were angry over the spending and because officials at both the White House and the inaugural committee had found her difficult to work with.
Yet in private communications with Ms. Winston Wolkoff on Feb. 20, 2018, a deputy White House counsel, Stefan Passantino, told her that the administration was terminating all types of "gratuitous service agreements," the type of employment agreement she had with the White House, around the same time amid a controversy over security clearances involving other officials.
She was assured by Mr. Passantino that "you didn't do anything wrong, and there's nothing wrong with this kind of contract, and I don't want you to think that this has anything to do with" the inaugural spending, she recalled. "So this is not personal."
In a letter written that same day and reviewed by The Times, Mrs. Trump told Ms. Winston Wolkoff that the decision affected "all" such contracts, was "not personal" and was made on a "professional level by White House counsel."
In the statement to The Times, Ms. Winston Wolkoff said Mrs. Trump's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, had given reporters at the time a "misleading statement about these events."
Ms. Grisham, she said, "said that because she had been 'inundated' with questions following press reports about the" inaugural committee, "a decision was made to state publicly that I had been 'severed.' That was not fair or accurate."
She said Ms. Grisham had "informed me that she had consulted with others within the White House and it was decided that 'this messaging is the best way to go in order to minimize the negative press stories of today and protect"' the first lady and the administration.
Mr. Passantino, who has left the White House, declined to comment. In an email, Ms. Grisham said: "The White House ended Mrs. Wolkoff's contract, period. I'm not going to waste my time arguing the semantics of what the word 'severed' means simply because someone decided to run to the media with hurt feelings and a bruised ego. As stated more than a year ago, I wish Mrs. Wolkoff well."
Over the past several months, the inaugural committee has drawn scrutiny from a number of law enforcement agencies.
Ms. Winston Wolkoff may have inadvertently prompted the first investigation when she relayed her concerns about the committee to Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, a friend, who recorded the conversation. The prosecutors in Manhattan, who were conducting a separate investigation of Mr. Cohen, found the recording on his cellphone. Mr. Cohen reported to prison in upstate New York on Monday after pleading guilty to personal financial crimes and arranging a hush-money scheme to pay off two women who said they had had affairs with Mr. Trump.
Last fall, the prosecutors sought Ms. Winston Wolkoff's help with their investigation of the committee, and she agreed. Mr. Cohen has helped them as well.

Byron York: No question there was spying on Trump campaign, but how much?

Texto completo: At a contentious hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General William Barr dropped a big hint about his investigation into the conduct of the Trump-Russia investigation.
"Many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a FISA warrant," Barr said. "I would like to find out whether that is in fact true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop the threat as it is being represented."
Here is what he meant. There has been a lot of discussion on the Right about the FBI's use of a confidential informant, an England-based college professor named Stefan Halper, to spy on some Trump campaign figures, including the sometime foreign policy volunteer advisers George Papadopoulos and Carter Page. There has also been talk about the FBI's use of a FISA warrant, a court-approved permission to wiretap, against Page.
There was also speculation about other possible FBI surveillance, but the Halper operation and Page FISA case were the only ones definitely known. So Barr was saying: If the FBI really took the Trump-Russia matter seriously, if they thought it was a threat to the republic, would that be all they would do? No other wiretaps or other surveillance? No other confidential informants? Nothing?
Given that Barr was already looking into the question, his phrasing suggested he suspected there was more.
Sure enough, just days later the New York Times reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI sent an undercover agent, a woman who went by the alias Azra Turk, to London to pose as Halper's research assistant and tease information out of Papadopoulos. (The Times was so reluctant to call Turk a spy that it referred to her, in a headline, as a "cloaked investigator.")
So now there are Halper, Turk, and the Page FISA warrant. If they represent the totality of the FBI's surveillance, that would still be a pretty anemic response to what some in the bureau viewed as a full-scale Russian attack on American democracy.
So the key question of the Barr investigation will be: Is there more?
The answer is not publicly known. But consider this: The Mueller report noted that on Aug. 2, 2017, the Justice Department authorized the special counsel to investigate specific allegations against four Trump campaign officials: Page and Papadopoulos, plus former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former security adviser Michael Flynn. Is it reasonable to believe that the FBI pulled out the big investigative guns, the spies and the wiretap warrant, against the two smaller figures, Page and Papadopoulos, and not against the far more important figures of Manafort and Flynn? Or if not against them, perhaps against others?
It wasn't that long ago, on April 10, when, during another Hill appearance, Barr set off a firestorm by declaring that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign. Democrats pounced; how dare Barr call the FBI's investigation "spying"?
"Perpetuating conspiracy theories is beneath the office of attorney general," tweeted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
It is abundantly clear that Barr was correct. He was careful to add that the unknown factor about the spying was "whether it was adequately predicated" — that is, whether the FBI had a legitimate reason to do it. But there was no doubt spying happened.
Now, the question is whether there was more than is now publicly known. Congressional investigators are anxiously awaiting the results of an investigation into at least some of the surveillance by Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz. That report is thought to be coming in the next couple of months. They are also watching to see what Barr will investigate on his own.
Both are deeply important efforts. Just as the public needed to know what is in the Mueller report, it needs to know about the FBI's secret political operations in the 2016 campaign.

A New Wotan Reigns in the Met's 'Ring'

Texto completo: It is one of the pinnacle roles in all of opera: Wotan, king of the gods in Wagner's epic "Ring." It's a nearly fathomless part that demands a beautiful voice, power, subtle acting, keen intelligence and stamina. Great Wotans don't exactly grow on trees.
At the Metropolitan Opera, the German baritone Michael Volle has donned an eye patch and picked up a spear to sing his first complete "Ring" cycle (performances continue through May 11). Here, three of The New York Times's classical music writers -- Michael Cooper, a reporter, Joshua Barone, a senior staff editor and critic, and Seth Colter Walls, a critic -- discuss his astonishing performance so far.
MICHAEL COOPER I was struck by how Mr. Volle navigated a chilling moment in "Die Walküre," the second "Ring" opera.
Wotan has just reluctantly caused the death of his own son by intervening in an earthly battle.
His sad duty done, the heartbroken, furious god dismissively dispatches the victor he has just assisted, and, with just a word -- "Geh!" ("Go!") -- strikes his son's killer dead.
Some great Wotans of the past would almost whisper that "geh," including Hans Hotter, whose recordings I literally wore out, and James Morris, whose rich, fluid voice made him the Wotan of my youth. I once heard John Tomlinson practically roar it, and Bryn Terfel contemptuously snarl it.
Mr. Volle growled it ferociously -- the kind of growl it almost hurts your throat to hear. But he returned in the next act singing as well as ever. One moment he was terrifying in his wrath, the next he was singing the tenderest, most lieder-like of lullabies in his farewell to his rebellious daughter, Brünnhilde. It was as gutsy, and colorfully varied, a Wotan performance as any I can remember.
JOSHUA BARONE Growl is exactly the word for that moment in "Walküre," the "Ring" opera in which he may give his best performance. But I don't want to discount his Wotan in "Das Rheingold," the opening of the "Ring," or "Siegfried," the third of the four operas -- especially since he so distinctly inhabits each stage of the god's downfall.
There wasn't a lot of nuance to Mr. Volle's "Rheingold," which I realized was exactly what the role calls for then: Wotan is fatally confident and carefree, from beginning to end. The cocksure patriarch who thinks he can manipulate his way to a free fortress is the same one who, annoyed by the Rhinemaidens lamenting their lost gold, barks at Loge to silence them as the opera comes to a close.
In "Siegfried," which he was singing for the first time, I found Mr. Volle ever more desperate.
COOPER Yes, his baritone -- which is on the bright side for a Wotan -- brought out the god's delight in toying with his foes early on. But as the night progressed, the existential terror beneath the surface kept peeking through, as the doomed god vacillated between accepting his fate and resisting it. His vocal acting made his final scene -- in which Wotan picks a stubborn old man's quarrel with the impetuous grandson he loves and loses his power -- into a "King Lear"-like tragedy.
[Video: Siegfried: "Zur Neidhöhle fuhr ich bei Nacht" Watch on YouTube.]
BARONE With each note, his characterization is clear, a trait he shares with the excellent bass-baritone Tomasz Konieczny, who is singing Alberich. That's why their shared scene in Act II of "Siegfried" -- as sung by Mr. Volle and Mr. Konieczny, a glimpse into the desperate and different ways two characters hungry for power try to reclaim it -- is a highlight of that opera, rivaled only by Mr. Volle's farewell to the saga, in Act III, in which his Wotan is by turns exasperated, determined and jaded.
[Video: Siegfried: "Wache, Wala! Wala! Erwach!" Watch on YouTube.]
But back to "Walküre": His emotional goodbye to Brünnhilde in the final scene was the first time that sadly beautiful music had me fighting back tears. And how about his monumental narrative in Act II?
SETH COLTER WALLS Yes! The Act II narrative in "Walküre" was one of the most astonishing passages of the evening, as both music and drama. When I was listening to it, I realized I was no longer bothered by the on-the-nose (on-the-eyeball?) quality of this production's video projections.
How did Mr. Volle manage that? For one thing, his scene partner here -- the soprano Christine Goerke, as Brünnhilde -- is mesmerizing even when she's just listening. It also helps that Mr. Volle gives her something to react to throughout this long bit of exposition, which can come across as a "Previously on 'Valhalla"'-type recapitulation.
Mr. Volle's Wotan has a lot of moods. In "Walküre," he knows what ails him, but he's not resigned to it, yet. He's still processing. And this Wotan's access to a quick-marshaling anger also reflects some of Wagner's stage directions: wanting the character to sound subdued during one little section, then more animated for a couple of beats, then ramped back down. (Those directions are included in a recent translation of the "Ring" librettos by Penguin Classics.) Mr. Volle observes these varied indications, even when the production is all too static.
I was lucky enough to catch one of James Morris's Wotans in the Met's previous production, by Otto Schenk. I can confirm that his voice remained luxuriously rich and smooth in this part as recently as 2008. But he was also perhaps a little too smooth, in terms of dramatic characterization. For me, the value of Mr. Volle's performance is the way it opens up new interpretive avenues.
[The musical building blocks of Wagner's "Ring."]
COOPER Those rapid changes of voice and mood allowed Mr. Volle to embody both sides of Wotan's many paradoxes: his power and impotence, his idealism and unscrupulousness, his warring desires for love and power. I have heard nobler Wotans and more craven ones, but by giving voice to both aspects Mr. Volle showed that they were not only not mutually exclusive, but intimately related.
He is 59, so it is difficult to say how long Mr. Volle's reign in Valhalla will last. He has another full "Ring" cycle this September at the Berlin State Opera, under the baton of Daniel Barenboim, and is planning to sing it in Dresden, Germany, in a future season with Christian Thielemann.
But at the Met, when he took his bow on Thursday night after singing his first complete "Ring," flipping up his eye patch to take in the cheering crowd, a bouquet of pink flowers was tossed at his feet. There was a new Wotan in the Wagnerian firmament.

Texto completo: It's still too soon to size up Yannick Nézet-Séguin's vision for the Metropolitan Opera as its music director. But his main responsibility is to preside over as many performances as possible and maintain the highest artistic standards throughout the company. Though he has led only three productions this season, his first in the role, he has proved himself exceptionally suited to the challenge in each.
In December, he led an elegant yet impassioned account of Verdi's "La Traviata." In January, he drew a dark and sensual performance of Debussy's "Pelléas et Mélisande" from an inspired orchestra and cast. And on Friday he conducted a glowing, grippingly volatile performance of Poulenc's wrenching "Dialogues des Carmélites."
[Mr. Nézet-Séguin discusses his favorite page from the "Dialogues" score.]
The opera tells the story of a Carmelite convent whose nuns are condemned to death during the French Revolution. In this revival of John Dexter's powerfully spare and dramatically dead-on 1977 production, Mr. Nézet-Séguin was consistently attentive to refinements of the music and the careful way Poulenc sets words so that vocal lines seem almost conversational, those "quintessentially French" qualities, as he said in a recent interview with The New York Times.
Yet, seizing on every piercing chord and astringent harmony, he also brought out boldly the contemporary elements of Poulenc's musical language, which subtly draws from diverse styles including modal French sacred music, Impressionist colorings and Neo-Classical fanfares and chorales, even sly hints of salon room insouciance during scenes in which aristocrats lament their political predicament.
[Video: Dialogues des Carmélites: "Oh! Ne me quittez pas" Watch on YouTube.]
The opera begins in the library of the Marquis de la Force (the sturdy baritone Jean-François Lapointe, in his Met debut), who is deeply worried about his fearful daughter, Blanche, here the resplendent mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard, who achingly conveys the fraught and shifting emotions of this complex character. Blanche's brother, the Chevalier de la Force (the sweet-voiced tenor David Portillo in an endearing performance), shares his father's concerns about Blanche. As they talk, revolution is fomenting right outside their home. Mr. Nézet-Séguin emphasized every slashing chord and tumultuous outburst during this scene. I've never heard it performed with such ferocity.
In a poignant scene, Blanche asks her father's permission to enter the Carmelite convent. But first Blanche must endure an interview with Madame de Croissy, the convent's older and ailing prioress, here the great soprano Karita Mattila. The prioress warns Blanche that the convent is not a refuge from fear, or life, or anything, but a house of devotion. But Ms. Mattila's steely prioress can't help succumbing to Blanche's touching combination of fragility and determination, as suggested by Ms. Leonard.
[Video: Dialogues des Carmélites: Act I Excerpt (Karita Mattila) Watch on YouTube.]
Ms. Mattila was harrowing during the prioress's death scene. Facing the end, writhing in pain and despair, she pleads for relief and doubts God's presence. Ms. Mattila made her character at once terrifying and a sad wreck of a woman.
As written by Poulenc, these sisters come together as a religious community in ensemble scenes of prayer, deliberation and crisis. Yet he gives each of them a distinct character; under Mr. Nézet-Séguin (and the revival stage director, David Kneuss), these impressive singers found their individual dramatic voices, especially the beguiling, pure-toned soprano Erin Morley as the chatterbox Constance; the mezzo-soprano Karen Cargill as the benevolent Mother Marie, who longs for martyrdom with her "daughters" but is denied it; and the soprano Adrianne Pieczonka as Madame Lidoine, the new prioress, who arrives with a slightly sanctimonious air, only to find inner strength and heroism.
[Video: Dialogues des Carmélites: "Salve Regina" Watch on YouTube.]
The final scene, in which the nuns, one by one, walk to the guillotine singing Poulenc's forlornly beautiful setting of the Salve Regina, felt more horrific than ever. And moving -- perhaps because artists of a new generation have taken over this great work, this classic production and, in a way, the Met, starting with Mr. Nézet-Séguin.

Texto completo: Hillary Clinton said on Saturday she is advising candidates about what it is like to have an election "stolen" during an "Evening with the Clintons" event in Los Angeles, Calif.
"You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you," Clinton said she has been telling candidates who have come to see her. The comment was met with cheers.
Clinton's 2016 campaign was targeted by Russian interference efforts, which included stolen emails from her campaign chairman that were leaked to the public, and a social media disinformation effort.

Tweet
The two-time failed presidential candidate has a long list of people and entities for which she has blamed for her defeat to President Trump, including but not limited to misogyny, the FBI, sexism, the National Rifle Association, and Russia. Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots, but lost the Electoral College 304 to 227.
Clinton has warned that Russia will reengage and try to boost Trump in the 2020 election, and said during an event last weekend that she has told candidates, "there would still be factors that would undermine a legitimate election."
Clinton's latest comments come weeks after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling, which found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, but left open the question of obstruction of justice by the president. Although Attorney General William Barr said he determined there was insufficient evidence for obstruction, Clinton remarked: "The Mueller report could not be clearer, the Russians interfered in our election and Trump obstructed justice."
The appearance also follows new details from a recently released update to New York Times Chief White House Correspondent Peter Baker’s book Obama: The Call of History, which said former President Barack Obama blamed Clinton for Trump's 2016 victory, seeing it as a "personal insult," and pinned it specifically on his former secretary of state's "scripted, soulless campaign."
According to the New York Post, the price of tickets for Bill and Hillary Clinton's speaking tour have dropped significantly since it was announced in November.

Texto completo: When I first began using the "virus" analogy to describe the rapid spread of misinformation and its potential to do serious harm, I didn't realize how fitting, or timely, that comparison would become.
The recent outbreaks of measles, one of the most contagious diseases in the world, make that connection alarmingly real.
Thanks to a safe and effective vaccine, measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. Yet this year, as of April 26, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 704 cases of this potentially deadly illness in 22 states. More than 500 of those cases were in people who had not been vaccinated. On April 15, the World Health Organization reported that measles cases in the first quarter of this year were up 300% over the same period in 2018. This year looms as the worst one for measles in the U.S. in decades.
What changed? In recent years, the "anti-vaxxer" movement has flooded social media platforms with misinformation questioning the safety of vaccinations. Articles, videos and posts replete with conspiracy theories, hoaxes and pseudoscience have, well, gone viral. Many people have been persuaded to make health-care decisions based on provocative, frightening and false content that puts their children, and their communities, at risk.
The internet often acts as an echo chamber, serving up content to reinforce a person's opinions regardless of compelling evidence to the contrary. Anti-vaxxers have benefited from this phenomenon. New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote this about them in March: "They turn to the internet, which is both a hall of mirrors and an overstuffed bazaar. It lets them customize their input and thus tailor their reality, which is reinforced by the like-minded company they keep online."
Life or death information Information is the basis for many of the decisions we make, and those decisions, in turn, become the basis for our actions. In the case of vaccination, these actions can have life-and-death consequences.
Online anti-vaxxer communities cross political, religious, geographic and income divides. What they have in common is their steadfast belief in dangerous and disproven information — including that vaccines cause autism, or that toxic compounds are used in the formulas.
For years, studies have repeatedly shown the safety of vaccines and their role in saving lives. Most recently, a study published in April in the Annals of Internal Medicine looked at data from more than 650,000 children in Denmark and found no link between autism and the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Yet those false claims persist.
The tangible consequences from the anti-vaxxers' misinformation campaigns are lower rates of vaccination and the all-but-inevitable outbreaks of disease. Those who refuse to vaccinate their children not only put their sons and daughters at risk, but potentially make others who come into contact with them vulnerable as well.

‘Heartbeat bills’ wholesome provocations

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — While constitutional lawyers, ethicists and theologians -- in descending order of importance in the abortion debate -- have been arguing in the 46 years since the Supreme Court attempted to settle the debate, some technologists have been making a consequential contribution to it. They have developed machines that produce increasingly vivid sonograms of fetal development. This concreteness partially explains the intensification of the debate.
Six states have passed “heartbeat bills” to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, approximately six weeks after conception. Such bills are, indeed, unconstitutional given the court’s Roe ukase that abortion cannot be restricted before a fetus is viable outside the womb — which means, presumably, before the fetus is a child.
But why should “viability” be the dispositive criterion? Viable means capable of surviving outside the womb, which no infant can do without constant help that others must give. Must. No infants are “viable” in that all are helpless, and the law requires that help be given by those responsible for the infant.
A New York Times editorial (Dec. 28, 2018) opposing the idea that “a fetus in the womb has the same rights as a fully formed person” spoke of these living fetuses — that they are living is an elementary biological fact, not an abstruse theological deduction — as “clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings.” Now, delete the obfuscating and constitutionally irrelevant adjective “viable,” and look at a sonogram of a ten-week fetus. Note the eyes and lips, the moving fingers and, yes, the beating heart. Is this most suitably described as a “cluster of cells” or as a baby? The cluster-of-cells contingent resembles Chico Marx in the movie “Duck Soup”: “Who ya gonna believe, me or your own eyes?”
The “heartbeat bills” are wholesome provocations: One of their aims is to provoke thinking about the moral dimension of extinguishing a being with a visibly beating heart. Furthermore, pro-life people are being provoked in different ways.
Last month, Kansas’ Supreme Court found in this from the state constitution —- “All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” — a reason to overturn the state’s ban on D&E (dilation-and-evacuation) abortions that involve dismemberment of the living fetus. In February, after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order to enforce taxpayer-funded abortions, Democratic legislators decided that not even that was enough. They introduced a bill to create a right to abortion for any reason at any point in a pregnancy, a bill similar to legislation enacted or advancing in other Democratic-controlled states. In February, all but three Democratic U.S. senators opposed, thereby killing, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse’s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that would have required, in the rare cases in which a child survives a botched abortion procedure, that the survivor receive the standard professional care that would be given to any child born alive at the same gestational age.
The 1850s debates that propelled Abraham Lincoln to greatness concerned not whether slavery should be abolished forthwith, which was neither a constitutional nor political possibility. Rather, the debates concerned two other questions: Would national policy stigmatize slavery as a tragic legacy and a moral wrong? And: Would policy confine slavery to its existing dominion by banning it from the territories, thereby, Lincoln thought, putting it on a path to ultimate extinction?
Temperate pro-life advocates, practicing Lincolnian prudence, consider the abortion debate akin to the slavery debates for three reasons: Abortion shrinks the scope of the concept of personhood. The issue has been inflamed by judicial fiat (Roe v. Wade as Dred Scott v. Sandford). And confining a morally objectionable practice is a worthy, albeit not fully satisfying, objective.
The changed composition of the Supreme Court, and the supposed imminent danger that Roe will be overturned, is the excuse that pro-abortion extremists have seized upon to do what they want to do anyway: to normalize extreme abortion practices expressive of the belief that never does fetal life have more moral significance than a tumor in a mother’s stomach. (Most European nations restrict abortions by at least week 13. France and Germany are very restrictive after 12, Sweden after 18.) The court’s new composition has encouraged some pro-life advocates in their maximum hope, that Roe can be overturned, which would not proscribe abortion but would restore its pre-1973 status as a practice states can regulate. This is not a foreseeable possibility; a more nuanced abortion regime is.

Texto completo: A los 12 años, Viko Ortega perdió a su padre, un hecho que le causó dolor, pero al mismo tiempo lo orilló a buscar una nueva oportunidad en su vida y ayudar a su familia. Un año después, el originario de Peña Colorada, Puebla , comenzó a hornear pan, oficio que fue el comienzo de la ruta que lo llevaría a convertirse en el chef ejecutivo de la cadena estadounidense ARK Restaurants , éxito que logró empatar con su propio restaurante, La Flor , conocido en Queens como “un rincón de París en Woodside” y cuyos platillos tienen un profundo toque mexicano.
Hellen y su hija Angela llevan siete años almorzando o cenando en este restaurante ubicado en la esquina de la Calle 53 y la avenida Roosevelt, en Queens, saliendo de la Estación 52 de la Línea 7 del Metro. Ellas viven en la zona y destacan el “espíritu familiar” del lugar, pero también el toque “romántico y la calidez” con el que es atendido, algo que Viko ha logrado con ayuda de su familia y su esposa, Rita, a quien conoció a los 7 años .
“Pienso que es porque es un restaurante familiar, trabaja mi esposa y mis hijos trabajaron por acá”, contó sentado en una mesa cercano a la barra –diseñada con losa que recuerda a la talavera poblana– que divide la cocina abierta de los comensales. “Nunca me he salido del enfoque de los ingredientes mexicanos, solo que al mismo tiempo combino el ingrediente mexicano con el europeo, asiático y americano… es como una fusión, sin olvidarme del ingrediente básico, que es el mexicano” .
Apenas entrado a sus años 20, Viko dejó la naturaleza de su pueblo, por donde pasa el Río Mixteco, el más importante de la región, para asentarse cerca de otros ríos y bahías, como el Hudson, el East River en Nueva York. Su primer trabajo fue en una imprenta, pero no le gustó. Pronto volvió a lo suyo, la cocina, al tiempo que estudió inglés para lograr mejores oportunidades.
“Me vine con la idea de venir acá, trabajar un año y seguir mis estudios universitarios, lo cual nunca pasó”, reconoce sin arrepentimiento. En EEUU nacieron sus hijos, quienes ahora exploran otros caminos, siguiendo el espíritu migratorio de su padre. “ Después de 14 años acá se me ocurrió la idea de abrir algo para mí… con un cuñado mío, le dije hay que hacerlo a nuestro estilo… yo tenía un abuelo que hacía estas cosas de cerámica, las mesas”.
El lugar que cumplirá en junio 19 años comenzó como una cafetería, pero ahora ofrece platillos que Viko no considera como “gourmet”, aunque el chef compartió que uno de sus primeros clientes –un amigo colombiano dueño de restaurantes– probó “un salmón con un puré de papa, alcaparras y una salsa de espinacas con vino blanco” . Viko no lo dice, pero la definición de gourmet se acerca a ese platillo que explora olores y sabores. Al amigo le encantó y le sugirió “olvidar los frijoles y el arroz”, ya que había muchos restaurantes alrededor ofreciendo lo mismo. El naciente empresario siguió el consejo e integró el “Pan-roasted Atlantic salmon” al menú.
¿Podría definir la comida como americana con un gran toque mexicano? , le pregunté al poblano, quien lo pensó unos segundos. “Podría ser eso”, hizo una pausa. “Lo defino más como Viko, es una mezcla de todo”. Las etiquetas no son importantes para él, pero reconoce que los ingredientes mexicanos, como la hoja de aguacate, la pipicha (similar al cilantro), la flor de calabaza, los chiles, y decenas de especias y vegetales, no esconden su origen.
A pesar de sus éxitos, Viko es un hombre sencillo, amable, de sonrisa fácil, a quien puede observarse cocinar y ensimismarse en el proceso . Su restaurante –donde también se pueden disfrutar vinos mexicanos, italianos, españoles o americanos– ha sido reseñado en The New York Times, New York Magazine y Time Out, por mencionar algunas publicaciones, insertadas en un collage que pende de uno de los muros y destaca por su color naranja y colabora a la acogedora atmósfera que en las noches de fin de semana se aderezan con jazz en vivo.
Al chef no le gusta mucho la idea de escoger sus “platillos favoritos”, pero ante la insistencia destaca “Lamb shank”, preparado con un estofado en vino tinto, verduras, especias mexicanas, sobre puré de papas y espinacas, y las “Barbecue baby back ribs”, creadas con un asado lento en salsa de chipotle, sobre puré de papas, con ensalada de col mexicana.
A Hellen y Angela les gusta todo lo que han probado en La Flor, pero disfrutan mucho los desayunos, las enmoladas, aunque esa mañana disfrutaron las “Bourbon vanilla French toast”, acompañadas con un jarabe de maple de la casa y reducción de fruta.
Viko afirma que no celebra el 5 de Mayo, pero la gente va a festejar a veces ese día en su restaurante, donde sí ofrece un menú especial para el Día de San Valentín o el Día de las Madres y el Año Nuevo. Ahora trabaja en un nuevo menú, que estrenará en dos o tres semanas.
El inmigrante mexicano, naturalizado estadounidense, agradece las oportunidades que este país le dio y defiende la importancia de “portarse bien” y “dedicarse a trabajar”, para demostrar que los inmigrantes tienen valía, pero hay que saber demostrarla.
“No tratar de pensar que estamos en nuestro país, estamos aquí como inmigrantes, lo más importante aquí es respetar las reglas… todos venimos aquí por una causa”, expresó y criticó aquellas personas que se pierden en los vicios, como el alcohol y las drogas, hacen desmanes y terminan durmiendo en las calles. “Nos daña, no solo a nosotros, daña a toda la comunidad hispana… no van a decir es mexicano, guatemalteco… todos nos vemos similares y eso da de qué hablar, que nos juzguen… Recordar que venimos a trabajar y respetar y no dejar que abusen… respeto no significa humillación ”.

Texto completo: Academics depict the peer-review process as the gold standard for intellectual honesty, ensuring published scholarly work is unbiased and accurate. But ideological conformity makes peer review a far thinner defense than advertised.
In January I published a book about the mental-health and violence risks of cannabis. Several dozen scholars signed a petition expressing in unison their objection to my work. Thus I've recently spent an inordinate amount of time reading papers seeking to prove that marijuana is a cure-all whose deleterious consequences are a figment of our collective imagination. The shoddiness of much of the work has shocked me.
Example: Driving deaths have risen more than 30% in Colorado and Washington, the first states to legalize marijuana for recreational use, since dispensaries opened there in 2014. That rise is more than double the national change. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reported in October that the number of vehicle accidents overall were up faster in legalized states than the rest of the nation.
Nonetheless, researchers have claimed legalization doesn't increase driving deaths. Last year, Benjamin Hansen of the University of Oregon and two other researchers wrote a paper looking at the rise in vehicular deaths in which drivers had THC in their blood. They found such deaths rose in Colorado and Washington at rates "similar" to those in other states.
In fact, the data showed that legalization explains about half the increase in Colorado and Washington. But because the data were limited, the results had wide confidence intervals, which means it's possible but not probable that the postlegalization gap was the result of chance. A more honest way to report the results would have been to say that the paper had found a worrisome trend in cannabis-linked deaths, which more data might confirm.
Violent crime has also soared in the legalized states since 2013. Yet last month two criminologists claimed in a Seattle Times op-ed that they had found "no increase in violent crime that can be directly attributed to marijuana legalization." That formulation makes the statement a trivial truth. Without examining every murder, no one can say legalization has directly driven the increase.
The authors explain in the op-ed that they based their statement on a paper they co-wrote. They don't name it, but the only published paper listing them as co-authors is a 2018 study called "Marijuana Legalization and Crime Clearance Rates." It didn't even examine whether crime had risen or fallen. It looked only at whether police were likelier to solve, or clear, crimes after legalization. But so what? If murders double from 100 to 200, and the police solve 50 the first year and 110 the second, the clearance rate has risen, but so has the crime rate.
Some of the research is comical. A paper published in March reported that cannabis use seemed to increase "satisfactory orgasms" in women. The paper divided subjects into three categories: nonusers, users who answered yes when asked if they used the drug "before sex," and users who answered no. But it presented results on sexual satisfaction only from the last two categories—not from women who don't use marijuana at all. The paper provides no data at all comparing users with nonusers.
I could offer a half-dozen other examples of dubious scientific practices—using nonstandard data sets, relying unnecessarily on "synthesized comparators" that are inherently vulnerable to manipulation, and "p-hacking" by looking at endless secondary outcomes until one pops up that reaches the threshold for statistical significance.
The tricks can be hard to find—and journalists, who are almost never trained in science or statistical analysis, often parrot the results unskeptically, especially when the findings confirm their own biases toward ideology or sensationalism. When car accidents and violent crime are involved, the results can be deadly.

Conservative views a big part of mainstream media coverage

Texto completo: I must confess that I scratch my pointy independent voter head whenever I hear a conservative grouse that "the media" is biased.
Fox News appears to meet the definition of "media" — "broadcasting, publishing, and the Internet, regarded collectively" — as does Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., the Wall Street Journal, New York Post, Washington Times, Washington Examiner, Breitbart and many other publications and websites regarded as conservative.
Yet there is still a complaint that conservative views aren't being heard in the mainstream. Again, I scratch. Fox is perennially America's most-watched cable news network, with 2.4 million prime time viewers compared to liberal rivals MSNBC (1.9 million) and CNN (1.058 million).
Among talking heads, Fox's Sean Hannity is king, with 3.12 million viewers. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow pulls in 3.05 million, but Fox holds six of the top 10 cable news program spots.
Most importantly, Hannity and Fox are tighter than spandex with President Trump, thanks to their unabashed support. Hannity's phone interview with him on March 27 drew an audience of 4.3 million. And the pews aren't filled entirely by the faithful. Folks of all political leanings tune in to the left and right if only to aggravate themselves.
Other numbers to chew: Three of the top five radio shows are hosted by conservatives: Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin. (The other two are financial advice guru Dave Ramsey, a conservative evangelical Christian, and the somewhat less reverent Howard Stern.)
Meanwhile, Sinclair is one of America's largest, most diversified broadcasting companies — 191 TV stations, 602 channels, affiliations with all major networks — and the nation's top local news provider.
Then we have media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The recent New York Times feature on his political accomplishments as the owner of Fox and newspapers in the U.S., U.K. and Australia should give conservatives reasons to be cheerful.
All of that ain't small potatoes.
I suspect the right's aggravation is mostly due to differing views being widely heard in major outlets like ABC, CBS, NBC, the New York Times, Washington Post and NPR. Liberals grumble about media bias, too, and bias is always an outrage ... unless it echoes your own. Neither side likes the other to be heard in the war to sway those who are in the middle.
I'm focusing on conservatives here because I'm intrigued by their accusations of censorship and suppression by Google, social media, and colleges.
Trump's Tweets are hard to miss, and I have no trouble finding conservative voices on social media. Even NPR and the New York Times occasionally feature them. However, my Google search of "Mueller Report" on its Chrome browser yielded only one conservative site, Fox, on the second page of results despite Fox carrying Attorney General William Barr's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at the time.
As for free speech at universities, I believe all voices within reason should be allowed a say. My pet theory is that at least some resistance to conservative views is due to the right being so closely associated with strident nationalism of the kind that is hostile to minorities, and contempt for things like environmental protection and social justice. Fair or not, conservatism has an image problem outside its own borders.
High-profile firebrands like white supremacist/avid Trump supporter Richard Spenser or even truculent commentator Ann Coulter trying to spread the word on campuses likely isn't the most effective way to win hearts and minds in these volatile times. Of course, if all you're spoiling for is a fight, then you gotta love what you're getting.
On the whole, I think the word from the right is being heard by the entire nation. Everyone agreeing with what they hear is another matter.
Taking It Personally

HORSE RACING NEEDS TO BE MUCH SAFER AFTER HARD WINTER, A TROUBLE-FREE SATURDAY IS MUST

Texto completo: LOUISVILLE, Ky.
Most mornings, the Kentucky Derby happy talk has been the happiest it has been in years:
* After proving that the Triple Crown had not gone the way of the rotary phone, Bob Baffert is back for more. He'll come to Churchill Downs Saturday with not one, not two, but three precocious horses capable of making Baffert the first trainer in more than 60 years to win six Derbies.
* Hardboots still melt at the sound of "My Ol' Kentucky Home."
* Jockey Mike Smith wants his third Derby winner. Shug McGaughey is determined to train his second. You'll hear Hall of Famers like Bill Mott and Steve Asmussen squeal like toddlers if they win their first.
* The Churchill Downs grandstand gets taller, wider and fancier. The best tickets fetch premium prices. The red carpet has TMZ hyperventilating.
* Sources say New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and his posse are primed to enjoy the Derby as much as they enjoy beating the Steelers.
Have I forgotten anything about the mile-and-a-quarter race that will crackle over the Churchill racing surface late Saturday afternoon?
Just this: Racing needs a clean, competitive and injury-free day. No breakdowns. No spills. No euthanized horses.
Derby 145 has already lost two horses, including the likely favorite, Omaha Beach, with injuries. The last thing it needs is an ugly visual on international television.
The sport won't be holding its breath for two minutes and change. It will be holding its breath all weekend.
"It's been fun this week," Baffert said. "It's been fun being out at the barn every morning and seeing all the people who love to come out and watch the horses. It's been a relief to be out of [Santa Anita]."
Santa Anita and horse racing suffered this spring. In just over three months, 23 horses died at the southern California track that is the home to talented horsemen such as Baffert, Richard Mandella and Doug O'Neill. Four horses died during the 16-day spring meet in Keeneland.
Concern from animal rights groups percolated into political pressure that was also stirred by casual fans asking why so many horses died. The discussion escalated from a debate about the ethics of whipping horses and administering medication that masks pain.
The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and Sports Illustrated all opened Derby Week by reporting detailed stories on the complex challenges horse racing faces as it tries to protect its spot in the sports entertainment world.
The headline in the New York Times was particularly stinging:
"Horse Deaths Are Threatening the Racing Industry; Is the Sport Obsolete?"
Obsolete?
Obsolete is a harsh word, one that critics have pinned on boxing. It's a word and story that inspired its share of bristles on the Churchill backside this week.
"I think we're all concerned, we're all trying to improve and we're all trying to make it a safer sport," trainer Todd Pletcher said.
"But, you know, the one thing is when you have Bucket List events like the Kentucky Derby, I think we'll always be OK."
OK? Maybe.
But racing should aspire to be greater than OK. The debate about horse safety has been as overdue in racing as the concussion discussion was in football.
The culture moves. Racing can't pretend it doesn't. A lack of marketing imagination and decisive leadership over the past four decades pushed the game into the niche sport role where it exists today. It can't risk not paying attention to what critics are saying today.
When I covered my first Kentucky Derby 1979, it was a Must Cover event for sportswriting titans like Red Smith, Jim Murray, Furman Bisher, Blackie Sherrod and Dave Kindred. It slipped from Must Cover status many years ago.
What the culture is telling racing today is the game must reexamine its policies on medication, especially on race day, while continuing research on the safest possible racing surfaces. At Santa Anita, Baffert and others argued the issue was excessive rainfall that made the racing surface too hard. Regardless, too many horses died.
"I've never seen so many trainers depressed and beaten down," Baffert said. "We were just waiting and wondering. We didn't know what our future was going to be. Are we going to have jobs? What's going to happen?"
A day like Saturday can be a reminder of the sights, sounds and smells that make horse racing such a glorious sport. It is a sport of hard-working earnest people as well as determined animals, a sport for the multi-million dollar owner as well as the $2 bettor and a sport that will inspire 170,000 people to scream their lungs out as the Derby field thunders into the stretch.
But it is also a sport that needs to be the safest it can be, especially Saturday with the sporting world watching.

With anti-Semitism on the rise, Jews must call out hatred on the left and the right

Texto completo: Es iz schwer tzu sein a yid. It is hard to be a Jew. — Sholem Aleichem
The recent deadly assault on the Chabad temple in Poway — just six months after a bloodier massacre in Pittsburgh — reflects the sad reality that anti-Semitism in all its hoary forms, is back.
This is, if anything, even more the case in Europe, where Jewish populations are under siege and are almost one-third as large as right after the Holocaust.
Sadly, confronted by such incidents, the Jewish community, reflecting the deep fissures of American society, seems divided by political orientation. The conservative faction, sometimes aligned to President Trump, focuses largely on growing anti-Semitism on the political left often downplayed by progressive Jews who focus on the scattered, albeit sometimes deadly, expression of anti-Semitism among scattered white nationalists.
The problem here is that both the far-right and the progressive left represent clear and present dangers to Jews around the world. The proper response to incidents at Poway, as well as those perpetrated by the political left, should not be division, but a common sense of unity in the face of a growing, and, until recently, largely unexpected threat.
The two faces of Jew-hatred
Historically, anti-Semitism has fed on two different, although sometimes aligned, perceptions. The first, dating back to classical times, was based on a notion of “otherness “. In ancient Greece and Rome, that was in large part because Jewish monotheism clashed with the dominant state-sanctioned polytheism. Later this hatred was reinforced by Christian, and later Muslim, intolerance. Jewish ideas may have underpinned both faiths, but the refusal to embrace “the true and only” divine relation infuriated religious zealots of the new religions.
In medieval societies, emerged a conspiratorial strain of anti-Semitism that maintained that a secret cabal of Jews was seeking, or even have achieved, world domination. This melding of the othering and conspiracy was mostly embraced on the right and turned into policy in Nazi Germany.
Even today the far right in Poland and other European countries — where roughly one in four hold anti-Semitic views — retains such memes even if their countries are largely judenrein. The unhinged alt-right of the Charlottesville marchers, as well as the lone wolf shooters in both Pittsburgh and Poway, embraced this particularly virulent ideology.
“The socialism of fools”
America’s progressive Jews, dominant in the non-Orthodox rabbinate, have had a harder time confronting the rise of left-wing anti-Semitism, which focuses on Jews as capitalist exploiters or Israel as a neo-colonialist power. The German social democratic leader August Bebel is widely credited describing this as “the socialism of fools.”
Groups like the Anti-Defamation League like to focus on right-wing hate groups, but their statistics have been roundly criticized in such respected magazine as Tablet, and are widely thought to reflect their predictably progressive bias.
Others accuse President Trump as inciting anti-Semitism. But despite his poorly chosen comments about “good people” on both sides in Charlottesville, Trump has been arguably the most pro-Israel president since Truman and the first president with Jewish grandchildren; for this, he was bitterly denounced by both the Pittsburgh and Poway shooters.
The progressive Jews own sense of moral superiority and desire to push “social justice” as the core of their identity — conflicts with the reality that , in both Europe and North America, the strongest anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel, political movements come from on the left. In Great Britain, for example, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has embraced the virulently anti-Jewish Hamas and attending ceremonies laying wreaths at the graves of such “heroes” as the terrorist killers at the 1972 Munich games.
Anti-Zionist, and anti-Jewish, sentiments are most commonly found in progressive bastions like college campuses, where “third world” oriented academics push “disinvestment” from Israel. Pitched merely as anti-Zionism, these same political warriors rarely favor actions against far more repressive states as China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Worse yet, , for the first time in decades, there are now anti-Semitic members of Congress , led by Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose pronouncements about Jews, money and “dual loyalty” have been tolerated by a party leadership intimidated by the rising left.
Normalizing anti-Semitism
We are witnessing the normalization of anti-Semitism. Democratic Presidential candidates, most recently Pete Buttigieg, seek out the blessings of the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton, a past dealer in anti-Semitic calumnies. The New York Times recently printed, in its International edition, a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu leading a blind, Kippur-wearing President Trump that would not have been out of place in Julius Streicher’s Nazi era Der Stürmer.
In Europe, far more than America, anti-Semitism is also rising on the right. In Belgium, Jewish caricatures have been on display at local festivals despite complaints. And in Germany, one official of the rightist Alternative for Germany party, dismissed the Holocaust as “a speck of birds*** in 1,000 years of glorious German history.”
Faced with what could become a permanent threat, Jews, and their friends in other religious communities, should confront anti-Semitism in all its forms. Divisions about fighting hatred serve to empower the haters, and make us all, of any faith, more vulnerable.

Texto completo: LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- At the Kentucky Derby, for nearly 20 years now, as I make my rounds at Churchill Downs, I hear two phrases dozens of times.
One is a question: "Who do you like?"
The other is a prayer: "Let's just get 'em all around there safely."
In my early days, I was far more eager to answer the question than reflect on the prayer. For the 150,000-plus fans expected here and the millions more watching on television, picking a winner, enjoying the hats, absorbing a truly American spectacle and a bourbon or two have become part of the fabric of the event.
The horse, after all, was our partner in settling this country. This is the 145th running of America's most famous thoroughbred race. Racing horses predates baseball.
[Read our expert picks for the Kentucky Derby]
The prayers, however, are what captivate me now. The people who murmur them do so daily at racetracks across the country. There are plenty of them: grooms and owners, veterinarians and breeders, horse lovers of all stripes.
They will offer them up Saturday before every race, but perhaps with extra passion before the 12th race, the one that turns casual sports fans into horse enthusiasts on the first Saturday of May.
Nineteen thoroughbreds, each going up to 35 miles an hour with a jockey aboard, striding out for a mile and a quarter. Add a roaring crowd, possible rain and sloppy footing. We are talking Formula One engines going bumper-to-bumper on ankles the size of Coke bottles.
It is thrilling and dangerous and beautiful all at once.
The stakes on Saturday are high for a declining sport that is now an endangered one. Twenty-three horse deaths over a three-month span at Santa Anita Park in Southern California shut down racing there and produced calls to ban the sport. In California, 600,000 signatures on a petition could prompt a ballot initiative on whether horse racing should continue to exist.
"I do believe that we all have to be conscious of the fact that it's a new world," said Craig Fravel, the president and chief executive of the Breeders' Cup World Championships. "We have to face up very clearly to that changed environment and minimize the perception that horses are being used beyond their capacity."
It is a tall order when nearly 10 horses a week, on average, died at American racetracks in 2018, according to the Jockey Club's Equine Injury Database. That's a fatality rate that is anywhere from two and a half to five times greater than in the rest of the racing world. A repeat of 2008, when the filly Eight Belles suffered a compound fracture in front of millions of fans after finishing second in the Derby and was euthanized, could be catastrophic for the sport.
Fravel knows that better than most. Each year, his organization hosts the best horses in the world, employs an equine medical staff and adopts surveillance and medication rules on par with Europe, and still it has suffered a handful of fatalities.
"They get hurt, and because of the nature of the animal, you can't put them back together like you do in human medicine," he said. "There's no way to spin that -- our job is to give maximum effort to minimize that. You have to get up in the morning and look at the mirror and ask yourself, 'Are you doing everything you can to keep that from happening?"'
Not enough racetrack owners, trainers and veterinarians are looking in the mirror and answering honestly in the affirmative. A vital move, experts and animal-rights activist say, is to dial back significantly on the use of performance-enhancing drugs and painkillers, which allow horses to perform better than they naturally would, increasing the danger of catastrophic breakdowns.
The Stronach Group, the owner of Santa Anita Park, is in the process of adopting international standards that are expected to transform the racetrack into one of the safest and most progressive ones in the country. It also backs a federal bill introduced in March with bipartisan support to create a uniform national standard for drug testing and medication rules in racehorses that would be overseen by the United States Anti-Doping Agency.
Notably, Churchill Downs Inc. and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who counts the company among his top patrons, do not support the bill.
It is a bold choice for a racetrack that has lost 43 thoroughbreds to racing injuries since 2016, an average of 2.42 per 1,000 starts, which was 50 percent higher than the national average during the same time. It is a deflating one for members of the Breeders' Cup, the New York Racing Association and the breeders and owners' organizations that support the bill.
So around 6:50 p.m. Saturday, shortly after the crowd joins in on a teary rendition of "My Old Kentucky Home," a battered old sport and those who love it will forget their troubles for two minutes.
Who do I like?
All of them. Let's just get 'em all around there safely.

The end of Woodstock

Texto completo: Woodstock is canceled. That’s probably a good thing.
Though the main issue reportedly involved permitting, the investors behind the Woodstock 50th anniversary concert put out a statement saying they “don’t believe the production of the festival can be executed as an event worthy of the Woodstock Brand name while also ensuring the health and safety of the artists, partners and attendees. … As difficult as it is, we believe this is the most prudent decision for all parties involved.”
Woodstock has long been known for many things, among them great music, mud, and drugs, but prudence was never on that list. In all of its incarnations, Woodstock had been a fun, chaotic disaster of an event. It wasn’t the Fyre Festival, a music festival so corruptly mismanaged it spawned two separate documentaries about the shenanigans, but it operated at a high level of dysfunction. In a world of security concerns, social media complaining, and 24/7 news, Woodstock simply doesn’t fit anymore.
I was at Woodstock ’94. The price was steep, $135, and a New York Times article about the event at the time made sure to note that organizers were going to sell the tickets by telephone.
When my friends and I, 17 years old and still trusting of authority, arrived Upstate on Friday evening, it was pandemonium. The security guard laughed as I showed him my parking pass and asked for directions to the parking lot to which I was assigned. He pointed to where I could leave my car, not so much a parking lot as a pile of dirt, miles from the campground. We were promised shuttle buses. None arrived.
[Opinion: Lessons from Fyre Fest]
We grabbed our sleeping bags and began the walk in the darkness. About halfway there, a local in a pickup truck took pity on us, loaded us into the bed, and drove us the rest of the way.
When we reached the grounds, the gates had already been overrun. No one took our tickets, and in the pre-9/11 days, no security was there to check any bags.
The next two days were a delirious chaos. People openly wheeled around nitrous tanks and held signs advertising drugs for sale. The port-a-potties overflowed by Saturday. It was scorching hot weather, and there were no free water options. The music was amazing and memorable. It rained, and we all got very dirty.
I imagine the scene playing out today, with cellphones and social media. The influencer "Instagirls" would be pitching a fit while simultaneously posing for pictures and flashing peace signs. Everyone would instantly get on the phone to dispute the charges with their credit card companies. On the plus side, we’d have Amazon deliver over some toilets. There would be a thousand think pieces on what went wrong and what it all meant.
Instead, we Woodstockers in ’94 survived the weekend without ever really realizing we got scammed. Fun was had, so what if it wasn’t exactly as advertised? Plus, back in the days before ubiquitous cellphones and social media, you could enjoy yourself unselfconsciously. It may have been chaos, but it was our chaos.
The other Woodstock festivals were just as poorly executed. The original one in 1969 cost only $7 to $8 a day, but the organizers didn’t account for thousands of people showing up without a ticket. The legendary traffic had the rural local roads at a standstill. They also failed to plan adequate food options for thousands of people spending three days together.
And the one in 1999 became infamous for violence, including sexual assault and fires. Riot police had to be brought in for crowd control, and MTV pulled its staff due to safety concerns.
So, it’s amusing the organizers didn’t think they could live up to the Woodstock name. The truth is that Woodstock is a relic of a different time when expectations were lower and inhibitions were freer. It wasn’t made for a world of photo filters and hashtags, where everything is an experience to be compartmentalized and shared. Woodstock’s 50th anniversary finds the world in a very different place. Baby boomers are out and millennials are in, with no place for its free love, loose-organization ethos. That’s a bummer, man.

SWALWELL QUALIFIES FOR PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES

Texto completo: East Bay Rep. Eric Swalwell earned his place on the Democratic presidential debate stage April 30 after getting 1 percent in his third qualifying poll since becoming a White House candidate.
The CNN poll found him at 1 percent nationally following polls earlier this month that put him at 1 percent in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The Democratic rules require candidates to qualify either by getting donations from at least 65,000 individual people, or getting at least 1 percent in three polls from approved polling organizations nationally or in one of the first primary states.
The CNN poll found former Vice President Joe Biden leading the field with 39 percent of respondents saying they would vote for him, and getting a bump after he officially announced his long-expected presidential bid last week. California Sen. Kamala Harris was in sixth place with 5 percent among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters.
While the poll results reinforce what a long shot Swalwell is for the presidency, the debate will give him an opportunity to make his case for gun control and student debt reform in front of what could be one of his largest audiences yet.
But the stage will be packed, and the 38-year-old representative will be under pressure to produce a breakout moment. He's the 17th candidate to qualify for the event, which will take place in Miami on June 26 and 27 with the candidates randomly split up between each night.
And there's still a chance Swalwell could eventually be shunted out of the debate. If more than 20 candidates qualify for the debates through either the donor or polling thresholds, they'll be winnowed down based on those who meet both measures. There are currently 20 Democrats running for president, with several other politicians eyeing a bid.
Swalwell hasn't yet received donations from 65,000 people, although his campaign said he was making progress toward that goal. A New York Times analysis this week found that only eight candidates had qualified through both methods so far, including Harris. (Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii became the ninth after CNN's latest poll.)
"I'm grateful that I'll have a place on the debate stage to discuss ending gun violence, providing affordable health care for all while finding cures in our lifetime, ensuring all communities have top-notch schools, and making sure student loan debt isn't a lifetime burden," Swalwell said in a statement.
Since he entered the presidential race with an announcement on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" earlier this month, Swalwell has campaigned across the early states, near the site of the Parkland, Florida school shooting, and in his hometown of Dublin, Calif. He met Democrats at house parties and forums across Iowa this weekend, focusing on rural towns. He's also kept up a steady stream of appearances on cable TV.

Religious hate, violence cry out for commonsense responses

Texto completo: Spring is usually a festive time of year for many religions, with Easter and Passover recently celebrated in April and Ramadan about to start. But at a time of Christians commemorating the resurrection of Jesus during Easter, Jews observing their religious freedom from Egypt through Passover, and Muslims fasting for Ramadan, we have also been reminded of the religious hate that continues to be spewed across our country and the world.
I was heartbroken when I heard the news this past weekend that there was another shooting at a place of worship. A 19-year-old man was able to purchase an AR-15-style gun, go into the California synagogue, Chabad of Poway, on the final day of Passover, and kill one woman and injure three others.
This shooting was six months after a deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead and a week after the Sri Lanka church bombings on Easter. And let us not forget the mass shootings at New Zealand mosques last month.
These horrific events are all jarring reminders that hate continues to leave innocent victims dead when they are just trying to pray in peace.
In the United States alone, hate crimes increased about 17% from 2016 to 2017, and I recently read that nationally there was a 23% increase in religion-based hate crimes. Not only that, but 60% of these crimes were directed at Jews or Jewish institutions.
I can only imagine what those numbers are going to look like after the 2018 and 2019 statistics are released.
Why is there so much hate and how can we stop it? The first thing we need to recognize is that hate crimes have been directly tied to hate speech online. Both the New Zealand gunman and, allegedly, the Chabad of Poway shooter posted hateful manifestos on the website 8chan.
Another shooter announced "I'm going in" on the social network site Gab before killing 11 at the Pittsburgh synagogue last year.
A New York Times story on April 3, 2019 said that "at least a third of white extremist killers since 2011 were inspired by others who perpetrated similar attacks, professed a reverence for them or showed an interest in their tactics."
This newspaper's analysis concluded that there are definitely connections between these hateful killers and how the internet and social media are used to perpetuate and spread white extremist ideologies and violence. For example, it is now being reported that the Chabad of Poway shooter was inspired by the New Zealand terrorist attack, which is why he used a similar strategy by posting on 8chan to promote his own hateful narrative.
I'm not saying we should be restricting anyone's First Amendment rights. Instead, I believe we need to fight this hate speech with more speech - we need to use our own voices to educate those who are learning to hate and confront these websites that are being used to publicize harmful hate speech.
That being said, this is not just a First Amendment issue, but also a Second Amendment one. Again, I am not asking to restrict anyone's constitutional rights, but I do agree with our governmental leaders who are presenting some commonsense recommendations.
For example, Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale recently developed a plan to keep us all safe while also dealing with the misuse of firearms.
Among other things, this plan recommends that we engage medical professionals to screen patients who are at risk for firearm violence, and engage licensed firearm dealers to look for "red flags" in customers who may potentially use a firearm for suicide. We could also review the red flag laws in other states that go a step further and allow police or family members to petition the court to temporarily remove firearms from a person who may present a danger to themselves or others.
We are at a time when leadership matters. We need our government leaders to guide us in this time of hate and violence.

Texto completo: Multiple media outlets labeled Louis Farrakhan a “far-right leader" when reporting that Facebook and Instagram had banned him and a number of other controversial figures from their platforms.
The New York Times, the Washington Post, Politico, and the Atlantic were among news organizations that used this description of Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam and a virulent anti-Semite who has long been associated with left-wing politics. After receiving almost immediate criticism for the "right-wing" characterization on social media, outlets scrambled their articles.
An article for The Atlantic was originally titled “Instagram and Facebook Ban Far-Right Extremists." Captured by the Wayback Machine, it stated that "In an effort to contain misinformation and extremism that has increasingly spread across the platform, Instagram has banned several prominent right-wing extremists. Specifically, Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, have banned Alex Jones, Infowars, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, Paul Nehlen, and Louis Farrakhan under their policies against dangerous individuals and organizations."
The opening line was then changed to read: "In an effort to contain misinformation and extremism that have spread across the platform, Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, have banned several prominent right-wing extremists including Alex Jones, Infowars, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Paul Nehlen under their policies against dangerous individuals and organizations. They also banned Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has repeatedly made anti-semitic statements."

An article in the Washington Post was originally titled “Facebook bans far-right leaders including Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos for being dangerous.” Also captured in a web archive, the piece originally stated that “Facebook said on Thursday it has permanently banned several far-right figures and organizations including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, Infowars host Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Laura Loomer, for being ‘dangerous’.”

The title was then switched out the words "far-right" with "extremist", and now reads: "Facebook bans extremist leaders including Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos for being ‘dangerous.'" The Washington Post also sent out a push-alert, beginning with the word "CORRECTION."

Critics had been quick to respond.

Tweet
Farrakhan has a long-time association with the Left and the Democratic Party. At least two prominent leaders of the Women’s March, Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour, have praised Farrakhan. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., had shared a stage with Farrakhan in 2011.

Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., attended Farrakhan’s meetings. Now-Attorney General of Minnesota, Keith Ellison, was a former member of the Nation of Islam who attended Farrakhan meetings while in Congress. The Congressional Black Caucus has met with Farrakhan. Then-Sen. Barack Obama had a picture taken with Farrakhan in 2005. And Farrakhan shared a stage with former President Bill Clinton during Aretha Franklin’s funeral last year.
Farrakhan also has a lengthy history of anti-Semitism. He compared Jewish people to termites in a 2018 tweet, saying, "I'm not an anti-Semite. I'm anti-Termite.”

Twitter has not banned Farrakhan from its platform, but it did previously remove his blue check mark.

Gillibrand wants to give voters up to $600

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand unveiled a plan Wednesday to provide each voter a credit of up to $600 to donate to federal political candidates of their choice in their state.
Gillibrand, a Democratic presidential candidate from New York, said her "Democracy Dollars" program is aimed at getting big money out of politics by making politicians less reliant on wealthy donors.
If enacted, Gillibrand's plan — which is based in part on a program in Seattle — would allow voters to request a credit of up to $200 each for House, Senate and presidential race, with the money equally split between primaries and general elections.
Politicians would only be eligible for the contributions if they voluntarily limit themselves to maximum individual donations of more than $200, well under current federal contribution limits.
"My Clean Elections plan is a critical structural change that gets big money and special interests out of politics, and ensures that elected officials in Washington are beholden only to the people who sent them there," Gillibrand said in a statement.
Gillibrand's plan comes as she struggles to gain traction in the 2020 presidential race.
Public-opinion polls, including a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday, have put her near the bottom of the crowded Democratic primary race.
And she has not yet surpassed the 65,000 individual donors needed to qualify for Democratic debates, though she will likely qualify based on her having at least 1 percent support in more than three polls, according to The New York Times.
The first Democratic debates are scheduled for June 26 and 27.
Gillibrand's election plan calls for allowing voters to spend their credit in $10 increments. She told NBC News the credit could only be used in a voter's home state, though they would be able to spend it on House races in their state but outside their home district.
"It will change who has a seat at the table and who gets elected in this country within one election cycle," Gillibrand told NBC.
Gillibrand was first appointed New York's junior senator in 2009 after former Sen. Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.
She was re-elected to her second full term last year.
Presidential hopeful Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand visited with college students and supporters in Denison, Iowa, on April 19.

Reader recommends PBS documentary “Being Mortal” (Sun Spots)

Texto completo: DEAR SUN SPOTS: I read an article about a film called “Being Mortal” by Boston surgeon Dr. Atul Gawande. I would very much like it to be shown in this area.
I’m sure it would get a good response as it sounds interesting.
Thank you for the good job you do helping so many. We need you.
— No name, Turner
ANSWER: “Being Mortal” is a 2015 PBS Frontline documentary. The hourlong film can be watched on your computer at the website https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/being-mortal/. You can also purchase the DVD from pbs.com or amazon.com for about $20.
Dr. Gawande is also a writer for The New Yorker and authored the book, “Being Mortal.” Both the book and documentary are powerful and thought-provoking. I highly recommend that everyone, no matter who you are, read the book or at least watch the documentary that was referred to in a The New York Times review as “a valuable contribution to the growing literature on aging, death and dying.”
DEAR SUN SPOTS: A few years ago, a friend suggested using Bar Keeper’s Friend for cleaning my new glass stove cooktop. This product did an absolutely great job in cleaning burned-on, hard-to-clean spills. Some “elbow grease” was needed, but it always took care of the stains and didn’t scratch the glass.
Several months ago, I started hunting for the same product. When I finally located it at several different stores, the label had changed and it no longer stated that it was safe for glass cooktops. I emailed the company and when they got back to me, they said that Bar Keeper’s Friend is no longer recommended for glass cooktops because it’s abrasive and could scratch it!
I’m getting desperate to find something that will clean my glass cooktop without scratching it. Do you or anyone else in Sun Spots Land have a suggestion? Please don’t tell me to try some of the liquid or cream cleaners out there – they do not work!
I love your column and never intentionally miss it!
— No name, Greene
ANSWER: I went online to the “Merry Maids” website at merrymaids.com and found this suggestion: Once the stovetop is cool, spray the surface generously with white vinegar. Liberally sprinkle baking soda over the liquid you just sprayed. Dip a clean towel in hot water, making sure to wring out the excess liquid. Place the towel over the baking soda and vinegar on the stovetop and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the towel and wipe away the baking soda and vinegar with a microfiber cloth. Spritz the surface with vinegar again and use a clean microfiber cloth to buff any streaks out. Repeat the above steps until your stovetop is free of residue.
It’s also suggested that you wipe down the cooktop with just white vinegar and a microfiber cloth to maintain the shine between cleanings.
There’s a great DIY video here: https://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/maintenance-and-repair/cleaning/how-to-clean-a-glass-top-stove
And I don’t want to put myself out of a job, but for those of you who like to use the computer, YouTube is such a fantastic resource. I’ve learned how to knit, do origami, and even do minor repairs on my old Subaru from watching these videos.

Who's in the Democratic Debates, And Who's in Danger of Missing Out

Texto completo: As you may have heard, the first Democratic presidential debate will be split across two nights, June 26 and 27, because there are so many candidates: 20 and counting.
What you may not have heard is that qualifying for the debate is turning out to be relatively easy -- to the point that it might cause embarrassment for some Democrats.
A candidate either has to receive donations from at least 65,000 people (including 200 donors apiece in 20 states) or have at least 1 percent support in three polls. Only polls from certain organizations are accepted, and candidates cannot count two polls from the same pollster in the same place.
According to a New York Times analysis, eight candidates will qualify based on polling but not, as of now, based on donors. Hitting 1 percent support in a handful of polls is a breeze for most candidates. But these eight Democrats risk appearing like they are skating onto the debate stage without the support of grass-roots donors.
The Times analysis found that if the debate was held today, 17 of the 20 candidates would make it to the stage. The qualifiers will be divided at random into two groups. This means that a number of candidates at the back of the pack in polling and fund-raising will still share a stage with the heavyweights in the race.
The inclusivity is intentional. Democratic leaders don't want to be accused of favoring certain candidates over others, as they were in 2016. But party leaders still might have to exclude some candidates if they want to stick to their self-imposed limit of 20 participants. Several other people, among them Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana and Stacey Abrams, the former candidate for governor of Georgia, might still run.
If more than 20 candidates qualify, the party has said it will prioritize those who met both the donor threshold and the polling threshold. If more winnowing is needed, polling averages will come into play, and that's where some candidates could really be in trouble: Kirsten Gillibrand, for instance, clears the "three polls of at least 1 percent" bar just as surely as Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren do, but her average is much lower.
If that doesn't do the trick, the final tiebreaking measure will be the number of donors, in which case candidates who just barely cleared the 65,000 threshold could be cut.

Texto completo: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Prosecutors will not be able to release surveillance videos before the trials of the New England Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft and 24 other men charged with soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla., a circuit court judge ruled Monday afternoon.
Judge Joseph Marx broadened a previous order from another judge, who last week temporarily blocked the release of videos involving Mr. Kraft. Judge Marx's order covers videos of all 25 men in the case, not just Mr. Kraft, and surveillance videos taken last fall outside of the Orchids of Asia Day Spa, not only those from January that include Mr. Kraft. Still photographs are not covered by the order.
Judge Marx said the videos can be released once one of these conditions occurs: trial juries are sworn in each case; the cases are resolved by plea agreement; the state drops the charges; or at a time when the judge finds the fair trial rights of the men are not at risk.
Judge Marx made the ruling in a hearing in the cases of Hua Zhang, the spa's owner, and Lei Wang, the spa's manager who is accused of performing the sex act on Mr. Kraft. The women have pleaded not guilty to several charges related to prostitution.
Lawyers for the women said releasing the videos would harm their clients' right to a fair trial.
During the hearing, Kathleen Phang, a lawyer representing Ms. Wang, said that after the state filed a notice 10 days ago that it would release the videos under Florida's open records law, "41 million Google searches were done" involving the case.
Ms. Phang also said the arresting affidavit described what happened "in uncomfortable detail" when Mr. Kraft visited the spa two times in January, including on the morning of Jan. 20, the day the Patriots faced the Kansas City Chiefs in a playoff game.
"Why do people need to see the video?" Ms. Phang said after the hearing.
Dana McElroy, who represents the 10 media companies, including The New York Times, seeking release of the videos, said the public has a right to see what's on them.
"All of that has to be balanced against the defendant's right to a fair trial," Ms. McElroy said. "The burden of proof is on the defense."
The media companies have 30 days to appeal the ruling to the Fourth District Court of Appeals.
Mr. Kraft has pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanors and has turned the dispute over the videos into a winner-take-all legal fight. He has hired at least two prominent attorneys and a publicist to keep the videos from being released.
One of Mr. Kraft's lawyers, Alex Spiro, was in the courtroom during the Monday hearing.
On Friday, in a county court hearing in Mr. Kraft's case, Mr. Spiro had grilled a Jupiter, Fla., detective for hours about the surveillance videos, which Mr. Kraft's lawyers are trying to get thrown out as evidence.
At the Monday hearing, Mr. Spiro said, "If you release the videos, you will allow people to sit at home and click on videos of naked people getting massages."
He dismissed the idea of using redacted videos. He said Mr. Kraft and the other 24 defendants will be presumed guilty because their faces would be blacked out.
Judge Marx ordered the defense attorneys for the Orchids of Asia spa to pay for extracting relevant splices from the five days' worth of video.

Texto completo: The NYPD stepped up security for houses of worship on Sunday after one person died and several others were injured during a shooting at a synagogue in San Diego. 
This is the second time in just weeks the department increased security around places of worship: The department also ramped up security outside churches on Easter Sunday following attacks on several houses of worship in Sri Lanka that left more than 200 people dead.
On Saturday, the last day of Passover, a 19-year-old man walked into a synagogue north of San Diego, yelled anti-Semitic slurs and opened fire with an A.R. 15-style gun, according to The New York Times. The attack left a 60-year-old woman dead, as well as injured the rabbi, a 34-year-old man, and a girl.
According to the NYPD, the department increased "patrols and presence at houses of worship and other sensitive locations around the city." The department was also "currently maintaining an enhanced posture at Jewish locations for Passover."
President Donald Trump offered his "deepest sympathies," according to reports, and said the attack "obviously looks right now based on my last conversations, looks like a hate crime, hard to believe."
Sen. Chuck Schumer on Sunday said the attacker may have been inspired by other attacks, and that it was important to find "ways to stop the spread of this hate" as well as address gun violence.
"This was just an awful incident, a heartless, horrific, anti-Semitic incident," Schumer said, speaking at an unrelated news conference at his New York office. "All you can say is that there are far, far too many of them. And far too many hate crimes happening in America today. It's this kind of anti-Semitism that's being rebutted by all borders of society. We must figure out what we can do to stop it

CNN and Avenatti; The network is applauded by the press corps while a favorite guest pleads not guilty.

Texto completo: One of CNN's most frequent guests was in court today fighting another round of criminal charges. Over the weekend the cable news network was honored for its coverage of a controversy he helped to inflame.
The Associated Press reports today :
Attorney Michael Avenatti pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he stole millions of dollars from clients, cheated on his taxes and lied to investigators...
Avenatti rose to fame representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in her legal battles against President Donald Trump.
He was indicted earlier this month on 36 counts, including wire and bank fraud. His trial is scheduled to start June 25...
Avenatti was arrested in March in New York in a separate case alleging he demanded millions to stay quiet about claims he planned to reveal about Nike paying high school athletes. He has denied wrongdoing in that case as well.
According to Bill D'Agostino at NewsBusters, over the past year one media outlet has been particularly significant in the Avenatti rise to fame. "CNN was the porn lawyer's top cable enabler with a whopping 121 appearances," writes Mr. D'Agostino. This column will go out on a limb and suggest there are probably full-time employees at CNN who don't appear more than 121 times in a year. Not that all CNN staff were thrilled that their network became the go-to platform for Mr. Avenatti to peddle his various claims, but it didn't necessarily bother the larger community of Beltway journalists.
This past weekend, the White House Correspondents Association lauded CNN for its coverage of one of the big stories of 2018:
An Honorable mention for the Merriman Smith Award in broadcast goes to CNN, Confirmation vote on Brett Kavanaugh.
From the judges: CNN's coverage on the day of the hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was aggressive, relied on deep sourcing and felt like one was watching a symphony. The news-making moments in which Sen. Jeff Flake, R-AZ, was confronted by two women was just a piece of the extensive coverage that followed every angle, all day.
In those "news-making moments" the protesters confronting Sen. Flake harangued him with unproven allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh, who was then a federal judge and is now a Supreme Court Justice. Of course one of the reasons he is now a Justice is that a majority of senators did not believe allegations against him promoted by Mr. Avenatti.
The Avenatti claims were not the only ones for which senators struggled to find evidence. But by now, the White House Correspondents Association must know that they have not aged well.
Several weeks after the gripping coverage for which CNN won a prize, on October 25, 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) referred Mr. Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick to the Justice Department for investigation of potential criminal violations "for materially false statements they made to the Committee."
"New questions raised about Avenatti claims regarding Kavanaugh," was the headline on an NBC News story that appeared that day soon after Mr. Grassley sent his letter. According to NBC:
In the NBC News interview that aired on Oct. 1, Swetnick back-tracked on or contradicted parts of her sworn statement where she alleged she witnessed then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be 'gang raped' in a side room or bedroom by a 'train' of boys."
NBC News also found other apparent inconsistencies in a second sworn statement from another woman whose statement Avenatti provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee in a bid to bolster Swetnick's claims....
Shortly after tweeting out the woman's allegations on Oct. 2, Avenatti confirmed to NBC News that it was the same woman interviewed by phone on Sept. 30. But when questioned on Oct. 3 about the discrepancies between what she said in the phone interview and the serious allegations in the sworn declaration, Avenatti said he was "disgusted" with NBC News. At one point, in an apparent effort to thwart the reporting process, he added in the phone call, "How about this, on background, it's not the same woman. What are you going to do with that?"
After NBC News received text messages from the woman refuting some of the claims in the declaration, NBC reached out again to Avenatti, who defended the declaration.
"I have no idea what you are talking about," he said in a text. "I have a signed declaration that states otherwise together with multiple audio recordings where she stated exactly what is in the declaration. There were also multiple witnesses to our discussions."
He sent a follow-up message moments later: "I just confirmed with her yet again that everything in the declaration is true and correct," Avenatti said. "She must have been confused by your question."
Roughly five minutes later, the woman sent a formally-worded text backing Avenatti. "Please understand that everything in the declaration is true and you should not contact me anymore regarding this issue," the text read.
But when reached by phone minutes later, the woman again insisted that she never saw Kavanaugh spike punch or act inappropriately toward women. She said she's "been consistent in what she's told Michael."
In a subsequent text on Oct. 5, she wrote, "I will definitely talk to you again and no longer Avenatti. I do not like that he twisted my words."

Stagecoach 2019: Sam Hunt closes out the second night with a big ‘ol dance party

Texto completo: By the time day two headliner Sam Hunt hit the stage at the 13th annual Stagecoach Country Music Festival, the fans were ready to dance at the Empire Polo Club in Indio.
During an interview ahead of the festival, Hunt said he hadn’t played a show in about six months but was ready to get back out to party with his fans at the festival. For a first-time headliner, Hunt’s performance was solid. He came out hard with “Leave the Night On” and transitioned into “House Party,” during which his crew unleashed dozens of giant balloons into the audience, which promptly blew away in the gusty desert winds.
Not all of Hunt’s songs are bangers, though, and he did pick up his acoustic guitar and slow things down a bit with songs like “Take Your Time,” “Cop Car,” a song he wrote for Keith Urban, and he jumped on the piano for “Make You Miss Me” during his encore. The fans danced and sang all the “woah-oh-oh’s” they could in “We Are Tonight,” a song Hunt wrote that was recorded by Billy Currington.
Though he’s not a traditional country artist since he mixes in elements of pop, rock, electronic dance music and R&B into his music, Hunt is a traditionalist at heart. He told the crowd he’d always tip his hat to those who paved the way within the country music genre and invited out fellow Mane Stage player Luke Combs to pay tribute to Brooks & Dunn with a cover of “Brand New Man.” Hunt also paid homage to the late Waylon Jennings with “Belle of the Ball.”
For his first Stagecoach appearance in 2016, Hunt surprised the audience by bringing out G-Eazy, Bebe Rexha and Snoop Dogg during his set, but this year he let his own material shine. After closing out with “Body Like a Back Road,” he did tell the audience he’d see them tomorrow, which might mean he’ll pop up at the festival’s first-ever official after party with EDM artist Diplo at the Palomino Stage after Aldean’s turn on Sunday.
While Luke Combs is an incredible songwriter and his ascent has been a quick one, unlike Hunt he is country through and through. He reminded the Stagecoach crowd when he took the Mane Stage just before Hunt he played this same fest at about 2:30 in the afternoon two years in front of about 1,000 people.
Since then, he’s scored five No. 1 hits and racked up the awards and accolades for songs such as “Hurricane,” “One Number Away” and “She Got the Best of Me,” all of which he put in his Stagecoach set. He also earned his spot, second to headliner, on the Mane Stage in front of 80,000 fans. That fact wasn’t lost on him as he told the crowd “five or six guys on stage get to live their dreams every night” because they spend their hard-earned money to come see them perform at things like Stagecoach.
He’s been touring on this album for some time and hit the audience with a few new songs including “Reasons” and “Beer Never Broke My Heart,” and during the latter he stopped and shotgunned a beer.
Singer-songwriter Cam has clawed her way up with time slots on the Mane Stage and finally landed herself the coveted sunset hour. The 34-year-old California native showed up in a colorful getup with lots of fringe and bedazzle not unlike a pack of Starburst. She opened with her single “Diane,” her fiery nod to Dolly Parton’s “Jolene,” which she included near the end of her set as well. She’s always been bubbly, but on Saturday night she let her personality really shine, engaging with the crowd with more banter and confident interactions. She debuted Diplo’s new song, “So Long,” on which she guests, which dropped earlier this week and hinted that she might be over at his set on Sunday as well.
Before performing her first single, “My Mistake,” she told the crowd that the New York Times once called the song “sex positive,” which she took as a compliment. However, “…when women sing about sex it’s like a statement, but when a man sings about sex it’s just another Friday night,” she told the crowd.
“If you think sex isn’t as important to women as it is to men, than I gotta story about yo’ mama,” she added as the crowd cheered. She came out at the end of her set wearing a bedazzled cape to sing her big hit, “Burning House.”
Meanwhile, Lynyrd Skynyrd became the new record holder for crowd at the Palomino Stage, with fans spilling out of the tent for tens of yards in every direction. The band even outdrew its 2014 audience at the same location. Part of the attraction could be that it’s a last chance to see Southern rock’s defining band, as a long farewell tour wraps this year. And unlike many Palomino players, Lynyrd Skynyrd held the crowd’s attention for the full set.
The 75-minute performance packed in the hits, including “Gimme Three Steps,” “That Smell,” “Simple Man,” “Tuesday’s Gone,” “Don’t Ask Me No Questions,” and “Call Me the Breeze” before ending with “Sweet Home Alabama,” during which the crowd danced and drowned out the band with their own singing. But what would Skynyrd’s final Stagecoach bow be without “Free Bird” as an encore?
Other earlier highlights included Lanco’s fun set with its hits “Greatest Love Story,” “Trouble Maker” and “Born to Love You.” Michael Ray had fans singing along to “One That Got Away” and Jessie James Decker got the Mane Stage going early with covers of Shania Twain’s “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” and Led Zeppelin’s “What Is and What Should Never Be.”

Impeaching Trump will only help him

Texto completo: President Trump has called the Mueller investigation a "witch hunt" nearly two hundred times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch. After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert Mueller definitively declared "the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." He didn't do it.
Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up. As Mueller put it, "unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."
This lack of an "underlying crime" is the source of Trump's justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You'd be angry and frustrated. You'd want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.
For two years, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of "treason" and crimes of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia -- evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn't end it. He didn't obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials. The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff. Remember, the only reason Mueller knew about his private exchanges with McGahn is because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn's cooperation. The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to The New York Times, "that investigators would not have learned of otherwise." This is evidence of Trump's cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel's report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to purse impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make my day." Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump's reelection. First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president. Second, Trump's supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d'état, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election. And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump's approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Trump's tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating. Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Trump's returns to assess how "the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a president"? Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.
Both the Democrats' attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Trump's privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO — Somehow, Suzyn Waldman's phone line worked.
The massive earthquake that struck minutes before Game 3 of the 1989 World Series had just begun its Bay Area devastation, and Waldman was on the air – and stayed live on WFAN for the next 20-30 minutes, describing the scene.
The man working atop Candlestick Park, holding on as the light towers swayed; the fans riding the rocking and rolling upper deck; the Giants and Athletics players scrambling onto the field, trying to find their families.
"I think everybody who was in it thinks about it every time they come to this city," Waldman recalled 30 years later, before broadcasting a Yankees-Giants game at Oracle Park with long-time radio partner John Sterling.
"I really got to know the people and what this city is all about," she said. "We've seen cities come together before, but it's the first time I'd ever been in the middle of it as a stranger."
And professionally, it was "the first time I was ever taken seriously as a journalist."
At one early moment on the air, giving a WFAN update as the quake hit, Waldman remarked how she'd never been as scared in her life.
But she kept reporting from one of the highest points of Candlestick Park, behind home plate in an auxiliary press box where only one other phone line worked.
Afterward, Waldman realized she had no way to get from the ballpark back to her Union Square hotel, until New York Post writer Henry Hecht came to the rescue.
Another writer had a car and Waldman, along with Hecht and the New York Times' Ira Berkow, made a typically 10-minute ride in three hours, through a city that was parts ablaze with no electricity.
Back in her room, "I had no lights," Waldman said. "But I had a phone."
Waldman did more interviews on the air, and also used her second rare, live phone line to inform the families of media members that everyone was well and accounted for.
And maybe a little tipsy from raiding the minibars.
In the days ahead, Waldman used her World Series press pass to move through fire and police lines to cover the news. She remembers the eventual World Series MVP, Dave Stewart, arriving with a generator and handing out coffee to police and firefighters – the start of an enduring friendship.
And there was the lady who owned a favorite coffee shop on tucked-away Maiden Lane, heartbroken as she surveyed the shattered china everywhere.
"May I?" Waldman asked, as she began to help her pick up the pieces.

Has the Recession Been Cancelled? The strength of the U.S. economy continues to confound the liberal establishment.

Texto completo: What would we do without experts? As U.S. workers continue to enjoy a vibrant job market, they should spare a thought for laborers in one category of professional services who remain mired in a multi-year slump. Established manufacturers of Keynesian economic forecasts have entered a prolonged period of secular stagnation. Some may even wonder if they can ever break out of a "new normal" of declining prestige.
At the New York Times recently, economist Paul Krugman valiantly attempted to overcome his history of underrating American potential by making another call on tax policy and the macroeconomy. On April 8, Mr. Krugman wrote about one of President Trump's signature policy achievements:
...his one major legislative success, the 2017 tax cut — which he predicted would be "rocket fuel" for the economy — has turned out to be a big fizzle, economically and, especially, politically.
It's true that U.S. economic growth got a bump for two quarters last year, and Trumpists are still pretending to believe that we'll have great growth for a decade. But at this point last year's growth is looking like a brief and rapidly fading sugar high.
Today New York Times colleague Ben Casselman helps to set Mr. Krugman straight:
Rumors of the economic expansion's death appear to have been greatly exaggerated.
Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy, rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, the Commerce Department said Friday. That is significantly better than most economists expected, and far better than the dour forecasts of early this year, when many forecast a near stall in growth.
While we can all celebrate the current expansion of U.S opportunity, forgive Harvard's Larry Summers if he finds the latest news less than entirely pleasant. A former Clinton and Obama economic adviser, Mr. Summers wrote in May of 2017 in the Washington Post:
Details of President Trump's first budget have now been released. Much can and will be said about the dire social consequences of what is in it and the ludicrously optimistic economic assumptions it embodies. My observation is that there appears to be a logical error of the kind that would justify failing a student in an introductory economics course.
Apparently, the budget forecasts that U.S. economic growth will rise to 3.0 percent because of the administration's policies — largely its tax cuts and perhaps also its regulatory policies. Fair enough if you believe in tooth fairies and ludicrous supply-side economics.
Sadly Messrs. Summers and Krugman have had plenty of company in struggling to predict U.S. economic performance. It seems that a significant portion of the Beltway economic forecasting sector has had some strange inability to recognize the potential of non-government-directed investment. Today the White House Council of Economic Advisers notes :
We see in today's advance estimate of real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2019 that the economy continues to outperform expectations... in their final longer-term forecasts before the November 2016 election, the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Open Market Committee on average projected four-quarter real GDP growth in 2017, 2018, and 2019 of 2.2, 2.0, and 1.7 percent, respectively. In actuality, real GDP grew 2.5 percent in 2017, 3.0 percent in 2018, and in the first quarter of 2019 grew at an annualized rate of 3.2 percent.
Recently there also seems to have been some inexplicable tendency among esteemed left-leaning economists to overemphasize the economic damage caused by a partial shutdown of the federal government. The outstanding report on first quarter growth had this column—and perhaps a few other Americans—wondering if perhaps we should hope for more such governmental interruptions. The White House says no, arguing that Commerce Department data suggest that the first quarter could have been even better:
In the absence of residual seasonality and the government shutdown, real GDP growth in the first quarter of this year might have been up to 1.2 percentage points higher, implying... annualized growth rates of 4.4 percent.
Let's not go overboard. As Don Luskin of Trend Macrolytics points out, beneath today's headline GDP number, growth in consumer spending and business investment was not as strong as we'd like. But overall the economy continues to show a remarkable vitality that has been especially surprising to the Democratic economic establishment.
It can even be a tad embarrassing. It's one thing to express pessimism about America in a column. How would you like to have scheduled an entire event dedicated to discussing a pending economic disaster and then have to read today's blowout GDP report?
The esteemed Brookings Institution recently announced a May event, "Preparing for the next recession: Policies to reduce the impact on the U.S. economy." This came complete with a roster of credentialed declinists and an official Twitter hashtag: #RecessionReady.
All that's missing is a sign of recession. Harriet Torry reports in the Journal on the optimism among corporate executives, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon:
"People are going back to the workforce. Companies have plenty of capital," he said, adding that "business confidence and consumer confidence are both rather high…it could go on for years. There's no law that says it has to stop," he said.
The Brookings gang should take those words to heart, and realize that while times may be tough in the industry dedicated to forecasting doom, most of the country is doing much better.

Thomas Friedman joins America, endorses Trump's immigration positions

Texto completo: Give New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman credit for his admission, rare among the national news media, that President Trump's immigration positions are logical, humane, and morally right.

Friedman wrote Tuesday that during a trip to southern border in San Diego, he became "more certain than ever that we have a real immigration crisis and that the solution is a high wall with a big gate — but a smart gate."

I'm glad Friedman realized that walls are as effective as they've ever been, but this isn't a new concept. Trump has been talking about it since 2015 and, more importantly, border agents have been asking for more wall construction since the 1990s.

Friedman said the wall should have a sign that says, "Besides legitimate asylum seekers, we’ll accept immigrants at a rate at which they can be properly absorbed into our society and work force, and we’ll favor visa seekers with energies and talents that enrich and advance our society.”

Wow, that sounds familiar. Oh, wait, it was the White House-backed bill proposed two years ago by Sens. David Perdue, R-Ga., and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., which did all of the things Friedman agrees with.

And what Friedman proposes includes all of the things Trump promoted during his 2018 State of the Union address, which Friedman's own paper said was "injected [with] only poison and confusion."

Here’s the “poison” from that speech:

"So, tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too."

Trump said in his address that immigration reform should include legal protections and a path to citizenship for the nearly 2 million "Dreamers," illegal immigrants brought to the country as children; an end to chain migration, wherein immigrant citizens are allowed to bring the remotest relatives to the U.S.; and an end to the visa lottery, which gives out green cards to foreigners at random.

The goal would be to judiciously import immigrants with the highest potential to contribute to American society, and put an end to violent crimes that are committed by low-skilled, unassimilated immigrants.

Friedman is one of the last people to be convinced on most of Trump's immigration proposals, which are overwhelmingly popular.

A Harvard-Harris poll released at the start of the year showed stunning support for limiting the number of immigrants into the country. The poll showed 81% of registered voters wanted the annual immigration rate reduced by nearly a third; nearly 80% said they favored an immigration system that prioritized education and skill level over the current chain-migration mess we currently have; and almost 70% said the lottery, which doles out visas to immigrants at random, should end.

The one proposal with only about 50% of the country's approval is "the wall," which I would guess has at least something to do with the national news media and the entire Democratic Party having called walls racist for nearly four years.

Most Americans know what a sane immigration system would look like. I'm happy Friedman has joined us.

Elizabeth Warren keeps offering detailed policy proposals. Why do so few Democrats seem to care?

Texto completo: Imagine if every presidential campaign looked like Elizabeth Warren's has the past few months.
A steady stream of detailed, specific policy proposals; thoughtful responses to difficult questions; coherent explanations of positions on matters of national import: Whether or not you agree with her politics, this is the Platonic ideal of campaigning, right?
Here are my ideas, here's what I care about, and here's why. That's the sort of thing that voters ought to be most concerned with. Anyone who voted for Warren's reelection to the Senate last year but had real trepidation about a presidential bid can rest easy. She's doing Massachusetts proud.
And so, because everything about our political landscape is a fiery hellscape, a University of New Hampshire poll released this week had Warren at just 5 percent among likely Granite State Democratic primary voters.
Welcome to presidential politics, where bold, specific, and detailed policy proposals; strong name recognition; and concise, comprehensible rhetoric somehow land you a distant fourth — 10 points behind Pete Buttigieg — in New Hampshire.
Nevertheless she persisted and all that, but you could forgive Warren if she put her fist through something when that poll came out.
Not Warren. Instead, she spent Monday night landing big punches at a CNN town hall appearance. It was masterful in all the ways that should matter. You know, the ways that voters say matter but rarely seem to drive decision making when it comes time to fill in the bubbles on the ballot.
Any attempt to refute the very gendered, often misogynist criticism of her electability and likability would probably just backfire anyway. Remember when she had the audacity to drink a beer? So instead she's turned specificity into the foundation of her campaign.
It's refreshing, until you realize that a detailed issues-and-policy-first run for the White House is rare enough to be refreshing.
“We're not going to win by just saying 'not Donald Trump.' We're not going to win by doing better name-calling than he does," Warren said during the CNN town hall. “The way we're going to do this, is we're going to get out and talk about our vision, and how it affects families all across this country — how it touches people personally."
This would sound not so different from all the other hope merchants who are still a little light on specifics in the vast Democratic field — your Betos, your Bookers, your Mayors Pete. Except that for Warren, this was the epilogue. Here's what she said first:
“A 2-cent [per dollar marginal rate on fortunes over $50 million] wealth tax would let us do universal child care, would let us do universal pre-K, would let us do universal college, would let us knock back the student loan debt burden, and still have money to spend."
These aren't talking points. Each policy plan is backed by enough detail to make Al Gore's eyes glaze over. And the answer to the ever-present “how will you pay for that" question is built in.
She introduced her plan to address housing costs and discrimination as a bill in the Senate. If every candidate were this specific about their proposals, instead of trafficking mostly in vague centrist rhetoric about coming together as a country, we might actually be able to choose a president based on ideas and plans, instead of problematic notions of personality.
Warren shouldn't be expected to win New Hampshire. Bernie Sanders won the 2016 primary there easily. He's from a neighboring state like Warren, of course, and though people sometimes make fun of his followers, their loyalty was well-earned. Only now, after Sanders has consistently championed his progressive platform for decades largely unchanged, have other Democrats found their way on board. It's easy to see why he was far ahead in the most recent poll.
But we still have a long way to go before New Hampshire, and even longer before a general election campaign that's still a year away. But if the campaign ahead is about issues and ideas instead of insults and ideology, then Warren will be leading the way.

Texto completo: No wonder Donald Trump was so angry.
No wonder he wanted to stop the Mueller investigation.
He didn't collude with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016.
He knew he was innocent.
And almost three years ago he foresaw that a biased fishing expedition by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his liberal lawyers would undermine his ability to govern and provide Democrats and the liberal media with an endless supply of damaging political ammo.
Now that Attorney General William Barr released the redacted Mueller report, the whole world knows that Mueller completely exonerated Trump of collusion with Russia.
Mueller was unable to decide whether the president was guilty of obstruction of justice. But the desperate Democrats in the House and the disappointed fake journalists over at CNN don't care that Mueller found Trump guilty of no crime.
They'll spend the next 20 months parsing the Mueller report's footnotes and milking the unanswered question of obstruction for every possible drop of political poison they can find.
By noon on Thursday CNN's all-liberal panel of eight Trump-hating pundits and legal experts like Jeffrey Toobin already were back to their usual tricks.
They spent half the morning spinning the importance of the inconclusive "obstruction" part of Mueller's report and trashing Attorney General Barr as a shill for the president.
Dana Bash and crew showed no sympathy for the unfair, incorrect and deranged assault they and their soulmates at MSNBC, the New York Times and elsewhere have subjected Trump to for three years.
You'd think Toobin and a few of the others would have been pleased to find out that the president of the United States did not collude or conspire with the Russians to fix the 2016 election.
According to the Mueller report, there were ten examples of Trump trying to get control of the Russia investigation.
They included firing FBI Director James Comey, urging Trump's useless Attorney General Jeff Sessions to "re-recuse" himself and trying to get various staffers to lie or not cooperate with Mueller.
The facts surrounding those presidential attempts to interfere are not in dispute.
But the president never fired anyone, even though he had the Constitutional power to do it, and he never obstructed Mueller from doing his work.
The White House even turned over millions of documents and the president waived his right to use executive privilege.
If any of his White House staff had followed the president's requests concerning the Mueller investigation there might have been a legitimate case for obstruction. But they ignored him. And they did exactly what they are supposed to do — they kept the boss from making a serious mistake.
I say bravo to the president's staff for saving his butt. They did their job. They protected President Trump from himself.
The president reacted to the Russia collusion charges the way any innocent man would react to a frame up.
President Trump had every right to be outraged and frustrated by Mueller's investigation, which he always knew was a Democratic witch hunt.
If he never colluded with anyone in the first place, as Mueller has proved to the satisfaction of everyone except maybe Rachel Maddow and Adam Schiff, it's hard to see how the president could be guilty of the crime of obstruction.
If anything, the only thing President Trump was guilty of was trying to obstruct injustice.

Texto completo: Pittsburgh-area religious leaders will hold an interfaith vigil Wednesday in Oakland to commemorate the hundreds of victims of the Easter Sunday bombing massacres in Sri Lanka.
As Buddhist, Christian, Jewish, Muslim and other groups planned for the event at 6 p.m. Wednesday at Heinz Memorial Chapel, local faith leaders were offering condolences and support for the victims of the attacks and other acts of persecution.
The death toll approached 300, officials said Monday, from suicide bombings at Christian churches as well as at hotels in multiple cities in Sri Lanka. Authorities there are blaming the attack on a previously little-known radical group claiming to act in the name of Islam.
"It's devastating," said Bhante Pemaratana, a native of Sri Lanka and abbot at the Pittsburgh Buddhist Center in Harrison.
He said people of different faiths in Sri Lanka often pay respects at each other's shrines, such as St. Anthony's in the capital city, Colombo, which was one of the bomb targets. Even the civil war that ended a decade ago, he said, was driven more by ethnic than religious differences, so the terrorism was a "shocking" attack on all.
After the civil war, "everybody started enjoying the peace and harmony and the tourism picked up," he said. And then "you have this. I feel so sorry for the people and also for the country."
The U.S. Census Bureau offers a rough estimate of 166 people born in Sri Lanka who live in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.
Among the organizations planning the vigil Wednesday are Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh Buddhist Center, Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Temple Sinai, Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Interfaith Impact Network, Muslim Association of Greater Pittsburgh, Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh's Center for Loving Kindness and Civic Engagement, All for All, Pittsburgh Area Pax Christi and Repair the World Pittsburgh.
"Easter is the feast of God's triumph over the powers of sin, evil and death," said the Rev. Liddy Barlow, executive minister of Christian Associates. "So it is particularly painful to have Easter services interrupted by such gruesome violence targeting innocent worshippers. Just as we felt the strength of the world's prayers after the Tree of Life shootings in our own community, so we send our prayers to Sri Lanka today, trusting in prayer's power to comfort and heal."
Nisantha Bandaranayake, 77, moved to Pittsburgh from Sri Lanka about 45 years ago for a residency program at the University of Pittsburgh. A retired anesthesiologist, he found out about the bombings Sunday morning watching the 7 a.m. news. He quickly called family in Sri Lanka, relieved to find out that he didn't know anyone affected but saddened by the brutality.
"It's such a sad story," he said. "So many lives were lost."
Dr. Bandaranayake, who is Buddhist, also noted that St. Anthony's church in Colombo was a focal point for many different religions. "I know it's a Catholic Church, but Buddhists and Muslims also go - all the Christian denominations, they go there," he said. "They think it brings good luck."
Dr. Bandaranayake, who lives on Washington's Landing, recalled reaching out to Jewish friends in Pittsburgh after the shootings in October at the Tree of Life synagogue and said that Pittsburghers are now reaching out to him.
"It's so sad the way people are going to these areas where people are worshipping according to their faith," he said, "and then most innocent people are the victims."
Pittsburgh Roman Catholic Bishop David Zubik asked that prayers of intercession be offered for Sri Lanka in area parishes this weekend. And the bishop included prayers for the victims, people and nation of Sri Lanka on Easter at St. John Fisher Parish in Churchill.
"My heart, the hearts of all Christians, and of all compassionate people are grieving over the terrorist attack on Catholics and others this Easter in Sri Lanka," Bishop Zubik said. "As we pray for the dead and wounded, and for peace in that wounded land, I ask everyone to seek ways to bring help and hope to victims of religious persecution worldwide."
Zohra Lasania, program director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations' Pittsburgh chapter, also denounced the massacres.
"The savage attacks on Christian worshippers celebrating Easter Sunday and others in Sri Lanka are an affront to all humanity," Ms. Lasania said. "We mourn today the loss of our brothers and sisters in Sri Lanka and send our sympathies to the Christian community and all Sri Lankans. ... Muslims respect the sanctity of all forms of prayer. We renew our commitment to work against all forms of hate this weekend as we join thousands [of] others and pray for Sri Lanka."

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Two Google employees, Claire Stapleton and Meredith Whittaker, helped organize a 20,000-person walkout from the company last November. Now they say they have paid a price for their actions.
In a letter shared internally with co-workers on Monday and reviewed by The New York Times, Ms. Stapleton, a marketing manager at YouTube, said Google had demoted her after she urged colleagues to walk out from the company last year over its treatment of sexual harassment. Ms. Whittaker, an artificial intelligence researcher, said in the letter that she had also been "informed my role would be changed dramatically."
In addition to the demotion, Ms. Stapleton said, Google instructed her to take medical leave even though she was not sick, according to the letter. And Ms. Whittaker said she had been told to abandon her external work at New York University, where she runs research on artificial intelligence and ethics for the university's A.I. Now Institute.
Ms. Stapleton said she had hired a lawyer and reversed the demotion. Ms. Whittaker did not address whether her role had ultimately changed.
"Only after I hired a lawyer and had her contact Google did management conduct an investigation and walked back my demotion, at least on paper," Ms. Stapleton wrote in the letter. "While my work has been restored, the environment remains hostile and I consider quitting nearly every day."
"We prohibit retaliation in the workplace, and investigate all allegations," a Google spokeswoman said. "Employees and teams are regularly and commonly given new assignments, or reorganized, to keep pace with evolving business needs. There has been no retaliation here."
The letter was earlier reported by Wired.
In October, The Times reported that Google had provided a $ 90 million exit package to Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile operating system, after an accusation of sexual harassment against him was found to be credible. The lavish payment after the misconduct outraged Google's employees. The company's top executives later apologized and revealed they had fired 48 people for sexual harassment over the past two years, with none receiving an exit package.
But the apologies did not calm employees' disquiet. Ms. Stapleton and Ms. Whittaker, along with other colleagues, called for employees to walk out of the company for a day in protest. At the time, Ms. Stapleton said in an interview that The Times article had "turned the lights on on the bias, discrimination and systemic inequality women and other groups experience very viscerally at Google."
On Nov. 1, about 20,000 Google employees left work in locations across the world, including Berlin, Chicago, London, Seattle, Singapore, Zurich and Hyderabad, India, as well as the company's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Some carried signs that said, "O.K. Google, really?" and chanted: "Stand up! Fight back!" Some of the employees talked publicly about how they also faced sexual harassment at work.
Afterward, Google said it would end its practice of forced arbitration for claims of sexual harassment.
More than 300 other employees have shared stories of retaliation since the walkout, Ms. Stapleton and Ms. Whittaker wrote in their letter. They said they planned to share their stories of retaliation at a company meeting on Friday.
"I think it's pretty straightforward," said Amr Gaber, a software engineer at Google who helped organize the walkout. "Google has never treated them this way, and then the walkout happened. Now they're having to deal with being told their work is no longer valuable."
The meeting on Friday will allow others to speak up about their experiences, Mr. Gaber said. "If we can't fight fear, then people aren't going to speak up and we're not going to listen to the voices that need to be heard," he said.

Trump committed no crime; Democrats don't care because the Russia investigation was always political

Texto completo: The neverending Russia-collusion saga was always political. Nothing makes that clearer than the Democrats calling for impeachment after Robert Mueller's finding that there was no there there.

Mueller’s team declared in the report last week over and over again that they found no evidence that President Trump’s 2016 campaign colluded with Russia and that they didn’t have the goods to accuse Trump of obstructing justice.

But now, we’re supposed to act like that whole thing about Russia was nothing — that the real concern is Mueller’s declining to state that Trump had broken the law in attempting to influence the investigation.

All the reasons Mueller made no determination on the obstruction question are spelled out in the report. The least of them is that Department of Justice policy says a sitting president is not to be charged with a crime. The other two reasons are far more important: that there was “substantial evidence” Trump was simply frustrated that the investigation was hamstringing his ability to govern and that there was no underlying crime (conspiracy with Russia) to begin with.

What justice can be obstructed if nothing wrong had occurred?

You will almost never get that context from the national media. Not that it matters.

Liberal New York Times columnist Charles Blow wrote Monday that House Democrats should impeach Trump solely to leave a stain on his presidency. “I can think of no president who has earned this rebuke more than the current one,” he wrote. “And, once a president is impeached, he is forever marked.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is running for her party’s presidential nomination, has also called for impeachment.

Former Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., wrote this weekend in the Washington Post that impeachment should take place, not because Trump is necessarily guilty of anything (the report says he’s not, by the way!) but because it would build “the record” against his presidency.

Democrats pretended for two years that this was about defending democracy and reaffirming our institutions. Now the report is out, it gave them nothing, and they’ve decided to drop the act.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had wanted to make Barack Obama “a one-term president" by wrecking his legislative agenda. Democrats want to make Trump a half-term president by imagining a crime.

Finding wisdom for the pope

Texto completo: Re-enacting a moment from his childhood, Paul Audia steadies an imaginary Eastman Kodak Brownie at his waist to take the first photographs of his career. "Oh, man," Audia says. "That little Brownie and seeing the magic of it. This is cool."
So is being the primary photographer for Pope Francis’ international best-selling book, "Sharing the Wisdom of Time."
"Every picture in that book has so much story behind it," says Audia, who lives in Wood Dale and spent months shooting photographs for the book in locations across the United States, Ireland, England, Malta, Italy, Croatia, Spain and Poland. His portraits include a local black woman who overcame prejudice to finish nursing school, a soccer player in Madrid who learned how hard work can overcome frustration, a Slovenian woman who talks about a life worth living as she rolls her wheelchair through the rain, and a Holocaust survivor who lives in Ohio and still works to curb hate.
"I like this book very much because it gives voice to people with years of experience. It lets them talk and tell their experiences," Pope Francis writes in the book’s preface. "I also liked looking at the images of their faces."
Most of those images are the result of Audia’s work.
"Our sincere gratitude goes to the man behind the camera, photographer Paul Audia, whose gift for capturing the dignity and majesty of a person shines through in each of his photos," reads the acknowledgment in the front of the book.
As a kid growing up in Fairmont, West Virginia, Audia photographed hometown hero and teenage gymnast Mary Lou Retton, who became famous at the 1984 Olympics as the first American woman to win the all-around gold medal.
Audia left West Virginia University early to start his career in radio, where he spent six years as an on-air personality, and worked as a disc jockey spinning disco tunes at nightclubs. But he also studied photography and became a member of the Professional Photographers of America.
He shot high school senior portraits, proms, weddings and ads for department stories and Iron City Beer. "I didn’t turn down anything," he remembers. One of his most difficult jobs was shooting photographs for Peabody Coal in a mine 600 feet underground, where lighting was an adventure. They shut down the mine for 10 minutes, and Audia captured three images on film. "The first was shaky. The second was almost perfect. The third was perfect," Audia remembers.
He has photographed Buddy Guy, Billy Corgan and other musicians and fashion models on runways in New York City and on cobblestone streets in Guatemala. "I was the king of bridal for about 12 years," he says. He’s captured faces from Barack Obama to Irish fishermen. He shoots video and photos for Access Community Health Network, a provider of health services across Cook and DuPage counties. He tells stories of some of his photos on his podcast. He’s married to Bonnie Reid, has two grown children and two grandkids.
"All the things you do previously in your life bring all those skills to that moment of life," Audia says in explaining how he captured images for the pope’s book. He was touched not only by the stories of older people but by the help he was offered from strangers in foreign lands whenever he needed directions or assistance, Audia says.
"To me, this book was life-altering," Audia says. "The stories I heard. The people who gave me love."
In 2015, Loyola Press published the first papal book for children: "Dear Pope Francis: The Pope Answers Letters from Children Around the World," which made The New York Times Best Sellers List. Jesuit Father Antonio Spadaro, editor-in-chief of the Italian Jesuit journal La CiviltÃ  Cattolica, visited the Chicago publisher in 2016. "He said the Holy Father had another idea," remembers Joellyn Cicciarelli, president and publisher of Loyola Press. "And we said OK."
Working with Jesuit groups and Unbound, a not-for-profit global anti-poverty organization with many programs that aid the elderly, the book gathered stories of elders imparting wisdom.
"These people were sharing raw stories and we needed a photographer to capture that," Cicciarelli says. The book’s designer, Jill Arena, had worked with Audia before and knew he’d be perfect for the job.
"I try to start out with a blank canvas. I start talking and try to get a feel for them," Audia says of his approach, which is the same for every person he meets.
Sitting next to filmmaker Martin Scorsese at the book’s release last October during the pope’s synod on youth in Rome, Audia says the director, who tells a story in the book, talked to Audia as if they were old friends about cameras, equipment and actors. Scorsese dropped names as if Audia were part of his Hollywood network. "I know Robert DeNiro, but I don’t know Bobby DeNiro," Audia says, laughing at the memory.
The book’s chapters deal with work, struggle, love, death and hope. "Sharing the Wisdom of Time" has been reprinted in nine languages in more than a dozen countries. It’s a coffee-table art book that reaches a diverse audience, some of whom Audia will photograph today in Michigan City, Indiana.
"I’m going to a prison on Easter Sunday," Audia says. "Several of the prisoners carry the book with them."

Texto completo: Re-enacting a moment from his childhood, Paul Audia steadies an imaginary Eastman Kodak Brownie at his waist to take the first photographs of his career. "Oh, man," Audia says. "That little Brownie and seeing the magic of it. This is cool."
So is being the primary photographer for Pope Francis’ international best-selling book, "Sharing the Wisdom of Time."
"Every picture in that book has so much story behind it," says Audia, who lives in Wood Dale and spent months shooting photographs for the book in locations across the United States, Ireland, England, Malta, Italy, Croatia, Spain and Poland. His portraits include a local black woman who overcame prejudice to finish nursing school, a soccer player in Madrid who learned how hard work can overcome frustration, a Slovenian woman who talks about a life worth living as she rolls her wheelchair through the rain, and a Holocaust survivor who lives in Ohio and still works to curb hate.
"I like this book very much because it gives voice to people with years of experience. It lets them talk and tell their experiences," Pope Francis writes in the book’s preface. "I also liked looking at the images of their faces."
Most of those images are the result of Audia’s work.
"Our sincere gratitude goes to the man behind the camera, photographer Paul Audia, whose gift for capturing the dignity and majesty of a person shines through in each of his photos," reads the acknowledgment in the front of the book.
As a kid growing up in Fairmont, West Virginia, Audia photographed hometown hero and teenage gymnast Mary Lou Retton, who became famous at the 1984 Olympics as the first American woman to win the all-around gold medal.
Audia left West Virginia University early to start his career in radio, where he spent six years as an on-air personality, and worked as a disc jockey spinning disco tunes at nightclubs. But he also studied photography and became a member of the Professional Photographers of America.
He shot high school senior portraits, proms, weddings and ads for department stories and Iron City Beer. "I didn’t turn down anything," he remembers. One of his most difficult jobs was shooting photographs for Peabody Coal in a mine 600 feet underground, where lighting was an adventure. They shut down the mine for 10 minutes, and Audia captured three images on film. "The first was shaky. The second was almost perfect. The third was perfect," Audia remembers.
He has photographed Buddy Guy, Billy Corgan and other musicians and fashion models on runways in New York City and on cobblestone streets in Guatemala. "I was the king of bridal for about 12 years," he says. He’s captured faces from Barack Obama to Irish fishermen. He shoots video and photos for Access Community Health Network, a provider of health services across Cook and DuPage counties. He tells stories of some of his photos on his podcast. He’s married to Bonnie Reid, has two grown children and two grandkids.
"All the things you do previously in your life bring all those skills to that moment of life," Audia says in explaining how he captured images for the pope’s book. He was touched not only by the stories of older people but by the help he was offered from strangers in foreign lands whenever he needed directions or assistance, Audia says.
"To me, this book was life-altering," Audia says. "The stories I heard. The people who gave me love."
In 2015, Loyola Press published the first papal book for children: "Dear Pope Francis: The Pope Answers Letters from Children Around the World," which made The New York Times Best Sellers List. Jesuit Father Antonio Spadaro, editor-in-chief of the Italian Jesuit journal La CiviltÃ  Cattolica, visited the Chicago publisher in 2016. "He said the Holy Father had another idea," remembers Joellyn Cicciarelli, president and publisher of Loyola Press. "And we said OK."
Working with Jesuit groups and Unbound, a not-for-profit global anti-poverty organization with many programs that aid the elderly, the book gathered stories of elders imparting wisdom.
"These people were sharing raw stories and we needed a photographer to capture that," Cicciarelli says. The book’s designer, Jill Arena, had worked with Audia before and knew he’d be perfect for the job.
"I try to start out with a blank canvas. I start talking and try to get a feel for them," Audia says of his approach, which is the same for every person he meets.
Sitting next to filmmaker Martin Scorsese at the book’s release last October during the pope’s synod on youth in Rome, Audia says the director, who tells a story in the book, talked to Audia as if they were old friends about cameras, equipment and actors. Scorsese dropped names as if Audia were part of his Hollywood network. "I know Robert DeNiro, but I don’t know Bobby DeNiro," Audia says, laughing at the memory.
The book’s chapters deal with work, struggle, love, death and hope. "Sharing the Wisdom of Time" has been reprinted in nine languages in more than a dozen countries. It’s a coffee-table art book that reaches a diverse audience, some of whom Audia will photograph today in Michigan City, Indiana.
"I’m going to a prison on Easter Sunday," Audia says. "Several of the prisoners carry the book with them."

Texto completo: I’ve been trying to teach my teenage son to take on some responsibility. I told him he is a selfish person, but only in the way that he’s a typical teenager. He immediately tried to correct me because don’t I see that he drives his little brother home from school and so he can’t possibly be selfish because he does so much for the family?
I took a little time to inform him that he drives his brother in a car that his parents gave him, a car we fill with gas as the teen lounges on his bed and watches the large television on his bedroom wall.
And he’s all, “Yeah, I don’t cause any problems. You’re welcome.”
So I gave him a chore. He needed to mow the lawn.
He agreed that maybe, possibly, mowing the lawn could be something he could do to contribute. But the first time he went out to the backyard, he was there for only a minute before coming back inside.
“Can’t mow,” he said. “Bees.”
I rolled my eyes. This is the same kid I sent into the grocery store one day with the mission to buy milk, and he came back to the car empty-handed and said, “They don’t have any.”
Long story short, they had milk, of course they had milk, because it’s a GROCERY STORE.
OK, I get that he lives in oblivion. But someone has to mow the lawn. So I said, “Look, there are always going to be bees outside. You still have to mow the lawn.”
“But mom,” he said. “Bees.”
And I responded, “But son, nature. It happens.”
He went outside again, and lasted two minutes before he came back inside.
“Bees,” he said.
“Blah,” I responded, in the form of a sigh. “Fine. Let’s go out and see these *air quotes* bees.”
We went to the backyard, and on the fence there were two active hives, and after some study (which means I got bit) we determined they were yellow jackets.
Yellow jackets are meat eaters. They bite to feed on your flesh, not for any defensive measures.
So the oblivious kid had a point this time. But yellow jackets or no, the lawn needed to get mowed eventually.
Now, I’m all about appreciating nature. But I’m also about committing mass murder of yellow jackets. I went to Home Depot and bought a spray that guaranteed to annihilate them on contact, without mercy.
But then the guy I was seeing at the time said, “No. We don’t kill living things.”
And I said, “What do you mean ‘we’?”
And he said, “Let’s just let them know that they need to relocate.”
“How?” I asked.
“We’ll knock down their homes. And they will find a new place that isn’t here.”
He went outside, armed with a shovel, and knocked down the hives. Then he came running inside, because apparently he’d made the yellow jackets mad.
A couple of days later, new hives appeared. Three of them. The yellow jackets had not gotten the memo that they were not welcome. In fact, they had invited friends.
So, I did what any sane person would do. I sprayed them all and I got rid of the boyfriend.
Now, the backyard is littered with dead yellow jackets, my teenage son mows the lawn, and my Tinder profile includes the phrase, “Must be willing to murder yellow jackets.”

Texto completo: Under pressure from animal-rights groups and a growing public perception that horse racing is cruel, the three tracks that host the Triple Crown races formed a coalition on Thursday and agreed to seek a ban on race-day medication for all of their 2-year old races beginning next year and to extend that practice for stakes races -- the sport's highest level -- in 2021.
The new policy would move the United States closer to the standards in Europe, Australia and Hong Kong, where strict rules about medication are thought to have helped make horse fatalities far rarer than they are here. The proposed policy is also an attempt to change the conversation -- directing it away from the recent 23 horse fatalities at Santa Anita Park -- as the Kentucky Derby approaches and casual sports fans turn their attention to horse racing.
This partial ban must be approved by regulators in Kentucky, New York, Maryland and other states with racetracks in the coalition. It is certain to be opposed by some trainers and owners in various jurisdictions. In fact, in 2011, the American Graded Stakes Committee and the Breeders' Cup, which runs an annual world championship, adopted similar rules only to abandon them within two years after pressure from trainers and owners.
If the changes are adopted, however, it would mean that horses competing in the 2021 Triple Crown races -- the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, the Preakness at Pimlico Race Course and the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park -- would run without receiving a shot of furosemide on the day of the race.
The drug, commonly referred to as Lasix, is a diuretic that has been banned on race days in Europe and many other parts of the world. The drug can reduce a horse's weight by up to 30 pounds, which is believed to enhance performance because a lighter horse may run faster. It is also thought to increase the chance of a catastrophic injury to a horse's thin legs.
"This is a progressive and unified approach to the subject of race-day medication, achieving consistency with international standards for young horses and those that form the foundations of our breeding stock," David O'Rourke, the chief executive of the New York Racing Association, which operates Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga, said in a statement.
The fatalities at Santa Anita have prompted an investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, condemnations from the state's elected officials, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and calls to shut down the sport altogether.
"This is a huge moment that signals a collective move to evolve this legacy sport," said Belinda Stronach, the chairwoman and president of the Stronach Group, whose holdings include Santa Anita, Gulfstream Park in Florida and Pimlico, home of the Preakness. "While there is still more work to be done, these reforms are a good start."
The Stronach Group, in the wake of the deaths at Santa Anita, has already issued even stronger rules about the care of horses than the proposal for the Triple Crown races.
The announcement came 16 days ahead of the Kentucky Derby, which kicks off the Triple Crown season: a five-week stretch during which tens of millions of casual sports fans tune into the telecasts of the year's biggest races. The host tracks hope to reduce growing concerns about American horse racing, which has a fatality rate two and half to five times higher than the industry in any other country, according to recent studies.
In a 2012 series, The New York Times showed that 24 horses died per week at racetracks across America, many of them because of overmedication or a lack of regulatory protection. Nearly 10 horses a week died on American racetracks in 2018, according to the Jockey Club's Equine Injury database. The number is lower in part because the database does not include deaths during morning training, which were included in the Times investigation.
"It took 23 dead horses on one track, but we were sure that the racing industry could change if it wanted to -- and phasing out Lasix for stakes races and for 2-year-olds is an excellent first step in what must be an ongoing overhaul of racing rules nationwide," said Kathy Guillermo, the senior vice president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a group that has been pushing the industry to change its practices. "Now, ban all medications in the two weeks before a race, ban trainers with multiple medication violations, mandate complete public transparency of injury and medication records, end whipping, and switch to high-quality synthetic tracks."
Horse racing has traditionally been slow to embrace change, especially when it comes to drugs. Many horse trainers across the nation say medication is aimed at keeping their animals healthy and competing. The trainers do not want to surrender the right to to use it, arguing that they know best how to maintain the health of a racehorse.
Some of those trainers and horse owners were digging in their heels on Thursday afternoon.
"Furosemide has been a hot-button topic within horse racing for well over a decade, yet no one credibly believes that its use has an effect on breakdowns," Joe Appelbaum, president of the New York Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association, said in a statement. "Our trainers widely believe that furosemide is an effective tool in combating exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage."

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to release a lightly

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to release a lightly redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s 400-page report today, offering a granular look at the ways in which President Donald Trump was suspected of obstructing justice, people familiar with the matter said.
The report — the general outlines of which the Justice Department has briefed the White House on — will reveal that Mueller decided he could not come to a conclusion on the question of obstruction because it was difficult to determine Trump’s intent and some of his actions could be interpreted innocently, these people said. But it will offer a detailed account of his alleged conduct — analyzing tweets, private threats and other episodes at the center of Mueller’s inquiry, they added.
Attorney General William Barr plans to hold an 8:30 a.m. news conference to address "process questions" and provide an "overview of the report," a senior Justice Department official said. The report will be delivered on discs to Capitol Hill between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. (CDT), the official said, and will be posted on the special counsel’s website thereafter.
Those who spoke to The Washington Post for this report did so on the condition of anonymity, citing the matter’s supreme sensitivity.
Today’s rollout plan — and news of the White House’s advance briefing, which was first reported by ABC News and The New York Times — led to political uproar Wednesday, with Democrats suggesting the attorney general was trying to improperly color Mueller’s findings before the public could read them.
"This is wrong," Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter.
While the report’s light redactions might allay some of their concerns, Democrats are likely to bristle at any material that is withheld. What the Justice Department and Trump’s lawyers might view as modest, lawmakers might see as overly aggressive.
Barr also is likely to face scrutiny over the Justice Department’s talks with the White House — which could help Trump and his attorneys hone their attacks on the report in advance.
Rudolph Giuliani, one of Trump’s lawyers, has said he is preparing a counterreport to Mueller’s findings, and in a recent interview said his document would explain from the president’s viewpoint every episode that could be considered obstructive. Giuliani and others have long feared Mueller’s findings on obstruction, viewing them as potentially more damaging than anything Mueller found on the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians.
Mueller did not find a conspiracy between Russians and Trump or his campaign, Barr said in a brief letter of the special counsel’s conclusions shared with Congress late last month.
Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s attorneys, told The Washington Post, "We do not discuss conversations that we may or may not have had with the president." A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to address questions about its briefings to the White House, the report’s redactions or Mueller’s findings on obstruction.
Trump had also apparently been briefed in advance of the planned news conference, which he revealed Wednesday during a radio appearance, which was confirmed later by a Justice Department spokeswoman. Barr will appear alongside Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the spokeswoman said, and he planned to take questions.
Barr has faced intense scrutiny from the public and lawmakers on Capitol Hill for his handling of Mueller’s report. Today’s news conference could give him an opportunity to address his critics — and perhaps provide them fresh ammunition. It is sure to be watched closely by Trump, an avid TV viewer whose relationship with his attorney general will almost certainly be colored by Mueller’s findings and what Barr says about them.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the White House did not ask the Justice Department to hold the news conference, but she declined to discuss White House and Justice Department interactions about the report.
Trump told the Larry O’Connor show on WMAL that he was pondering having his own news conference.
"You’ll see a lot of very strong things come out tomorrow. Attorney General Barr is going to be giving a news conference. Maybe I’ll do one after that; we’ll see," Trump said.
Already, Democratic lawmakers and pundits have alleged that Barr seems to be taking steps to mitigate the political damage Mueller’s report might do to Trump, and some members of Mueller’s team have told associates they are frustrated by the limited information he has released about their work.
A senior White House official said Trump has praised Barr privately for his handling of the report and compared him favorably with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who Trump grew to loathe over his recusal from what would become Mueller’s investigation.
Since the special counsel’s office closed its investigation late last month, Barr and his team at the Justice Department have been reviewing the final report to determine how much of it can be made public. The Justice Department has said it plans to release the document with four categories of information shielded from public view: material from the grand jury, material that reveals intelligence sources and methods, material that is relevant to ongoing investigations, and material that could affect the privacy of "peripheral" third parties. Each redaction will be color-coded so readers know the reason material is being shielded, Barr has said.
Any redactions could be controversial, and Democrats have said they won’t be satisfied unless they are given the entire, unfiltered document. It is likely House Democrats will attempt to subpoena it, sparking a legal battle that could last for months or even years.
Barr has so far disclosed only what the Justice Department terms Mueller’s "principal conclusions." In a four-page letter to lawmakers, he declared last month that Mueller did not find that anyone on Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, and that the special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice. Barr wrote that he and Rosenstein then reviewed the evidence and did not find it sufficient to make an obstruction case.
Barr offered only a few quotes from Mueller’s report, leaving a curious public with many more questions than answers about what his 22-month investigation had found.
White House officials are concerned about damaging testimony from a number of senior aides, particularly former counsel Donald McGahn and former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, according to current and former officials. Their testimony, according to people with knowledge of it, gave a clear, detailed breakdown of some of the most controversial incidents, from the firing of James Comey as FBI director to attempts to oust Sessions. McGahn spoke with the special counsel for dozens of hours, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Texto completo: LONDON -- Daniel Kramer has resigned as artistic director of English National Opera, the company said on Wednesday, just two weeks after he announced the program for his second season in the role.
Mr. Kramer will leave at the end of July to focus on directing, the company said in a statement. But he will act as a consultant until the end of the year on a series of four operas about the Greek myth of Orpheus in the company's coming season.
"I am proud to leave E.N.O. after a season that has broken box office records, innovated and challenged, while delivering commercial success," Mr. Kramer said in a statement.
Mr. Kramer's sudden departure is the latest high-profile resignation to trouble the English National Opera, one of the two main opera companies in London. In the past 18 months its chief executive, Cressida Pollock, and Terri-Jayne Griffin, a long-serving and well-respected member of the production team, have also resigned.
Arts Council England, the body that distributes funding for the British government, has significantly reduced the company's grant. The music director Mark Wrigglesworth stood down after a hefty cut in 2016. The company has turned to renting its home out to other productions to make up the shortfall.
Mr. Kramer, an American director, had never held a position at an opera house before his appointment in August 2016, but he was brought in to revamp the organization. "I could see they needed a leader who had some of the maps to come out of trauma into forward motion," he said in an interview with The New York Times last year. "It felt like the opportunity of a lifetime," he added.
His first season met with mixed reviews.
Anthony Tommasini, writing in The Times, hailed a production of "Porgy and Bess," for its "emotional depth and belief in the characters." It is transferring to the Metropolitan Opera in September. But that production was planned by Mr. Kramer's predecessor. A production of "Jack The Ripper: The Women of Whitechapel," which focused on the Victorian murderer's victims, fared less well. The critic Hugh Canning called it "an intriguing failure" in a review in The Times of London.
A feminist reworking of "Salome" met with a similar reception. The Daily Telegraph's critic called it "infuriatingly baffling" and "mightily pretentious," adding, "I doubt the show's ambience will play out well with E.N.O.'s core audience."
In a statement earlier this month announcing the company's new season, Mr. Kramer said, "It is important that E.N.O. continues to push the boundaries of what is possible on the operatic stage and at the same time keep bringing in new audiences who may not have considered us before."
"It's not surprising that he left. It was more when than if," said John Allison, the editor of Opera magazine, in a telephone interview. Mr. Kramer was a good talker about his productions, but they often failed to deliver, Mr. Allison added.
The English National Opera should appoint a new artistic director with experience in the opera world, as this was missing from the company's leadership team, Mr. Allison said. But he did not want to speculate on who could fill the position. "It is a bit of a poisoned chalice," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: When Spelman College named Donald M. Stewart its sixth president in 1976, female students "went ballistic," a former pupil recalled.
Four of Spelman's previous presidents had been white women and the fifth a black man. Believing the time long overdue for an African-American woman being named president, some Spelman sisters roped the school boardroom door closed, locking in several trustees. For roughly 24 hours students took shifts guarding the rope.
"During that time I went into the student center, and standing right there was Daddy King (Martin Luther King Sr.)," said the Rev. Cassandra Aline Jones, a 1979 graduate. "He told us, 'I support what you young people are doing, just remember to stay peaceful.' "
By the time Stewart brought his family to campus that fall, tempers had simmered down.
"We were young," his wife Isabel Stewart said recently. "We had two young boys and a dog. That softened people."
It didn't hurt that Stewart's personality and intellect took the school, founded in 1881, to new heights. During his 10 years, Spelman's endowment grew from $9 million to more than $41 million.
A gift negotiated with DeWitt Wallace added another $37 million to that when the gift matured in 1992, five years after Stewart left.
According to a 1986 New York Times article, the average SAT scores of entering freshman escalated 100 points during his tenure. About half of Spelman's professors had doctorates when Stewart took over; that jumped to 74 percent. The enrollment expanded from 1,200 to 1,600 students.
To many, it seemed like he knew them all.
"I had a classmate who lost both her parents during her senior year," Jones said. "Both the Stewarts called her, asked her how she was, if there was anything she needed. That is something my friend has never forgotten."
Donald Mitchell Stewart died of natural causes in his hometown of Chicago on April 7. The funeral is April 20, 11 a.m., at University Church of Chicago.
Stewart was born in 1938 to Elmer Ashton Stewart, who worked for the Postal Service, and Anna Lucy Stewart, who sold World Book Encyclopedias to help put Don and his younger sister Ruth Ann Stewart -- later a professor at New York University -- through school.
He graduated from Grinnell College (Iowa) in 1959 with a bachelor's in political science.
He earned a master's in political science from Yale University, and a master's and doctorate in public administration from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
In 1960-62 he also attended the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Switzerland, although his wife said, "He mostly studied skiing."
They met on a complicated blind date involving three couples where, she said, "nobody liked anybody."
But Don persisted, and they married in 1965 in Philadelphia. They honeymooned in Europe and North Africa and, through his work with the Overseas Development Division of The Ford Foundation from 1962 through 1969, lived in Nigeria, Egypt and Tunisia.
"We were planning an international life of adventure," Isabel Stewart said. "But then came the assassinations (Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr.) in 1968. We knew we wanted to come back and take part in the movement."
Stewart spent several years teaching and helping administer at the University of Pennsylvania before coming to Spelman.
Marian Wright Edelman, a 1960 Spelman grad and later a MacArthur Fellow and founder of the Children's Defense Fund, was on the board of trustees that hired him. She was also one of those locked in by angry students.
"Well, of course I wanted a black woman president just like they did," Edelman said this week. "They locked us up with no access to the bathroom, although we did have some nice trash cans. I don't blame them. I would've done the same thing if I'd been them.
"But I wasn't going to back down," she said. "We scoured the country and we found the best choice in Isabel and Don, an extraordinary couple. They were young, vibrant, attractive and smart. And he made the college a national institution that competed on a national level."
During Stewart's time Spelman established a foreign travel-study program, a comprehensive writing program and the Women's Research and Resource Center. It built strength in the sciences, technology and math (STEM) and established chemistry and computer science departments.
Spelman is now the number one institution in producing African American woman who get doctorates in the STEM field, according to Myra Burnett, Spelman's vice president of Institutional Research, Planning and Effectiveness. "Our success was built over many decades, but it goes back to him," she said.
After resigning in 1987 -- Stewart said he'd stay no longer than 10 years -- he became president of the College Board, the nonprofit that administers the SATs. After leaving the College Board in 1999 he became a special advisor to the president and senior program officer in the education division of the Carnegie Corporation of New York. From 2000 to 2005, he was chief executive of Chicago Community Trust, and from 2005 to 2011 was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy.
In his last years it wasn't unusual for Stewart to express pride that he was Spelman's last male president.
"We all wanted a (black) woman going back a long time," said Jane Smith, Spelman's vice president for College Relations. "But all that (lockdown) was never about him. For all of us who were around back then, Dr. Stewart walks on water."
Survivors include his wife, Isabel Carter Johnston Stewart, along with their sons, Jay Ashton Stewart ( Jasimin Torres), Carter Mitchell Stewart (Michelle Alexander),Gojeb Frehywot and eight grandchildren.

And STEPHEN R. GROVES
The Associated Press
NEW YORK - The South Florida Sun Sentinel and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won Pulitzer Prizes on Monday and were recognized along with the Capital Gazette of Maryland for their coverage of the horrifying mass shootings in 2018 at a high school, a synagogue and a newsroom itself.
The Associated Press won in the international reporting category for documenting the humanitarian horrors of Yemen's civil war, while The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal were honored for delving into President Donald Trump's finances and breaking open the hush-money scandals involving two women who said they had affairs with him.
The Florida paper received the Pulitzer in public service for its coverage of the massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and for detailing the shortcomings in school discipline and security that contributed to the carnage.
The Post-Gazette was honored in the breaking news category for its reporting on the synagogue rampage that left 11 people dead. The man awaiting trial in the attack railed against Jews before, during and after the massacre, authorities said.
After the Pulitzer announcement, the newsroom in Pittsburgh observed a moment of silence for the victims. At the Sun Sentinel, too, the staff took in the award in a sober spirit.
"We're mindful of what it is that we won for," Editor-in-Chief Julie Anderson said. "There are still families grieving, so it's not joy, it's almost ... I don't know how to describe it. We're emotional, as well."
So, too, at the Capital Gazette, which was given a special citation for its coverage and courage in the face of a massacre in its own newsroom. The Pulitzer board also gave the paper an extraordinary $100,000 grant to further its journalism.
"Clearly, there were a lot of mixed feelings," Editor Rick Hutzell said. "No one wants to
Win an award for something that kills five of your friends."
The Annapolis-based newspaper published on schedule, with some help from The Baltimore Sun, the day after five staffers were shot and killed in one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in U.S. history. The man charged had a longstanding grudge against the paper.
The Pulitzers, U.S. journalism's highest
Honor, reflected a year when journalism also came under attack in other ways.
Reuters won an international reporting award for work that cost two of its staffers their liberty: coverage of a brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims by security forces in Myanmar.
Reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are serving seven-year sentences after being convicted of violating the country's Official Secrets Act. Their supporters say the two were arrested in retaliation for their reporting.
Reuters also won the breaking news photography award for images of Central American migrants heading to the U.S.
The AP's international reporting prize went to a team of journalists who documented atrocities and suffering in Yemen, illuminating the human toll of its 4-year-old civil war.
As a result of the work by reporter Maggie Michael, photographer Nariman El-Mofty and video journalist Maad al-Zikry, at least 80 prisoners were released from secret detention sites, and the United Nations rushed food and medicine to areas where the AP revealed that people were starving while corrupt officials diverted international food aid.
"This is a story that everybody was not really paying good attention, and we're very happy to be able to draw some attention to it," Michael said.
Images of the famine in Yemen also brought a feature photography award for The Washington Post. The Post's book critic, Carlos Lozada, won the criticism prize for what the judges called "trenchant and searching" work.
In the U.S., journalists have been contending with attacks on the media's integrity from the president on down. Trump has branded coverage of his administration "fake news" and assailed the media as the "enemy of the people."
Monday's wins by the Times and The Wall Street Journal and freelance cartoonist Darrin Bell may further anger the president.
The Times won the explanatory reporting Pulitzer for laying out how a president who has portrayed himself as a largely self-made man has, in fact, received over $400 million in family money and helped his family avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Trump has called the Times expose a false "hit piece."
The Journal took the national reporting award for its investigations of payments orchestrated by the president's former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels and a Playboy centerfold. Trump has denied having affairs with them.
Bell, the editorial cartooning winner, called out "lies, hypocrisy and fraud in the political turmoil surrounding the Trump administration," the Pulitzer judges said.
The Los Angeles Times took the investigative reporting prize for stories that revealed hundreds of sexual abuse accusations against a recently retired University of Southern California gynecologist, who has denied the allegations. The university recently agreed to a $215 million settlement with the alleged victims.
The local reporting prize went to The Advocate of Louisiana for work that led to a state constitutional amendment abolishing Louisiana's unusual practice of allowing non-unanimous jury verdicts in felony trials.
ProPublica won the feature reporting award for coverage of Salvadoran immigrants affected by a federal crackdown on the MS-13 gang.
Tony Messenger, of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, received the commentary award for his series of columns about poor people being thrown back in jail in Missouri because they couldn't afford to pay the costs of a previous stint behind bars.
The New York Times' Brent Staples received the editorial writing award. The judges said his writing about the nation's racial history showed "extraordinary moral clarity."
The journalism prizes, first awarded in 1917, were established by newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer. Winners of the public service award receive a gold medal. The other awards carry a prize of $15,000 each.

No, America is not ‘full’

Texto completo: President Trump recently traveled to the Mexican border and delivered one of the most foolish and fallacious statements of his entire presidency. Speaking to the surge of immigrants seeking asylum here, he said, "We can’t take you anymore. Our country is full."
No, it is not full. It is not close to being full. In fact, the opposite is true. As aging baby boomers leave the workforce and depend more heavily on costly government services, more immigrants are desperately needed to fill jobs, pay taxes, have babies and revitalize areas that are losing population.
Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric serves only one purpose: to energize his supporters by inflaming the nativist fears that have periodically engulfed the country throughout our history. He firmly believes those fears helped elect him once, and will again.
From a political standpoint, that calculation is questionable. Trump’s denunciation of brown-skinned rapists and gangsters pouring across the southern border certainly helped his campaign in 2016, but last year, when he tried the same cynical scare tactics, his party lost 40 seats in the House. Clear majorities in national polls have consistently opposed his immigration policies.
From an economic standpoint, however, his war on immigrants is a disaster that would suffocate the sustained growth he loves to brag about. And in rare rational moments, when he acknowledges fiscal reality, the president admits that his own policy is crazy.
"I got all these companies moving in," he boasted recently. "They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place."
Under great pressure from business interests, Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security doubled the number of visas available for temporary guest workers this summer. Indeed, Trump’s own resorts and golf courses have long employed foreigners -- a graphic rebuttal to his own inane comments.
"It’s ironic that Trump is demagoguing and railing against a so-called dangerous and scary flood of migrants and caravans from Mexico and Central America, and even threatening to shut down the border, while at the same time using his legal authority to grow a guest worker program," Daniel Costa, an immigration expert at the Economic Policy Institute told the Washington Post.
There are short- and long-term implications here. Since June, for the first time since 1970, there have been more jobs available than workers seeking them. Many industries, from agriculture and food service to construction and health care, are frantically seeking immigrants to hire.
"For all the fears of robots taking over jobs," reports the New York Times, "some economists are worrying about the broader economic fallout from a lack of low-skilled workers. And businesses across the economy are complaining that without immigration, they will be left without a workforce."
Dallas homebuilders tell the Times that a lack of workers is adding $6,000 to the cost of every new home and delaying completion by two months. Larry Cox, who farms in California’s Imperial Valley, said the labor shortage is driving "a large transition of growing from California down to Mexico."
The problem is aggravated in areas like New England that are losing population. Phil Scott, the Republican governor of Vermont, said recently in his annual budget address: "I believe our biggest threat is our declining labor force. It’s the root of every problem we face. This makes it incredibly difficult for businesses to recruit new employees and expand, harder for communities to grow and leaves fewer of us to cover the cost of state government."
Older cities from Philadelphia to St. Louis are actively recruiting foreigners to restock urban neighborhoods as earlier settlers depart for the suburbs. "One of the key solutions" to urban blight is "to welcome immigrants into these communities," said Brooks Rainwater of the National League of Cities to the Times.
If anything, immigrants are even more important to the nation’s future economic health. U.S. birthrates are plummeting, and last year, population growth sank to its lowest level in 80 years. Newcomers accounted for nearly half of that increase. And by 2030, foreigners will be "the primary contributor to national population growth," estimates demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution.
These demographic trends, says Frey, require "a more serious discussion of U.S. immigration policy because of the future contributions that immigrants will make to growing America’s society and economy."
True, that serious discussion is imperative. But Trump’s tirade about a "full" America is totally wrong, and typical of his damaging determination to believe half-baked fantasies instead of proven facts.

Capital Gazette wins special citation; Pulitzer Prize Board recognizes staff for coverage of shooting at its office

Texto completo: The Pulitzer Prize Board awarded a special citation Monday to the staff of the Capital Gazette for their work in covering the June attack on their Annapolis offices that killed five employees.
The Capital's citation was given "for demonstrating unflagging commitment to covering the news and serving their community at a time of unspeakable grief." The award comes with a $100,000 bequest by the Pulitzer Board - the largest amount ever awarded - to be used to further the newspaper's journalistic mission.
The Capital Gazette staff was also a Pulitzer finalist in the editorial writing category.
In the face of tragedy, the Capital Gazette staffers continued to report on the shooting June 28 that killed Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith and Wendi Winters.
The Pulitzer Prize Board's special citation for the Capital was an unusual decision, existing outside of the 21 categories across journalism, books, drama and music awarded annually. A special citation was last awarded in 2011 to songwriter Hank Williams. The previous record for a cash award was $15,000, said Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy.
Canedy called the prize money a statement of support for local news, and said she hopes the gesture brings a measure of comfort to the staff and their families.
"It was important to us to make the contribution significant enough to aid the newspaper in continuing to do extraordinary community work," Canedy said.
Leadership with Baltimore Sun Media, which includes the Capital Gazette, will work with the newspaper's staff to determine how best to use the funds from the Pulitzer Board, said Tim Knight, CEO of the group's parent company Tribune Publishing, in an email Monday to employees.
"I ask that we pause and consider the remarkable sacrifice and dedication that our journalists poured into their award-winning work," Knight said. "That ... our teams could deliver such precise, compelling, heartbreaking journalism while their own hearts were breaking demands our awe."
Capital editor Rick Hutzell called the citation a "great honor," but one that brought mixed emotions.
"We spent the last couple of weeks talking about what this could mean," Hutzell said of the Pulitzer Board's consideration. "It's a recognition of what happened after June 28. The work we've done in the last eight to nine months speaks volumes about the community of journalism and it speaks worlds about the people in this room."
Staff believe it is the first Pulitzer that the paper has won.
Staffers gathered in the newsroom for a small event that Hutzell said was not quite a celebration.
"We weren't sure what to call this today," he said. "We have some refreshments in the office. We didn't want to have a celebration, but it feels really good that our peers were nationally recognized."
Reporter Chase Cook said the mood among the staffers, former colleagues and family at the gathering Monday was "subdued."
"There was definitely no exciting pop-off like there may have been at other papers," Cook said. "It was a little confused. Was it OK to cheer? It's a complicated feeling. I think we were all overcome with excitement, but also the reminder of the worst day of our lives."
Despite the bittersweet feelings, reporter Selene San Felice said she felt elated to learn of the special citation. "[I want people] to know that we do this not for us, but for the community," San Felice said. "We picked up nationwide notoriety after the shooting, but we're reporting for Anne Arundel County, for Annapolis. That's been our goal since day one and nobody's going to stop that."
Trif Alatzas, publisher and editor-in-chief of Baltimore Sun Media, which includes the Capital Gazette, called the award a great tribute to the staff's work under extraordinary circumstances.
"They always came to work and did their job as they remembered Rob Hiaasen, Rebecca Smith, Wendi Winters, John McNamara and Gerald Fischman," Alatzas said. "We also owe an incredible amount of thanks to the entire journalism community, who provided so much assistance throughout the days, weeks and months to help this organization continue on its mission."
Before announcing the winners, Canedy shared strong words recognizing journalists, including those at the Capital Gazette, who have died for their work.
Gov. Larry Hogan tweeted a congratulations to the Capital Gazette and called the prize a "well-deserved honor."
"Gerald, Rob, John, Rebecca, and Wendi will never be forgotten," Hogan said in the tweet.
The 2019 winners and finalists of the Pulitzer Prize, considered one of the highest honors in journalism, were announced Monday afternoon at Columbia University's School of Journalism. Other winners included: the South Florida Sun Sentinel (also part of Tribune Publishing) for its coverage of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland; the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for coverage of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting; and The New York Times for its investigation into President Donald Trump's finances.
Aretha Franklin, who died last summer, also received a special citation from the Pulitzer Prize board, with judges praising the Queen of Soul "for her indelible contribution to American music and culture."
In addition to the Pulitzer citation, the Capital staffers won the 2019 News Leaders Association award for breaking news and were named among Time magazine's Person of the Year for their work as "The Guardians and the War on Truth." And Hutzell accepted the National Press Foundation's Benjamin C. Bradlee Editor of the Year award in February.
The Maryland General Assembly unanimously voted in March to designate June 28 as "Freedom of the Press Day" to honor the fallen Capital employees.

Texto completo: Last week’s arrest of Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange by the British government on a U.S. extradition order is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the U.S. Constitution. It is an attack on the free press. It is an attack on free speech. It is an attack on our right to know what our government is doing with our money in our name.
Julian Assange is every bit as much a political prisoner as was Cardinal Mindszenty in Hungary or Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
They, and so many more, were imprisoned because they told the truth about their governments.
Repressive governments do not want their citizens to know that they are up to so they insist on controlling the media. We are taught, at the same time, that we have a free press whose job it is to uncover the corruption in our system so that we can demand our political leaders make some changes or face unemployment. That, we are told, is what makes us different from the totalitarian.
The arrest of Assange is a canary in a coal mine to warn us that something is very wrong with our system.
What’s wrong? The U.S. mainstream media always seems to do the bidding of the U.S. government. That is why they rushed to confirm Washington’s claim that the Assange indictment was not in any way about journalism. It was only about hacking government computers!
As the New York Times said in an editorial, sounding like a mouthpiece of the U.S. government, Julian Assange committed “an indisputable crime.” But was it? As actual journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote last week, what Julian Assange did in 2010, for which he is facing extradition to the U.S., is no different from what New York Times and other journalists do every day! He attempted to help Chelsea Manning shield Manning’s identity as Manning blew the whistle on U.S. government crimes to a publisher. The information in question included a video showing U.S. military personnel participating in and cheering the murder of Iraqi civilians. Why is it criminal for us to know this?
The difference is that what Assange and Manning did embarrassed the U.S. government, which was lying to us that it was “liberating” Iraq and Afghanistan when it was actually doing the opposite. Mainstream journalists publish “leaks” that help bolster the neocon or other vested narratives of the different factions of the US government. That’s why the US media wants to see Assange in prison, or worse: he upset their apple cart.
The lesson is clear: when you bolster the government’s narrative you are a “brave journalist.” When you expose corruption in government you are a criminal. Do we really want to live in a country where it is illegal to learn that our government is engaged in criminal acts? I thought we had an obligation as an engaged citizenry to hold our government accountable!
As long as Julian Assange is in prison, we are all in prison. When the government has the power to tell us what we are allowed to see, hear, and know, we no longer live in a free society. Julian Assange will be extradited to the U.S. and he will have dozens of charges piled on. They want him to disappear so that the next Assange will think twice before informing us of our government’s crimes. Are we going to let them steal our freedom?
Dr. Ron Paul is a former member of the House of Representatives. This article was written for and published by the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.

Texto completo: The Wall Street Journal won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles that detailed hush-money payments to two women who said they had affairs with President Trump.
The investigation —which placed Mr. Trump at the center of a scheme to silence Stephanie Clifford, the former adult-film star known professionally as Stormy Daniels, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal before the 2016 presidential election—won the Pulitzer for national reporting.
For the 103rd annual competition, the South Florida Sun Sentinel won in the public service category for "exposing failings by school and law-enforcement officials before and after the deadly shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School."
In the national reporting category, a team of Journal reporters won for "uncovering President Trump's secret payoffs to two women during his campaign who claimed to have had affairs with him, and the web of supporters who facilitated the transactions, triggering criminal inquiries and calls for impeachment."

The New York Times and Washington Post each won two awards. The Times was recognized for its investigation of President Trump's finances and for editorials written by Brent Staples. The Post won for criticism by Carlos Lozada and for feature photography of the famine in Yemen.
The Associated Press and Reuters each won Pulitzers for international reporting, for their coverage of war in Yemen and the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, respectively. Reuters also won for breaking news photography of South and Central American migrants' journeys to the U.S.
The Los Angeles Times took home the prize for investigative reporting on a former University of Southern California gynecologist accused of violating hundreds of young women. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was recognized for breaking news coverage of a deadly synagogue shooting, and the Advocate of Baton Rouge, La., won the local reporting award.
Columbia University administers the prizes.
In fiction, the Pulitzer was given to "The Overstory" a novel by Richard Powers, published by W.W. Norton. The drama prize went to Jackie Sibblies Drury for her play "Fairview," which examines the issue of race.

Kokua Line: City and state not among sanctuaries for undocumented migrants

Autor: Donnelly, Christine. 

Información de publicación: Honolulu Star - Advertiser ; Honolulu, Hawaii [Honolulu, Hawaii]. 15 Apr 2019.

Texto completo: Q uestion : Is Hawaii a sanctuary state?
Answer : No. A bill this year in the state Legislature would have made Hawaii a so-called sanctuary state for undocumented immigrants, but it died in the House after passing in the Senate.
The measure, SB 557, would have limited local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal authorities enforcing immigration violations against undocumented immigrants who pay their taxes and have no criminal convictions. You can read the measure, and testimony for and against it, at 808ne.ws/sb557.
As of 2015 there were about 45,000 undocumented immigrants in Hawaii, the bill said, most of whom were people from Japan or the Philippines who had overstayed their visas.
According to The Associated Press, Oregon was the first to approve a statewide sanctuary law, in the 1980s, followed by California, decades later. In addition, hundreds of U.S. cities or counties — Honolulu is not among them — have enacted sanctuary laws aimed at keeping law enforcement officials focused on local crime, rather than detaining people suspected of being in the country illegally, the AP said.
Your question was prompted by President Donald Trump’s desire to release into sanctuary states and cities migrants now being detained at the United States’ southern border. Mayors of potentially affected cities dismissed Trump’s comments as a publicity stunt that could backfire.
His 2016 campaign promise to block federal funding for sanctuary cities has gone unfulfilled, and sanctuary- type laws are expanding despite his opposition. More than 120 new laws have been enacted throughout the country since January 2017, according to “The Success of Sanctuary Under Trump,” published by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a nonprofit based in California. You can read the paper at 808ne.ws/paper.
Q : Were any Hawaii parents involved in the college admissions scandal?
A : No one from Hawaii was among the 50 people charged in indictments unsealed March 12 in federal court in Boston that alleged a nationwide scheme of fraud, cheating and bribery in the world of elite college admissions. Thirty-four defendants are from California — where confessed mastermind William “Rick” Singer ran a college-prep company — and the rest are from Texas, Florida, Connecticut, New York, Nevada, Maryland, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Canada. They include parents, college coaches, exam administrators and others who, among other things, are accused of paying or accepting bribes to fraudulently admit students into elite colleges.
See the list of individuals and the status of their cases at 808ne.ws/fedcase.
Other readers have also asked about this topic, wondering, like you, whether the scheme reached Hawaii or whether more people willbe charged. (Singer claimed to have clients in 81 U.S. cities and five foreign countries and that 750 students benefited from the scheme from 2011 to 2018, according to news reports.)
Liz McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachu­­setts, declined to provide information beyond that already released.
“Due to the ongoing case, we cannot comment. However, during the initial press conference, the U.S. Attorney did state it is an ongoing investigation and did not rule out the possibility of additional charges,” she said in an email.
Q : In “Old Town Road,” is that an ukulele?
A : Yes. The New York Times describes the first 25 seconds of this hugely popular hip-hop/country song as “a lonely howl delivered over a plucked ukulele.” The tune is simple to learn, according to free instructional videos online.

SPORTS MEDIA; Glanville finds Robinson's lessons still relevant today

Texto completo: Imagine what Jackie Robinson could have accomplished in his messaging with modern-day media platforms.
"It would have been amazing," Doug Glanville says. "He was a prolific letter writer to start with -- but he really was viral before there was viral, even with just the traditional media outlets covering him."
The 48-year-old former MLB outfielder in his latest role at ESPN considers himself to be a media multitasker, thanks to his "crash course in every way one can express ideas." He's also thankful to be back as part of the network's litany of Jackie Robinson Day remembrances on Monday -- including L.A. receiving the national coverage of the Dodgers-Reds contest at Dodger Stadium that will include Rachel Robinson and two of her children.

After a nine-year run as a heady outfielder with the Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies and Texas Rangers, Glanville put in seven seasons at ESPN on game and studio analysis work. But then he was blindsided by network layoffs in 2017.
He had a side gig writing about sports and social justice for the New York Times and had an acclaimed 2010 book published, "The Game From Where I Stand." From where he stood at that moment, Glanville needed introspection and reinvention.
"I was grateful ESPN gave me this powerful ability to learn so many platforms -- interviews to post-production to digital to radio," said Glanville, who worked an Angels-Cubs game from Wrigley Field for NBC Sports Chicago on Friday before flying home.
"I needed all that as I was going to go back to my roots, think of what's next, what were my passion points. An academic side came up and served a purpose."
Glanville left ESPN with class, then a class to teach at his alma mater Penn. A lecture course called "Communications, Sports and Social Justice" focused on how sports messages were crafted to effect change on society. ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza was among the guest speakers.
"To hear him teach the class, then be part of it, the things he asked me to bring up, how the students reacted ... that tells so much about Doug's political awareness and what sports means in this space today," said Mendoza. "He is so smart and so socially, culturally, racially and gender aware of everything happening in our country right now. I'm so happy he's back at ESPN."
A year later, Glanville spun that into a seminar for 20 students once a week at Yale called "Athletes, Activism, Public Policy and the Media," for the political science department.
"Jackie Robinson's effort was always to find a way into something new," said Glanville, "and I'm blown away in finding new ways to engage this next generation. They listen and debate and understand how sports is woven into so many disciplines in our lives -- economics, sociology, anthropology. And baseball is the most beautiful storytelling sport of all. Jackie Robinson showed how it can be a pivot point of harmony."
Somehow, it rotates back to Robinson.
A personal story Glanville uses as a test case with students is an incident he had at Los Angeles International Airport in September 2015. A taxi driver belligerently refused to give him a ride as he waited on the curb with a white colleague from ESPN. Glanville was yelled at to take the bus instead.
While he got into another cab, Glanville was encouraged by an LAX officer who witnessed it to report the incident because of its repetitive nature. Glanville not only did that but he engaged more decision-makers, which led to the L.A. City Council calling an emergency meeting to discuss it after his account appeared in The Atlantic. It led to an LAPD undercover sting operation and more confirmation.
Glanville believes he channeled Robinson in handling that situation.
"When I think of Jackie Robinson, I'm struck by his patience and focus, and I think I took a lot of pages out of that -- I took a deep breath, understood that society has made a lot of strides since Robinson's days but there is still a lot of work to do," said Glanville.
"There was a collective process -- not to get the driver fired, but an example of bringing people together into a common cause to improve upon this. It hit home for a lot of people. There is now zero-tolerance policies in place and quarterly checks to see if people are holding to standards."
Glanville's return to ESPN isn't coincidental.
"We welcome back Doug Glanville," said Norby Williamson, ESPN executive vice president and executive editor, studio production. "He will be a versatile asset to our team of baseball analysts for the 2019 season as we re-imagine our content."
This annual Robinson reboot provides a perfect example of Glanville's added value.
Glanville, who gave his son the middle name of Robinson, came from parents who wrote poetry and were educators in North Carolina, in a city that during the 1960s was voluntarily desegregated.
"That absolutely gave me the groundwork for my strong connection to the Jackie Robinson story," said Glanville. "Knowing my family was committed to things in the spirit of what he represented, and then loving baseball on top of it all, I am very fortunate.
"I'm always inspired by his story and learn more every day about what he fought for."
--
A Masters like no other
The back-to-back video replays of Tiger Woods hugging his father, Earl, after his first Masters win in 1997 and then hugging his son, Charlie, in the same spot on the Augusta National course after winning Sunday's Masters provided an emotional, masterful punctuation for CBS' coverage of the weekend.
CBS' ability as well to shift coverage to the early start at 6 a.m. Sunday -- and then replay the entire five-hour window starting at noon -- was a fortunate residue of a historic event. This was also CBS' first golf coverage after a two-month layoff to cover college basketball's conclusion, and its first since the PGA Tour's Genesis Open at Riviera in mid-February, but the network was back on its game.
Perhaps, until the finish.
Viewers might have smelled an azalea-scented blanket of CBS' analysts trying to out-gush each other, overworking the cliche meter. Those may have been honest reactions from Ian Baker Finch calling a "Cinderella story" or Peter Kostis dropping "the impossible has become possible" during Woods' final holes, but there could have been more self-policing to stick to reporting and let the video and graphics tell what was still far from a certainty. Verne Lundquist's retro call of Woods' near hole in one at the 16th hole with "Oh my goodness" could be excused.
But all the premature exasperation needed to recalibrate as Jim Nantz waited until Woods stood over a putt at the 18th green and "put it in context: This is going to be ... the completion of one of the great comebacks in any sport all time." And as Woods tapped in to win, Nantz finished: "This is the minute millions around the world have waited for ... many doubted we'd ever see it, but here it is ... the return to glory."
Now if there was only a way to get Tony Romo into the 18th tower ....

Texto completo: LAST WEEKEND Ernest F. Hollings passed away at the age of 97, a passing noted mostly only by political junkies, and aging political junkies at that.

But his life and times deserve wider notice because Fritz Hollings was all that most Americans want our politics and our politicians to be.

Mr. Hollings was, first, an American patriot and public servant. He was a World War II vet and saw action in North Africa and Europe. He was awarded the Bronze Star.

But he loved politics - loved it. He loved the battle. And he loved beating the odds. When he decided to retire after 38 years in the Senate, a reporter asked him if it was because Republicans had become dominant in South Carolina and the race would have been a tough one. "That's exactly right," he said, and the race was a tough one in 1992 and 1980, and 1968, and he went down the list of all the years he'd won.

When Sam Donaldson once asked Mr. Hollings, a bitter enemy of the NAFTA agreement and free trade, where his suit was made, Mr. Hollings' reply was, "I got it right down the street from where you got that wig."

He was blunt and he was outspoken and he was often funny and barbed. He never apologized for any of that. Politics was a contact sport. After that '92 race he said: "I don't have to get elected to a bloomin' thing. And I don't have to do things that are politically correct. The hell with everybody. I'm free at last."

But he did run one more time, and win one more time. He'd always been free.

Mr. Hollings hated government waste and was the last great deficit hawk in the Democratic Party - an author of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit control act of 1985, which imposed deficit reduction targets and automatic cuts if the targets were not met (it was diluted and deconstructed in subsequent years). There is no such Democrat today.

But he also believed in the positive role of government. There are some things government can do well, Mr. Hollings believed, and some things only government can do. His first great cause, and his abiding one, was the eradication of hunger in his home state and in rural America. He made a famous "hunger tour" and went to places he admitted he had not known existed, places where no politician had ever been. He wrote a book on the subject, and it moved the national debate. For here was a conservative Southerner, not an Eastern liberal, attempting to raise the nation's awareness of the hunger of the poor.

Mr. Hollings saw third-world conditions on that tour. He saw children with extended stomachs and families drinking unsafe and unclean water. The result was legislation that changed America by creating the food program for women, infants, and children - WIC.

Mr. Hollings was impatient and increasingly so as he aged. He had no time for politics by poll or press conference. He had no sympathy for anti-government politicians at the top of the political food chain. "Give me a break, man," he said after one colleague's rant on the perils of big government. Let's do what we do well, forget what government does poorly, and move on.

Mr. Hollings was the first in the Senate to champion the preservation of open waters and protection of the oceans. What entity but government could take on that mission?

We are here to get things done , was his constant refrain to his colleagues. He said that when he and his fellow soldiers came back from the war, "we wanted to do it all."And when he did finally leave the Senate, it was largely due to what he called "the outright money chase" - constantly taking time off from legislating to raise funds for re-election.

He said everyone was working on "the campaign and not the country."

He loved the Congress and his colleagues, but not what had happened to them.

Mr. Hollings' other great issue was "free" trade - he opposed it. He was unapologetically for protectionism if it meant protecting American jobs and workers, most especially South Carolina workers. Fritz Hollings practiced geographic politics. He was from somewhere. That, and not ideology, shaped him. He despised NAFTA because he was an independent thinker and had read the treaty. But also because he saw what it would do to his state's textile industry. He was the senator from South Carolina, not The Wall Street Journal or New York Times, he said.

Think about this. Where is Barack Obama actually from? Where are the Clintons or Mitt Romney from? Mr. Hollings went home when he retired. He raised money for a local hospital and wrote op-eds for his local paper.

Mr. Hollings had the courage to change. He was a segregationist who became an integrationist governor. He regretted voting for the Iraq war and became a harsh critic of it. As a young governor, he stuck his neck out for John F. Kennedy in 1960.

Mr. Hollings stuck his neck out whenever he thought he should. He relied on persuasion rather than polls and focus groups to get re-elected. His wife, Peatsy, was his focus group.

His governorship, from 1959 to 1963, was one profile in courage after another, as he accomplished peaceful school integration and fought "like a dirty dog" for a bill to establish state technical colleges. He was the first governor to hop on a plane and go straight to foreign companies cajoling them to come to his state. Thanks to Mr. Hollings' initiative and legacy, South Carolina is today a leading world manufacturer in automotive manufacturing and aerospace. He dragged the state into the 20th century and was 40 years ahead of his peers.

Mr. Hollings was an ardent Democrat, but a type of Democrat who probably could not survive today. His own mind, conscience, and most of all his constituents, came before party. His was a politics formed not by abstraction and virtue signaling but by character and human connections.

Fritz Hollings had incredible physical posture. He stood tall. And it fit him. Men of his rectitude and fearlessness are rare in politics, in any age. In our age their existence has come to seem almost impossible.

Bernie Sanders slams Clinton-linked think tank for 'bad faith smears' of 2020 Democrats

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is blaming a leading liberal think tank for stymieing Democrats’ efforts to unseat President Trump in 2020 and spreading “bad faith smears” about him and other Democratic presidential hopefuls who have moved the party further to the Left.

Sanders sent a letter Saturday to the Center for American Progress and CAP Action Fund, which was obtained by the New York Times, that accused the organization of playing a “destructive role” in the 2020 presidential campaign.

“I and other Democratic candidates are running campaigns based on principles and ideas and not engaged in mudslinging or personal attacks on each other,” Sanders wrote in his letter. “Meanwhile, the Center for American Progress is using its resources to smear Senator [Cory] Booker, Senator [Elizabeth] Warren, and myself, among others. This is hardly the way to build unity, or to win the general election.”

The Center for American Progress was founded in 2003 by John Podesta, who served as White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Sanders and Hillary Clinton engaged in a bitter primary during the 2016 presidential election, which exposed rifts in the Democratic Party.

Sanders, an early frontrunner among 2020 Democrats, specifically noted an article published in ThinkProgress, run by CAP Action Fund, that knocked his appearance and income he earned from his book. The website also published a video that Sanders said “dishonestly attacked me for hypocrisy in my effort to address income inequality in America.”

Sanders acknowledged last week he is now a millionaire, which is attributed to having written a best-selling book, and is expected to release a decade of tax returns Monday.

But Sanders said he is not the only Democrat in the 2020 field who has “experienced personal attacks” from the Center for American Progress. He went on to highlight criticisms of Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., who have both advocated progressive policies, from ThinkProgress.

“This counterproductive negative campaigning needs to stop,” Sanders wrote. “The Democratic primary must be a campaign of ideas, not of bad faith smears. Please help play a constructive role in the effort to defeat Donald Trump.”

Sanders accused Center for American Progress chief Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton confidante, of “maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas.”

“I worry that the corporate money CAP is receiving is inordinately and inappropriately influencing the role it is playing in the progressive movement,” he wrote.

Texto completo: Poignant stories of violence and loss, perseverance and hope are depicted in photographer James A. Bowey’s exhibit "When Home Won’t Let You Stay," on display until Sunday, May 26, at the Schaumburg Township Library, 130 S. Roselle Road, Schaumburg. The exhibit is on the library’s second floor.
As Bowey, a documentary artist, traveled throughout Minnesota in an exploration of America’s evolving attitudes toward refugees, he listened to refugees’ stories and photographed them in their everyday surroundings.
Each was forced to leave their country in order to survive. The experiences shared by the refugees featured in "When Home Won’t Let You Stay" produce a compelling human portrait of refugees in Minnesota.
"One of the most difficult things a person ever does is to truly see another," Bowey said in his artist statement. "But if we really look at someone and consider their story, we discover the shared humanity that links us all. That is the hope for this work: to find ourselves in each other, one photograph at a time."
Bowey uses his documentary and photography skills to explore issues of human rights and social connection. He has spent his career covering a wide range of global and national stories, from the war in Bosnia to Hurricane Katrina. His photography and writing has been featured in The New York Times, Time magazine, The Associated Press, and in numerous exhibitions.
For a full listing of upcoming programs, see the library’s Guide or visit www.SchaumburgLibrary.org.

West Haven Veterans Museum reopens with honor, fanfare

Texto completo: WEST HAVEN — The unveiling of a restored painting of legendary war dog Sgt. Stubby, who saved countless lives and could stand and salute with his right paw, was at the center of a ceremony to celebrate the grand reopening of the West Haven Veterans Museum and Learning Center, where vast displays honor veterans.
Although there was fanfare over Stubby and the portrait restoration that required moving peeling paint layers — in some cases those as small as a pinhead — the occasion that brought the community together was that the vast museum on Hood Terrace reopened after a long closure to build a media center.
The media center, on display Saturday, is named after late longtime community activist and businessman Edward N. Silver, and was paid for by a $60,000 gift from the West Haven Rotary Foundation.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who spoke at the reopening, called the museum “a treasure,” and the new addition, “special.”
“I always learn something when I come here,” Blumenthal told the audience of about 50, including Mayor Nancy Rossi, state Rep. Dorinda Borer, D-West Haven, City Council Chairman Ronald Quagliani.
Blumenthal said military working dogs such as Sgt. Stubby have saved many lives throughout history and as a dad of two sons in the military, he has seen firsthand how the military dogs of today can sniff out explosive devices.
The new media center — which includes a library, conference room, computer access and large flat screen television for educational and other presentations, will get its special day in June when a dedication is planned.
Also unveiled at the ceremony was a Word War I trench diorama by Joseph J. Buydos.
The painting of Sgt. Stubby, once described as the “pride and joy” of the museum, was restored by a student through Yale University’s Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage on the Yale West Campus.
The portrait was done by Charles Ayer Whipple in 1925.
The institute’s director, Mark Aronson, said he got a call from a museum representative: “I have a painting that needs help.” Normally when they get those calls, they refer people to restoration businesses, but then his assistant, who loves dogs, suggested using the opportunity as student practice.
Graduate student Emily Landry said it was a fabulous learning experience and thanked museum officials for the opportunity. Consolidating peeling paint layers was a big part of the job from June to November .
Stubby was immortalized last year in an animated feature film: “Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero.”
Sgt. Stubby got his start in New Haven and his enlistment wasn’t exactly through official channels.
Pvt. J. Robert Conroy, a young New Britain soldier was camped out and training with other members of the 102nd Infantry of the U.S. Army’s 26th Yankee Division near Yale Bowl in the spring of 1917 when a stray dog started hanging around the troops. Conroy named the dog Stubby because of his stub of a tail.
According to Ann Bausum’s book “Stubby the War Dog,” when the soldiers prepared to ship out to Europe that summer, Stubby followed them to the train depot and hopped on board. After the troops and their mascot arrived in Virginia, Conroy persuaded a crew member of the European-bound ship to wrap Stubby inside a blanket and walk up the gangplank with him.
Stubby was allowed to stay on board because he was so friendly.
Stubby had a trick that would come to charm everyone he met. He could sit on his haunches and salute with his right paw.
He would come to be known and greeted by three U.S. presidents.
Sgt. Stubby was said to save many lives through his acute hearing and ability to smell the mustard gas before the soldiers could.
“The soldiers wouldn’t go into the trench until Stubby sniffed it out. If Stubby ran out, no one went in. He’s credited with saving hundreds of lives,” Frank Chasney, president of the veterans’ all-volunteer museum has said.
Conroy, always careful to protect Stubby, had a gas mask made for him and according to Conroy’s accounts, Stubby saved the inhabitants of the French village of Chateau-Thierry from a gas attack. The grateful women of the town made an “Army” coat for him.
An April 1, 2001, cover story of Parade magazine, on display at the museum, reported: “Stubby was in 17 battles, saving U.S. lives, capturing Germans and comforting the wounded.”
According to Laura Macaluso’s book “New Haven in World War I,” Stubby was gassed during one of the battles and hospitalized. Even there he entertained and consoled the bedridden soldiers.
The museum has a thick file of Stubby memorabilia.
In the fall of 1920, Conroy and Stubby moved to Washington, D.C., where Conroy enrolled at Georgetown University Law School. Stubby became the mascot for the university’s football team.
On March 16, 1926, at the estimated age of 11 or 12, Stubby died in Conroy’s arms. Conroy never owned another dog.
The New York Times ran a lengthy obituary for Stubby, a copy of which is in the files of the West Haven museum.
Stubby’s remains have been preserved at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
Museum admission is free, but donations are gladly accepted, officials said.

What does the Choice Hotels TV commercial tagline mean?

Texto completo: Q: Please explain the tagline "Bocca-Book Bocca-Boom" (or however it is spelled) for Choice Hotels TV commercials. No one I know has a clue what it means or the origin.
A: According to the hotel chain, the phrase is "Badda Book. Badda Boom." The slogan draws on the expression "bada bing, bada boom," which as the Oxford English Dictionary notes, refers to something happening suddenly or easily. The OED has references to the original phrase going back more than 50 years; the most famous uses of the term are likely those in mob chronicles such as "The Sopranos" (where the topless club was called Bada Bing) and "The Godfather." A Choice Hotels press release said its slogan indicates "there's an easy way to plan and book hotel stays, and find the lowest hotel rates guaranteed ... (by) booking direct at ChoiceHotels.com."
Q: Do you know if "Southern Charm" is coming back on Bravo? Being from Savannah and Charleston I sure liked the "Southern Charm" shows set there. There was a little too much bickering sometimes, but no more than on all those "Real Housewives" shows.
A: Bravo will offer a sixth season of "Southern Charm" and the Charleston, S.C., cast beginning on May 15. According to the network, returning cast members will include Craig Conover, Kathryn Dennis, Cameran Eubanks, Austen Kroll, Chelsea Meissner and Shep Rose. Former star Thomas Ravenel, who is also Kathryn's ex, will not be in this season.
New to the cast are Naomie Olindo and Eliza Limehouse. Storylines include Kathryn hoping to rise in the social hierarchy, Cameran working on a work-life balance, Craig hiring a personal assistant, and Shep getting a new dog.
Q: I am writing about this great show "God Friended Me." I find it very refreshing and it covers many facets of humanity with a diverse cast, all while talking about doing good by helping others. I hope this program goes on for a long time. It is so uplifting.
A: The drama will have its first season finale on April 14, but don't worry. It has been renewed for a second season. "It's one of the top three new series on television, has improved its time period significantly, and continues a long tradition of prestige dramas for CBS on (Sunday) night," said Kelly Kahl, president, CBS Entertainment, in the renewal announcement.
Q: We were in Morocco from 1970 to 1973 when my husband was in the Navy. At that time, the king of Morocco was King Hassan. His wife was Latifa, which would make her Queen Latifa. I wonder if the American actress/singer chose her name, Queen Latifa, from the former Moroccan queen?
A: A New York Times profile of the multitalented Queen Latifah (with an h, unlike the common spelling of the Moroccan royal) says the former Dana Owens "named herself Latifah as a child, after learning it was Arabic for 'delicate, sensitive and kind.' "

Magazines have a long history of publishing fiction and poetry, but there are few precedents for presenting 15 original plays in a single issue, as we do in these pages. Accordingly, T???s editors and designers had to reimagine the publication???s structure and layouts virtually from scratch. For example, ???We didn???t know how many 10-minute plays we could fit in an issue,??? says T???s articles editor, Kurt Soller, who, along with the magazine???s staff editor, Kate Guadagnino, commissioned most of these works. Senior art director Dan Wagner then had to lay out irregular lines of dialogue in ways that maintained their integrity but were captivating to read ??? among his solutions: graphic typefaces and tinted pages ??? while photo and video director Nadia Vellam worked to embody the issue???s theme: America 2024. The resulting portfolios range from photographs by the documentarian Eugene Richards and collages by the artist Lorna Simpson to projects creative directed by Humberto Leon and Carol Lim of the fashion brand Kenzo and the designer Virgil Abloh.
The issue???s cover concept was another puzzle: How do you illustrate plays that have never been produced? The answer was to ask four of the playwrights to hypothetically cast their works and enlist the photographer Todd Hido to shoot the actors at the United Palace Theater in New York City for four different covers. The performers ran lines from the plays on camera ??? many of them for the first time ??? for a series of videos that will accompany the issue on tmagazine.com. (T is also hosting a night of live readings featuring Jackie Sibblies Drury, Adam Rapp and Celine Song at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on April 22; visit bam.org for more information.) ???We never see actors like that, in the very early stages of a work,??? says Soller. ???I think the punk nature of it is what makes it interesting.??? ???What was amazing,??? adds Guadagnino, ???was how unfazed they were about the background traffic noises in the room where we recorded them. Even for very important actors, theater can only be so glamorous.??? ??? Alice Newell-Hanson The United Palace, where this issue???s covers were shot, occupies an entire square block in Upper Manhattan???s Washington Heights. It was built in 1930 as Loew???s 175th Street Theater, the last of the five opulent so-called Wonder Theaters that the movie company constructed across the boroughs and New Jersey in the preceding decade, and it was designed by the architect Thomas W. Lamb, who also worked on the Rialto on Broadway and the still-standing Cort Theater on 48th Street.
The terra-cotta structure evokes both the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain, and the massive cut-rock Kailasa temple in Verul, India. The interiors feature baroque chandeliers, a vast staircase that leads to a gilded depiction of the aurora borealis and Louis XV and XVI furnishings. Some of the walls are filigreed; others are hand-carved in wood with Moorish patterns.
Loew???s sold the 3,400-seat theater in 1969 to an evangelical organization headed by the Rev. Frederick J. Eikerenkoetter II, who renamed it the Palace Cathedral. He died in 2009, but his association continues to operate the space ??? which remains remarkably intact ??? as a church, cultural center and concert venue. ??? Nancy Hass

How the Times Thinks About Your Data

Texto completo: Over the past few years, The New York Times has reported aggressively on the erosion of digital privacy, bringing information to light about the exploitation of personal data that Facebook amassed on its users, about companies buying and selling children's data, and about phone apps secretly tracking users' every movement. That reporting helped spur global debate about how society should protect privacy in digital spaces.
Yet all of this journalism was paid for, in part, by The Times's engaging in the type of collecting, using and sharing of reader data that we sometimes report on. As with a politician railing against high drug prices while accepting campaign donations from big pharma, a news organization cannot talk about privacy on the internet without skeptical readers immediately, and rightly, examining its own practices for signs of hypocrisy. So, as we kick off The Privacy Project, I wanted to share a bit about how The Times itself approaches reader data and privacy.
Like virtually every business on the internet, we collect, use and share data about readers. We make money by using that data to sell advertisements and subscriptions, often working with other companies like Google and Facebook, which allows us to sustain a 1,600-person news operation that reports from more than 150 countries every year. This data also helps us improve The Times's website and apps by providing readers interactive stories, developing new products and features, and recommending relevant articles. (Our privacy policy offers more detail about our data practices.)
It would be easy to argue that this approach to data has long been regarded as standard for any major website, or to note that we are more careful about protecting reader data than many others. Both are true. But we aspire to more than simply being better than average in a digital ecosystem that is in obvious need of reform.
Though we know we must participate in this messy and rapidly changing ecosystem -- one with plenty of bad actors -- we are also working to ensure that our own data practices live up to our values. The business leadership of The Times has taken steps over the past year to increase privacy protections. These efforts have focused on cutting back on data collection and sharing, strengthening security and increasing transparency. We significantly reduced the amount and type of data shared with social media companies. We put in place stronger controls to limit data shared with third parties through advertisements. And we will continue to test additional steps and collaborate with others to push for industrywide changes.
If you're reading this essay on an internet browser, it offers a useful example of what tracking looks like at a practical level. Before you had time to read a single word, a number of different companies had already placed a "cookie" or other tracking mechanism on your browser to study your internet use. The Times hosts these trackers for three purposes: to learn about how people use our website and apps so that we can improve their experience; to reach readers we hope will subscribe; and to sell targeted advertising.
Nearly every site on the internet employs these trackers. I asked a colleague on our data team to see how many trackers we could detect on articles on a range of major news websites about a single topic, the election of Chicago's new mayor. Because the number of trackers can vary significantly based on a host of factors -- including where you are, time of day, whether you're a subscriber and how far down you scroll into an article -- he used different browsers to examine each website at least five times using the anti-tracking tool Ghostery.
The averaged results show how ubiquitous this practice is: The Financial Times had 19 trackers, The New York Times had 24, The Wall Street Journal had 53, The Guardian had 54, The Washington Post had 58, Fox News had 63, BuzzFeed had 67, HuffPost had 77, CNN had 83, Vox had 95, and USA Today had 100.
The Times, like many of these organizations, maintains clear internal guidelines about how such data is collected and used. But this control is often more limited than it seems because in many cases, the news organizations that host the trackers don't know what happens with that information once it is transferred to third parties. Those companies include major platforms like Google and Facebook, smaller companies you've never heard of that act as analytics providers and advertising intermediaries, and the individual companies that place individual advertisements. Readers may understandably wonder: What data do these companies have? To whom might they sell it? How might those buyers exploit it?
I ask myself those questions, too, as a publisher and as a person who uses the internet. As a journalist, I deeply believe that society benefits from the type of free-flowing information that overly broad privacy regulations could unintentionally impede. Our reporting often relies on leaks from whistle-blowers, personal communications of government officials obtained through records requests and computer-driven analysis of huge sets of data. But I'm also a person who values his own privacy -- I have virtually no presence on social media -- and I share the anxiety and mixed feelings that many have about the systematic collection, warehousing and sharing of personal data.
It's clear that the rapid increase in data collection has resulted in many worthy contributions: creating a more interconnected world, saving users untold amounts of time and money, driving business and innovation and enabling important advances, from identifying public health threats to foiling terrorist attacks. But it's also increasingly clear those benefits come with costs and trade-offs that society has not really reckoned with. People have little transparency into what is being gathered, where it's being shared and how it's being used -- to follow their movements, to charge them more for health insurance or to manipulate them with political messages -- and even less agency to do anything about it.
Countless companies are wrestling with these trade-offs, many of them doing the best they can within a digital ecosystem they can't hope to unilaterally reform. The internet doesn't have to be this way. But change needs to be driven at a societal level -- by politicians, leaders of major technology companies and the public at large.
While we'd welcome such change, we're not waiting for it. The Times is committed to continuing to take steps to increase transparency and protections. And our journalists will do their part to ensure that the public and policymakers are fully informed by covering these issues aggressively, fairly and accurately. Over the coming months, The Privacy Project will feature reporters investigating how digital privacy is being compromised, Op-Ed editors bringing in outside voices to help foster debate and contextualize trade-offs, and Opinion writers calling for solutions. All of us at The Times will be reading closely as well, using their findings to help inform the continuing evolution of our own policies and practices.

Texto completo: ALBANY - An explosion of anger during a closed-door meeting of state Senate Democrats has some members of the conference questioning whether the incident was a one-off exchange or a sign of mounting tensions.
The row between Sens. Kevin Parker (D-Brooklyn) and Alessandra Biaggi (D-Bronx) was sparked by concerns over lawmakers and their staffers' social media use and a progressive push to primary mainline centrist Dems.
"There is some anxiety over the newer members and their staff putting out messages that don't reflect the feelings of the conference," one Democratic insider told the Daily News Friday. "It's inappropriate."
Biaggi and several other younger, more progressive members of the party have publicly expressed disillusionment and disappointment following the passage of the state budget and have vowed to transform the process.
The meeting earlier this week, which was first reported by The New York Times, was in part a chance to make sure all members were on the same page going forward with messaging during the remainder of the legislative sessions and a reminder that they're all on the same team, sources said.
But tempers flared as Parker admonished fellow members for stepping out of line and using social media to share their own agendas and not that of the conference.
Several sources, who did not want their identities used, said Parker hurled personal criticisms at Biaggi and that she in turn told Parker he should "thank" her for not probing his own past Twitter posts.
Parker tweeted "Kill yourself!" to Senate GOP communications staffer Candice Giove in December. A spokesman for Biaggi, the chairwoman of the Senate Ethics and Internal Governance Committee, said in February that no formal probe would be conducted. Parker told Gotham Gazette the matter was "handled internally."
Biaggi condemned Parker's behavior and appeared to contradict her own staff in a tweet Thursday.
"I don't do favors for anyone, especially not him," she wrote. "That comment was unacceptable, and *if* the matter comes before my committee, which it has yet to do, I will put it through to the full extent of my power."
Parker, in office since 2003, has a history of a hotheaded behavior and has engaged in similar spats in the past.
Sen. Julia Salazar (D-Brooklyn), meanwhile, took to Twitter to defend her fellow freshman.
"Sen. Biaggi didn't quash ANY investigation, and she also never said that she did. It's terrible and ironic to respond to this incident by questioning her integrity," she tweeted.
Some lawmakers said the squabble was more than just Parker losing his temper and fear the tensions are a sign of things to come.
"It's not going to get any better. In fact, I think it's going to get worse," an insider said, noting that several progressive groups with ties to Biaggi and Salazar have called for protests against Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx).
Others, pointing out how much Dems were able to accomplish early on in the session with control of both the Senate and the Assembly for the first time in nearly a decade, brushed off the brouhaha as post-budget stress rising to the surface after three long weeks of late nights and endless negotiation.
"I've seen worse," one lawmaker said. "Not everyone gets along. That's just the way it is."

EX-SPY CHIEF ARRESTED ON U.S. WARRANT

Texto completo: MADRID - A former Venezuelan spy chief has been arrested by Spanish authorities who acted on an extradition request from the United States, where he is wanted for drug trafficking.
Hugo Carvajal, who had also served as a lawmaker in President Nicolás Maduro's ruling party, was taken in by Spanish police in Madrid on Friday afternoon, the Spanish police said. He is expected to appear Saturday before a Spanish judge, who will review the extradition request.
Mr. Carvajal left Venezuela after making a dramatic break from Mr. Maduro's government and telling The New York Times in February that he had witnessed multiple members of Venezuela's government being involved in drug trafficking.
Mr. Carvajal is wanted for similar crimes himself, having been accused of taking money from a Colombian drug trafficker in an indictment that was unsealed in 2014. In 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Mr. Carvajal, who was then head of the country's military intelligence agency, for "protecting drug shipments from seizure by Venezuelan authorities" as well as providing weapons to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, then the country's main rebel organization.
Sudan's leader ousted
CAIRO - The Sudanese military on Friday swiftly replaced the country's transitional leader linked to the Darfur genocide after street rallies against him and said that it wouldn't hand over ousted President Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity.
Thousands of jubilant protesters celebrated in the streets after Defense Minister Gen. Awad ibn Ouf, who was named de facto leader after overthrowing Mr. al-Bashir on Thursday, announced he was stepping down as transitional leader. He named a reputable army general as his successor.
Gen. Ibn Ouf said he would be replaced by Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, general inspector of the armed forces, as head of the transitional council, which will rule the country for two years until elections.
"I am confident he will steer the ship to safe shores," he said of Gen. Burhan, adding he was stepping aside to "preserve unity" of the armed forces.
EU weighs tariffs
The European Union is considering hitting 10.2 billion euros ($11.5 billion) of U.S. goods ranging from handbags to helicopters with retaliatory tariffs in a dispute over subsidies to Boeing, according to a draft list seen by Bloomberg News.
The plan follows a U.S. threat to target $11 billion of European goods ranging from helicopters to cheeses with import duties to counter state aid to Airbus. Both moves stem from parallel, 14-year-old, disputes at the World Trade Organization over market-distorting support for aircraft makers.
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, outlined its retaliation plan to trade experts from the bloc's national governments on Friday in Brussels, an official said on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were behind closed doors.
The WTO will ultimately determine the amounts of imports that both sides would be allowed to target in the two cases. On Tuesday, the commission dubbed the U.S. aim of hitting $11 billion of imports from the EU "greatly exaggerated."

Texto completo: The Vienna State Opera's ballet academy vowed to reform its practices after former students and staff said dancers as young as 11 were kicked, scratched and handled roughly in classes.
Others said they were regularly pressured to lose weight. Another said they had been sexually abused.
"Many children have lost their dream to dance," said Luisa Solowjowa, 20, a former student, in a telephone interview. She said a teacher once kicked her "like a football."
The academy acknowledged that students had been subject to physical and emotional abuse after allegations were reported on Tuesday by Falter, an Austrian newsmagazine.
Investigations by the magazine "uncovered very unpleasant incidents, which are completely intolerable and which we regret greatly: Some individuals have behaved very badly," the academy said in a statement. "The students who were subject to physical or emotional abuse have our deepest sympathy," it added.
Students said that Bella Ratchinskaia, a teacher at the school, at times went beyond the limits of normal practice during ballet classes, roughly forcing their limbs into position or scratching them as she adjusted their bodies, sometimes drawing blood. André Comploi, a spokesman for the State Opera, said that Ms. Ratchinskaia, who previously worked at La Scala in Milan, was dismissed in February.
Ms. Ratchinskaia did not reply to a request for comment but said in a statement provided by the academy: "Contact is a part of the training in this profession -- it is necessary to touch to make corrections in ballet classes, and this is done all over the world. To the students who I have hurt, I apologize sincerely. I never injured anyone deliberately, and it was never done maliciously."
Another teacher who was accused of sexual assault was suspended on Monday pending an investigation by Austrian prosecutors. According to Sharon Booth, a former teacher who said she had spoken with the student involved, the teacher is accused of trying to get the student, a boy who was 16 at the time, to masturbate him. Mr. Comploi said that the teacher denies the allegation.
In a statement on Tuesday, the State Opera announced several measures to improve conditions at the ballet academy, including the appointment of a psychologist and an independent ombudsman whom students could complain to if they were mistreated. From September, the school's teachers and students will receive compulsory training in nutrition, the statement said.
"There have been a few initiatives before, in terms of nutrition and body image and so on," Mr. Comploi said in a telephone interview. "But obviously not enough."
Vienna's Children's and Youth Protection Unit said in a statement on Wednesday it had been working with the ballet academy since December and that the school needed "a fundamental reworking of pedagogical attitudes and practices." Austria's culture minister ordered a commission to create rules for dance teachers.
The scandal is the latest to hit the ballet world following sexual harassment allegations at both the New York City Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet. Modern dance has not escaped these problems. Last year, there were allegations of mistreatment and sexual harassment at Troubleyn, a dance company in Belgium led by the choreographer Jan Fabre.
But this is the first major case involving children, and the allegations against the academy, although specific, raise larger issues about how dancers are trained from an early age to obey teachers, directors and choreographers, and so find it difficult to speak out about inappropriate treatment.
The scandal also raises issues around the desire for dancers to look slim, and whether that means some dancers, even when children, are pressured into unhealthy practices.
"Schools try to change the bodies of students, instead of changing their teaching," said Martin Puttke, former head of the State Ballet School in Berlin, in a telephone interview. The aggressive teaching methods used by some teachers at the Vienna ballet school were not typical, he said.
The Vienna State Opera stressed the accused teachers were a minority. "The majority of people working for the academy are doing excellent jobs," it said in its statement. "It would be unfair to them if everyone and everything were thrown in the same pot."
The alleged victims of abuse at the academy were identified in Falter by pseudonyms, but The New York Times spoke to two former students who said they had been mistreated by Ms. Ratchinskaia and had faced continual comments about their weight from other teachers.
"I left the school two years ago, two weeks before my final exams," said Ms. Solowjowa, who started classes at the academy at age 6. "I just couldn't handle it anymore."
When she was 14, Ms. Solowjowa said, Ms. Ratchinskaia kicked her ankle so hard she fell over and suffered ligament damage that required two months' rest. She said she had seen Ms. Ratchinskaia pull students' hair to adjust their head positions and press down on their limbs so hard it bruised.
Ms. Ratchinskaia was "crazy about ballet, and still is, and wanted the best from us," Ms. Solowjowa said, but added that such methods were "not right, especially with children."
Nina Veech, 19, another former student, said in a telephone interview that she had also witnessed rough treatment, but that the "biggest issue" for her was that some teachers verbally attacked students, especially about their weight. "They'd say things like, 'You're too fat, you should just drink water and eat pineapple for the weekend,' " Ms. Veech said.
"It was like a psychodrama," Ms. Veech added of one teacher's obsession with students' weight. "We did a performance and she said, 'You have to lose 4 kilos. The stage makes you look fatter.' " Ms. Veech said she developed "bulimic tendencies" during her time at the school.
The students in her class were once invited to an eating disorder workshop with a nutritionist, Ms. Veech added, but that was on a weekend and not compulsory.
Both Ms. Solowjowa and Ms. Veech said they had complained on multiple occasions about Ms. Ratchinskaia and other teachers to Simona Noja-Nebyla, the school's managing director, but that she had not taken their complaints seriously enough. Ms. Veech said Ms. Ratchinskaia had been present at a meeting to discuss the complaint, and she had felt that she could not speak freely.
In a statement, Ms. Noja-Nebyla said she had reacted promptly when concerns about Ms. Ratchinskaia were raised. She said that Ms. Ratchinskaia received a written warning in 2016, although she did not explain why.
Ms. Booth, the former teacher, said in a telephone interview that she had once seen Ms. Ratchinskaia kick the feet of an 11-year-old student into position while wearing hard-toed shoes. Students, teachers and parents complained to the school about treatment like this, but little was done, she added. Ms. Ratchinskaia was moved from teaching younger students to the graduating class, but that seemed like a promotion, Ms. Booth said.
Ms. Veech said she hoped that dance schools everywhere would change, not just the Vienna academy. "I was just reading this interview where a dancer said, 'My suffering today will be my success tomorrow,' " she said. "And I thought, 'O.K., but what happens to all the students who don't ever stop suffering? Who have no tomorrow?' "

Law prohibiting free online IRS tax filing system is wrong

Texto completo: Congress has landed on one of those rare ideas that commands support from both Democrats and Republicans.
Unfortunately, it's a bad one.
On Tuesday, the House approved legislation misleadingly titled the Taxpayer First Act that includes a provision prohibiting the Internal Revenue Service from developing a free online system that most American households could use to file their taxes. The Senate is considering a similar piece of bipartisan legislation.
This makes no sense. Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes. Instead of barring the I.R.S. from making April a little less miserable, why isn't Congress requiring the I.R.S. to create a free tax filing website?
Better yet, the United States could emulate the roughly three dozen countries, including Chile, Japan and Britain, where most taxpayers do not need to fill out tax returns.
In some of those countries, the accuracy of tax withholding is sufficient to obviate the annual filing process. In others, the government sends out completed forms to most taxpayers. In Estonia, filing taxes can be done in less than three minutes.
The federal government collects enough information about most American households to mail out a completed tax form that people would simply need to verify, sign and return. President Ronald Reagan proposed a version of just such a system.
In 1998, Congress passed a law instructing the I.R.S. to develop such a system by 2008. President Barack Obama endorsed the concept during the 2008 presidential campaign. It still hasn't happened.
The explanation is sad but not surprising.
The most vocal opponent of simplicity is Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, which has spent millions of dollars lobbying against efforts to reduce demand for its services. The company draws support from conservatives worried that making it easier to file taxes would make it easier to raise taxes.
Intuit and its allies, including proponents of the legislation, say that it's cheaper and better for the government to let private companies run the system. But companies have little incentive to advertise the availability of free filing or to make the system easy to use.
Indeed, they have every reason to steer people away from the free products. That is how they make money.
As a result, the government is saving taxpayer money at the expense of those taxpayers.
Members of Congress pay lip service to ideas like filing taxes on a postcard, but they continue to perpetuate the current system of mass April immiseration by preventing the most obvious and effective way to simplify tax collection.

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
THE ANARCHIC CINEMA OF VERA CHYTILOVA at BAM Rose Cinemas (through April 18). In the United States, the Czech-born filmmaker Chytilova (1929-2014) remains best known for her second feature, "Daisies" (on Friday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday), a touchstone of filmmaking in the run-up to the Prague Spring (it was initially banned in Czechoslovakia) and a milestone of feminist cinema, starring Jitka Cerhova and Ivana Karbanova as mischief makers whose antics upend conventions of film and narrative form. But BAM's retrospective paints a fuller picture of the auteur; almost all the other titles in the series are rarely shown stateside. The 1980s horror film "Wolf's Hole" (on Saturday), for instance, about teenagers on a ski trip, is said to offer an opportunity to see Chytilova fuse political allegory with more conventional genre tropes.

'EL DESENCANTO' at Film Forum (April 13, 5:10 p.m.). An account of the Paneros, a Spanish literary family whose patriarch became a leading figure of letters during Franco's rule, this documentary from the mid-1970s was intended as the Iberian Peninsula's answer to "Grey Gardens," according to Film Forum. Unreleased in the United States, it inspired a new book on the Paneros by Aaron Shulman, who will introduce the screening. "In addition to producing thousands of pages of poetry and prose, the Paneros have inspired academic studies, fan fiction, film treatments and Twitter hashtags, but they are virtually unknown in the English-speaking world," Amanda Vaill wrote in her review of the book for The New York Times.
212-727-8110, filmforum.org
INFRADESTRUCTION! (A.K.A. WHEN INFRASTRUCTURE ATTACKS) at Anthology Film Archives (April 13-21). The natural follow-up to last month's Infrastructure on Film series -- which gawked at the ingenuity of highway systems and railways -- is this collection of movies about engineering gone awry. The problems might extend to the choice of director in "Maximum Overdrive" (on Saturday, Wednesday and April 19), which has a reputation as a notoriously silly filmmaking debut from Stephen King that pits sentient machinery against the populace. "Final Destination 2" (on Saturday, Tuesday and April 19) opens with its ill-fated cast members cheating death by avoiding a vehicular pileup, while the culprit in "Volcano" (on Tuesday and April 21) is not so much infrastructure as the bubbling lava beneath it. And if you've only seen "Titanic," check out the riveting "A Night to Remember" (on Sunday, Wednesday and April 20), a more matter-of-fact, procedural account of the ship's sinking.

LINCOLN KIRSTEIN AND FILM CULTURE at the Museum of Modern Art (through April 24). While MoMA celebrates the influence of Kirstein, a founder of New York City Ballet, on the worlds of art and dance with an exhibition, this parallel program commemorates his role as a pioneering cinephile. This retrospective recreates some of the original programs from a film society Kirstein helped start in the early 1930s, such as a double bill of the Soviet animation "Mail" and Luis Buñuel's Surrealist outrage "L'Age d'Or" (on Tuesday). It also showcases film work Kirstein championed, from the acting of James Cagney, who can be seen in "The Public Enemy" (on Friday and April 21) and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (on April 22), to rushes that Sergei Eisenstein filmed in Mexico (on Saturday) for a never-completed project on the country's history.

Texto completo: The bright-voiced American soprano Lisette Oropesa -- who is known for singing bel canto onstage and running marathons offstage -- has been awarded the prestigious Richard Tucker Award, the prize's administrators announced on Monday.
The award, which comes with $50,000 and the opportunity to headline a starry celebratory gala at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 27, is among the most sought-after prizes for young American opera singers. Many of its past recipients have gone on to stardom.
Ms. Oropesa, 35, is one of the few opera singers who have been featured in both Opera News and Runner's World, which reported on her 2015 feat of running the Pittsburgh Marathon the morning after starring in a production of Donizetti's "La Fille du Régiment." The article noted that "her standing-ovation-to-marathon-time was just over 13 hours."
She has had recent successes in both famous bel canto roles and Meyerbeer rarities. When she sang the role of Marguerite de Valois in Meyerbeer's "Les Huguenots" at the Opéra National de Paris last fall, Zachary Woolfe wrote in The New York Times that Ms. Oropesa "sounded lucid and silky, radiating good intentions."
Listen for yourself:

Born in New Orleans to parents from Cuba, Ms. Oropesa played the flute as a child and studied vocal performance at Louisiana State University. She trained in the Metropolitan Opera's young artists program and sang her first big role there, Susanna in Mozart's "Le Nozze di Figaro," when she was just 22. She has appeared at the Met more than 100 times and will return next season to star in Massenet's "Manon" and Verdi's "La Traviata."
Previous winners of the Tucker Award include Renée Fleming, Lawrence Brownlee, Christine Goerke, Joyce DiDonato, Michael Fabiano and Jamie Barton.

Texto completo: Former FBI General Counsel James Baker divulged details about behind-the-scenes discussions among top leaders at the Justice Department and FBI, including chatter about appointing a special counsel before former FBI Director James Comey was fired by President Trump in May 2017.

Baker additionally testified FBI officials were entertaining the idea that Trump had fired Comey at the behest of Russia.

The new insight was revealed in the second Baker transcript released by Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., on Wednesday, following the release of the first transcript on Tuesday -- the latest in a series of such disclosures by the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee. The transcript is from a closed-door interview that Baker gave on Oct. 18, 2018 in front of a joint session of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees. It was Baker’s second day in front of those committees — his first was on October 3, 2018.

Baker served as the FBI's top lawyer from 2014 to 2018, and he held that key role in the midst of two high-profile investigations — the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email practices and mishandling of classified information as well as the investigation into any alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told Baker, “we now have evidence that would suggest that a special prosecutor was being discussed prior to the firing of Director Comey” and said information came from “[DOJ official] Bruce Ohr's notes where he was having conversations about a special prosecutor in March of 2017.”

Meadows asked Baker: “Did you have conversations prior to the firing of James Comey about a special prosecutor?”

Baker said. “to the best of my recollection, that topic came up, but I don't remember a specific conversation sitting here today about it, but I remember it coming up.” He said he couldn’t remember why it was mentioned as a possibility.

“What would be the conflict of you all continuing your investigation?” Meadows asked.

Baker said, “I think it was as the Russia investigation was moving forward and the interactions that the President was having with the Director, Director Comey, and it was sort of on the margins of some type of conversation.”

“I don't even remember who said it, quite honestly, but I'm telling you that the topic did come up before the firing,” Baker said.

Under questioning from Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Baker revealed he was unable to recall specifically who he had conversations about the appointment of a special counsel with prior to Comey’s firing. “I think it was a passing conversation that could have been with the Director [Comey], with the Deputy Director [McCabe], and some of the other senior leaders," he said.

When pressed by Jordan on why Baker was discussing obstruction of justice and a special counsel prior to Comey’s firing, Baker’s attorney intervened, saying, “We’ll have to instruct the witness not to respond to a question that specific that pertains to special counsel ongoing investigative efforts.”

Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017, and one of the memos leaked by Comey to a friend was described in the New York Times on May 16, 2017. Comey claims his memos are contemporaneous notes on his interactions with Trump, and the contents are hotly disputed. Comey later told Congress that he leaked the memo to prompt a special counsel investigation. The day after the New York Times report, Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016.

Newly unsealed court records from 2017 reveal that Mueller considered Comey to be a “witness” in his investigation and considered the Comey memos to be “evidence.”

Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, asked Baker whether “there was a discussion … about whether or not President Trump had been ordered to fire Jim Comey by the Russian government.”

Baker replied, “I wouldn't say ordered. I guess I would say the words I sort of used earlier, acting at the behest of and somehow following directions, somehow executing their will. So literally an order or not, I don't know.”

Baker said they considered “the other extreme … that the President is completely innocent” too.

Mueller finished his investigation more two weeks ago and, according to a summary by Attorney General William Barr, did not find any criminal collusion between Trump or any Trump associates and the Russians.

In the days immediately following Comey’s firing, Baker said he spoke with former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the executive assistant director of the FBI’s National Security Branch Carl Ghattas, “probably” former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, and former assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division Bill Priestap.

During a meeting in this timeframe, Baker said Page and McCabe told him they took Rosenstein’s suggestion that he “wear a wire” to record conversations with President Trump seriously.

“My recollection is that the reason for the taping was to obtain evidence with respect to the President's state of mind with respect to why he fired Director Comey,” Baker said.

Baker’s attorney did not let him answer whether this was “all about the obstruction of justice issue.”

Barr has stated that Mueller did not reach a conclusion on obstruction of justice one way or the other, and wrote in his summary that he and Rosenstein determined there was insufficient evidence to determine that such a crime has taken place.

Baker recalled McCabe said he was “stunned” and “surprised” that Rosenstein would offer to wear a wire, but that he didn’t think Rosenstein was joking. Baker said he took the suggestion seriously too, though he believed it was a “crazy idea.”

Rosenstein has denied that this was a serious suggestion.

Baker also referred to the "25th Amendment conversation” at the meeting on whether to invoke the amendment to remove Trump from office. He recalled Page and McCabe informed him that Rosenstein said “there were two members of the Cabinet who were willing to go down this road already." He did not know who the two Cabinet members were.

Baker testified that “everyone” was upset about the firing of Comey. He also said Rosenstein in particular, who authored a memo used by Trump to justify Comey’s firing, “believed that either he made a mistake or was fooled or drawn into it in some way that he didn't anticipate how it was going to turn out, and that he had extreme regrets about what had happened.”

Rosenstein would be the one to appoint Mueller just days later.

In the new transcripts, Baker also testified that if Nellie Ohr — a Fusion GPS contractor and the wife of DOJ official Bruce Ohr — was involved with creating evidence that was used in FISA applications to target Trump associates, “then it seems as though the institution of the Department of Justice should provide that to the FISA Court.”

The Baker transcripts also revealed that the former top FBI lawyer initially believed that Clinton should’ve been prosecuted, but that he was eventually “persuaded” otherwise.

The transcripts released Tuesday showed that Baker believed Clinton’s behavior was “alarming” and “appalling”, that he found the texts between former FBI special agent Peter Strzok and Page “quite alarming" and thought the Trump-Russia investigation was “highly unusual.”

Tuesday’s revelations also included Baker testifying that he’d received Trump-Russia related information from Perkins Coie lawyer Michael Sussman and a portion of Christopher Steele’s anti-Trump dossier from Mother Jones journalist and “long-time friend” David Corn — all of which Baker had then passed along to the FBI.

Baker also stated that he had reviewed at least a portion of the FISA application to surveil former Trump campaign associate Carter Page.

In recent weeks, Collins has released transcripts from the congressional interviews of Strzok, Page, Bruce Ohr, his wife Nellie Ohr, former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos, and former assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division Bill Priestap.

Texto completo: The political revolution is turning Bernie Sanders into a one-percenter.
The big-money-bashing Vermont senator revealed he's a millionaire on Tuesday, crediting his book deals for the cash flow.
"I wrote a best-selling book," Sanders, 77, told The New York Times. "If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too." Sanders has published three books in as many years, all bestsellers.
He didn't specify his net worth, and reps did not return requests for comment.
Sanders' millionaire status puts him among the U.S.'s wealthiest 1%, per an Economic Policy Institute study.
The Democratic candidate for president has spent his entire career criticizing economic policies that allow for the millionaires and billionaires in the 1% category to grow perpetually richer while the country's wealth gap widens.

Details surface in Mar-a-Lago arrest

Texto completo: The Chinese woman who was arrested after gaining entry to President Trump's private club while carrying four cellphones and other electronic equipment had even more electronics in her hotel room, including a device used to detect hidden cameras, a federal prosecutor said Monday.
The woman, Yujing Zhang, who was born in 1986, was arrested March 30 after telling Secret Service agents that she had come to use the pool at Mar-a-Lago and showing two Chinese passports. After authorities determined that the event she said she had come to attend did not exist, she was arrested and charged with lying to a federal officer and accessing a restricted area.
Zhang had entered the property with four cellphones, a hard drive, and a thumb drive infected with malware, according to federal court records. Upon searching her hotel room, investigators found another cellphone and a radio frequency device that detects hidden cameras, Assistant US Attorney Rolando Garcia said during a bond hearing at the US District Court in West Palm Beach on Monday.
She also had nine USB drives and five SIM cards in her room at the Colony Hotel, along with several debit cards and about $8,000 in cash, including about $700 in Chinese currency, Garcia said.
Garcia told US Magistrate Judge William Matthewman that Zhang is a “serious flight risk" because she “lies to everyone that she encounters."
She had initially told authorities at the club that she carried multiple phones to the resort because she was afraid to leave them in her hotel room, Garcia said. She had previously told the court in an appearance last week that she had only about $5,000 in the bank.
Zhang came to the United States on March 28 from Shanghai on a B-1 visa that has been revoked, meaning that if the court does release her from jail pending trial, she would be transferred to immigration custody, Garcia said.
Zhang's assistant federal public defender, Robert Adler, said in the court hearing that Zhang did not attempt to hide the four cellphones when she entered the club. He stressed to the judge that she is not charged with espionage.
The Secret Service agent who questioned Zhang after her arrest, Samuel Ivanovich, said during testimony that she did not carry any lock-picking or eavesdropping gear. His 4½-hour interrogation of Zhang was recorded by video, Ivanovich said, but it lacked sound because he didn't realize that the agency's office in Palm Beach didn't have that capability.
The judge postponed a decision on whether to release her on bond until next week, to give the defense time to bring people from China who could support Zhang's story.
New York Times
Top Judiciary Republican urges Mueller testimony
The top-ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee is urging that Special Counsel Robert Mueller be called to testify before the panel this month.
Representative Douglas Collins, Republican of Georgia, in a letter Monday to House Judiciary chairman Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, said that he would like to see Mueller testify during the week of April 22, calling it "undoubtedly the best way" for the American people to learn about "the full contours" of the investigation into Russian election interference in 2016.
Last week, the Democrat-led committee voted to authorize Nadler to subpoena the full report and underlying documents produced by Mueller during his investigation into whether the Trump campaign and Russia coordinated during the presidential election and whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe.
According to a four-page summary of top-line findings of Mueller's report provided to Congress by Attorney General William Barr, Trump and his campaign did not illegally coordinate with Russia, but Mueller left open the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. Barr said he concluded that Trump did not commit obstruction.
Nadler went on Twitter later Monday to say he agrees that Mueller should appear before the committee but that the committee needs to see the full report and hear from Barr first in order "to ask Special Counsel Mueller the right questions."
"We look forward to hearing from Mr. Mueller at the appropriate time," Nadler said.
Nadler is seeking to bring Barr before the committee to explain his conclusions but has not ruled out calling Mueller later. Democrats are increasingly questioning whether Barr, a Trump appointee, was a neutral arbiter on what transpired.

Maine woman charged with sending letter to Collins
A Maine woman appeared in court on Monday to face federal charges of mailing a threatening letter to the home of US Senator Susan Collins last year.
An affidavit filed in US District Court in Bangor said Suzanne Muscara, 37, of Burlington, mailed starch to the Republican senator's Bangor home along with a note reading: "AnthRAX!!! HA HA HA!!!" The letter also included a threatening drawing of a stick figure with the letter X for eyes and an arrow pointing at its face.
The mail was intercepted at a postal mail sorting facility in Hampden, Maine, triggering an investigation. Muscara was arrested Friday.
According to court documents, Muscara told federal authorities she thought law enforcement would catch the letter before it reached Collins's home and that it wouldn't be taken seriously, WABI-TV reported. It was not clear whether Muscara had a lawyer who could comment on her behalf.
The mailing came after Collins cast a key vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and shortly after she received another threatening letter at home that was addressed to her husband.
Muscara is expected to return to court next week. She faces up to 10 years in prison.

Trump resists Democrats' push for report, tax returns
President Trump went on Twitter Monday morning to cite recent comments from conservative lawmakers and pundits as he continued to air grievances about efforts of congressional Democrats to obtain the full special counsel report and his tax returns.
In a series of tweets, Trump — who until recently had said he had no problem with the release of the full report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election — cited the views of commentators questioning whether Democrats should have access to it and claiming that they were trying to weaken Trump politically.
In one tweet, Trump quoted Katie Pavlich, editor of Townhall.com, saying that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., was "not entitled" to the full report and underlying documents produced by Mueller, who investigated whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in 2016 and whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe.
In another tweet Monday, Trump quoted Charles Hurt, the opinion editor of the Washington Times, saying Democrats "made up this complete lie about Collusion."
"The Russian Hoax never happened, it was a fraud on the American people!" Trump added in his own words.
The president also pushed back against efforts by the Democratic-led Ways and Means Committee to obtain six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service.
In one instance, Trump retweeted Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a frequent ally and the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, saying that "Dems want President's tax returns for purely political purposes!"
Trump also tweeted a C-SPAN clip in which Jordan defended Trump's pledge to fight releasing his tax returns during an interview.
Trump's tweets Monday came a day after his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said that Democrats will "never" see the president's tax returns, abandoning Trump's long-held position that he would someday release the documents for public inspection.

There's a warning in the data for far-left Democrats

Texto completo: Progressives dream of a Democratic future. Yet as the 2020 primary heats up, the presidential frontrunners refuse to read the cold, hard numbers for what they say.

At the New York Times, Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy did a deep dive into the divide between Democrats active on social media and those who are not. Less vocal Democrats, outnumbered 2-to-1 on social media, are overhelmingly more concerned about the overreach of political correctness in the country, identify as moderate or conservative, and are less white and more black. Just one-quarter of Democrats overall consider themselves ideologically consistent progressives, and as Cohn and Quealy note, less engaged voters have "an appreciation for well-known, battle-tested politicians who have been on their side or even delivered in the past."

While commentators have tried to divvy up multiple lanes Democrats can choose to win the primary, there's an inherent polarity in the prospect: running to take back Obama-to-Trump country or running to maximize turnout by veering even further left. Democrats have demonstrated that they're keen to dump the Obama legacy, finally throwing former Vice President Joe Biden under the bus for being overly touchy with women in public life. It's concern-trolling at best and a vicious weaponization of the #MeToo movement for political gain at worst, but again, while the far left may hope they stumbled onto a silver bullet, the data suggests otherwise.

Biden is battle-tested, bulwarked somewhat against these absurd #MeToo claims with his record on the Violence Against Women Act in the Senate and tackling campus sexual assault in the White House. He is also appealing to the Rust Belt in a primary dominated by disdain for even the most tepid of Trump voters. He also may just be Teflon.

The media may have worked overtime to fuel the Biden brouhaha, but his poll numbers haven't taken a hit. While Morning Consult found that his "very favorable" rating fell by 6%, he still tops the field. With a whopping 75% overall favorability, Biden remains the most popular candidate in the race by far.

Time and time again, we've seen Democrats deny the reality of polling.

Six in 10 Americans support the legality of abortion during first trimester, but the polling clearly indicates that they support it as a last resort — as Democrats used to swear, "safe, legal, and rare." The overwhelming majority of the country is either satisfied with the nation's abortion laws or wants them stricter. Only 45% of Americans support women getting abortions for solely personal reasons, even in the first trimester of pregnancy. Yet Democrats have embraced legalizing abortion up until the very point of birth and refuse to vote on laws protecting fully viable babies born alive during an abortion.

Think that's a winning issue outside of Bushwick? Just 13% of Americans — and even just 18% of Democrats — support legalizing third trimester abortion.

Everyone likes the idea of free stuff, but just 37% of Americans support a government-financed healthcare plan that eliminates private health insurance and jacks up their taxes. Too bad for Democrats, the same Medicare For All plan that Bernie's gotten his competitors to endorse with him does both.

The greatest case against President Trump isn't one of policy but of norms. His judicial appointees and actual enacted policies haven't defied mainstream conservatism, and they certainly haven't lived up to left-wing hopes of cataclysm. But he's defended the world's worst dictators on public, calling Kim Jong Un his "friend" and openly allowed Vladimir Putin to equivocate on Russia's attempt to corrode the integrity of our elections. He's referred to literal neo-Nazis as "very fine people" and uses the presidency as a bully pulpit.

Running a known entity like Biden presents an easy case for the disaffected center: The past decade wasn't so awful under Obama, and we need a solid, sane guy to bring back normalcy to the Oval Office.

Instead Democrats want to lurch even further leftward, practically gifting Trump the ability to say that he is the stable candidate. With another four years of Trump, you get more bad tweets, chaotic headlines, and relative domestic tranquility in your daily life. Elect President Kamala Harris, and we're looking at court packing, federal jobs guarantees, and babies' skulls crushed after botched abortions in the ninth month of pregnancy.

Democrats have a decision to make. The data should render it easy, but if the past few months have served as any indication, they'll find a way to ignore it.

Texto completo: ALBANY — Some New York Democrats think they have a new way to get at President Donald Trump's tax returns.
A bill introduced Monday by a Democratic senator would allow the state tax department to release a president's state tax returns if any of three congressional committees asks for them.
Sen. Brad Holyman, D-Manhattan, said the measure would be a way to assist the Democratic-controlled House in its efforts to review the president's state returns, which would have a bevy of information since Trump and his businesses are based in New York.
"Americans deserve to know whether the person who sits in the highest office of the land has conflicts or potential conflicts of interest," Holyman said Monday.
The bill is latest attempt by Democrats in the state Legislature to try to find a way to compel the president to release his state taxes.
The proposal would allow three congressional committees — the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation — to request from the state Department of Taxation and Finance the president's federal tax returns.
The New York bill comes after House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., last week asked the IRS to release six years of Trump's tax returns by April 10. But the Trump administration has resisted.
White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday called the efforts by Democrats a "political stunt."
He said the issue of Trump's tax returns "was already litigated during the election."
"Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn't, and they elected him anyway, which is, of course, what drives the Democrats crazy," Mulvaney said on "Fox News Sunday."
Some New York Democrats believe they are in a unique position to pass a state law that would force the release of Trump's state taxes because he is a New Yorker.
Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-Manhattan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told The New York Times the New York bill would be helpful.
"The state return, presumably, has to match the federal return," he said, adding, "It just makes the work of the federal committee, that has a legitimate reason to look into this, a little easier to see the complete picture."
Holyman has helped introduced three bills in New York to try to get Trump's state taxes.
The latest had yet to get an Assembly sponsor.
One measure, called the NY TRUTH Act, would require all statewide elected officials, including the president and vice president if they file New York income taxes, to release their taxes publicly each year.
Another would keep Trump off the state's 2020 ballot if he doesn't release his taxes, a bill similar to ones being considered in other states, including New Jersey, where it passed but was vetoed by then-Gov. Chris Christie, a Trump ally.
So far in New York, though, none of the bills has been successful. Yet there is renewed hope this year because Democrats control the state Legislature; Republicans had held the Senate majority for the past eight years.

Texto completo: Grammy, Tony and Emmy award-nominated singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles will play the UPMC Events Center at Robert Morris University in Moon on Nov. 15.
The concert is part of Bareilles' 30-city "Amidst The Chaos Tour," in support of her album of the same name released April 5. The tour kicks off Oct. 5 in Detroit and wraps up Nov. 26 in Atlanta.
Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. April 12 at livenation.com.
According to a review in Variety, Bareilles' new album "establishes that there's no one in contemporary pop better at flexing mezzo-soprano sensitivity and social empathy like a muscle."
Bareilles first achieved mainstream success in 2007 with her hit "Love Song," which reached No. 1 in 22 countries. She has seven Grammy nominations, including Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Album of the Year.
Her 2015 book, "Sounds Like Me: My Life (So Far) in Song," is a New York Times best-seller.
She composed the music and lyrics for the Broadway musical, "Waitress," for which she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Score and a Grammy Award nomination for Best Musical Theater Album. She also made her Broadway acting debut in 2017 in the lead role in "Waitress."

They'll help you elevate the quality of your images without weighing you down too much. After all, you might never pass this way again!
Fujifilm X-A5 Camera

Out with a stomp

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
Her feet hit the stage like an explosion. Her expertise imbues the Twin Cities flamenco dance scene with an unexpected range of skill and emotion.
And now Susana di Palma will step into the spotlight one final time. The veteran choreographer plans to continue as artistic director of Zorongo Flamenco Dance Theatre, the Minneapolis company she founded in 1982. But di Palma will no longer dance in the company's main stage productions following "What the Moon Sees," opening Thursday at the Lab Theater.
"I've never felt physically better," di Palma said recently while breezing through Zorongo's airy Minneapolis studio. "But I'm 72 years old. Sometimes I have to get out my ID just to remind myself."
Under di Palma's direction, Zorongo has built a national reputation for pushing flamenco's traditional roots in compelling, even theatrical, directions, using the Spanish art form to explore literature, visual art and social issues.
Dance writer and choreographer Judith Brin Ingber recalled watching di Palma perform an early version of 1987's "Gernika," inspired by Pablo Picasso's antiwar "Guernica" painting from 1937 (widely regarded as a cubist masterpiece). "I was very astounded," Ingber recalled of watching di Palma's show. "She was taking this traditional form, but actually saying something with it."
Di Palma guided Zorongo through many more surprising explorations: She investigated religious intolerance with 2014's "ConVivir," based on Spain's theologically diverse yet peaceful Convivencia period (roughly the eighth through 15th centuries). She saw American Indian boarding schools through the eyes of her own grandmother with 2012's "Zorro in the Land of the Yellow-Breasted Woodpecker." For her final dance performance, di Palma draws on her experiences as a volunteer for St. Stephen's Human Services, a nonprofit that serves Minnesotans experiencing homelessness.
"She was one of the pioneers in a movement that took flamenco from a purely traditional form to a form that embraces new and contemporary ways of telling stories," said Ten Thousand Things Artistic Director Marcela Lorca, a former Guthrie Theater staffer who enlisted di Palma for her 2001 production of the Spanish folk tragedy "Blood Wedding."
Through it all, di Palma remained in demand as a Twin Cities dancer of rare skill. She appeared locally as a guest dancer with international flamenco troupes, contemporary dance companies and even opera productions, including her appearance with Mill City Summer Opera's "Carmen" last summer.
"Her gestures are so essentialized," Lorca observed of di Palma's dancing. "They are so full of meaning that watching her do anything onstage is a real treat. All she has to do is stand there and there's power."
Flamenco in Minnesota
A Minneapolis native, di Palma began studying Spanish classical dance as a young girl. Ingber remembers taking classes with di Palma at MacPhail Center for Music. Their teacher was a former vaudeville dancer named Lillian Vail. "She wore black Spanish heels, a leotard, and she always had a colorful flowy scarf tied to her waist," Ingber recalled of their former teacher.
Due to her talent -- and possibly due to what she called her "stage mother" -- di Palma was dancing competitively and professionally from an early age. By her teen years, she was touring nationally with dancers Donald O'Connor and Ann-Margret, before the latter became a star for her role in 1963's "Bye Bye Birdie."
As a 20-something, di Palma moved to New York briefly before heading to Spain to study Spanish classical dance. From there, it didn't take long to discover that flamenco was her true passion. "I think it was the emotional range, the darkness," di Palma said. "I related to that."
With its roots in ballet, Spanish classical dance proved a great base for flamenco. "In the old days, even in Spain, you had to study Spanish classical dance, and regional dances, and then flamenco," di Palma said.
And yet flamenco held a second-class status, di Palma continued, perhaps because it comes from the country's marginalized Roma population. "It's raw. In fact, flamenco was not popular up until the 1980s in Spain. If you were a flamenco dancer, you were from the lower classes."
While in Spain, di Palma studied the form intensely while working in tablaos (flamenco nightclubs). She did some TV work with dance companies and toured with flamenco acts such as La Singla. Once she nailed the core techniques, though, she realized she needed to "say something" more with flamenco. So she moved back to Minnesota and launched Zorongo, frequently returning to Spain to keep abreast of the art form.
As a foreigner in Spain, di Palma figured, it would have been difficult to create opportunities for herself. Meanwhile, back in Minnesota, she found that support from generous funders and eager audiences allowed her to flourish.
Zorongo toured successfully to other U.S. cities over the years. One of the company's biggest hits was "Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands," performed at New York City's Joyce Theater in 1993. "It was a totally outrageous piece," di Palma recalled. "I cooked rabbit on stage." (A New York Times reviewer called it "probably one of the most imaginatively staged dance events ever presented at the Joyce Theater.")
"Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands" might have been the launchpad for a national tour. "I could have performed it other places, but I was just burnt out," di Palma said. "I didn't return phone calls for like a year."
So she remained anchored in Minneapolis. Sure, di Palma flew in international flamenco artists for several Zorongo collaborations, which proved quite costly. But she also sought out collaborations with local artists representing a diversity of disciplines. For example, Zorongo copresented 2012's "Journey" with Katha Dance Theatre, a Minnesota company specializing in northern India's classical Kathak dance tradition. Zorongo co-created 2003's Encounters/Encuentros" with Twin Cities gospel singer musician J.D. Steele.
And the company worked with performance artist Patrick Scully on 2016's "Lorca's Women," with Scully distinguishing himself from the Zorongo dancers by performing nude and painting his body blue. "One of the things I've always admired about Susana is her willingness to engage with dancers from other aesthetic traditions," Scully said. " I think that's a real gift that she's brought to our community."
As her role shifts, di Palma confessed to uncertainty regarding Zorongo's future. "I have these apprentice dancers that have achieved something," she said. "Maybe they will be a strong core company that I can continue to direct. Perhaps they can continue the legacy of theater flamenco that addresses issues that are a little outside of the box.
"So many people have studied with me," di Palma added, "they are my family. I just can't walk away from that. Especially as you get older, you need that love all the more."

Texto completo: Kirstjen Nielsen, la secretaria del departamento Seguridad Nacional (DHS) y cara de la actual campaña migratoria del presidente Donald Trump en contra de la inimgración ilegal no aguantó mas la presión y renunció a su cargo tras un reunión este domingo con el presidente en la Casa Blanca.
“La secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen, abandonará su cargo y me gustaría agradecerle por su servicio”, dijo Trump en Twitter.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service….
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2019
A paso seguido Trump anunció su reemplazo en Twitter. “Me complace anunciar que Kevin McAleenan, el actual Comisionado de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de los Estados Unidos, se convertirá en Secretario Interino de @DHSgov. ¡Confío en que Kevin hará un gran trabajo!”
Kirstjen Nielsen abandona el cargo luego de un dificil paso por la dirección de DHS, gestión que la convirtió en el blanco de repetidas críticas por parte del presidente Trump y de varios miembros de su gabinete.
La medida se produce días después de que Trump, quien ha expresado en repetidas ocasiones su enojo por el aumento de migrantes en la frontera sur, se arrepinitió y retiró a su candidato Ron Vitiello para dirigir ICE porque buscaba a un funcionario mas “agresivo” en contra da inmigración ilegal.
Para muchos en Washington la salida Nielsen no es una sorpresa tras las reiteradas críticas de Trump por su insatisfacción con la funcionaria debido al aumento de inmigrantes que ingresaban ilegalmente a los Estados Unidos por la frontera sur
En mayo pasado, seis meses después de asumir el cargo en el departamento, The New York Times informó que Nielsen había redactado su carta de renuncia después de haber sido reprendida públicamente por lo que el presidente llamó su fracaso para ayudar a detener la inmigración ilegal en la frontera.
Según reporta el diario neoyorquino, Stephen Miller, asesor principal de Trump en temas migratorios, se habría dado a la tarea de aumentar la presión y las quejas sobre Nielsen, acusándola de no encontrar formas creativas para detener la entrada de inmigrantes centroamericanos a suelo de EEUU.
De igual forma Jared Kushner, asesor y cuñado de Trump tampoco veía con buenos ojos la continuidad de Nielsen en la dirección de DHS, aumentando la presión para que la funcionaria diera una paso al costado, dijeron varios funcionarios de la Casa Blanca.
Todos estos factores habrían llevado a que Nielsen, después de una agitada reunión con Trump en la Casa Blanca este domingo, decidira renunciar.

Book blurbs need transparency

Texto completo: I don't mean to brag, but sometimes your humble Biblioracle apparently speaks for the entire Chicago Tribune, a newspaper that has been in continuous operation since 1847 when I was minus 123 years old.
Perhaps the most striking example of this was last year when Atria Books, the publisher of Sean Penn's "novel," "Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff" took out a full-page ad touting what critics had to say about the book in a cheeky attempt to lean into what had been overwhelming scorn.
"Honestly, shut your face, Sean Penn," said Marie Claire.
HuffPost declared, "Sean Penn is a novelist who must be stopped."
And the Chicago Tribune? They said to "Ignore Penn."
Except it wasn't the Chicago Tribune who said it. It was me, John Warner, The Biblioracle, and it's advice I stand by, at least when it comes to Sean Penn the novelist and that book, which I shall never mention again.
Even worse, technically, I'm not even an employee of the paper. I know it looks like I've made a home here, but in reality, I'm a freelancer paid by the column. I've never even been inside the Chicago Tribune offices.
How can I be said to speak for the Chicago Tribune?
Framing an individual judgment as belonging to the larger, more august entity isn't unique to books. For movies, theatrical productions, restaurants, video games, blenders, the authority reflexively falls to the publication in which the review appeared.
Except there are exceptions. When Siskel and Ebert gave "two thumbs up," those opposable digits were not credited to the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times. When Stephen King publishes a review in The New York Times, you can bet the pull-quote is attached to him, not the paper.
There are a small handful of book reviewers who have earned the cache to stand alone from (or more likely alongside) their publication. Michiko Kakutani was perhaps tops among them all prior to her recent retirement from The Times. Ron Charles at The Washington Post and Laura Miller at Slate deserve the same distinction in my book. Parul Sehgal, another Times critic, will be there eventually if she isn't already.
But why not me? Why not Claire Fallon, who is the author of the quote credited to HuffPost above?
Honestly, I wasn't inclined to question the practice until Kathleen Rooney took issue with it on Twitter, and I began to think how right she is. Rooney is both a fellow Tribune freelance colleague and the author of "Lillian Boxfish Takes a Walk."
It's not just about ego, but manners as well, acknowledging credit where it is due. At the same time, I believe that it's in the best interest of publishers to attach the names of all reviewers along with the publication in their ads, the pages at internet retailers, or the blurbs on the paperback versions where these things often appear.
"The Biblioracle" does not engender recognition nationwide, but in Chicago? Yeah, a little bit. Imagine a reader browsing the new paperbacks table and seeing a quote from The Biblioracle and remembering, Oh yeah, that guy who recommends books in the Trib. Humility aside, this is a more persuasive connection than only the name of the paper.
You just sold a book.
No one will ever challenge Oprah when it comes to a stamp of approval's ability to move units, but couldn't "A Biblioracle Pick" potentially move at least a few?
Only three words -- five if you include my name with it.
At least think about it, publishers.

Book recommendations from the Biblioracle
John Warner tells you what to read based on the last five books you've read.

1. "A God in Ruins" by Kate Atkinson
2. "Anything is Possible" by Elizabeth Strout
3. "The Secret Life of Bees" by Sue Monk Kidd
4. "A Fatal Grace: A Chief Inspector Gamache Novel" by Louise Penny
5. "Less" by Andrew Sean Greer
-- Nancy A., Normal, Ill.
"Tell the Wolves I'm Home" by Carol Rifka Brunt has a propulsive and emotionally involving story that I think will appeal to Nancy.

1. "The Man Who Was Thursday" by G.K. Chesterton
2. "Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg" by Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik
3. "The Pillars of the Earth: Kingsbridge Book 1" by Ken Follett
4. "The Confidant" by Helene Gremillon
5. "The Modigliani Scandal" by Ken Follett
-- Biff G., Valparaiso, Ind.
I am jealous of Biff because he read one of the books on his list in French, and another in Spanish, which means he can read in at least three languages. I've always wondered about what it would be like to read untranslated literature in my non-native tongue, but I also wonder if it's too late for this old dog to learn a new trick. I'm recommending "The Good Lord Bird" by James McBride.

1. "The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914" by David McCullough
2. "Two Eggs on My Plate" by Oluf Reed Olsen
3. "The Necessary Death of Lewis Winter: The Glasgow Trilogy" by Malcolm Mackay
4. "You Can't Win" by Jack Black
5. "Uncle Tom's Cabin" by Harriet Beecher Stowe
-- Sam D., Lee, Ill.
If Sam isn't already a fan of John Fante, he will be after reading "The Brotherhood of the Grape."

Texto completo: Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer resume their cat-and-mouse game in "Killing Eve." And Lena Waithe's "The Chi" returns to Showtime.
What's on TV
KILLING EVE 8 p.m. on AMC and BBC America. The first season of this spy vs. assassin series ended with a stab to the gut. As Season 2 begins, Villanelle (Jodie Comer) is still bleeding from it. She's the assassin, and a target of obsession for Sandra Oh's British spy character, Eve Polastri. The obsession is mutual and, in the first season, came in many flavors: The two are somewhere between a Tom and Jerry and a Mr. and Mrs. Smith, professional enemies who spend every waking hour thinking about each other. This season, the British actor Emerald Fennell has taken over as showrunner, replacing the show's creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. In her review of the beginning of Season 2 for The New York Times, Margaret Lyons wrote, "Everything that was good about Season 1 is still good."
UNFORGOTTEN 10 p.m. on PBS. The third season of this mystery series begins with a construction crew stumbling on skeletal remains buried deep in English soil. (No, they don't belong to Richard III.) The question of how they got there provides the next case for Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) and Sunil Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar), the detectives at the center of this British series. Unlike most police procedurals, the show puts significant effort behind exploring the effect its central crimes have had on those who knew the victims. In a positive review of the third season for The Guardian, Sam Wollaston wrote that the show "doesn't let you forget that at the core of a murder investigation is the saddest human tragedy."
THE CHI 10 p.m. on Showtime. Lena Waithe, a star of and writer for "Master of None" who won an Emmy for her writing, created a nuanced picture of Chicago in the debut season of this series. The show follows several characters in a neighborhood. At the start of the second season, Brandon (Jason Mitchell), a young man who struggled in Season 1 to pursue his passion for cooking while being pulled toward violence, opens a food truck. Soon after he starts serving up pork belly and polenta tacos, though, an injustice threatens to knock him back on a path toward violence. "My mission is to show these young black men are not born with a gun in their hand," Waithe told The Times last year. "But I don't paint us in a perfect light at all," she also said. "My hope is that I can show us in an honest way. That's it. Not bad. Not perfect. Just accurate."
What's Streaming
CHILLING ADVENTURES OF SABRINA Stream on Netflix. Kiernan Shipka returns as Sabrina the Teenage Witch in this gothic coming-of-age series, created by the "Riverdale" showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. Expect satanic rituals and high school basketball.

President Withdraws Nominee to Lead ICE, Seeking 'Tougher Direction' for Agency

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump said on Friday that he withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a "tougher" direction, a surprise decision before the president's trip to the southwestern border.
Ronald D. Vitiello, who was nominated last summer by Mr. Trump to run ICE, the agency that arrests, detains and deports people who are in the United States illegally, has been serving as the agency's acting director since last June. He had planned to accompany the president on his trip to California, but was left behind.
"Ron's a good man, but we're going in a tougher direction," Mr. Trump said to reporters as he left the White House en route to Calexico, Calif.
Mr. Vitiello's nomination had been awaiting approval by a second Senate committee and confirmation by the full chamber. In an email to ICE employees on Friday afternoon, he signaled that he planned to remain at the immigration agency. No replacement has yet been named.
"While I will not become the permanent director of ICE, I look forward to working alongside you in serving the American public with integrity, courage and excellence," Mr. Vitiello said in the email, which was read to The New York Times by an ICE employee on the condition of anonymity.
One person familiar with the president's thinking said that Mr. Trump believed that Mr. Vitiello did not favor closing the border, as the president had proposed before backing off that threat this week.
Another person said that Stephen Miller, the president's chief policy adviser and a supporter of curtailing legal and illegal immigration, did not support Mr. Vitiello's nomination. The two people familiar with the president's thinking both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the internal White House decisions.
The president's abrupt decision came at a time when his administration considers the United States border with Mexico to be in crisis because of the flow of people trying to get into the country, making it a priority to have a confirmed appointee leading the agency to carry out the administration's policies. But some senators, including Republicans, had concerns that Mr. Vitiello was not the right person for this job.
Mr. Trump, who has continued to push for stronger deportation rules, had also expressed concern about whether a career civil servant, like Mr. Vitiello, would be up to the task. ICE has been led by acting directors since January 2017.
Mr. Vitiello had recently been more outspoken about overflowing immigration facilities and strapped resources at the border. But that did little to assuage the National ICE Council, a union representing agency employees, which in February told the Senate it opposed Mr. Vitiello's nomination over what was described as his controversial posts on social media and his treatment of some ICE agents.
The request to withdraw Mr. Vitiello's nomination surprised officials on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Even some Department of Homeland Security officials questioned whether it was sent in error.

Let's shine some light on blossom illumination efforts in years past

Texto completo: I grew up in the Washington area, and remember as a child visiting the cherry blossoms at night, where there were a number of those huge spotlights on flatbed trucks aimed at the trees. As you can imagine, the trees were spectacular, glowing as if they were lit from inside. Do you recall this history? It would seem that having the trees lit at night during peak bloom would extend viewing time and allow more folks to see them. Plus, they were even more beautiful when illuminated.
- Patricia Turner, Sterling, Va.
How much help does nature need? That's a question that stewards of our natural places wrestle with. Who, for example, saw a towering sequoia and decided, "That's cool. But you know what would look really cool? If we put in a tunnel so you could drive your car through it."
Of course, the Tidal Basin's cherry trees were never as "natural" as the sequoia. They were carefully cultivated and are lovingly tended. Still, at some point, someone decided they'd look good if illuminated by a collection of artificial suns.
There's a vintage postcard of the illuminated trees on the cover of Ann McClellan's 2012 book, "The Cherry Blossom Festival: Sakura Celebration." She told Answer Man that she once asked the National Park Service's famed blossom expert Rob DeFeo when the lights were in use.
"He said that they knew they were, but no one made a record of when," said McClellan.
Answer Man determined that the trees were lit up in 1934, though he can't be sure they weren't lit up earlier. But 1934 is when Pepco installed $2,200 worth of underground wiring, cables and other "permanent" equipment. That allowed 450 floodlights to be plugged in throughout the trees.
The effect? The Washington Post wrote that "Like Nature's ballerinas the cherry trees shimmered in a fluffy-skirted row with almost the detached grace that clouds possess. The flood-lights were so artfully placed they enhanced the fascination the cherry blossoms possess in the daytime a hundredfold."
But problems cropped up the following year. A fire in the warehouse where equipment was stored damaged 70 floodlights. And Pepco complained that it hadn't been paid for the previous year's installation work.
"The lights don't belong to us and besides we haven't the money to turn them on," said C. Marshall Finnan , superintendent of National Capital Parks.
Lighting was back by 1937, when the New York Times noted that "Pyrotechnicians have arranged special lighting around the Tidal Basin . . . Great flood lights will be thrown on the trees."
That seems to be the first year festival organizers called out the military. At least some of the flood lights were provided by the Army.
That practice ceased during World War II, when the Army presumably needed its lights for more pressing matters, and blackout restrictions meant it wasn't a good idea to light up a major section of the nation's capital. The cherry trees went dark.
The lights didn't come back until 1947. The theme of that year's festival was "Peace Among the Cherry Blossoms."
The trees were lit into the 1960s, when military floodlights on the backs of trucks threw beams of up to 800 million candlepower on the blossoms until 10:30 or 11 each night.
These weren't the only illuminating features of the festival. In 1949, the festival queen was conveyed on a barge in the Tidal Basin that was picked out by lights from shore. And that year a nighttime "water carnival" featured "the maneuvering of small boats and canoes formed in various patterns, with each boat outlined in phosphorus."
For much of its history, the Cherry Blossom Parade was itself held after dark. Post stories from the 1950s mention that the three giant searchlights provided by the Army were moved from the Tidal Basin to illuminate the parade, which started at 8 p.m. and took floats and marchers up K Street NW. (The parade was moved to the morning in 1961.)
The beams that swept the cherry blossoms may have been impressive to tourists, but they posed a problem for pilots landing at National Airport, who complained of being briefly blinded. In 1955, the lights were adjusted so the beams reached no higher than the treetops.
In 1966, the Park Service announced that it would no longer be borrowing the Army's searchlights. On April 7, the Evening Star reported, "An experimental lighting system, however, was turned on last night and will be in use nightly during the blossoming and festival period. The new system features both groundlevel floodlights and elevated lights."
The energy crisis during Jimmy Carter's presidency meant that many federal buildings and monuments went dark. That included at the Tidal Basin.
The blossoms were lit in 2012 for the centenary of the trees' arrival. Today's visitors will encounter only the occasional streetlight. See the blossoms during the day or hope for a bright moon.

Resumen: The suspect jailed for murder in the friendly-fire death of a Queens detective claims the tragedy began with an ill-conceived stab at comedy. Self-proclaimed "shock value comic" Christopher Ransom, 27, told the Daily News in a jailhouse interview that his alleged Feb. 12 robbery attempt at a T-Mobile store was actually a phony holdup videotaped by a pal and meant to get laughs online. Ransom and his alleged lookout, Jagger Freeman, were indicted on charges of murder, manslaughter, assault and robbery in the death of the 42-year-old Simonsen and the wounding of the detective's partner Sgt. Matthew Gorman.

Texto completo: The suspect jailed for murder in the friendly-fire death of a Queens detective claims the tragedy began with an ill-conceived stab at comedy.
Self-proclaimed "shock value comic" Christopher Ransom, 27, told the Daily News in a jailhouse interview that his alleged Feb. 12 robbery attempt at a T-Mobile store was actually a phony holdup videotaped by a pal and meant to get laughs online.
"It was a prank gone horribly wrong," claimed Ransom in the Rikers Island sitdown. "I never meant to hurt anyone or rob anyone ... I feel bad for the detective's family and I hope the sergeant recovers soon."
Detective Brian Simonsen was mortally wounded when cops fired 42 shots after responding to the reported Richmond Hills robbery. The seven cops arrived to find Ransom inside, clutching a replica Colt handgun and running toward them.
Ransom, shot eight times in the NYPD fusillade, limped out for the interview in his gray prison uniform, looking calm and smiling as he spoke. He appeared more concerned with his comedy career than his criminal case.
"Am I gonna be on the front cover?" he asked a News reporter at one point.
"I'm a shock-value comic," Ransom continued. "That's what I do. I'm an entertainer."
Ransom and his alleged lookout, Jagger Freeman, were indicted on charges of murder, manslaughter, assault and robbery in the death of the 42-year-old Simonsen and the wounding of the detective's partner Sgt. Matthew Gorman.
Though Ransom wielded a fake gun incapable of firing, prosecutors charged him under a law specifying that a participant in a violent felony is responsible for any deaths resulting from the crime. The suspect insisted that he never imagined the stunt taking such a horrific turn.
"I'm not a monster," he said. "I didn't know what was going to happen that night."
Ransom told The News that Freeman was videotaping the bogus robbery as he used the fake gun to corral the store's two workers. Dressed all in black, Ransom ordered the employees into the back.
"Dude, this isn't funny," one of the employees told him.
Ransom said he returned the workers' cash, handed them his business card and walked from the store's back room into the line of fire. Freeman bolted from the scene once the shooting began, cops said.
Contradicting Ransom's comedic claims are charges against the comedian in four previous cell phone store robberies. Authorities claim Freeman joined Ransom for a Feb. 8 holdup at another T-Mobile outlet.
The duo communicated via cell phone to plot the earlier heist, and texted each other afterwards to discuss splitting the more than $3,000 netted in the robbery, court papers allege.
Ransom's attorney, Ken Finkelman of Legal Aid, told The News in February that his client suffers mental health issues and was possibly trying to commit suicide by cop.
Ransom said he remembered the glass windows shattering around him as the officers opened fire.
"At the time I thought I was going to die," he said. "There was a lot of blood."
Ransom has a history of odd behavior, including a September 2016 visit to the 71st Precinct in Crown Heights where he was dressed in his underwear with a red towel tied around his neck like a cape.
The inmate said he gravitated toward comedy because he was an adopted child and felt the need to stand out from his brothers.
"There's a price to pay to be famous," he added.
Though awaiting a trial that could jail him for life, Ransom wants to continue doing comedy - and intends to write a book about his life.
"It's already in the works," he said. "It'll be a New York Times bestseller!"
Employees at the T-Mobile store where the shootout happened said it was against company policy to talk about it.
"And to be honest .... I don't want to remember what happened," one employee added.

Texto completo: In what seems like a broken record, Facebook is facing another scandal related to the transparency of its user data.
The UpGuard cybersecurity firm reports that it uncovered two cases in which massive buckets of third-party Facebook app data were left exposed on the public internet.
In one such case, a Mexico-based media company named Cultura Colectiva amassed 146 gigabytes of data with more than 540 million records. The records are said to include user comments, likes, reactions, account names, Facebook IDs and more.
Don't yell, text: The new normal of how families 'talk' at home

Another exposure, UpGuard says, came from a since-discontinued Facebook-integrated app called At The Pool and was apparently posted on a public Amazon cloud server. This second data trove reportedly included unprotected passwords for 22,000 users.
Though At The Pool shut down in 2014, UpGuard wrote that, “this should offer little consolation to the app’s end users whose names, passwords, email addresses, Facebook IDs and other details were openly exposed for an unknown period of time. ”
Facebook shut down the Cultura database after being alerted by Bloomberg.
In a statement supplied to USA TODAY via email, the social network wrote that “Facebook's policies prohibit storing Facebook information in a public database. Once alerted to the issue, we worked with Amazon to take down the databases. We are committed to working with the developers on our platform to protect people's data. ”
UpGuard outlined the potential risk: “These two situations speak to the inherent problem of mass information collection: the data doesn’t naturally go away, and a derelict storage location may or may not be given the attention it requires. ”
The scandal-ridden company faced more bad news. Over the weekend in an unrelated matter, Twitter user "e-Sushi" reported that the social network, as part of a dubious verification process, demanded the secret password of some users’ personal email accounts.
In an email sent to the Daily Beast after it reported the issue, Facebook said that it doesn’t store the email passwords but announced it would end the practice just the same.
“We understand the password verification option isn’t the best way to go about this, so we are going to stop offering it,” the company wrote in the email.
The latest string of events follows last month’s scandal in which the KrebsOnSecurity security news site reported that hundreds of millions of Facebook users passwords were stored in plain text that could be searched by more than 20,000 Facebook employees.
And that was revealed after the New York Times reported that Facebook faces a federal criminal investigation into consumer data-sharing deals it made with scores of other technology companies including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Samsung.

Amazon Asked to Limit Facial-Recognition Software

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- At least 25 prominent artificial-intelligence researchers, including experts at Google, Facebook, Microsoft and a recent winner of the prestigious Turing Award, have signed a letter calling on Amazon to stop selling its facial-recognition technology to law enforcement agencies because it is biased against women and people of color.
The letter, which was publicly released Wednesday, reflects growing concern in academia and the tech industry that bias in facial-recognition technology is a systemic problem. Some researchers -- and even some companies -- are arguing the technology cannot be properly controlled without government regulation.
Amazon sells a product called Rekognition through its cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services. The company said last year that early customers included the Orlando Police Department in Florida and the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon.
In January, two researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a peer-reviewed study showing that Amazon Rekognition had more trouble identifying the gender of female and darker-skinned faces in photos than similar services from IBM and Microsoft. It mistook women for men 19 percent of the time, the study showed, and misidentified darker-skinned women for men 31 percent of the time.
Before publishing their findings on Amazon Rekognition, the M.I.T. researchers released a similar study examining services from IBM, Microsoft and Megvii, an artificial-intelligence company in China. All three updated their services to address concerns raised by the researchers.
In separate blog posts from the Amazon executives Matthew Wood and Michael Punke, the company disputed the study and a Jan. 24 article in The New York Times describing it.
"The answer to anxieties over new technology is not to run 'tests' inconsistent with how the service is designed to be used, and to amplify the test's false and misleading conclusions through the news media," Dr. Wood wrote. Amazon did not directly engage with the M.I.T. researchers.
The letter released on Wednesday was signed by the Google researchers Margaret Mitchell, Andrea Frome and Timnit Gebru; the Facebook researcher Georgia Gkioxari; William Isaac, a researcher at DeepMind, the London lab owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet; and Yoshua Bengio, one of the world's most important A.I. researchers.
Last week, Dr. Bengio was one of three people to receive the Turing Award -- often called "the Nobel Prize of computing" -- for his work with neural networks, the technology that underpins modern facial recognition services.
"There are no laws or required standards to ensure that Rekognition is used in a manner that does not infringe on civil liberties," the A.I. researchers wrote. "We call on Amazon to stop selling Rekognition to law enforcement."
The researchers added that Dr. Wood and Mr. Punke had "misrepresented the technical details" of the M.I.T. study and modern facial-recognition technology. Amazon declined to comment on the letter on Wednesday.
Microsoft, by contrast, improved the accuracy of its facial recognition last year after an earlier M.I.T. study reported that its system was better at identifying the gender of lighter-skinned men in a photo database than darker-skinned women.
During a February talk at the Cornell Tech graduate school in New York, Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, said the company had "participated in the market for law enforcement in the United States," but had also turned down sales when there was concern it could unreasonably infringe on people's rights.
In February, Microsoft backed a bill in Washington State that would require notices to be posted in public places using facial-recognition tech and ensure that government agencies obtain a court order when looking for specific people. The bill is still pending. But the company did not back other legislation that provides much stronger protections.
Mr. Punke wrote in his February blog post that Amazon also supported regulation of facial-recognition technology and called for law enforcement agencies to "be transparent in how they use facial-recognition technology." But Amazon has declined to disclose how police or intelligence agencies are using its Rekognition system and whether the company puts any restrictions on its use.
Amazon has said that it has not received any reports of Rekognition misuse by law enforcement, and that the company's acceptable use policy prohibits customers from using its services in ways that violate laws.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former Vice President Joe Biden, facing multiple allegations from women of unwanted and inappropriate behavior, promised to be more "mindful and respectful" in a video released Wednesday
Biden, who is considering a bid for the White House in 2020, says his touching was all about making a "human connection. "
"It's just who I am," Biden says in the video. "I've never thought of politics as cold or antiseptic. "
Hours after the video, The Washington Post reported allegations from three more women, including a former White House intern who said Biden got very close to her face and called her a "pretty girl. "
The additional accounts bring the total number of women who have brought forward complaints about Biden to seven, since Friday.
Biden contends his close contact is his way of showing people he cares.
"I’ve always tried to be, in my career, I’ve always tried to make a human connection. That’s my responsibility, I think. I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men and women by the shoulders and say you can do this,” Biden said in the video posted to Twitter. “It’s the way I’ve always been. It’s the way I’ve tried to show I care about them and I’m listening. ”
But he says he understands times have changed and so should his behavior. "I get it. I get it. I hear what they're saying. I understand," Biden says. "I’ll be much more mindful. "
"I’ll always believe that governing, quite frankly life for that matter, is about connecting with people," Biden says. "That won’t change, but I will be more mindful and respectful of people’s personal space – and that’s a good thing. "
The string of accusations started when Lucy Flores, a former member of the Nevada Legislature, accused Biden of "demeaning and disrespectful" behavior when he kissed the back of her head.
In a column for New York Magazine, Flores detailed a backstage encounter with Biden during an event in 2014 in Nevada where he spoke to help boost voter turnout for Democrats.
"I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified," Flores wrote. "He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. "
Since then, three women told similar allegations stories to the New York Times and another three on Wednesday came forward in the Post.
Trump talks Biden: As Biden faces 2 more accusations of improper conduct, Trump jokes, 'You having a good time, Joe?'
Opinion: I worked with Joe Biden for a decade. I saw nothing inappropriate: Today's talker
Among the allegations, Vail Kohnert-Yount, a former intern at the White House, told the Post that in 2013 she met the vice president at the White House.
After shaking hands, "he put his hand on the back of my head and pressed his forehead to my forehead while he talked to me. I was so shocked that it was hard to focus on what he was saying. I remember he told me I was a ‘pretty girl,’" Kohnert-Yount told the Post.
Another accuser, Sofie Karasek, told the Post that she told Biden a story about a college student who was the victim of a sexual assault during the Oscars in 2016. She told the Post that after she told Biden that the student had committed suicide after the assault, Biden took her hands and placed his forehead against hers.
Karasek told the Post that it was an awkward moment and that she did not know how to react. She said she doesn't feel Biden's video apology was enough.
"He emphasized that he wants to connect with people and, of course, that’s important. But, again, all of our interactions and friendships are a two-way street," Karasek said, adding that Biden "still didn’t take ownership in the way that he needs to. "
A third woman on Wednesday told the Post that Biden held her close "for a beat too long" during a 2008 event when she was introduced to the former vice president.
Ally Coll said Biden leaned in, squeezed her shoulders and complimented her smile, according to the Post.
The allegations against Biden come amid #MeToo, a movement started nearly a decade ago that went viral in 2017 as women in Hollywood and across the country shared stories of sexual harassment and assault.

It’s led to the resignation or downfall of more than 100 entertainers, executives and politicians, including Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer and Kevin Spacey. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn. , announced his resignation in 2017 after accusations of sexual misconduct.
Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. , also stepped down, as well as Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz. , who resigned amid reports he discussed with female staffers the possibility they could be surrogates for his and his wife's baby.
President Donald Trump suggested at an event Tuesday that Biden may have been one of the Democrats' best shots at taking the White House in 2020, then he cracked several jokes.
"It looks like the only non-sort-of-heavy socialist, he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists. They got to him, our former vice president," Trump said. "I was going to call him. I don't know him well. I was going to say, 'Welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?' "
Trump again mentioned Biden while telling the crowd at the National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner about a general who told him defeating the Islamic State could be done within a week. "Give me a kiss," Trump said he told the general.
He continued: "I felt like Joe Biden. "
Wednesday, the president said, "I wish him luck. I do wish him luck. "
More than a dozen women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct over the years, including eight women who accused him of forcibly kissing them.
Trump denied the allegations. In an “Access Hollywood” tape that surfaced during the final weeks of the presidential campaign in 2016, Trump made lewd comments and bragged about groping women. The president said that was "locker-room banter. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump cracked a few jokes about the allegations encircling Joe Biden – the same day two more women came forward with accusations against the former vice president.
The new allegations, reported by The New York Times, follow the claims of two women who have come forward over the last five days to accuse Biden of unwanted, inappropriate behavior.
Speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner on Tuesday, Trump suggested Biden would not pose a threat to him if he entered the 2020 presidential race, thanks to "socialists" working to take him down.
"It looks like the only non-sort-of-heavy socialist, he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists. They got to him. Our former vice president," Trump said. "I was going to call him, I don't know him well, I was going to say, 'Welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?'"
Pelosi on Biden:Allegations aren't 'disqualifying,' but he needs to understand 'people's space is important'
2020 impact: How Democrats in early primary states view allegations against Joe Biden
Trump brought up the former vice president while discussing his reelection theme, asking the audience if he should embrace "Keep America Great" or keep the slogan from his 2016 campaign, "Make America Great Again. "
Later, Trump again mentioned Biden while telling the crowd about a general who told him defeating ISIS could be done within a week. "Give me a kiss," Trump said he told the general.
He continued: "I felt like Joe Biden. "
The Times on Tuesday night published accounts from two additional women who said Biden's close contact made them feel uncomfortable.
Caitlyn Caruso told the Times that Biden put his hand on her thigh during an event about sexual assault at UNLV in Las Vegas. Caruso, 22, said she was 19 at the time and told the Times that the incident happened after she finished telling her story of an assault.
“It doesn’t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that,” she told the Times. “These are supposed to be people you can trust. ”
Opinion: How Joe Biden could make me start forgiving him for Anita Hill (first, stop touching)
Opinion: I worked with Joe Biden for a decade. I saw nothing inappropriate: Today's talker
Another woman, D. J. Hill, told the Times that in 2012 at a fundraising event in Minneapolis, Biden placed his hand on her back then started dropping it down her back.
Hill, 59, said it made her "very uncomfortable" and told the Times that her husband noticed the incident and intervened by cracking a joke and putting his hand on Biden's shoulder.
"Only he knows his intent," Hill told the Times, adding "If something makes you feel uncomfortable, you have to feel able to say it. "
Biden has previously denied any wrongdoing.
"In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort," he said Sunday. "And not once – never – did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention. "

On Monday, the Hartford Courant reported Amy Lappos of Connecticut said Biden touched her and rubbed his nose on hers during a 2009 political fundraiser in Greenwich.
"It wasn't sexual, but he did grab me by the head," Lappos told the newspaper. "He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth. "
The allegations against Biden come amid #MeToo, a movement started nearly a decade ago that went viral in 2017 as women in Hollywood and across the country began sharing stories of sexual harassment and assault. It’s led to the resignation or downfall of more than 100 entertainers, executives and politicians, including Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer and Kevin Spacey. Former Minnesota Democrat Sen. Al Franken announced his resignation in 2017 following accusations of sexual misconduct. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. , also stepped down, along with Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz. , who resigned amid reports he discussed with female staffers the possibility they could be surrogates for his and his wife's baby.
More than a dozen women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct over the years, including eight women who have accused him of forcibly kissing them. Trump has denied the allegations. In an “Access Hollywood” tape that surfaced during the final weeks of the presidential campaign in 2016, Trump was heard making lewd comments and bragging about groping women. The president has said that was "locker-room banter. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump cracked a few jokes about the allegations encircling Joe Biden on Tuesday — the same day two more women came forward with accusations against the former vice president.
The new allegations, reported by the New York Times, follow the claims of two women who have come forward over the last five days to accuse Biden of unwanted, inappropriate behavior.
Speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner on Tuesday, Trump suggested Biden would not pose a threat to him if he entered the 2020 presidential race, thanks to "socialists" working to take him down.
"It looks like the only non-sort-of-heavy socialist, he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists. They got to him. Our former vice president," Trump said. "I was going to call him, I don't know him well, I was going to say, 'Welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?'"

Trump brought up the former vice president while discussing his reelection theme, asking the audience if he should embrace "Keep America Great" or keep the slogan from his 2016 campaign, "Make America Great Again. "
Later, Trump again mentioned Biden while telling the crowd about a general who told him defeating ISIS could be done within a week. "Give me a kiss," Trump said he told the general.
He continued: "I felt like Joe Biden. "
The Times on Monday night published accounts from two additional women who said Biden's close contact made them feel uncomfortable.
Caitlyn Caruso told the Times that Biden put his hand on her thigh during an event about sexual assault at UNLV in Las Vegas. Caruso, 22, said she was 19 at the time and told the Times that the incident happened after she finished telling her story of an assault.
“It doesn’t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that,” she told the Times. “These are supposed to be people you can trust. ”
Opinion: How Joe Biden could make me start forgiving him for Anita Hill (first, stop touching)
Opinion: I worked with Joe Biden for a decade. I saw nothing inappropriate: Today's talker
Another woman, D. J. Hill, told the Times that in 2012 at a fundraising event in Minneapolis, Biden placed his hand on her back then started dropping it down her back.
Hill, 59, said it made her "very uncomfortable" and told the Times that her husband noticed the incident and intervened by cracking a joke and putting his hand on Biden's shoulder.
"Only he knows his intent," Hill told the Times, adding "If something makes you feel uncomfortable, you have to feel able to say it. "
Biden has previously denied any wrongdoing.
"In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort," he said Sunday. "And not once – never – did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention. "

The string of accusations began after Lucy Flores, a former member of the Nevada Legislature, accused Biden of "demeaning and disrespectful" behavior when he allegedly kissed the back of her head.
In a column for New York Magazine, Flores detailed a backstage encounter with Biden during a 2014 event in Nevada where he was speaking to help boost voter turnout for Democrats.
"I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified," Flores writes. "He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. "
On Monday, the Hartford Courant reported Amy Lappos of Connecticut said Biden touched her and rubbed his nose on hers during a 2009 political fundraiser in Greenwich.
"It wasn't sexual, but he did grab me by the head," Lappos told the newspaper. "He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth. "

Texto completo: Now, for the millions reading The New York Times around the world in print, on tablet or on a computer, ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to readdddd an interviewwww.
O.K., so maybe it doesn't quite have the same ring to it. But it probably would have sounded better from Michael Buffer, the prolific ring announcer who, beginning in the 1980s, made the phrase "Let's get ready to rumble!" a pop-culture staple. When the live-action version of "Dumbo" opened last weekend, viewers were treated to Buffer's latest cameo. He doesn't play himself, as he usually does. Instead, his character is actually given a name -- Baritone Bates -- and instead of his classic quote, he says, "Let's get ready for Dumbo!" The Tim Burton-directed movie has been using the clip in advertisements.
Buffer, a 74-year-old Philadelphia native, has a lengthy film and television résumé, mostly in projects that involve fighting. He appeared in both "Creed" movies, as well as "Grudge Match," "The Fighter" and last year's critically panned "Holmes & Watson." He has even had a role where he moved beyond simply announcing: the villain Walbridge in "You Don't Mess With The Zohan."
But Buffer is first and foremost a ring announcer, he said in a phone interview, with little ambition to go beyond that. It is his catchphrase, combined with an instantly recognizable deep baritone voice, that has allowed him to do so.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
How did the cameo in "Dumbo" come about?
Susie Figgis was the casting director, and we got a feeler from her to see if I was available. It sounded like something great and something that I'd love to do.
How many requests for cameos do you receive each day?
I don't know if I receive requests on a daily basis. I'll get two or three a year for movies. I've been in about 20 movies. Most times, I'm playing myself in films, like "Rocky" or "Creed."
I know you've done weddings, bar mitzvahs and birthday parties. What are some of the more unusual requests you've received?
You just named a few of the unusual ones. It's been a while since I've done a wedding or a bar mitzvah, but I have done quite a few of those. One time, a hedge fund gentleman in Connecticut brought in a bunch of professional wrestlers and myself at a very hefty price for his son's 11th birthday.
Have you ever thought about trying out more acting?
One of my careers just before ring announcing was that I worked as a model. I did get a lot of requests for soap opera stuff and that sort of thing. I have to give it to actors, it's a lot of work. I don't think I could see myself getting up at 4 a.m. every day and going to makeup at a studio.
I read that you once recorded your signature phrase to help motivate the troops during the war in Iraq. Where does that rank in terms of unconventional gigs?
I've done quite a few gigs for the military. Some of them had to be kept under the wire. I'm a three year Army veteran myself, and I'm always available to do stuff like that. I've even done some things for the British military, too.
What percentage of your work is in the ring now?
It's still my primary job. Now, I have an exclusive contract with DAZN and Matchroom Boxing. For the 37 years I appeared on HBO, I never had a contract with them. I was always an independent, working for the promoters.
When you developed "Let's get ready to rumble" in the early 1980s, what were some of the other phrases you were thinking about?
It wasn't that there were a lot that I was looking to try out. I was just looking for something that would get the fans' attention. When I say attention, the primary purpose of sticking with "Let's get ready to rumble" was when the fighters would come to the ring, it was exciting, and then ring announcers were introducing all their buddies on the boxing commission. It just killed the crowd. So I wanted a hook that would be comparable to, let's say, "Gentleman, start your engines." Everyone knows the race is about to begin. I tried "Man your battleships" and "Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seatbelts." They didn't seem to have any pizazz.
Do you get tired of it?
Not when I wake up every morning at my house and look around at my garage and that sort of thing. I'm not tired of it at all.

Texto completo: Kylie Jenner's status as the youngest "self-made" billionaire has sparked furious debate across social media, with scores of people accusing Jenner of leveraging her family’s affluence and notoriety into profit.
Forbes bestowed the coveted title on the 21-year-old makeup mogul last month, thanks to her lucrative company, Kylie Cosmetics, which is worth over $900 million.
After initially shooting down critics by saying, "There’s really no other word to use other than 'self-made,' because that is the truth," Jenner now appears to be changing her tune.

During an interview with The New York Times over the weekend, the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan admitted that she "can’t say I’ve done it by myself. "
"If they’re just talking finances, technically, yes, I don’t have any inherited money," she said. "But I have had a lot of help and a huge platform. "
Jenner has 130 million followers on Instagram, which allows her to advertise her lip kits and products directly to her devoted fan base with virtually no marketing expenses.
"It’s the power of social media," she told Forbes. “I had such a strong reach before I was able to start anything. "

When Forbes first reported last summer that Jenner was on track to take over the title, she was met with debate from USA TODAY readers and social media users alike, who argued over whether her success was "self-made" or merely a byproduct of being born into an already-famous and wealthy family.
In response, Jenner told Interview last month that she used "100% of my own money to start the company" in 2015, adding that "not a dime in my bank account is inherited … and I am very proud of that. "
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously held Forbes' title for youngest self-made billionaire.

Second Woman Says Biden Made Her Uncomfortable

Texto completo: A second woman on Monday accused Joseph R. Biden Jr. of touching her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable, intensifying the scrutiny of the former vice president's close physical interactions with women over the years as he prepares for a likely presidential bid.
The woman, Amy Lappos, said in an interview with The Hartford Courant that Mr. Biden "put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me" at a fund-raiser in Connecticut in 2009.
"When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth," she said in the interview. She said the encounter "wasn't sexual" but that there was "a line of respect" and Mr. Biden had crossed it.
[Joe Biden's hugs and kisses were well-known in Washington. Now he faces a generational reckoning.]
Her allegations follow a weekend in which Mr. Biden defended himself against a similar complaint from a former Nevada assemblywoman, Lucy Flores, who said in an essay published on Friday that the former vice president had touched and kissed her inappropriately at a campaign event in 2014.
In a statement late Monday that Ms. Lappos sent to The New York Times, she said she was speaking out because she was disappointed in the way Ms. Flores has been treated in the aftermath of her allegations. "Uninvited affection is not okay. Objectifying women is not okay," Ms. Lappos said.
"Referring to this type of behavior as 'simply affection' or 'grandpa-like' or 'friendly' is ridiculously dismissive and part of the problem," she said in the statement. "Saying 'but Trump....' is dangerous and sets the bar for Democratic men far below where it should be."
Mr. Biden's team had already issued two statements trying to contain the damage. Earlier Monday, his spokesman, Bill Russo, sent a third, lengthy email to reporters criticizing what he said were misrepresentations of Mr. Biden's past behavior, and seeking to link some of the attacks on him to Republicans.
Mr. Russo cited an image of Mr. Biden holding the shoulders of Stephanie Carter, the wife of former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, and another of Mr. Biden kissing the head of Senator Chris Coons's daughter, arguing that the criticism of the former vice president was rooted in inaccurate assumptions about what was occurring in the pictures.
Both Ms. Carter and Mr. Coons's young daughter welcomed Mr. Biden's embrace, Mr. Russo said, pointing to a Medium post Ms. Carter wrote and comments Mr. Coons made about how close his family is to the Bidens.
But Mr. Biden's team of advisers is preparing for more criticism about his past behavior, acknowledging that, given Mr. Biden's nearly 50-year career in politics, it's inevitable that others will come forward to say he made them feel uncomfortable.
Mr. Russo pointed out that much of the criticism about Mr. Biden's conduct has come from Republicans and that some of it has been manufactured entirely.
The aide pointed to photoshopped images, including one in which Mr. Biden is portrayed touching Ms. Carter's breast, and another cropped photo of the former vice president comforting his grandson at the funeral of his son, Beau -- which he called "most galling of all."
"These smears and forgeries have existed in the dark recesses of the internet for a while," Mr. Russo said. "To this day, right-wing trolls and others continue to exploit them for their own gain," he added, warning against a "cottage industry of lies."
On Monday, the Drudge Report posted a collage of Biden photographs, including one that photoshopped him standing behind a crying piccolo player in the Villanova University band, a widely shared image from the 2015 N.C.A.A. basketball tournament.
Mr. Biden's advisers believe that the more the right pushes images of him, real or fake, the more it will help them persuade Democrats that Republicans are trying to derail a potential challenger who performs best in polls against President Trump. The aides spoke on condition of anonymity because the former vice president is not yet in the race.
But Mr. Biden's inner circle is also deeply suspicious about the timing of Ms. Flores's criticism, believing it's part of a larger effort by hostile Democrats to undermine the former vice president's candidacy before he even announces, the advisers said.
The aggressive response by Mr. Biden's aides represents the latest indication of what they said over the weekend: that he will not be dissuaded by the allegations from entering the presidential race.
The challenge for Mr. Biden now, though, is that Ms. Flores is no longer alone in speaking out.
In her interview with The Courant, Ms. Lappos said the encounter that made her uncomfortable occurred at a fund-raiser in 2009, when she was working as a congressional aide to Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut.
"There's absolutely a line of decency," she told The Courant. "There's a line of respect. Crossing that line is not grandfatherly. It's not cultural. It's not affection. It's sexism or misogyny."
She said she "never filed a complaint, to be honest, because he was the vice president. I was a nobody."
The office of Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut confirmed Monday that the event described in the Courant article took place and that Mr. Murphy, who was a congressman at the time, attended it.
The recent scrutiny of Mr. Biden's physical behavior began on Friday when Ms. Flores, a Democrat, published an essay in New York Magazine's The Cut, which described an encounter with Mr. Biden in 2014 that she described as mortifying.
In the essay, she wrote that Mr. Biden had come to a rally to help her fledgling campaign for lieutenant governor of Nevada and had come up behind her, touched her and planted "a big slow kiss" on the back of her head. Mr. Biden, in a statement Friday, said he did not believe he acted inappropriately, but pledged to listen to any accuser.
Since the essay published, Ms. Flores, 39, has praised Mr. Biden for being willing to listen to concerns and clarify his intentions. But she has said she finds it hard to believe that Mr. Biden could not have been aware of how he made her and other women feel and has called his behavior "completely inappropriate."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Don't change money goals for spring break

Texto completo: We've all been waiting for a break from this cold, dreary winter. Well, for students — and their families — across the country, it's finally here: spring break! But as much as you've been pining for sunshine and a beach, spring break isn't an excuse to bust the budget or, worse, go into debt.
Your money goals shouldn't change based on the time of year. So, to help you save money, here's my list of best and worst things to do for spring break.
Best things to do for spring break Stay stateside. Driving is pretty much always the cheapest way to travel, so check out a destination within five or six hours of where you live. If you have to fly, you'll save money if you stay within the United States versus going to an overseas destination.
Visit southern beaches. I'm not just saying this because I'm from the South! Destinations like Daytona, Florida, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, are absolutely gorgeous. You can find hotel deals in both cities for around $75 per night.
Stay with friends. When I look back on my spring breaks, it's not the places I remember as much as the people I was with. Do you have a friend you haven't seen in a while who lives in a cool city that would be fun to visit? You'll both save money and make the most of your time off by staying at the each other's places for spring break.
Worst things to do for spring break Get a timeshare. Timeshares are one of the top sellers in the travel industry, but they're also one of the biggest scams on the market today. Think about it. Why spend thousands of dollars on a place you might get to enjoy one week a year? Oh, and you never have any equity in the place. If you're already stuck with one, it is possible to get out from under it. Timeshare Exit Team is dedicated to helping timeshare owners dissolve their unwanted timeshare contracts, legally and forever.
Go to Disney World. Listen, I love me some Disney. I am totally convinced it's the happiest place on earth — except during spring break. Why spend all that money to go during the time of year when everyone else has the exact same idea? If you go just before or after spring break, you'll find shorter lines, happier kids and possibly a better deal.
Use a credit card. Seventy-four percent of Americans have gone into debt for a vacation, so when the Fourth of July rolls around, they're probably still paying off spring break. Like my dad, Dave Ramsey, always says, "The best vacations are the ones that don't follow you home." Putting a vacation on a credit card isn't a good option. Don't let our culture tell you that just because everyone else is doing it, you should too.
If you're planning to travel over spring break, there are plenty of ways to do it on a budget. I put together a Vacation Budget Worksheet to help you make a plan for your money so you can focus on enjoying your trip. This worksheet can also help you determine if taking a vacation really is within your budget. If you can't afford it this year, start saving up the cash and go on an amazing spring break next year. The beach will always be there.

Red Cross granted access to deliver aid in Venezuela

Texto completo: CARACAS, Venezuela - The Red Cross said Friday it had received permission from Venezuela's government and opposition to roll out one of the organization's biggest global relief campaigns, signaling a possible easing in the dire humanitarian emergency gripping the country.
The announcement amounted to the first tacit acknowledgment by the government of Nicolas Maduro that Venezuelans are suffering from lack of food and other basics.
In scale and ambition, the relief effort could become an "operation very similar to what is happening in Syria," Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told reporters in Caracas on Friday. "It obviously will not and cannot solve the country's problems, but it's a necessary step to save lives."
Maduro had repeatedly denied that the country needed help, even as the economy hurtled toward collapse. The crisis has led to an explosion of malnutrition and infant mortality, a resurgence of nearly eradicated diseases and the biggest refugee crisis in South America, as hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans fled.
The Red Cross said a diplomatic waiver granted by Maduro would allow it to begin delivery of medical supplies as soon as mid-April. The organization's local affiliate runs hospitals in Venezuela, but until now the organization has not been allowed to operate a national humanitarian aid-delivery campaign.
Now, the Red Cross will double its budget for Venezuela to an equivalent of at least $60 million this year, hoping to reach about 650,000 Venezuelans and stimulate a new wave of donations that would finance a further expansion of the campaign later in the year.
"We're open to all the donors," Rocca said. "We're ready to negotiate with everyone."
As Venezuela's economic travails have worsened over the past few months, both Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido have attempted to control supplies of aid for political advantage. Maduro and Guaido have been locked in a power struggle since Guaido proclaimed himself president with support of the United States and about 50 other countries in late January.
Maduro has used food distribution and access to medical care as tools to ensure his support among the needy population. His government stopped publishing any health statistics in 2016, while denying the country needed any aid.
"In Venezuela there's no humanitarian crisis," Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the United Nations in February.
Venezuela's aid predicament has mirrored the international alliances forged by the competing sides. The United States and the EU nations have become the main donors for humanitarian projects launched by Guaido. China and Russia have delivered relief supplies to Maduro.
Guaido has opened three aid depots on Venezuela's borders in Colombia, Brazil and Curacao, which have collected at least $100 million worth of supplies donated by the U.S. Agency for International Development and other allies. Maduro called the USAID supplies a "Trojan horse" aimed at toppling his government and has vowed to prevent them from entering the country. His vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, even called the opposition's supplies "cancerous."
Guaid�'s plan to bring basic supplies into Venezuela in February, intended to help the population but also to bolster his standing and discredit Maduro, was stymied by Maduro's armed forces and paramilitaries. At least seven people were killed and dozens were seriously injured during the chaotic and inconclusive standoff along the country's border.
The Red Cross said its relief in Venezuela will not be linked to any political parties.
The Red Cross was granted the permission after personal meetings with Maduro and Guaid�, said a person involved in negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss confidential talks.

Break up Big Tech and all monopolies

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) put her habit of mincing no words in policy discussions on display a few weeks ago when she released a proposal to "break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook."
This was a courageous move on several levels. First, the big tech companies long have been assumed to be natural allies of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, the presidential nomination of which Warren has been seeking. Nevertheless, she brought her plan to the SXSW Conference, an annual high-tech hoedown in Austin, Texas, showing that she wasn't afraid of fielding fastballs from those who might be most directly affected.
Warren outlined her proposal in terms that customers of the named companies are likely to understand.

"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy," she wrote. "They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation."
She's right; if anything, her proposal is too narrow. It should be applied not merely to tech platform companies with revenues of $25 billion of more, as she proposes, but to other monopolizing corporations that have consistently eroded freedom of choice and privacy protections, such as internet service providers.
The three companies she named -- and some she did not -- have grown too big and too quickly for U.S. government regulators to get their hands around their consequences for competition and innovation.
European regulators, who work with a different set of antitrust rules, don't seem to have the same problems. Last week, the European Union fined Google $1.7 billion for using its dominance in online search to force third-party websites to restrict ads for Google competitors. The action brought the total EU fines imposed on Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., to about $9.3 billion since 2017.
Thanks to their ownership structures, Facebook, Amazon and Google have been almost impervious to outside scrutiny in the U.S. Facebook's co-founder and Chairman Mark Zuckerberg controls 60% of shareholder votes thanks to a two-class share structure; Amazon.com founder and Chairman Jeff Bezos owns only 16.3% of its shares, but he's so closely identified with its success that it's almost inconceivable that the company would follow any course with which he disagreed.
That means that imposing regulatory discipline from outside is imperative to keep these companies from flouting the public interest.
Warren proposes to do so in two main ways. First, she would use existing antitrust authority to unwind mergers that the big companies have used to stifle competition. Among those she mentions are acquisitions by Amazon of the grocery chain Whole Foods, by Facebook of the social media firms Instagram and WhatsApp, and by Google of the advertising platform DoubleClick, the home appliance company Nest, and the traffic app Waze.
Warren's argument is that these takeovers gave the parent companies too much power to advantage their own products and services over competitors' offerings. They could do so thanks to their control of their "platforms," through which they attract consumers to their websites and extract personal data they can sell or otherwise exploit, typically without the full awareness of their users. These platforms include Amazon's online marketplace, Google search and Facebook's social network.
That leads to the second part of her plan, which is to designate the big platforms "platform utilities" and prohibit any company to own both a platform utility and a service using that platform. Amazon could own either its merchandise distribution platform or its online store, but not both; Google would have to spin off its search service and its advertising exchange.
The platforms, which are free to users but funded from ad sales or commissions from commercial transactions, could still carry advertising or charge transaction fees, Warren says; they would just have to do so in arm's-length arrangements.
Warren's plan quickly attracted a backlash from conservatives and pro-business pundits. "Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of users and consumers," declared Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review.
Lowry and other critics wrung their hands over how Warren's proposal would reduce the big companies' ability to drive innovation.
The truth is, however, that most innovation in Silicon Valley and the broader high-tech world comes from small start-ups, exactly the kinds of companies that struggle to reach the marketplace, in part because the big companies stand in their way to protect their own products and services.
That's also true of the activities of big internet service providers that have been permitted to acquire content companies, resulting in the Comcast-NBCUniversal and AT&T-Time Warner mergers. Signs that providers unaffiliated with ISPs face higher costs and other disadvantages reaching the public have proliferated.
On CNBC, New York Times business columnist James Stewart asserted that "there is nothing illegal about becoming a monopolist because you're so good at what you do that others can not compete with you." That's true, but Warren's point is that these companies have become monopolists by using their heft to disadvantage others that might have better ideas but can't reach the public with them.
Nor is there anything particularly novel about the principles Warren is expressing. "From Standard Oil to the railroads to AT&T, America has a long history of breaking up big conglomerates," she told me by email. "Back then, we recognized that ownership of a network and participating on the network caused a conflict of interest. My plan follows that same tradition."
Government-mandated breakups of large corporations aren't panaceas for what has ailed capitalism, but it's incorrect to dismiss them out of hand, as Stewart did.
The 1934 breakup of United Aircraft & Transport into United Airlines, Boeing and United Technologies arguably liberated the aircraft manufacturing and airline industries from anti-competitive conflicts of interest. The 1948 court order requiring the movie studios to divest their theater chain broadened the availability of films to the moviegoing public.
The best example is the court-ordered 1982 breakup of the AT&T monopoly into seven "Baby Bells," which launched a period of unparalleled innovation and price-cutting in telecommunications. Before then, AT&T had the power to control the design and distribution of telephones, to stifle the development of data networks such as the internet, and to profiteer from local and long-distance calls.
After the breakup, we got new phone technologies, cheaper phones, less-expensive calling plans, and vastly expanded data communications.
Stewart scoffed that the Baby Bells have just coalesced back together, so the effort was just a waste of time and money, but his take was both incorrect and irrelevant.
The spinoffs have reunited into not one but two companies, Verizon and the rechristened AT&T (formerly Southwestern Bell or SBC). In any case, that development is the result of lax antitrust enforcement after 1982, not of any flaws in the original breakup, the virtues of which long have been manifest. As it happens, Warren in her proposal points directly to the drawbacks of "weak antitrust enforcement," and she pledges to turn that around if she's elected.
The anti-competitive ills that Warren talks about are hardly mythical. In 2014, Amazon interfered for months with sales of books from Hachette Book Group, the owner of Little, Brown and other imprints, in a dispute over Amazon's pricing of online sales of Hachette books. In 2010, Amazon pulled books from Macmillan -- the owner of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, St. Martin's Press and other publishers -- in a dispute over e-book prices.
Facebook, for its part, managed to prove Warren's point about the excessive power of the big platforms by removing several ads her campaign had placed promoting her proposal.
"Curious why I think FB has too much power?" she promptly tweeted. "Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power."
Facebook restored the ads after its action was made public.

Texto completo: New York City Ballet, which has been going through its biggest upheaval in decades, said Friday that its next season would feature a mix of the new and the familiar -- including six world premieres, Balanchine classics and tributes to two icons of modern dance.
It will be City Ballet's first season under its new artistic director, Jonathan Stafford, and associate artistic director, Wendy Whelan, who were appointed last month to succeed the company's longtime leader Peter Martins, who retired last year while under investigation for abusive behavior. But the new season was planned before their appointments -- by Mr. Stafford and Justin Peck, City Ballet's resident choreographer and artistic adviser.
The company will dance new ballets by Edwaard Liang, Lauren Lovette, Mr. Peck, Alexei Ratmansky, Jamar Roberts and Pam Tanowitz. Returning Balanchine works will include "Jewels," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," "Union Jack," and, of course, "The Nutcracker." And the season will feature the full-length "Swan Lake" choreographed by Mr. Martins, who has denied the accusations against him, which a company investigation later called uncorroborated.
Here is a look at what dance critics from The New York Times are looking forward to next season, which will include 21 weeks of performances from Sept. 17 to May 31.
Lauren Lovette world premiere, Sept. 26
When Lauren Lovette choreographs, it's as if the steps in her body are in a race to see which ones can get out first: She's just that natural. Ms. Lovette, a City Ballet principal dancer, started making dances at the company-affiliated School of American Ballet; she has created two works -- spirited and fresh -- for the main company. She's musical, she knows her dancers and she deals with issues of the day. This one will have its debut at the fashion gala. Do I wish her premiere could stand on its own and not be part of that evening? Obviously. But she will make it work. GIA KOURLAS
Merce Cunningham's 'Summerspace,' Oct. 5
By bringing back this delicately beautiful, mind-opening 1958 work, which the company first performed in 1966 and hasn't danced since 2000, City Ballet doesn't just get in on the Cunningham centennial. It re-establishes a connection with Cunningham, the modern-dance innovator, who studied at the School of American Ballet. A chance to perceive the deep similarities and differences between his choreography and that of Balanchine will be good for the company's dancers and its audience, too. Next step: more Cunningham, please. BRIAN SEIBERT
Paul Taylor's solo in 'Episodes,' Feb. 6
When "Episodes" was created in 1959, it was like a meeting between great-power states. Half was choreographed by Martha Graham, half by Balanchine. The sections stayed separate, but as part of the exchange, Balanchine made a strange, pretzely solo for Paul Taylor, then a dancer in Graham's company. Soon, the Graham contribution was discarded, and Balanchine's half, without the Taylor solo, became a classic of the choreographer at his most radical and modern. When City Ballet reinserts the solo, as it hasn't done since 1989, it will be paying tribute to Taylor, who died last year. But it will also be re-examining its past in ways that might prove useful in the present. BRIAN SEIBERT
Justin Peck world premiere, Feb. 26
Justin Peck seems to have no trouble whipping up expansive, effervescent ballets that hum with the energy of youth. There have been breakthroughs -- works like "The Times Are Racing" (2017) that catapult the genre forward -- and, as with any artist, moments of stasis, like this year's pretty but predictable "Principia." What will happen next? With Mr. Peck, City Ballet's resident choreographer, it's always worth finding out. For the winter season, he unveils a new work with a commissioned score by the contemporary classical composer and frequent ballet collaborator Nico Muhly. SIOBHAN BURKE
Pam Tanowitz world premiere, April 24
For years, Pam Tanowitz has seemed like an obvious fit for City Ballet: a choreographer who at once honors and stretches the classical ballet vocabulary, forever mining the form for fresh, surprising possibilities. While her first work for the company, coming this spring, builds on a piece she started with other dancers, her 2020 premiere will be her first created fully for members of City Ballet. Whatever she ends up making, this long-overdue partnership is cause for celebration. SIOBHAN BURKE
Jamar Roberts world premiere, May 7
It's always good to have an outlier in the mix, and Jamar Roberts, a much-admired member of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, is just that. He's still new to choreography, but after his 2017 work for Ailey, "Members Don't Get Weary," a powerful, contemporary work about overcoming the blues set to music by John Coltrane, he showed off both his musicality and his ability to move large groups of dancers. At City Ballet, where dancers sing with their feet, that's key. GIA KOURLAS

More parents in admissions scandal appear in court in Boston

Texto completo: William McGlashan Jr., a high-powered Silicon Valley investor accused of illegally scheming to get his son into college, had a request.
The magistrate judge had ordered that McGlashan, along with more than a dozen other wealthy parents implicated in the college admissions scandal, not leave the country except for business. But in Boston's federal court Friday, McGlashan's lawyer asked the judge to make an exception so McGlashan could go on a long-planned family vacation to Mexico.
Assistant US Attorney Eric Rosen was not sympathetic. McGlashan had other suitable vacation options within the United States, he said.
“He has a home in Big Sky, Mont., worth $12 million," Rosen said. “He has a home in Truckee, Calif., that is also worth a lot of money."
Rosen's reference to McGlashan's real estate portfolio was a pointed reminder of the extraordinary wealth enjoyed by the 15 parents who filed through the courthouse Friday for their initial appearances in the high-profile case that accuses them of trying to boost their children's chances of getting into elite schools by paying fake test-takers or falsely certifying their children as top-level athletes.
They all stand accused of one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for allegedly participating in a scheme to pay a college consultant, William “Rick Singer, to create fake profiles for their children as athletic recruits, facilitate cheating on SAT and ACT exams, or outright bribe college coaches.
McGlashan, 55, is accused of paying $50,000 to have his son's ACT admission test score doctored and discussing another $250,000 payment to have a fake athletic profile created for submission to the University of Southern California.
He followed defendants like Elisabeth Kimmel, 54, who amassed a fortune of $325 million in 2017 when she sold a slew of television and radio stations her family once owned; Agustin Huneeus Jr., the 53-year-old owner of vineyards in Napa Valley; and Gamal Abdelaziz, 62, the former president and chief operating officer of Wynn Resorts Development. Abdelaziz, who is accused of paying Singer $300,000 to create a fake profile for his daughter to secure her admission to USC as a basketball recruit, played a key role in the development of a hotel and casino in Everett.
None of the defendants spoke to reporters after their proceedings in court, where they were told not to keep weapons in their homes, and to avoid marijuana use and talking about the case with any family members because they may be called as witnesses at trial.
The defendants showed little emotion in the courtroom and answered Federal Magistrate Judge Mary Page Kelley when she asked them if they understood their rights and conditions of release.
Some defendants tried to downplay their wealth. Thomas H. Bienert Jr., one of the defense attorneys, said the media had been misrepresenting his client, Michelle Janavs, the 48-year-old heiress to the Hot Pockets fortune. Janavs allegedly paid $100,000 to falsify her daughter's ACT exam score and get her into USC as a volleyball recruit, even though she did not play the sport competitively.
“My client has been a homemaker and volunteer for the last 20 years and she has not been an executive at a food company," said Bienert, as Janavs, whose family owns Chef America, sat ramrod straight at the defense table.
Abdelaziz asked if he could be allowed to travel internationally for work, specifically a business trip to Mexico in April, a request the prosecution opposed.
“We want to point out to your honor that he faces a substantial amount of time in this case," said Assistant US Attorney Justin O'Connell, noting that under federal sentencing guidelines Abdelaziz could be sentenced to 30 to 37 months if convicted, far more than the 21 months other defendants could receive. He would face a stiffer penalty because of the amount of his alleged bribe.
“The weight of the evidence against Mr. Abdelaziz is quite strong" O'Connell said.
Abdelaziz's lawyer, Brian T. Kelly, scoffed at that argument, saying the evidence is based on Singer, who admitted to obstruction of justice and is now a government informant.
Kelly described Singer as “deeply compromised."
“This is not a strong case," Kelly said. Abdelaziz is “not running from this case. He intends to fight this case."
Kelley approved the request but cautioned Abdelaziz to keep his work travel limited. He nodded gratefully.
McGlashan's lawyer, Jack Pirozzolo, was less successful arguing that his client be allowed to leave the country.
The point of the bail statute is “really all about risk of flight," he said. “It's not meant to be punitive. There is really no other effect of this denial of the ability to go on this vacation other than punitive."
Kelley disagreed.
“I don't think the risk of flight is zero," she said. “I'm sorry to disappoint the family, but I'm not going to allow the vacation."
Other defendants who appeared Friday include: I-Hsin “Joey" Chen 64, of Newport Beach, Calif., who operates a warehousing provider for the shipping industry; Robert Flaxman, 62, of Laguna Beach, Calif., a real estate developer; Diane Blake, 55, of San Francisco, an executive at a retail merchandising firm, and her husband Todd Blake, 53, an entrepreneur and investor; Marjorie Klapper, 50, of Menlo Park, Calif., the co-owner of a jewelry business; Marci Palatella, 63, of Healdsburg, Calif., CEO of a liquor distribution company; Robert Zangrillo, 52, of Miami, founder and CEO of a private investment firm; Gregory Abbott, 68, a food and beverage packaging titan from Manhattan and Aspen, Colo., and his wife, Marcia Abbott, 59; and Stephen Semprevivo, an executive at Cydcor, a company in Agoura Hills, Calif., which provides outsourced sales services.
Huneeus, the vintner, allegedly paid Singer to facilitate cheating on his daughter's SAT and to have her falsely certified as a water polo recruit at USC, which extended a conditional acceptance letter to her in November 2018, records show.
But during the process, Huneeus voiced concern about the deal coming to light, records show. During one call, Huneeus asked Singer, “And is there any risk that this thing blows up in my face?"
Singer replied, “Hasn't in 24 years."

Texto completo: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg had a good week.
Call it the "Buttigieg bump" or whatever you want, but the presidential hopeful jumped in two polls and is now tied with Sen. Elizabeth Warren in a third released Thursday.
And to cap things off, he was the focus of a fawning six-minute segment Wednesday on "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah."
The latest poll, by Quinnipiac University, shows Buttigieg is the top choice for 4 percent of Democrats surveyed – his highest placement of any national poll to date. In a survey of 559 Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters, Buttigieg was behind by four people in a crowded field: Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Kamala Harris. He tied with Warren.
The margin of error for the March 21-25 poll was 5.1 percentage points.
This past weekend, Buttigieg made headlines for major gains in an Emerson Iowa Poll, showing he had the support of 11 percent of Democrats surveyed, just behind Sanders and Biden.
The poll was good news for Buttigieg, but it had a small sample size, just 249 respondents, and a relatively wide margin of error, plus or minus 6.2 percent. Plus, many of those who took the poll were presented with Buttigieg's name first, instead of the candidates being randomized.
Morning Consult, which releases weekly national polling involving people in the Democratic presidential conversation, had Buttigieg on Tuesday as the choice for president among 2 percent of 13,725 registered voters nationwide who indicate they may vote in the Democratic primary or caucus, a slight increase from the week before. Also, his name recognition in that poll rose 9 percentage points. That poll's margin of error was plus or minus 1 percent.
On Wednesday night's "Daily Show" piece on Buttigieg – he didn't appear on the segment – Noah gave an overview of his biography, his background as an openly gay mayor, war veteran and millennial who speaks Norwegian and several other foreign languages. It also devoted considerable time to the pronunciation of his name.
Buttigieg's climb within the Democratic presidential crowd also is reflected in his fundraising. In the 24 hours after his CNN town hall earlier this month, he raised about $600,000, and days later, he met the donation threshold to be invited to the June Democratic debate.
He's also continued to generate Google search interest and on Thursday morning tweeted that his book made it back on The New York Times best sellers list.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
ALBANY -- A debate over Albany's ingrained culture of shadowy fund-raising has erupted into open warfare among the state's Democrats, with three recently elected lawmakers accusing Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of hypocrisy and pay-to-play tactics, and the governor's senior adviser in turn calling them "idiots," preceded by a vulgarity.
The intraparty hostility exploded just days before the state's April 1 budget deadline, with lobbyists and special interests racing to ensure that their priorities are included in a spending plan expected to exceed $170 billion.
The flare-up began on Wednesday evening, when the three lawmakers held an impromptu news conference in a Capitol hallway. Senators Alessandra Biaggi and Jessica Ramos, who took office last year by defeating powerful Democratic incumbents, and Yuh-Line Niou, a second-term assemblywoman, said they were outraged by a New York Times article that detailed a mid-March fund-raiser by Mr. Cuomo where entry for a couple cost $25,000.
The article, published hours before the women's news conference, described how lobbyists and business executives flocked to the event at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan for face time with him as well with as his budget director, Robert Mujica, who oversees the budget negotiation process.
During the news conference, Ms. Biaggi called the fund-raiser, which was not advertised on the governor's public schedule, "exactly what we have come to Albany to change."
"Show me another example at another state where there is a governor, during the budget process, raising $25,000 a ticket," she said.
The women, who share an apartment and have formed an informal coalition of progressive young lawmakers, said the article proved the need for a public financing system for campaigns -- a system that Mr. Cuomo has also championed.
But Ms. Biaggi said that for Mr. Cuomo to make that call while hosting such events was "hypocritical."
"It is impossible to say a $25,000 ticket is not influencing the decisions," she said.

Mr. Cuomo's office quickly fired back. Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, walked through the Capitol's press office excoriating the three legislators as "[expletive] idiots." When a reporter asked if that comment was on the record, Mr. Azzopardi did not hesitate. "Yeah."
He pointed out that Ms. Ramos herself had hosted a fund-raiser in Albany on March 6, for between $250 and $5,000 per person. Melissa DeRosa, the governor's top aide, used Twitter on Thursday to accuse Ms. Biaggi of lying when she said she had not held any fund-raisers during the budget season, sharing an invitation to a fund-raiser for Ms. Biaggi on Feb. 28. Admission ranged from $250 to $2,500.
"Hypocrisy is one thing," Ms. DeRosa wrote. "Willful lying is another."
During the news conference, Ms. Ramos acknowledged holding her own fund-raiser, but said she had returned contributions from people whose political beliefs did not align with hers. She also said that she would support a ban on fund-raisers during the budget season, but that she would operate under the current rules until then.
Mr. Cuomo has defended his fund-raising methods similarly, saying that he would "live within the campaign finance system" until it was changed.
Ms. Biaggi replied to Ms. DeRosa on Twitter by noting that she had not held a fund-raiser in the capital -- the February fund-raiser was in New York City -- and that she would "never have a fund-raiser during budget."
Budget season is not clearly defined in Albany: Mr. Cuomo delivered his budget address on Jan. 15, and the budget is due on April 1. In between, both legislative chambers release budget proposals and negotiate furiously for their own ends.
The Senate Democrats' campaign committee has been actively raising money over the past few months, too: On Wednesday, just before the lawmakers' news conference, the committee sent supporters an invitation to a "spring reception" on April 18. The reception would be hosted by the Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and the requested donations ranged from $1,000 to $25,000.
A "labor breakfast" on March 5 had asked for the same amounts, as did a "winter reception" on Jan. 22.
While Mr. Cuomo's press team has earned a reputation for aggression, some political observers said the tenor of the response to the women's remarks stood out.
"I don't remember the last time I've seen anything on the record from the press office using such vulgar, disrespectful language about men, let alone other elected officials," said Erica Vladimer, a former legislative aide who has been outspoken against sexual harassment in Albany.
The governor's office denied the charge of sexism.
"These lawmakers criticized the governor for having a fund-raiser while they themselves did the exact same thing," Dani Lever, Mr. Cuomo's communications director, said. "That hypocrisy was pointed out, and just because those lawmakers are female doesn't mean they should be shielded from that. Making this a sexist issue cheapens actual sexism."
The month before the budget deadline is by far the busiest period of the legislative session for fund-raisers: In March 2018, lawmakers held at least 77 such events, more than double the number held in the next busiest month, according to data compiled by the New York Public Interest Research Group, a government reform organization.
At least 29 other states prohibit lobbyists or their clients from making campaign contributions during the legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Yet in New York, a bill to ban fund-raisers during the session has foundered for nearly two decades.
Carl E. Heastie, the Assembly speaker, said he did not believe Mr. Cuomo's fund-raiser, or any budget-time fund-raiser, was inappropriate. He has also expressed skepticism about the feasibility of public financing.
"We should really just be trying to work together at this point, not point fingers, not try to say that everything in this business is corruptive and corrupted," he said.
Legislative leaders reinforced that message privately. On Thursday, Senate leaders asked their members during a meeting to be strategic about their tactics before the budget; the day before, less than 15 minutes after the women's news conference had concluded, Mr. Heastie pulled Ms. Niou aside.
Mr. Heastie on Thursday told reporters that his conversation with Ms. Niou "went fine," as he stressed the importance for lawmakers to remain collegial with one another.
"I think that also brings a negative view to our constituents, if we're always saying that every single thing that motivates us is being done because of some corruptive motive," Mr. Heastie added. "I think it's a problem."

Texto completo: Goldstein Charges Consolidated
ARI GOLDSTEIN, the former president of Temple University's banished Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity chapter, will face two sets of sexual assault charges in one trial on June 4, The Temple News reported.
In a March 14 pretrial hearing, Assistant District Attorney Lauren Stram said the two cases should be consolidated because the two complainants were both students at Temple, were about the same age and the circumstances were similar.
In the first case, which stems from February of 2018, the complainant alleges that Goldstein locked her in his bedroom at the fraternity house, pinned her down and tried to force sexual activity on her before she managed to kick him and run away.
The second complainant alleges that, in November of 2017, she went to Goldstein's bedroom. The two began to have intercourse, but it became aggressive. She alleges that he also forced her to perform a sex act on him and that she eventually was able to push herself away and run out of the room.
Jewish Philanthropy Leader Faces Several Sexual Harassment Allegations
Billionaire Jewish philanthropist Michael H. Steinhardt was accused by several women in a March 21 New York Times article of sexual harassment when they were seeking his support.
Women at Hillel International, Birthright Israel and other organizations described incidents where Steinhardt made repeated sexual comments and requests.
Steinhardt declined to be interviewed, but did issue a statement.
"In my nearly 80 years on Earth, I have never tried to touch any woman or man inappropriately," he said. Provocative comments, he said, "were part of my schtick since before I had a penny to my name, and I unequivocally meant them in jest. I fully understand why they were inappropriate. I am sorry."
This is not the first time Steinhardt has been accused of harassment. The Jewish Week reported in September that Hillel was investigating him for "inappropriate sexual remarks" that dated to 2011.
Tree of Life Raises $40,000 for New Zealand Shooting Victims
The Tree of Life*Or L'Simcha synagogue in Pittsburgh - victimized in October with its own shooting that left 11 worshippers dead - raised more than $40,000 to support victims of the Christchurch, New Zealand mosque shootings, JTA reported.
The shootings on March 16 left 50 Muslim worshippers dead and least 20 injured.
"We feel compelled to come to the aid of those communities, just as our Jewish community was so compassionately supported only a few short months ago by people around the world of many faiths," the synagogue wrote on its GoFundMe page.
High School Athletic Director Calls Hitler a 'Good Leader,' Apologies Follow
Joe Piro, athletic director of Nutley High School in Nutley, New Jersey, referred to Adolf Hitler as a "good leader" during a March 16 presentation at Madison High School in Madison, New Jersey, prompting an apology letter the next day from Madison Superintendent Mark Schwartz, the New York Post reported.
"It is the position of the Madison High School District that the inclusion of Adolf Hitler had no place in the context of an assembly intended to promote unity and character," Schwarz wrote.
Piro made a statement to NorthJersey.com in apology.
"My intentions during the presentation were to make a point that a leader could have strong leadership skills and influence people in a negative way," he said. *

Texto completo: MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace is divorcing her husband of 14 years and is dating New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, a regular on her afternoon show.

Schmidt, a 35-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, has broken numerous stories about Russian interference in the 2016 elections and other topics. Schmidt and Wallace, 47, decided they had to disclose their relationship to the network, according to The New York Post.

Wallace and Schmidt were seen together at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas earlier this month.

Wallace joined MSNBC and NBC News after a career in Republican politics. In 2005 she married Mark Wallace, who helped manage former President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election win, and was subsequently named U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Nicolle Wallace served as White House communications director under Bush. She was later a senior adviser in the late Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid.

The pair have a six-year-old son. Friends say they have been separated for at least a year.

Nicolle Wallace served as a co-host of "The View" for a year, through August 2015.

Nicolle and Mark Wallace were featured in the 2012 HBO political drama "Game Change," adapted from the best-selling book. Sarah Paulson played Nicolle Wallace and Mark was portrayed by Ron Livingston. The Nicolle Wallace sections of the film focused on her creeping disaffection with McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.

Las decisiones de Emma Coronel que sorprendieron a “propios y extraños”

Texto completo: Emma Coronel , esposa de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , sigue causando curiosidad entre periodistas, autoridades y analistas de los cárteles en México, ya que hasta ahora es la única esposa de un alto líder del narco mexicano que ha sobresalido por su belleza, estilo y una personalidad fuerte, que deja incluso ver poco de lo que realmente piensa o siente.
Varios perfiles hechos en diarios como el New York Times, L.A. Times, El País, Rolling Stone, incluso en este periódico, revelan sólo una parte de lo que Coronel quiso mostrar en público. Su primera entrevista a un medio de alta cobertura como Telemundo fue retomada por periodicos y televisoras en inglés y español en Estados Unidos. Había nacido formalmente la “Kardashian de Sinaloa” .
Entre los aspectos que sorprendieron de la exreina de belleza fue su fortaleza para acudir a prácticamente a todo el juicio en la Corte de Brooklyn, siempre con una sonrisa para quienes se sentaban alrededor de ella, pero con un rostro serio, casi inmutable frente las fuertes narraciones de asesinatos y trasiego de droga que testigos relataban.
“Creo que Emma y El Chapo hicieron algún show para los medios (durante el juicio) “, dice Anabel Hernández , periodista mexicana autora del libro Narcoland: Los narcotraficantes mexicanos y sus padrinos. “Pero Emma sabe perfectamente cómo es ‘El Chapo'” .
La experta en narcotrafico mexicano dijo a Rolling Stone que la razón de que Coronel no se impresionara con algunos testimonios, incluso el Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López, la “Chapodiputada” –una de las examantes de su esposo– es que ella sabía todo con antelación.
“Estoy segura de que el testimonio para ella no fue una sorpresa” , consideró.
Coronel también desató polémica al afirmar que admiraba y amaba a su esposo, a pesar de todos los crímenes de los que se le acusa.
“No conozco a mi esposo como la persona que están tratando de mostrar” , dijo Coronel al Times. “Lo admiro como el ser humano que conocí y con el que me casé”.
La esposa del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa –que nació en los Estados Unidos– también asombró por el amor hacia sus gemelas de 7 años de edad, a quienes llevó en tres ocasiones al juicio, pero después decidió no hacerlo más.
“Ella realmente se preocupa por sus hijas. Por los comentarios que hace, creo que realmente se preocupa por ellas”, dice Hernández.
El día en que el exsocio de Guzmán Loera, Dámaso López Núñez, alias “El Lic” , afirmó que Coronel ayudó a la segunda fuga de su esposo, ella ni se inmutó. Volvió a sorprender, como cuando fue detenida en Mazatlán con sus hijas y su marido. Historia relatada a detalla por un exagente de la DEA.
Hernández cree que esa ocasión ella quería enviar el mensaje de que estaba “en peligro”, por eso se le vio vulnerable.
“El mensaje fue que su vida estaba en peligro” , dice Hernández. “Si ella estaba siendo sincera o no, no lo sé… solo puedo decirte, para mí como periodista, ese era el mensaje que quería enviar”.
Es incierto si hay o no amor en entre Guzmán Loera y Coronel, pero él confía mucho en ella y ella muestra confianza en él.
“Lo que he aprendido a lo largo de todo este tiempo, en estos años, en los contactos con Emma y familiares de ‘El Chapo’, es que él tiene mucha confianza en ella. Él realmente confía en ella “, dice Hernández. “Y ella es la única esposa, la única mujer (en su vida) que quiere hablar de él, que trata de defenderlo”.

Texto completo: Haya Konte, una madre inmigrante de El Bronx (NYC) cuyas dos hijas infantes murieron en el incendio de su apartamento, llegó a un acuerdo de culpabilidad de homicidio por negligencia criminal, optando por irse del país para evitar la cárcel.
No había detectores de humo en funcionamiento en el apartamento y el fuego fue causado por la quema de incienso mientras Konte (29) lavaba la ropa afuera, en abril de 2016, según los bomberos.
Konte, que estaba embarazada en ese momento, dijo que pensaba que un compañero de residencia estaba en casa cuando cruzó la calle para lavar la ropa.
El acuerdo de culpabilidad fue acordado con su ex esposo, el padre de las niñas fallecidas de 2 años y 18 meses de edad, dijeron las autoridades.
Su tercer hijo, una bebé de 2 años, estuvo en el tribunal ayer, cuando el Fiscal Auxiliar de Distrito Morgan Dolan pidió que se impusiera la sentencia aprobada por el padre “de las dos niñas que murieron como resultado de la acción de la señora Konte”, citó New York Post.
Nacida en Francia y criada en Gambia, Konte no se convirtió en ciudadana estadounidense, a pesar de que su entonces esposo sí lo era.
El mes pasado le dijo a The New York Times que no sabía a qué país se iría con su bebé.

Texto completo: THE PERSONALITIES
Faces Along the Way
By Jay Schreiber
CASEY STENGEL
He wore the uniform of the Brooklyn Dodgers, the New York Giants, the Yankees and the Mets. Although he was often depicted as engaging in "Stengelese," Robert Lipsyte, who covered the early Mets for The Times, said that was nonsense. "His hourslong monologues made perfect sense," he wrote. And if you listened, you would hear the always quotable, always clever Stengel advise young players to "get in shape now, you can drink during the season," and proclaim after another loss that "the attendance got robbed." In every way, Lipsyte said, Stengel was the Mets' leading man.
'MARVELOUS MARV' THRONEBERRY
His real name was Marvin Eugene Throneberry, which meant his initials spelled MET. Originally a Yankee, he joined the Mets in May 1962 and, in the spirit of things, immediately started tripping over himself. His crowning moment came in a game in June when, playing first base, he was called for interference in the top of the first and then, in the bottom of the inning, failed to touch first and second base after hitting a triple. When a teammate, Charlie Neal, followed with a home run, Stengel came out of the dugout and pointed at each base for Neal's benefit.
JIMMY BRESLIN
Long before he won the Pulitzer Prize for his newspaper columns, Breslin wrote a slim, engaging account of the 1962 Mets, "Can't Anybody Here Play This Game?" From Breslin's gleefully subversive point of view, the Mets were nothing less than great comedy, as good as Bert Lahr in "The Wizard of Oz" or the Marx Brothers in "Room Service." "Take any day, any town, any inning," Breslin wrote of the season. "With the Mets, nothing changed, only the pages on the calendar. It was all one wonderful mistake." Before long, Breslin's book became a byword for the Mets. They had, with his help, become even more amusing.
THE UPRISING
"The Mets Is Coming," declared one of the banners that Mets fans brought to the Bronx -- although not into the stadium -- on the night of June 20, 1963, for the first Mayor's Trophy game. It was a matchup of the worst team in baseball and the mighty Yankees. The banner may not have made it inside Yankee Stadium but tens of thousands of Mets fans did. Amazingly, the Mets won, 6-2, although, to be fair, the Yankees had played a regular-season game earlier that day. Still, as Robert Lipsyte wrote in The Times afterward: "A frightened man told his foreman to shut up, a beaten dog bit a cruel master. The long shot came home and beautiful, blue-eyed tomorrow finally arrived."
JOAN PAYSON
She was a wealthy society matron who was at home at the racetrack and at the ballpark, and in 1962 she became the first owner of the Mets. She had been a minority stockholder in the New York Giants, and had even tried to block their move to San Francisco. That didn't work, but then along came the Mets, a team whose games she would sometimes follow at the track with a transistor radio stuck to her ear. Despite all her money, she was, said the writer Frank Sullivan, "a simple, generous woman with no swank." And all her considerable patience was ultimately rewarded with a championship.
DUKE SNIDER
The Mets had begun their existence with a lot of players who were near the end of their careers. So it was hardly surprising that Snider, a Brooklyn hero who had gone to Los Angeles with the rest of the Dodgers, was back in 1963 as a Met. In Brooklyn, he had been a graceful center fielder, famous for sharing that position in New York with Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle. In 1963, at age 36, he usually played right field or left. And as a Met, he hit 14 homers, batted .243 and then went to San Francisco for the 1964 season, where he ended his career amid a lot less losing.
THE BANNERS
The original bedsheet banners that popped up at the Polo Grounds in 1962 and 1963 essentially came out of nowhere. There was no internet to organize the effort; no publicity campaign by the Mets to get things going. Instead, there were just banners, some of them pretty clever. But soon enough, the Mets tried to put a more respectable gloss on the phenomenon by creating an annual Banner Day. And for years at Shea Stadium, it proved to be a popular event, even if the banners tended to be a little more cute (see above, 1965) and a little less irreverent than the originals.
YOGI BERRA
As a Yankee, he won 10 championships and three Most Valuable Player awards before retiring in 1963. A year later, the Yankees fired him after just one season as their manager. And by the following May, Berra, about to turn 40, was back in uniform, for the Mets, but as a catcher and pinch-hitter. The Berra experiment did not last long. Four games, including two behind the plate. Nine at-bats. Two singles. At that point, Berra proclaimed himself "an old man" and retired again. But 1969 would bring him his 11th championship, as the Mets' first-base coach.
GIL HODGES
He was a fixture at first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1950s, and the ball landed in his glove for the last out of the 1955 World Series, the only time those Dodgers won it all. He finished his playing career with the Mets, in 1962 and 1963, and by 1968 he was managing them, his powerful physical presence allowing him to convey a quiet, unbreakable authority. George Vecsey, a longtime sports columnist for The New York Times, said he came to think of Hodges "as one of the most decent, straight, strong-minded managers I ever met." It was a strength that "made you listen," said Tom Seaver, and it would propel the Mets in 1969.
ED CHARLES
At 36, Charles was the elder statesman of the 1969 Mets, a team with many key players in their mid-20s. The team's part-time third baseman and sometime poet, Charles grew up in the segregated South of the 1930s and '40s and as a teenager he drew inspiration from spotting Jackie Robinson in spring training. He once even ran after a train on which Robinson was riding with his Dodger teammates. Charles hit only .207 in 1969, but he started the winning rally in Game 2 of the World Series. And at the Mets' victory parade, he read a poem he had written while stuck in the minor leagues.
DONN CLENDENON
He joined the Mets in June 1969 in a trade with the Montreal Expos and represented the only significant pickup the Mets would make during the season. He turned 34 a month later, making him the second-oldest player on the team. Like Charles, a fellow African-American, he became a veteran leader on a team that was mostly white. Tall and powerful, Clendenon became part of the four platoons that Manager Gil Hodges used daily. He played first base against left-handed pitchers; Ed Kranepool played against righties. And it was Clendenon, who later earned a law degree, who became a huge factor in the World Series.
ERNIE BANKS
He was born in 1931, played for the same Negro league team that Jackie Robinson did and in 1953 became the first African-American player on the Chicago Cubs. In the years that followed, Banks became one of the best and most popular players in the game, first as the Cubs' power-hitting shortstop and later as the team's first baseman. He also became known as Mr. Cub, the optimist who endured one losing season after another and still hoped for better. And 1969 seemed to be that season, the one that would get him to his first World Series. It didn't happen.
LEO DUROCHER
In 1948, Durocher was the colorful, controversial manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers and Gil Hodges was his rookie first baseman. But by July of that year, Durocher had left Brooklyn to become the manager of the Giants. After that, it was in the caldron of Dodgers vs. Giants that Hodges and Durocher sized each other up. In 1969 they were squaring off again, Durocher managing the Cubs, Hodges running the Mets; Durocher still fiery and quotable, Hodges just the opposite. But Hodges got the last word when the Mets beat out the Cubs.
RALPH HOUK
And what were the Yankees up to in 1969? What were they up to while the Mets pulled off one of the great reversals of all time? The answer is nothing much. The Yankees went 80-81, continuing a decline that came out of nowhere in 1965. The manager was Ralph Houk, in his second stint in that role. In his first, he had led the Yankees to World Series titles in 1961 and 1962. But in '69 the Yankees weren't winning. The best player on the team was Mel Stottlemyre, who went 20-14. Notable teammates included Gene Michael, Joe Pepitone, Horace Clarke and Bobby Murcer. All of them were overshadowed by the events in Queens.
THE BLACK CAT
The cat showed up uninvited, strolling right into the middle of a crucial Mets-Cubs game at Shea Stadium on Sept. 9, 1969. More precisely, it chose the top of the fourth to make its appearance, walking behind Cubs third baseman Ron Santo, who was in the on-deck circle, and then parading past the Cubs' dugout. At the time, the Cubs were losing, 2-0, and the Mets had Tom Seaver on the mound. A black cat was not what the Cubs needed. In the end, the Cubs did get a run that inning, but that was it. The Mets won, 7-1, and moved to half a game behind the Cubs in the standings. The cat disappeared, its work done.
KARL EHRHARDT
He was the Mets' Sign Man, the guy with the degree in design art from Pratt Institute who, from his seat at Shea Stadium, would hold up preprinted placards throughout the game to comment on the action. He was, in effect, picking up where all the fans' bedsheet banners left off. A banner hung from a railing and stayed there. But Ehrhardt, with his bag of 20-by-26-inch placards by his side, could go with the flow as the game proceeded. He said he liked to anticipate what might happen in a game by studying beforehand. He began holding up his signs when Shea opened. Five years, and a lot of bad baseball later, he, too, made it to the postseason.
HANK AARON
The Mets confronted one future Hall of Famer after another on their way to the championship in 1969, but not one was better than Atlanta's Hank Aaron, the Braves' slugger and right fielder. And in the three-game National League Championship Series against the Mets, the 35-year-old Aaron was superb: three home runs and two doubles in 14 at-bats. But all of his heroics at the plate couldn't bring the Braves a single victory against a Mets team that normally relied on pitching, but simply outhit Atlanta in the N.L.C.S. Afterward, Aaron called the Mets "amazing." Casey Stengel had often called the Mets that, too, but with a big wink. Aaron was serious.
TUG McGRAW
The ebullient left-hander was the busiest member of the Mets' bullpen in 1969, throwing 100⅓ innings while compiling a 9-3 record and a 2.24 E.R.A. while picking up 12 saves. And yet he never got to pitch in the World Series, when the Mets used only six pitchers from start to finish. McGraw did, however, appear in Game 2 of the N.L.C.S., throwing three scoreless innings to close out an 11-6 victory for the Mets. And in the bottom of the ninth of that game, after the first two Braves hitters reached base, McGraw struck out Hank Aaron looking.

AG reaches settlement in labor rights case — on an issue that figured into Ellison’s decision to run for the office

Texto completo: It was among the first questions he was asked after he decided to give up a safe seat in the U.S. House of Representative to enter a contested primary for Minnesota attorney general.
Why?
After all, Keith Ellison was a 12-year member of Congress from Minneapolis whose party was on the verge of regaining majority control of the U.S. House. He could well have been a committee chair after being in the political minority for years. Why give that up for an uncertain campaign for statewide elected office? His answer was always the same: poaching.
In Congress, Ellison had introduced a bill to make it illegal for fast-food companies and other chain retailers from having agreements that block one franchisee from hiring workers from another franchisee. Reducing workers’ mobility by not competing for employees, Ellison said, made it easier for those companies keep wages down.
But the bill was going nowhere. It hadn’t been scheduled for a hearing and likely wouldn’t be for some time, if ever. And yet, while his bill languished in Washington, attorneys general in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts began investigation fast-food companies, eventually winning settlements to end the practice of poaching.
That, Ellison said, showed the difference between what you could do as one of 435 members in the U.S. House of Representatives and what you could do as a state attorney general.
Elllison, of course, went on to win the election, and was sworn in as AG in January. And earlier this month, he was able to make an announcement that harkened back to his original rationale for running for the job in the first place: His office had reached a settlement with four fast-food companies regarding anti-poaching requirements for franchisees.
The agreement covers Dunkin’, Arby’s, Five Guys and Little Caesars, and stems from investigations begun by the state of Massachusetts last summer, which Minnesota and 12 other states later joined. Under terms of the agreement, the franchising companies have agreed to stop including no-poaching requirements in their agreements with franchisees, which stopped the franchisees from hiring workers from other fast-food chains. The agreement also requires the companies to stop including such language in future agreements and to post signs in workplaces to let employees know of the settlement and their right to apply elsewhere.
Even with historic low unemployment rates in the U.S., wages have not increased as economists would expect. “How come they don’t? Well because of stuff like no-poaching agreements,” Ellison said Tuesday. “A lot of little things that employers get to do that they’re not called on add up to stagnant wages for working people.”
Ellison said there is more he wants to do on that front, including addressing noncompete clauses for workers without especially rare skills or who don’t possess trade secrets. “They restrict people from being able to compete in the labor market,” Ellison said. “I don’t think our economy does best with a low-wage model.”
The existence of such clauses in franchise agreements — and their effect on wages — came to light in a 2017 New York Times article, which was in turn based on the work of economist Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisors in the Obama Administration. Krueger died last week.
Under the anti-poaching agreement, the fast food companies must notify the attorneys general if one of their franchisees tries to restrict any employee from moving to another restaurant and are subject to penalties of up to $100,000 for breaches of the settlements.
In addition to Minnesota, the states of California, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont, and the District of Columbia are parties to the settlement.

Upward Mobility: Culture Explains Asians' Educational Success

Texto completo: New York City's most selective public high schools released demographic data last week on students who were offered admission to the 2019 fall freshman class. The results were as predictable as the subsequent griping.
These eight schools admit kids based on a single standardized exam, and again Asian students, who comprise only 16.1% of the city's public school system, were awarded a majority of the openings, 51.1%. By comparison, whites, who are 15% of public-school students, and blacks, who are 26%, were offered 28.5% and 4% of the seats, respectively. At Stuyvesant High, the most selective school, a mere seven of the 895 seats were offered to black students. In recent years, Asians who attend Stuyvesant and the city's other two super-elite high schools, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech, have regularly outnumbered their white peers by 2 to 1.
Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to scrap the admissions test to achieve more racial balance in the classroom. He has decried the outcomes as evidence of "massive segregation." The Washington Post's education writer likened the low black acceptance rates at New York's top schools to the recently exposed college bribery scandal, calling it "an admissions scandal of a different sort." Apparently, when black students demonstrate academic excellence, it's celebrated. When Asian students do so, it's scandalous.
The notion that these schools aren't diverse enough tells you something about the politicization of terms like "diversity." Asians not only enrich these schools racially and ethnically but also bring economic diversity. The Manhattan Institute's Kay Hymowitz has reported in City Journal that a disproportionate number of Asians admitted to these schools come from a low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn where Chinese immigrant parents "have crammed themselves into dorm-like quarters, working brutally long hours waiting tables, washing dishes, and cleaning hotel rooms."
The Asian student outcomes we see year after year aren't the result of luck or "privilege." They stem from hard work and a culture that prioritizes learning. Research shows that Asian kids read more books, watch less television, and study longer. In poorer families, money goes toward test-prep instead of $200 sneakers. The results are obvious at elite schools nationwide, where even low-income Asian students have outperformed middle- and upper-income students from other groups. "For Chinese immigrants," Ms. Hymowitz writes, "education for the next generation is close to a religion. It opens the path to a good life."
Mr. de Blasio wants to replace the exam with an admissions scheme that would reserve slots at the specialized high schools for the top 7% of graduates from every city middle school. According to one report cited by the New York Times, the mayor's plan would cut Asian enrollment at the elite schools by half, but Asian parents aren't the only ones complaining. At a town-hall meeting in December, black parents also expressed concern that tinkering with the admissions process will increase racial tensions and set up their own children to fail. "We know that middle schools are not all created the same," said one mother, according to a report in the New York Post. She added that black students are concentrated in the lowest-performing schools.
Mr. de Blasio is a progressive Democrat, and like many on the left he is quick to equate racial disparities with racial bias. But black and Hispanic students of previous generations were accepted to the city's exam schools at significantly higher rates than today. In 1989, Brooklyn Tech's student body was 51% black and Hispanic. Today, it's less than 12%.
Stuyvesant's enrollment history tells a similar story, according to Stanford economist Thomas Sowell, who attended the school in the 1940s while growing up in Harlem. The proportion of blacks attending Stuyvesant as far back as the 1930s approximated the proportion of blacks living in the city at the time. That began to change in the latter part of the 20th century, when the socioeconomic status of blacks was rising and segregation was decreasing. Between 1979 and 1995, the school's black enrollment dropped to 4.8% from 12.9%, and by 2012 it had fallen to 1.2%.
"In short, over a period of 33 years, the proportion of blacks gaining admission to Stuyvesant High School fell to just under one-tenth of what it had been before," Mr. Sowell writes in "Wealth, Poverty and Politics." "None of the usual explanations of racial disparities -- racism, poverty or 'a legacy of slavery' -- can explain this major retrogression over time."
It is not systemic racism but changes in black cultural behaviors in recent decades that offer the more plausible explanation for widening racial gaps in education and other areas. Telling blacks that white prejudice or Asian overachievement or some other external factor is primarily to blame for these outcomes may help the mayor and his party politically, but we shouldn't pretend that lowering standards helps blacks or any group advance.

Culture Explains Asians' Educational Success; Black enrollment at New York's elite public high schools was far higher in the 1930s than today.

Texto completo: New York City's most selective public high schools released demographic data last week on students who were offered admission to the 2019 fall freshman class. The results were as predictable as the subsequent griping.
These eight schools admit kids based on a single standardized exam, and again Asian students, who comprise only 16.1% of the city's public school system, were awarded a majority of the openings, 51.1%. By comparison, whites, who are 15% of public-school students, and blacks, who are 26%, were offered 28.5% and 4% of the seats, respectively. At Stuyvesant High, the most selective school, a mere seven of the 895 seats were offered to black students. In recent years, Asians who attend Stuyvesant and the city's other two super-elite high schools, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech, have regularly outnumbered their white peers by 2 to 1.
Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to scrap the admissions test to achieve more racial balance in the classroom. He has decried the outcomes as evidence of "massive segregation." The Washington Post's education writer likened the low black acceptance rates at New York's top schools to the recently exposed college bribery scandal, calling it "an admissions scandal of a different sort." Apparently, when black students demonstrate academic excellence, it's celebrated. When Asian students do so, it's scandalous.
The notion that these schools aren't diverse enough tells you something about the politicization of terms like "diversity." Asians not only enrich these schools racially and ethnically but also bring economic diversity. The Manhattan Institute's Kay Hymowitz has reported in City Journal that a disproportionate number of Asians admitted to these schools come from a low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn where Chinese immigrant parents "have crammed themselves into dorm-like quarters, working brutally long hours waiting tables, washing dishes, and cleaning hotel rooms."
The Asian student outcomes we see year after year aren't the result of luck or "privilege." They stem from hard work and a culture that prioritizes learning. Research shows that Asian kids read more books, watch less television, and study longer. In poorer families, money goes toward test-prep instead of $200 sneakers. The results are obvious at elite schools nationwide, where even low-income Asian students have outperformed middle- and upper-income students from other groups. "For Chinese immigrants," Ms. Hymowitz writes, "education for the next generation is close to a religion. It opens the path to a good life."
Mr. de Blasio wants to replace the exam with an admissions scheme that would reserve slots at the specialized high schools for the top 7% of graduates from every city middle school. According to one report cited by the New York Times, the mayor's plan would cut Asian enrollment at the elite schools by half, but Asian parents aren't the only ones complaining. At a town-hall meeting in December, black parents also expressed concern that tinkering with the admissions process will increase racial tensions and set up their own children to fail. "We know that middle schools are not all created the same," said one mother, according to a report in the New York Post. She added that black students are concentrated in the lowest-performing schools.
Mr. de Blasio is a progressive Democrat, and like many on the left he is quick to equate racial disparities with racial bias. But black and Hispanic students of previous generations were accepted to the city's exam schools at significantly higher rates than today. In 1989, Brooklyn Tech's student body was 51% black and Hispanic. Today, it's less than 12%.
Stuyvesant's enrollment history tells a similar story, according to Stanford economist Thomas Sowell, who attended the school in the 1940s while growing up in Harlem. The proportion of blacks attending Stuyvesant as far back as the 1930s approximated the proportion of blacks living in the city at the time. That began to change in the latter part of the 20th century, when the socioeconomic status of blacks was rising and segregation was decreasing. Between 1979 and 1995, the school's black enrollment dropped to 4.8% from 12.9%, and by 2012 it had fallen to 1.2%.
"In short, over a period of 33 years, the proportion of blacks gaining admission to Stuyvesant High School fell to just under one-tenth of what it had been before," Mr. Sowell writes in "Wealth, Poverty and Politics." "None of the usual explanations of racial disparities—racism, poverty or 'a legacy of slavery'—can explain this major retrogression over time."
It is not systemic racism but changes in black cultural behaviors in recent decades that offer the more plausible explanation for widening racial gaps in education and other areas. Telling blacks that white prejudice or Asian overachievement or some other external factor is primarily to blame for these outcomes may help the mayor and his party politically, but we shouldn't pretend that lowering standards helps blacks or any group advance.

Senate moves less restrictive felons voting bill

Texto completo: The Senate Criminal Justice Committee approved a plan Monday to restore the voting rights of most ex-felons with fewer restrictions than the House plan. The measure now heads to the Senate floor.
Stung by critics who said a House proposal to implement the constitutional amendment would create a new Jim Crow law by imposing a poll tax, senators voted to require only fees imposed by a judge be paid before voting rights are restored.
Bills in both the Florida House and Senate set the definitions of the terms used in the constitutional initiative approved by voters. Both define a sentence complete when felons pay back all court-ordered fees to regain the right to vote.
"The problem here is that many hardworking returning citizens with limited job opportunities are unable to earn enough to pay restitution completely," Cecile Scoon of the Florida League of Women Voters told the panel.
"The League contends they should not be punished for life with the denial of the right to vote."
Voters approved Amendment 4 in November to restore voting rights to most felons upon completion of their sentence but excludes those convicted of murder and felony sex offenses. Elections supervisors have asked the state to clarify the qualifications.
A House bill to implement the initiative includes all court costs, fees and restitution. It has been roundly criticized by editorial boards across the nation, including the Washington Post. Florida has some of the highest court fees in the nation – and a Brennan Center for Justice study found an estimated 80 percent of felons leave prison in debt due to fines and fees.
The New York Times heralded the "Return of the Poll Tax," when it editorialized on the House bill. The Washington Examiner called out lawmakers for "trying to undo Amendment 4." And Slate charged "Republicans are sabotaging Amendment 4."
Sen. Keith Perry, R-Gainesville, chairs the Criminal Justice Committee. He explained to dozens of onlookers who had gathered Monday to speak against the proposal that lawmakers were bound by the ballot language and Amendment 4 supporters' testimony before the Supreme Court.
Perry and Sens. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg and Jason Pizzo, D-Miami, discussed ways to reduce the number of ex-felons who would be excluded by the Legislature's definitions of the terms voters approved by a 64 percent margin.
The Senate version defines sexual offenses as those that would require someone to register as a sex offender.
But it would still require an ex-felon to pay any fees imposed by a judge as part of the sentence. Sen. Randolph Bracy, D-Orlando, objected and referred to Perry's opening remarks that lawmakers were bound by the parameters set by the ballot language.
"There is nothing that mentions financial obligation in the written constitutional amendment. It does not say financial obligation to be completed," said Bracy. "You are essentially telling these people you won't be able to vote."
Many fees are mandatory under state laws and county ordinances. A 1998 constitutional amendment requires courts to be funded entirely by fines and fees, so many of the fees are imposed at the county level and not by a judge.
Brandes amended the bill to require felons to pay only the fees set by a judge as part of the sentence. But Bracy and a long line of speakers would not buy the compromise he and Perry offered.
The criticism seemed to exasperate Brandes. In the face of criticism from the Fines and Fees Justice Center, he asked what lawmakers could do other than follow the plain meaning of the language the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition used at its web site and in their Supreme Court testimony that fines, and fees are part of a sentence.
"For the purposes of voting rights, we feel monetary obligations should not be a bar from this fundamental right to vote," responded Ashley Thomas, the center's Florida director.
"But that is not what the Constitution said," replied Brandes. "It says all terms of sentence."
"Correct," said Thomas. "What I'm offering is a simple definition which is completion of the terms of incarceration, probation and parole. Which colloquially, what many people in our community think of . . . when sentence is complete."
A spokesman for the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition called the Senate bill a step in the right direction because it takes a less restrictive approach than the House.
The measure passed on a 3 -2 party-line vote. It's next stop is the Senate floor.

Texto completo: And now comes the reckoning for the mainstream news media and the pundits.
After more than two years of intense reporting and endless talking-head speculation about possible collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russian agents in 2016, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III put a huge spike in all of it on Sunday. Attorney General William P. Barr relayed Mr. Mueller's key findings in a four-page summary of the 22-month investigation: The evidence was insufficient to conclude that Mr. Trump or his associates conspired with Russians to interfere in the campaign.
Mr. Barr's announcement was a thunderclap to mainstream news outlets and the cadre of mostly liberal-leaning commentators who have spent months emphasizing the possible-collusion narrative in opinion columns and cable TV panel discussions.
"Nobody wants to hear this, but news that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is headed home without issuing new charges is a death blow for the reputation of the American news media," Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi wrote in a column published Saturday, a day before Mr. Barr nailed the collusion coffin shut. He added: "Nothing Trump is accused of from now on by the press will be believed by huge chunks of the population."
Mr. Taibbi wrote that the reporting and commentary asserting collusion between Mr. Trump and Russia belonged in the dustbin of other discarded stories, such as Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction before the U.S. invasion in 2003. He even called out "Saturday Night Live" - one of Mr. Trump's favorite Twitter foils - for a cast singalong to Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" that featured the line: "Mueller, please come through, because the only option is a coup."
Journalist and commentator Glenn Greenwald - a longtime skeptic of the collusion angle - tweeted his contempt for the media coverage on Sunday, too: "Check every MSNBC personality, CNN law 'expert,' liberal-centrist outlets and #Resistance scam artist and see if you see even an iota of self-reflection, humility or admission of massive error."
He added: "While standard liberal outlets obediently said whatever they were told by the CIA & FBI, many reporters at right-wing media outlets which are routinely mocked by super-smart liberals as primitive & propagandistic did relentlessly great digging & reporting."
Mr. Greenwald reserved special vitriol for MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who he said "went on the air for 2 straight years & fed millions of people conspiratorial garbage & benefited greatly."
An MSNBC representative declined to comment Sunday; CNN's representatives did not respond.
Among the theories commentators advanced was one by New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait, who speculated in a cover story in July about whether "the dark crevices of the Russia scandal run not just a little deeper but a lot deeper." He suggested that "it would be dangerous not to consider the possibility that the [then-upcoming] summit [between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin] is less a negotiation between two heads of state than a meeting between a Russian-intelligence asset and his handler."
In a statement Sunday night, Mr. Chait stood by his article. "That story relied on reports in credible public sources. None of those reports have been refuted. ... If the full Mueller report does show that media reports on Trump's ties to Russia were wrong, I would absolutely amend, correct or withdraw commentary I have written on that basis."
Other news outlets defended their reporting as well, noting that much of it is undisputed and has led to indictments and guilty pleas by figures associated with Mr. Trump's campaign.
"I'm comfortable with our coverage," said Dean Baquet, The New York Times's top editor. "It is never our job to determine illegality, but to expose the actions of people in power. And that's what we and others have done and will continue to do."
He noted that Mr. Barr's letter summarizing Mr. Mueller's findings points out that the actions that warranted an obstruction inquiry were "the subject of public reporting" - a fact "that's to the credit of the media."
In fact, revelations by the Times and The Washington Post about contacts between Russian agents and Mr. Trump's campaign advisers in 2016 helped prompt the inquiry that the special counsel took over in May 2017. The two newspapers shared a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on the issue that year.
As Mr. Baquet noted, "On Russia interference, we and others wrote extensively about Russia's attempt to influence the election, both through hacking and direct approaches by Russians to people around candidate Trump. Those stories were true. And nothing has happened to call into question the reporting about Donald Trump's financial history, or the use of his charity, or any of the other fine investigative reporting over the past three years."
"Russiagate" has been a news media obsession since Mr. Trump's victory in November 2016. The nonpartisan Tyndall Report pegged the total amount of time devoted to the story on the evening newscasts of ABC, CBS and NBC last year at 332 minutes, making it the second-most covered story after the Senate confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. According to a count by the Republican National Committee released Sunday, The Post, the New York Times, CNN.com and MSNBC.com have written a combined 8,507 articles mentioning the special counsel's investigation.
The cable news networks, particularly CNN and MSNBC, have added hundreds of hours of discussion about the topic, too.
The story undoubtedly was an important factor in shaping voters' perceptions before the 2018 midterm election, in which Democrats won control of the House.
But the conclusion of the inquiry has put a question once hazily debated into sharp focus: Did the mainstream news media mislead?
"Liberal journalists expected Mueller to build a case for scandalous collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government," said Tim Graham, director of media analysis for the conservative Media Research Center. Noting Mr. Mueller's broad findings, he said, "So now it's apparent the news channels merely channeled their wishful thinking. They had a grand denouement in mind, and it didn't happen. They mocked Trump for saying 'no collusion,' and that ended up being the truth. ... The voters should feel punked, swindled."

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr’s summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report vindicates, without reservation, President Donald Trump's insistence that there was no collusion with the Russians regarding the 2016 campaign.
Clearing the president and his campaign of a provable conspiracy is a matter of law. But as a matter of national security, Barr’s letter does not clear up very much about the relationship between the Trump inner circle and the Russians, or about the behavior of the president himself.
There is unambiguous good news for the president in Barr’s letter. Most important, it means that on the central question Mueller was asked to investigate, there is no evidence to link the Trump campaign to the Russian government. This is not the same thing as saying that people in the Trump campaign were not involved in shady dealings with bad people, but it lays to rest — and for this we should all be thankful — the possibility that the president of the United States knowingly cooperated with an enemy government in seeking election.
Read more commentary:
Mueller report mystifies, but not because it cannot be true
Skimpy Barr letter sets up constitutional battle royal to force full Mueller report release
Mueller report: Collusion by the news media, not Trump, but don't expect apologies
This, however, is an odd finding and one that is difficult to square with how many people are in legal trouble for lying about this very issue. If there was no canoodling with the Russians, why was there so much lying? How did Mueller manage to unravel what looks like a tangle of deceptions about Russia — and then reach a conclusion that there was no collusion with the Russians?
Without seeing the actual Mueller report, it seems at this point that there are three possibilities:
First, it may well be that Mueller only uncovered the usual swampy mess found under some of the slimiest rocks in Washington.
Expecting to cash in on a Trump loss
This would explain how a claque of grifters who were already feeding at the Russian trough latched on to Trump and then found themselves completely unprepared for life in the spotlight when Trump won. They expected Trump to lose, but they knew they could sell their proximity to a major campaign, and to senior figures in the GOP, to the Kremlin and other unsavory clients long after November 2016.
The fatal mistake of this group, from Paul Manafort on down, is that they underestimated Trump’s chances of winning and overestimated Trump’s intelligence. They never expected that Trump would do something as stupid as firing FBI Director James Comey while — according to a document read to The New York Times — bragging to the Russian ambassador that he did it to stop any further investigations.
The second possibility is that Barr is carefully parsing Mueller here, noting — at least to the eyes of a layperson rather than a lawyer — that Mueller could not legally establish that members of the Trump campaign "or anyone associated with it" reached out and made a deal with people they knew to be representatives of the Russian government.
Bread crumbs from WikiLeaks to Moscow
Barr’s letter is carefully worded on these points, with terms like “knowingly,” “associate” and “government” potentially doing a lot of work. If Roger Stone, for example, communicated with Julian Assange about Hillary Clinton’s emails, does this pass the test of “campaign associates” “knowingly” working with “the Russian government”? For a lawyer, perhaps not, since Stone was not officially associated with the campaign, and Assange is not part of the Russian government.
For anyone following the bread crumbs from WikiLeaks to Moscow (as Barr’s letter itself notes) and from Stone back to the Trump family, it’s an easier call. What a lawyer can prove, however, and what a counterintelligence analyst might believe with a high degree of certainty are not the same thing.
The main problem with both of these theories is that they cannot explain very much about how Trump and his coterie acted right from the start of this entire matter. If there was no collusion, why did the president panic and fire Comey, and thus proliferate his own troubles beyond all measure? Why did the people around him lie at will, almost as a reflex?
Until Congress sees the full report, we will not know Mueller’s reasoning. But if this is the case, and Mueller refused to pursue charges for which he did not have an ironclad case, then the president’s exoneration ironically rests entirely on Mueller’s caution and prudence — in other words, on the very qualities that prevented a swift and fruitful investigation from turning into a witch hunt.

Texto completo: to rocker Lou Reed The New York Public Library has opened an archive dedicated to pioneering alternative rock musician Lou Reed.
The library acquired the archive after performance artist and musician Laurie Anderson, who was married to Reed, decided to share it with an institution that could preserve and showcase the archive. The New York Times reports the archive includes a large collection of personal notes, photographs and more than 600 hours of recordings.
Anderson says Reed never discussed what to do with his belongings before his death in 2013. She says she thought the archive should be accessible to young musicians and anyone interested in his life.
Reed was the lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter for The Velvet Underground, and had a solo career that spanned decades after leaving the band.

BORDER WATCH; Fertile ground to build a 'smart wall'; Virtual barriers are being billed as an alternative to detect intrusions on U.S. soil.

Texto completo: Deep in the Otay Mountain Wilderness, there is no wall.
The only boundary between the U.S. and Mexico is a section of barbed wire fence in a pastoral valley. And miles and miles of treacherous terrain.
It's a territory crisscrossed by steep trails that disappear into tunnels of thick brush, a place looped by violently rutted roads that Border Patrol agents negotiate daily.

Land such as this is not a likely candidate for President Trump's "big, beautiful wall."
But it is fertile for an invisible kind of fence, one built of artificial intelligence, radar, drones, sensors, motion-activated cameras and even lidar, the same technology used in self-driving vehicles.
"Virtual walls" or "smart walls" along the Southwest border are increasingly being billed as an alternative to the proposed concrete and steel barriers that have so sharply divided public opinion.
An electronic fence is not about preventing intrusion as much as it is about detecting intrusions and intercepting them.
Although even the strongest proponents for such a technological solution admit physical barriers are probably best in urban areas such as San Diego and El Paso, they see a virtual wall as a cheaper and more effective way to police much of the rest of the 2,000-mile Southwest border.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection has asked that $223 million of its fiscal 2019 budget focus on technology improvements, funding that could have bipartisan support.
But the increased focus on smart walls is deepening concern about a growing Big Brother-is-watching network, and civil liberties organizations have asked lawmakers to proceed with caution.
"Warrantless use of these technologies comes at an unacceptably high cost," Neema Singh Guliani and Michelle Fraling, officials with the American Civil Liberties Union, said last month. "They allow the government to track, surveil and monitor individuals indiscriminately and with precise detail. Individuals in the border zone should not be subject to near-constant surveillance that intrudes on the most intimate aspects of their lives."
--
Lessons learned
An electronic fence is not a new idea. It is one that the federal government has failed to implement wide-scale at least three times in the last few decades.
From 1997 to 2005, the government spent about $429 million on two border technology programs deemed unsuccessful, according to congressional reports.
The third and most recent iteration was the Secure Border Initiative Network, known as SBInet, a massive project started in 2006. Boeing was contracted to build a network of surveillance towers and ground sensors that would detect intrusions and relay the information to command posts, where agents would decide how to react.
It was rolled out first along the Arizona border, but expansion was halted in 2010 due to serious concerns about its feasibility.
The Government Accountability Office faulted SBInet for poor management, cost overruns and missed deadlines. The technology was also troubled, pulled off the shelves rather than custom-designed for the border environment and the job at hand.
The program was killed in 2011, at a price tag of more than $1 billion.
"I terminated it when I was commissioner. It was a failure," Alan Bersin recalled in an interview last week with the San Diego Union-Tribune. Bersin, a former U.S. attorney in San Diego, served as a so-called border czar under two presidents and was appointed U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner from 2010 to 2011.
Part of the problem, Bersin said, was pursuing a one-size-fits-all approach to the border.
"Instead of one technology system borderwide, we now follow a system customized to the particular conditions on the border," Bersin said. "The setting up of an electronic fence in the Sonoran Arizona desert is far different than doing so around San Diego's urban area."
--
Aging technology
Even before SBInet was terminated, doubts about the program led authorities to redirect millions of dollars in funding to deploy other technology across the border. That included mobile and fixed surveillance towers, cameras, drones and thermal imaging devices.
Many of those systems are in use today, although they are aging -- both physically and in concept as technology leaps forward.
To cope, Border Patrol sectors have largely focused on incremental improvements in a piecemeal strategy.
Evidence of that effort can be seen in the Border Patrol's Brown Field Station east of San Diego, a 568-square-mile region stretching from Otay Mountain to Tecate, with 11 miles of international border.
Agents there typically spend a large amount of their time on the job investigating alerts from seismic sensors tripped by potential intruders. Problem is, the sensors are also tripped by rabbits, deer, the rain and other agents.
A sensor in a remote canyon could mean a two-hour hike, only to discover fresh mountain lion tracks nearby.
The recent addition of several motion-activated Buckeye cameras has helped tremendously, agents said. The camera takes a grainy snapshot immediately after being triggered, sending the information to the Tactical Operations Center at the station for quick analysis.
The command post, better known as TOC (pronounced "talk"), monitors other surveillance, too. Radar returns predict the presence of suspicious activity and send images that can distinguish vehicles and people. An agent sitting at the computer can then direct a field agent to intercept.
The TOC also takes a high-tech approach to one of the Border Patrol's most low-tech tactics -- tracking "sign."
Sign refers to the traces left behind by a person on the move, whether it be footprints, litter, broken branches or overturned rocks.
Reading sign is how agents have done the job for decades, something unchanged by even the best technology, they say.
For instance, an agent who discovers fresh footprints from a group of people headed up a specific trail will report it to the TOC. The spot will be marked with GPS coordinates and updated as another sign is discovered.
The information can be passed on to the next shift for continued tracking.
"The TOC can track a sign for two, three days," said Border Patrol spokesman Fabian Carbajal, who has spent 13 years of his career patrolling Brown Field Station.
--
The future
The capabilities are a start, but innovators at many smaller firms have their sights set on technology that seemed futuristic not too long ago.
Quanergy, a Silicon Valley company that developed lidar for driverless vehicles, has been testing new laser technology in the Texas border town of Del Rio with the cooperation of a local sheriff, the New York Times reported. Laser sensors give a 3D view of an area, building on the existing technology already being used.
Anduril Industries, based in Orange County, is working to apply artificial intelligence to national security settings. Its founder is Palmer Luckey, the entrepreneur behind the virtual-reality company Oculus.
"One of the big advantages to the use of AI-enabled technology is that you can deploy it without having to increase manpower," said Matt Steckman, Anduril's head of corporate and government affairs. "You get computers to do a lot of the work and let the humans be the decision-makers."
Anduril's system, called Lattice, uses hundreds or even thousands of sensors, then lets artificial intelligence scan the environment five times a second and interpret the results. Only meaningful results will be transmitted to an agent in the field, on a smartphone or tablet, in the form of a cropped image of the form. The agent can then decide how to respond.
Tech companies are also working to make devices more mobile, and therefore more nimble.
David Aguilar, former acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said technology would unquestionably be a large part of securing the border -- used in combination with physical barriers when appropriate as well as manpower.
He gave the example of Synthetic Aperture Radar being looked at to constantly map and remap a portion of land in remote areas to detect terrain change, such as a new trail or road implicating fresh trafficking routes.
"That's good intelligence," Aguilar said in a recent interview. "You can go in there, drop ground sensors in the area, fly a drone on a persistent basis or post tethered aerostats to watch that area."
But he warned against viewing any one solution, including technology, as a silver bullet.
"There is no such thing. You're never going to have a border that is going to be impenetrable. That's just not going to happen. Does that mean we stop working toward it? No."

Justice Department to honor Anne Bingaman

Texto completo: Anne Bingaman was a heartbroken fourth-grader when Democrat Adlai Stevenson lost his bid for president in 1952.
She liked the fact that Stevenson had worked as a lawyer. So from then on, whenever someone asked the young Anne what she wanted to do when she grew up, she said, "I'm going to be a lawyer."
"I had no real concept of what lawyers did, but I knew Adlai Stevenson was a lawyer and he was my hero," the Santa Fe woman said. "And I guess kids want to have a hero."
Bingaman went on to earn a law degree at Stanford University and become the first female professor of law at the University of New Mexico School of Law. In the 1990s, she served as an assistant attorney general in the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.
Now the Justice Department is honoring Bingaman, the wife of former Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman, by naming an auditorium and lecture hall in her honor. The Anne K. Bingaman Auditorium in the Liberty Square Building in Washington, D.C., will be used to host lectures and presentations, and to train attorneys, economists and paralegals, among other purposes.
The hall will be dedicated Wednesday.
For Anne Bingaman -- who sums up her lengthy career simply: "I practiced law and I worked for the government; that's all I can say" -- the Justice Department nod is "gracious."
She said her motto has always been "better to be lucky than smart, and boy have I been lucky."
Still, the dedication of a building in Washington speaks to the achievements she has accomplished since her birth
as Anne Kovacovich some
75 years ago in the mining town of Jerome, Ariz. Her mother was a "yellow dog Democrat" -- she would vote for a Democrat even if he was a yellow dog, Bingaman said. Her father was a grocer. No one in her family attended college until she did.
She met her husband at Stanford, and the two moved to New Mexico in the late 1960s, where Anne Bingaman first practiced law. The couple have one son, John Bingaman, who recently became the chief of staff to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
When Anne Bingaman was put in charge of the Antitrust Division in 1993, the New York Times reported that she "brings a solid background litigating big cases on behalf of consumers who say they have been forced to pay unreasonable prices and companies victimized by cartels."
Two of the actions she is most proud of from that period, she said, were initiating a practice of hiring paralegals with college degrees -- previously, she said, paralegals in the agency "were largely secretaries who were promoted" -- and investigating an industrywide conspiracy among Nasdaq trading firms to fix transaction costs for investors.
After several years, a federal judge approved a $1 billion settlement offered by Nasdaq to avoid a lawsuit, making it the largest civil antitrust settlement in history.
"My proudest accomplishment," Bingaman said of her role in the Nasdaq case. "I felt then, and feel now, personally responsible for it."
Bingaman recently put together a presentation on the history of the Antitrust Division under her watch (1993-96) for an upcoming workshop in Washington about women who were involved in milestone antitrust cases.
Mostly, she's enjoying retirement, she said, but she keeps busy reading (she belongs to a history book club in Santa Fe) and serving on an array of local nonprofit boards, including the boards of the Lensic Performing Arts Center and the Museum of New Mexico Foundation.
New Mexico, she said, has provided her with opportunities.
"If I had been in Los Angeles or New York in 1968 or 1969, when the percentage of women lawyers was exactly what it had been in 1920 -- 3 percent -- I would have been working in the Motor Vehicles Department or some other such job," she said.
"Only in this wonderful, open, Western state where people know each other and hear about people they don't yet know," she added, "could I have lived the life I have."

Texto completo: The 1998 New York Times review of the original staging of "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" contains at least two words now considered outdated, even offensive. The fact that the review was written just 21 years ago? That shows how much has changed in the world of gender and identity politics.
"Sex-change" operations are now generally called "gender-confirming" surgeries. And many "transsexuals" prefer the term "transgender." With our language evolving so rapidly, no wonder it's so tricky to stage the once-outr-but-now-beloved "Hedwig." Discussion concerning gender has become a lot more nuanced since the musical premiered, with more Americans embracing a definition that is nonbinary, where people can identify with points along a continuum rather than the male-female extremes.
" 'Hedwig' means so many different things to different people," said trans actor Jay Owen Eisenberg, a cast member for Theater Latt Da's "Hedwig" (opening Saturday in Minneapolis). "There are so many people in the queer community who love Hedwig and this show and so many who hate it and so many people in the middle. It's true of any piece, but 'Hedwig,' especially, has a polarizing quality."
That was also true when "Hedwig" debuted off-Broadway. It felt revolutionary with its story of a German youth who falls in love with a man. The title character has his penis removed so he can marry his lover and move to the U.S., only to be dumped and forced to carve out a living as a low-rent cabaret performer.
"Hedwig" became a 2001 cult movie starring co-creator John Cameron Mitchell. It eventually landed a 2014 Broadway stint that earned Neil Patrick Harris a Tony award. The show's mass appeal proved "Hedwig" was no longer as subversive as it once seemed (the Times' 2014 review called Hedwig's gender "undefinable"). In fact, Mitchell -- who now refers to the title character as "genderqueer," a term that barely existed in 1998 but describes people who don't identify with traditional roles -- has said "Hedwig" would be a different show if he wrote it today. With actors including Laverne Cox and Asia Kate Dillon and TV series including "RuPaul's Drag Race" and "Transparent" becoming popular in the interim -- to say nothing of marriage equality and the public transition of Caitlyn Jenner -- audiences are apt to see "Hedwig" a lot differently than they did in the late '90s.
'A third gender space'
For one thing, is Hedwig even trans?
"So many people, even LGBTQI people, still call Hedwig a trans character, but she never uses that word," said Theater Latt Da Artistic Director Peter Rothstein, who codirects "Hedwig" with Annie Enneking. "The narrative is that Hedwig is a gay man who cuts his penis off to get out of East Berlin."
Eisenberg concurs with that assessment.
"The show was pushing the envelope in so many ways in 1998 because we were seeing someone who was really messing with gender presentation and was a gender-variant person on stage," he said. "But we have someone whose transition was largely informed by coercion, so it gets tricky to use the word 'trans.' "
One thing both Eisenberg and Rothstein like about Hedwig is that she doesn't fit current gender norms (as indicated by the script, the artists use she/her pronouns for the character). That's why Eisenberg loves the idea of all kinds of actors playing the character: men, women, trans, genderqueer.
That's also why, when he heard about the production last summer, in which cisgender actor Tyler Michaels King was cast as Hedwig (a role almost always played by cis men), Eisenberg "had some questions" about Latt Da's take on the show.
So he called Rothstein. At a follow-up meeting with Rothstein and Latt Da Associate Artistic Director Elissa Adams, Eisenberg raised issues the queer community was debating, issues concerning the fairness of casting King. "Peter said, basically, 'We knew conversation would come out of this, but we would rather have those conversations than not. We want to do this show and we want to talk about it,' " Eisenberg said.
The meeting convinced him that this was a "Hedwig" production he could get behind. "I do want us to be cast more, of course," Eisenberg said. "But I don't necessarily interpret this character as trans, because of how the transition happens. I interpret her, by the end, as occupying a third gender space."
Minneapolis City Council Member, trans woman and artist Andrea Jenkins said that she's surprised that a cisgender man is playing "Hedwig" but that she appreciates the involvement of Eisenberg and trans woman Jendeen Forberg, who played Hedwig's drummer in the first Twin Cities production in 2002 and returns to that role for Latt Da. (The production includes several queer or gay artists.)
"I'm not always necessarily a purist around these issues," Jenkins said. "I thought Jeffrey Tambor was an excellent choice for 'Transparent' because it was about a trans person coming out late in life. It totally made sense to me that that actor would portray that character, and I think Hedwig is in a similar vein."
Rothstein stands by his casting choice but said he also gets why it's controversial.
"We're very intentional about opening our doors and inviting nonbinary artists to audition, to be a part of our process," he said. "So that conversation I absolutely agree with: People were upset that Tyler got the role because there are not that many roles written for trans or nonbinary artists and I was denying them a chance to play this role."
But "theater can build a more compassionate world," he added, specifically because artists have the empathy to play characters who are different from them.
'Small things matter'
After that initial meeting with Rothstein and Adams, Eisenberg was offered a job codirecting "Hedwig." But when Meghan Kreidler, originally cast as Yitzhak, dropped out of the show, Adams asked Eisenberg whether he would consider auditioning.
He may be the first trans man to play Yitzhak, Hedwig's sometime lover, a male role written for a woman's voice. One "really beautiful" aspect of this production, he said, is how music director Jason Hansen rearranged Yitzhak's vocals to make use of Eisenberg's voice now, "a tenor with a lot of falsetto," rather than the trained mezzo soprano he had before taking testosterone. "On the first day of rehearsal, I said, 'Thank you for working with my Yitzhak. It feels good,' " Eisenberg said.
Meanwhile, Latt Da reflects Hedwig's bravery by staging her lounge act not in a queer space, but in a suburban Minneapolis park circa 1997. That's bound to start a conversation.
There's also bound to be talk about the new signage at the Ritz Theater, where Latt Da performs. When patrons visit for "Hedwig and the Angry Inch," they will see that the former men's and women's restrooms are now marked with signs inviting theatergoers to use whichever feels most comfortable. (Latt Da has been weighing an expensive conversion to fully gender-neutral bathrooms since it bought the Ritz in 2016.)
"When Peter first brought it up, I said, 'That's so great. I think it's important for the run of this show to do that, considering that it's likely we'll have more people who want gender-neutral restrooms,' " Eisenberg said. "And Peter said, 'Yeah, and then we're going to keep them that way.' Those small things matter. It can make you feel immediately comfortable when you walk into a place and think, 'Hmmm. I see some very active allyship happening here.' "
While Latt Da's nonbinary patrons and their allies will likely applaud the shift, Rothstein knows it won't be easy for everyone. "We have some patrons who have said, 'I would not be comfortable with this,' " he acknowledged. "But our response is usually, 'Imagine how a transgender person has felt the majority of their life.' "
With President Donald Trump banning trans people from the military and seven states issuing nonbinary driver's licenses, these are issues the country is still debating. And we're debating them, at least in part, thanks to the trailblazing influence of "Hedwig."
"Hedwig was a pioneer," Rothstein said. "And we need to acknowledge these pioneers who put on a pair of heels, if that was how they acted out loud, or who knocked on doors or put on political rallies. She wants to have real conversations about her life experience, and how that resonates with gender identity and sexual identity and power."
So Latt Da is inviting Hedwig into the Ritz to continue that conversation, one encompassing how all of us come to know ourselves, how we express that, where we occasionally miss the mark and maybe which restroom feels right.

Texto completo: By George F. Will

WASHINGTON -- On Feb. 12, Joaquin Guzman Loera, aka "El Chapo," was convicted of multiple crimes related to running the Sinaloa drug cartel, Mexico's largest. Thirteen days before his conviction, authorities seized enough of the synthetic opioid called fentanyl for 100 million lethal doses. It was hidden in a truck carrying cucumbers through the Nogales port of legal entry.

On Feb. 28, authorities at the port of Newark inspecting a container ship that had arrived from Colombia found inside a container supposedly filled with dried fruit 3,200 pounds of cocaine, worth $77 million on U.S streets. This was two days after Don Winslow published "The Border," the final volume in his 1,900-page trilogy of novels ("The Power of the Dog" and "The Cartel") about the cartels and the U.S. "war on drugs." He could hardly have arranged a better launch for his book, which is already on best-seller lists.

His thesis is that the war on drugs resembles the Vietnam War in its futility and its collateral damage to Mexicans, more than 250,000 of whom have died and another 40,000 have disappeared, according to the Financial Times, in the past dozen years from violence associated with rivalrous cartels and law-enforcement measures. Those endless photos of confiscated sacks of drugs do resemble old photos of dead Vietcong -- body counts of replaceable bodies. El Chapo, 61, will die in a U.S. "supermax" prison, and his incarceration -- he has been in custody since 2016 -- will make no difference regarding drug flows.

The mayhem and sadism Winslow describes are, he says, derived from credible reports. Wonder what the Central Americans who trek through Mexico to the U.S. border are fleeing? Read Winslow's description of a 10-year-old Guatemalan living off a garbage dump, alert for trucks bringing garbage from the better neighborhoods.

Winslow might be right about sinister involvements of some U.S. financial institutions in handling the cartels' billions. He could, however, have omitted the thinly -- very thinly -- disguised President Donald Trump, and his son-in-law who knowingly uses cartel money to rescue himself from a bad Manhattan real estate bet. One reason to read fiction is to avoid reading about those people. However, the upward of $40 billion in profits made from the $150 billion U.S. market -- 30 million consumers of illicit drugs -- must go somewhere. First, to Mexico, "so much cash," Winslow says, "they don't even count it, they weigh it." But then where?

Every day 4,500 trucks pass, necessarily with usually minimal inspection, through three legal entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border. Any wall would be irrelevant to interrupting drug shipments. As is the strategy of bringing down cartel kingpins. The New York Times reports that in 2016 and 2017, when El Chapo was in custody, "Mexican heroin production increased by 37 percent and seizures of fentanyl in places like Nogales more than doubled."

The "supply side" attack on drugs is frustrated by, among other things, geography and the torrent of south-north commerce. The "demand side" is frustrated by declining prices (the supply-side failure) for increasingly potent products, such as fentanyl, which has passed prescription opioids and heroin in overdose deaths. Made from chemicals, not crops, and patented almost 60 years ago, it is mixed with heroin for an extra kick -- and if doses are not carefully calibrated, a lethal kick. Says New York University's Mark A.R. Kleiman: In 1979, a milligram of pure heroin sold for about $9 in today's prices; today it costs less than 25 cents. "Fifty grams of fentanyl -- just over an ounce and a half -- has the punch of a kilogram of heroin, and it's way, way cheaper." Three hundred micrograms -- "roughly the weight of a grain of table salt" -- can kill. And dealers are not precise chemists.

"We have," Kleiman says, "about 30 times as many drug dealers behind bars today as we had in 1980" but today's dealers employ cellphones, texting, social media and home delivery. In the most recent Global Drug Survey, Kleiman says, "cocaine users around the world reported that their most recent cocaine order was delivered in less time, on average, than their most recent pizza order."

He notes that serious cultural change has taken 50 years regarding tobacco, yet it is "still much more widely used than any of the illicit drugs except for cannabis." And "the fentanyls aren't going to be the last class of purely synthetic and super-potent recreational chemicals; they're just the first." Worse living through chemistry, even if it disadvantages the crop-growing cartels of Winslow's epic.

With the iPhone Sputtering, Apple Bets Its Future on TV and News; Tim Cook is gambling that selling services, an area filled with risks and competition, will be the company's next chapter

Texto completo: The iPhone is running out of juice. To go beyond the device that made Apple Inc. a global colossus, Tim Cook is betting on a suite of services—marking the company's biggest shift in more than a decade.
The chief executive's strategy, years in the making, takes Apple out of its comfort zone into areas where it has failed in the past, and that today are replete with risks and competition. Apple will take a giant leap toward its goal on Monday, when it plans to announce video- and news-subscription services that it hopes will generate billions of dollars in new annual revenue and deepen ties between iPhone users and the company.
In some ways, Apple helped create its own predicament when it launched the app industry a decade ago. The goal was to make the iPhone more powerful.
Over time, though, apps and services, from Spotify to Netflix to China's WeChat, have often become more important to users than the devices that run them. That allows consumers to hold on to phones longer or switch to less expensive versions. In January, Apple reported its first decline in revenue and profit for a holiday quarter in over a decade.
By contrast, revenue from the services business grew 33% last year, to nearly $40 billion—accounting for about 15% of the company's total of $265.6 billion.
The company's ambition in video is to become an alternative to cable, combining original series with shows from other networks to create a new entertainment service that can reach more than 100 markets world-wide. It is the tech giant's latest attempt to reinvent television, something it has tried to do for about a decade with limited success.
On Monday, the tech giant plans to unveil the first footage from some of its new original TV shows, according to people familiar with the event. Apple has used a $1 billion budget to buy dozens of original TV shows in hopes it can land a breakout hit. It has cut deals with Hollywood stars including actor Reese Witherspoon and director J.J. Abrams, who have been invited to attend Monday's event on Apple's campus, according to those people.
Apple declined to comment for this article.
Apple hasn't said what it will charge for the programming. People working on the projects said the company plans to charge a fee, after previously saying it would be free to Apple device owners.
The original series will be delivered in a new TV app that staff have been calling a Netflix killer. It will make it easier for people to subscribe with a single click to channels such as Starz, Showtime and HBO, with which Apple has been negotiating to offer their shows to users for $9.99 a month each, people familiar with the talks said.
Apple has been negotiating to bring its new TV app to multiple platforms, including Roku and smart TVs, according to people familiar with the talks—an unusual move for a company that has long preferred to limit its software and services to its own devices. Some of those distribution agreements are expected to be announced Monday.
At the same event, Apple plans to showcase a revamped News app that includes a premium tier with access to more than 200 magazines—including Bon Appétit, People and Glamour—as well as newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal. It plans to charge $9.99 for the service and believes the premium news content can lift engagement on its devices, people familiar with the plans said. The New York Times earlier reported on the Journal's participation.
As part of the arrangement, much of the Journal's content will be available through the service, although certain types of stories—particularly general news, politics and lifestyles news—will be showcased, while business and finance news won't be displayed as prominently, according to people familiar with the situation. The deal will result in the Journal hiring more reporters focused on general news to help feed Apple's product, one of the people said. The Journal sells its own subscriptions for $39 a month.
The news subscription offering follows Apple's 2018 acquisition of a Netflix-for-news app called Texture . The deal gave Apple rights to most major North American magazines for at least five years and up to two decades in an agreement that splits revenue 50-50 between the tech giant and publishers such as Hearst Magazines and Condé Nast, according to people familiar with the deal.
The terms rankled some newspapers Apple courted, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, which sell monthly subscriptions for $15 and $10, respectively. The Washington Post and New York Times aren't participating in the new app, according to people familiar with the situation.
Pushing services
When Apple last found itself on the ropes in the early 2000s, co-founder Steve Jobs reinvented the company by pushing it into mobile devices. The iPod and its accompanying iTunes service revived a company that was largely dependent on Mac computer sales. The subsequent iPhone helped Apple become the first company to surpass $1 trillion in market value last year.
Mr. Cook, who succeeded Mr. Jobs, is attempting a similar feat in the approaching twilight of the smartphone era. He began pushing the services strategy hard in late 2017, after Apple launched its 10th-anniversary smartphone, the iPhone X. While a big price increase to nearly $1,000 was helping boost revenue, the iPhone X wasn't selling more phones , and higher prices made sophisticated, lower-cost rival devices more appealing.
Mr. Cook, who had vowed earlier that year to double Apple's services revenue by 2020, began meeting regularly with the services division.
At the monthly sessions, the 58-year-old CEO has peppered the team with detailed questions. He wanted services team members to tell him which apps were selling well, how many Apple Music subscribers stuck with the service, and how many people were signing up for iCloud storage, a costly service that required spending billions of dollars to build data centers around the U.S., according to people familiar with the meetings.
"You couldn't say, 'I don't have that information. I'll get that tonight,' " said one person involved. "You had to have a dictionary of backup."
Apple's biggest source of services revenue comes from distributing other companies' software through its App Store. The company is now battling Spotify and Netflix, two of the most popular apps, over its practice of taking 30% of sales or subscription revenue from apps.
Netflix recently stopped letting users sign up for its service on Apple devices, and said it won't participate in Apple's video subscription service. Spotify AB this month filed an antitrust complaint in Europe claiming Apple abuses its control over the App Store, something Apple denies.
Apple's music-streaming service, its biggest attempt so far to build its own subscription business, has about 50 million global subscribers—far behind Spotify's 96 million.
Apple's base of 1.4 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs in use globally gives it a distribution platform. Yet the businesses of selling gadgets and services can conflict. To reach the biggest possible market for video service, Apple would have to offer it on non-Apple devices—something it has been loath to do in years past.
Previous successes with services such as iTunes, which redefined the music industry, have been offset by troubles with Maps and Siri.
"They built an organization to make beautiful gadgets and compete with Samsung and other gray-box manufacturers," said Mike Levin, co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a technology analysis firm. "Now, they have to really think about the services and software that have been so uneven and compete with a lot of very different competitors."
Mr. Cook has said Apple retains its edge. "Apple innovates like no other company on Earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas," he told investors in January, when Apple reported earnings.
Apple's stock, while up since early January, remains 20% below its peak in October. It is currently valued at $900.85 billion.
App resistance
Co-founder Mr. Jobs foreshadowed Apple's services future when he started iTunes in 2001, offering categories from competing major labels to make the first successful digital-music store, with songs available for 99 cents.
When Apple created the iPhone in 2007, Mr. Jobs opposed letting other companies sell apps for it, fearing they could undercut performance or introduce viruses.
Apple's software team, recognizing that more apps could make the phone more dynamic, pushed back and prevailed. The resulting App Store has generated more than $120 billion in total sales for developers since it opened in 2008.
It also brought competition from rivals such as Spotify, which began selling subscriptions in the U.S. in 2011.
The competition led to Apple's biggest deal, its $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics LLC in 2014, so Apple could launch a competing music-streaming service.
By then, concerns had already been rising inside Apple about the iPhone's future. The number of devices Apple sold was growing more than 20% annually as Mr. Cook pushed it into new retailers and markets, but sales executives told colleagues in 2014 they were running out of avenues for easy growth, former employees said. "They were freaked out," one person said.
During a presentation before the launch, the music-streaming team told Mr. Cook they expected to generate more than 10 million subscribers in the first year.
"Double that," said Mr. Cook, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The executives ended up easily clearing the goal, which encouraged them about Mr. Cook's vision for the opportunity in services, the person said.
Mr. Cook and Eddy Cue, his lieutenant in charge of services, started looking for other subscription opportunities. Video was an immediate priority. Apple's share of movie sales and rentals was more than 50% in 2012. By 2017 it had fallen to between 20% and 35% .
Apple wanted a service that could beat Netflix, a person familiar with the company's plan said. After a 2015 effort to persuade Walt Disney Co. and others to join a streaming-TV service faltered, Apple's executives debated alternatives, including acquiring Walt Disney Co. or Netflix, and building its own studio, people familiar with the discussions said.
In 2017, it hired two prominent executives from Sony Pictures Television and empowered them to cut deals for more than two dozen original programs. They scooped up a reboot of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television's "Amazing Stories," scored a series about a morning talk show starring Ms. Witherspoon, and struck a partnership with Oprah Winfrey.
Apple faces steep competition from big spenders while it plays catch-up to experienced rivals. Netflix has 139 million subscribers and is expected to spend $15 billion on content this year. It also offers a far deeper content library than Apple plans to make available. Disney, which has decades of experience making hit shows and movies, plans to launch its own streaming service later this year.
Morgan Stanley estimates that a combined media package from Apple that includes video and music could generate more than $22 billion in sales by 2025.
Previously, Apple used software and services to sell more of its own devices. In January, Apple announced it would put a TV app on sets made by rival Samsung Electronics Co., making it available to people who don't necessarily own any Apple hardware.
Apple executives made clear during talks with TV makers that it needed as broad a reach as possible to compete with Netflix and others. Last year, Apple announced a similar agreement with rival Amazon.com Inc. to bring Apple Music to Echo smart speakers.
"We made a mistake with Apple Music, thinking we could go it alone, and it took a long time to catch up. We still aren't there yet," the head of marketing Apple services, Jon Giselman, said during a meeting with one of the company's partners, according to a person in attendance.
The push into news subscriptions could help Apple battle Facebook Inc., whose News Feed has helped it become the No. 1 app world-wide in monthly active smartphone users. It is also the anchor of a business that Facebook is looking to expand by emphasizing private messaging , a step many interpret as the first in an effort to become a super-app like China's WeChat, which allows users to shop, order food, buy movie tickets and make reservations on any mobile operating system.
For Mr. Cook's monthly services meetings, the company has intensified monitoring of apps that benefit and threaten Apple. The team has created a release radar for the CEO to track apps that are expected to sell well and other metrics for the apps that have challenged Apple's business, including iTunes sales decreases compared with Apple Music subscription growth, said the person involved with the meetings.
Other successful subscription apps have given away much more content at lower prices than Apple is expected to offer initially. Amazon Prime members, who pay $119 annually, get free video content and discounted music subscriptions. Some inside Apple's services group wanted similar benefits for iPhone buyers. Mr. Cook and his leadership team have made it clear that its forthcoming services will carry a price tag.
"There's this conflict between wanting to become a services business and acting like one," said the person. "They haven't solved that."

Texto completo: Native American author Tommy Orange, of Oakland, has won the prestigious 2019 PEN/Hemingway award for "distinguished first novel."
The honor was announced Tuesday by PEN America, a project of the Hemingway Society created after the death of Ernest Hemingway.
Orange, a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, wrote his debut novel, "There There," about modern-day native Americans struggling with loss of identity in urban Oakland.
Published by Knopf in 2018, the novel was rated by the New York Times as one of the best books of the year.
"After noticing a lack of stories about urban Native Americans, Orange created a remarkable work that explores those who have inherited a profound spirituality, but who are also plagued by addiction, abuse, and suicide," says a biography on the Penguin Random House Speakers Bureau website.
In a June 2018 Bay Area News Group review of the book and interview with Orange, Lisa Wrenn wrote: "His love for Oakland and its people is obvious in his book's broad cast of characters, who are introduced in eponymously titled chapters that read like standalone stories. Like Orange himself, the characters are biracial, with names like Orvil Red Feather, Edwin Black and Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield.
"Oakland itself serves as a character, drawn in such details as the characters' allegiance to the A's and Raiders, the whiff of cannabis smoke at the bus station and the faded pink glow of the Tribune Tower, which seems like it should be red, but somehow lost steam along the way.' "
Regarding the book's title, she writes: "Orange draws parallels between the identity issues facing Oakland and the Native Americans who are nearly invisible' here. When Dene applies for an arts grant, he's interviewed by a smirky, hipster judge, Rob, who tells Dene: No one's really from (Oakland), right?' Rob goes on to parrot the oft-misinterpreted Gertrude Stein quote, there's no there there.' "
The PEN/Hemingway comes with a $25,000 award from the Hemingway Family and the Hemingway Foundation. Orange also will receive a month-long residency fellowship at the Ucross Foundation, a Wyoming retreat for artists and writers.
Séan Hemingway, the grandson of Ernest Hemingway, will present Orange with the award during an April 7 ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.

What's On Saturday

Texto completo: Watch Jason Statham confront a massive whale in "The Meg." Or catch a Mötley Crüe biopic on Netflix.
What's on TV
THE MEG (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms; Rent on Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. When the trailer for this blockbuster was released last year, it gave the impression of an ironic B-movie in the vein of "Sharknado." Loosely based on the 1997 novel "Meg" by Steve Alten, it follows a rescue diver (Jason Statham) who's called on to save a crew of scientists trapped in a deep-sea submersible from a 75-foot prehistoric shark. When the film landed on the big screen, it shattered box office expectations but most critics gave it scathing reviews. Variety said the movie is "'Jaws' on dumbed-down steroids." The Hollywood Reporter called it "generically derivative." And in her review for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote, "The movie feeds us bite-sized, subtitle-friendly dialogue, finger-puppet characters and a string of brainless set pieces masquerading as a plot." If there's anything to hang onto, it's shots of Statham's impressive swimming skills, such as this scene where he channels Dory from "Finding Nemo."
WORLD FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS
8 p.m. on NBC. NBC airs the final programs of this year's competition, taking place in Saitama, Japan. The player to watch is Nathan Chen, who, at 19, is a freshman student at Yale and the defending world champion. If he comes out on top in the men's field, he will become the first American man to win back-to-back world titles since Scott Hamilton earned four consecutive championships from 1981 to 1984.
2019 NICKELODEON KIDS' CHOICE AWARDS
8 p.m. on Nickelodeon. DJ Khaled hosts this annual awards show live from Los Angeles. Among the stars attending, and potentially getting drenched in slime, are Chris Pratt (nominated for favorite "butt-kicker" for his role in "Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom") and Ariana Grande (her song "Thank U, Next" is also in the running for an orange blimp).
FUNNY WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE (2019)
9 p.m. on Showtime. Five female comics over the age of 50 perform stand-up on past relationships, aging and sex in this new special. Fran Drescher ("The Nanny") headlines while Carole Montgomery hosts. Some of the jokes, which are too raunchy to retell here, are aimed at younger women in the crowd -- not so much as advice but as warnings on what to expect as the years go by. Depending on your sense of humor, they will leave you cackling or mortified. Or both.
What's Streaming
THE DIRT (2019) Stream on Netflix. Move over Queen, it's Mötley Crüe's turn. This in-your-face biopic, adapted from the heavy metal band's 2001 memoir, holds very little back. Directed by Jeff Tremaine ("Bad Grandpa," "Jackass: The Movie") and starring Machine Gun Kelly, Douglas Booth, Daniel Webber and Iwan Rheon ("Game of Thrones"), the movie covers the group's internal tensions but focuses more on the members' antics: substance abuse, extreme recklessness and sexuality that would not have gone unnoticed in the #MeToo era.

We f--king get it, OK?

Autor: Felten, Eric.

Texto completo: Can we please stop the f--king cursing?

I had sworn I wouldn’t step foot in an Amazon bookstore. First the Bezos biz drives just about every brick-and-mortar bookshop into bankruptcy by offering free delivery of anything ever printed. And then, having made bookstores obsolete, what does Amazon do but open bookstores. It’s almost enough to make you cheer Elizabeth Warren’s war on the corporate giant.

But then, a week or two ago, I failed in my resolve. The proximate cause of my weakness of will was the car, which needed new tires. As it went up on the rack, and the pneumatic gunner started zwerling the lug nuts off, I needed to kill an hour. I ankled down the street, and the first storefront I encountered was an Amazon bookstore. I did a bad thing. I went in.

The first thing one notices about an Amazon Books is just how small it is. Online, Amazon insists it’s essential to have everything in the world at our fingertips, the digital universe at the command of our digits, if you will. By contrast, the physical Amazon store is severely limited and ruthlessly curated. What little shelf space the store has is squandered wantonly by facing all the books out so you see covers, not spines. It’s visually appealing, but it means the store, already stingy with its selections, only has room for about a quarter of the books it might otherwise be able to offer.

Wandering the few stacks, one of the first books I encountered was titled The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck . Sarah Knight wrote this work of genius in 2015. Since then, Knight has penned such beloved classics as Get Your Sh*t Together , published in 2016, and Calm the F*ck Down , published in 2018.

With such prodigious output, you’d think she had the naughty-word book market cornered. But it turns out there’s a Calm the F*ck Down by Sasha O’Hara. This second offering distinguishes itself by being “an irreverent adult coloring book.” The highly curated Amazon bookstore somehow found room for both.

The field of potty-mouthed authors has grown crowded these days, and most of them have their full book covers staring shamelessly from the Amazon shelves, just begging for us to be shocked and offended.

For a small shop with inefficiently used shelves, Amazon manages to make space for a surprising number of titles featuring a certain emphatic Anglo-Saxonism otherwise best suited to limericks. One or another letter is routinely excised from the w-rd. What is this nod to vestigial propriety? A recognition that the word is not to be said in polite company, even if there is no such thing as polite company anymore?

A gentleman who answers to the name Mark Manson offers us The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. A No. 1 New York Times' best-seller no less.

Jon Kim is author of I Used to Be a Miserable F*ck .

Showing a little creativity, or perhaps just cluelessness, is Gary John Bishop, who instead of titling his book Unf*ck Yourself misplaces the typographical fig leaf and gives us Unfu*k Yourself .

For the foodies, there’s F*ck, That’s Delicious by someone called Action Bronson. Zach Golden over-seasons the soup with What the FXXK Should I Make for Dinner?: The Answers to Life’s Everyday Question (in 50 F*@#ing Recipes) . And there is the cookbook from the Thug Kitchen that urges one to “eat like you give a f*ck.” It too has hit No. 1 on the NYT’s best-seller list.

And the New York Times' best-sellers just keep coming, such as F*ck Feelings by psychiatrist Michael Bennett and Sarah Bennett. Their previous title was F*ck Love .

Finally I spotted a book to buy, one I had been meaning to read for ages. And there at the Amazon bookstore it seemed positively demure by contrast. Which is why I’ve been reading A Clockwork Orange .

Eric Felten is the James Beard Award-winning author of How’s Your Drink?

Meet the lawyers representing Robert Kraft in the spa case

Texto completo: New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Fla., in January, along with nearly 200 other men in multiple counties, as part of a sweeping investigation into illicit sexual services at massage parlors. Authorities say these parlors were part of a human trafficking operation.
Kraft, through a spokesperson, has adamantly insisted he did not commit a crime when he visited the spa on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20.
The National Football League has said it is aware of the charges against Kraft.
Kraft has rejected a proposed deal that would have dropped the charges against him if he admitted he would have been proven guilty at trial.
Florida prosecutors plan to take the case to trial. Here are the lawyers who are representing Kraft:
Jack A. Goldberger Goldberger is a veteran Florida criminal defense lawyer. His former clients include Jeffrey Epstein, a Palm Beach financier who was accused of sexually abusing more than 80 underage girls. Epstein was ultimately convicted of procuring underage girls for sex.
Goldberger was part of a team of lawyers who worked with then-US attorney Alex Acosta to put together a non-prosecution agreement that let Epstein avoid federal charges, plead guilty to two state counts of felony prostitution, and serve 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail.
In February, the Justice Department opened an investigation into that 2007 plea deal.
William A. Burck Burck is a partner in the Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan law firm in Washington, D.C., but is not a member of the Florida bar.
He served as special counsel to President George W. Bush and played a role in screening documents related to Judge Brett Kavanaugh's time in the Bush administration as part of Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination.
Burck has also counseled current and former White House officials through their interviews with investigators, including President Trump's first chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trump's former strategist Stephen Bannon.
During his time as a federal prosecutor in New York City, Burck participated in the 2004 prosecution of Martha Stewart for obstruction of justice, a conviction that sent Stewart to prison for several months.
In another high-profile case, Burck represented Maureen McDonnell, who was indicted on corruption charges along with her husband, the governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell. Burck also represented FIFA, the international soccer organization, while it was being investigated by the Justice Department.
Burck has been described by his colleagues as disciplined, driven, intense, and passionate — especially about his favorite football team, the New England Patriots.
Alex Spiro Spiro is also a partner at the Quinn Emanuel law firm and is also not a member of the Florida bar.
He is a Tufts University graduate who worked five years at McLean Hospital in Belmont, where he supervised an adolescent treatment center and ran a “program for children with autism and Asperger's syndrome."
Spiro eventually shifted his attention to the legal profession, graduating from Harvard Law School. Since then, he has worked as a prosecutor in Manhattan where he prosecuted serial killers and was part of a conviction integrity team.
As a defense lawyer, Spiro represented Julian Edelman, the Patriots wide receiver who was suspended by the NFL for four games last season for using performance-enhancing drugs, ESPN reported.
He was also part of former Patriots tight end Aaron J. Hernandez's defense team in a 2017 double-murder trial, where Hernandez was acquitted.

Texto completo: James Kennerley's "Bach Birthday Bash" Wednesday evening at Merrill Auditorium was actually a day shy of the 334th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach's birth. But for anyone inclined to quibble, by the time Portland's municipal organist began his recital, it was well past midnight in Leipzig, where Bach spent much of his life; so on Bach's own turf, it was legitimately his birthday.
Like his predecessor, Ray Cornils, Kennerley is an outgoing player, eager to expand the audience for organ recitals, and to foster love and respect for the Kotzschmar organ by offering spoken introductions to the music at hand, personalizing their performances for listeners who might otherwise find organ recitals dry or otherwise off-putting. Their styles are a bit different: Where Cornils' showmanship extended to a sparkly wardrobe, Kennerley dresses in a plain black tuxedo, and discusses the music at greater length, usually with humorous asides.
Some might find Kennerley's introductions overly chatty, but given the absence of program notes, his approach makes sense. And the Friends of the Kotzschmar Organ's continued use of a large screen showing close-up views of the organ's manuals and pedals (and Kennerley's playing) helps as well, further reducing the distance between player and listener. In any case, the audience at Merrill was larger than it often has been for organ recitals, so these popularizing touches appear to be working.
One thing Kennerley's recital demonstrated was his openness to different, one might even say antithetical, interpretive approaches. Half the works on the all-Bach program - the Fantasia and Fugue in G minor (BWV 542), the Chorale Prelude, "Vor deinen Thron" (BWV 668), and the Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor (BWV 582) - were played with the scholarly orthodoxy you would expect from a musician who came through the Historical Performance program at the Juilliard School and who has worked plentifully with period-instrument ensembles.
That meant fairly reserved choices of tone color, reflecting the sounds of the organs available to Bach in 18th-century Germany, rather than the full, kaleidoscopic range of timbres available on the Kotzschmar organ. The only oddity, in this section of the program, was his decision to put the Chorale Prelude between the G minor Fantasia and Fugue, which are more typically played together. But it turned out to be a thoughtful move - an arrangement that recast the works almost as a sonata, with the dramatically dissonant Fantasy as the opening movement, the Fugue as a lively finale, and the quiet, serene Chorale Prelude, in a sublimely focused performance, as the central slow movement.
The program's opening work, Kennerley's transcription of the spirited Sinfonia that opens Cantata No. 29, "Wir danken dir, Gott" (BWV 29), was decidedly more freewheeling, in terms of registration, taking in many of the Kotzschmar organ's brighter colors, and using the instrument's five manuals to give the piece an orchestral heft and variety.
Kennerley's decision to transcribe this movement, originally for orchestra and choir, follows an impulse he could trace to Bach himself: Bach aficionados will also know it as the Prelude to both the Partita No. 3 for solo violin (BWV 1006) and the Lute Suite No. 4 (BWV 1006a).
For me, his transcription was only partially successful. It did capture the energy of the choral writing and the vitality of the perpetual-motion orchestral scoring. But the balances seemed off, with the choral sections overpowering the orchestral figures. I had a similar problem with Kennerley's more straightforward performance of the C minor Passacaglia and Fugue, where the crucial bass line sounded weak, almost whispered, in its first appearance.
The second half of the program was devoted to transcriptions as well - Kennerley's rescoring of the Italian Concerto (BWV 971) and a version of the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor (BWV 903) by the 19th- and early 20th-century composer Max Bruch. Both are more typically heard on the harpsichord, which has a very different kind of articulation than the organ - which made these transcriptions startling, at first.
It was hard to come fully to terms with the translation from the needle-sharp harpsichord sound to the sustained organ timbres in the opening movement of the Italian Concerto, but in the slow movement, the organ sound worked exquisitely, and it seemed natural in the finale, as well. Reger's version of the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue, by contrast, sounded as if it were written for an organ with the Kotzschmar's rich palette.
As an encore, Kennerley gave a vigorous performance of the "Gigue" Fugue in G major (BWV 577).

Democrats must really like losers

Texto completo: Look at the losers running, or considering a run, for the Democratic presidential nomination.
I don't mean that pejoratively. I mean it literally.
Beto O'Rourke's presidential candidacy is the ultimate expression of the participation trophy culture on the left. It used to be you had to win on the state level before taking the national stage. Barack Obama won a Senate seat from Illinois before immediately declaring his intention to run for president. At the time, that was considered pretty audacious. He hadn't accomplished anything in the Senate before he decided on a presidential run. But at least he won. O'Rourke lost his race to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., last year. He got a participation trophy. Apparently, he thinks that qualifies him to be the leader of the free world.
Well, he must have some accomplishments other than almost winning a Senate seat, right? Not really. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was flummoxed when asked what O'Rourke had accomplished in Congress, saying he "brought a great deal of vitality" to his work "preserving our planet and protecting our people." (In fact, O'Rourke passed a single bill, H.R. 5873, which renamed a courthouse in his hometown of El Paso.) Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa was questioned by Ed Henry on Fox News, "What would you say is Beto O'Rourke's top accomplishment that he brings to the table?" Hinojosa could not name a single one. "I'm not even talking about Congress," Henry said. "What has he done in his life?" "Your question is meaningless," Hinojosa replied.
So, if O'Rourke hasn't accomplished anything, he must at least have some clear ideas of what he wants to accomplish in the Oval Office, right? Nope. The Post reports that "unlike candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who launched their campaigns with clearly articulated policy platforms, O'Rourke focuses more on sweeping calls for unity and pitching himself as the best antidote to the country's toxic politics." The motivation for his run, apparently, is him. As Vanity Fair's Joe Hagan explains in a recent profile, O'Rourke "can't deny the pull of his own gifts." He tells a reporter, "Man, I'm just born to be in it."
He's not the only statewide loser taking the national stage. Stacey Abrams lost the governor's race in Georgia in 2018, yet national Democrats tapped her to deliver the official rebuttal to the State of the Union --- a task normally given to those who actually won their races. And now, The Post reports, she is considering a race for president as well. "I think that I am a skilled communicator," she said. "I think I'm a very good thinker. No, I know I'm a good thinker. I know I have policy chops. I have foreign policy experience."
Foreign policy experience? She served as minority leader of the state House of Representatives. Her official bio lists her as "former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations" (a temporary membership for young people) as well as "a Council on Italy Fellow, a British-American Project Fellow, a Salzburg Seminar-Freeman Fellow on U.S.-East Asian Relations, a Salzburg Seminar Fellow on youth and civic engagement and a Yukos Fellow for U.S.-Russian Relations." That might qualify her for an entry-level job at a left-wing think tank, but it hardly qualifies her to be commander in chief. Even O'Rourke can claim experience on the House Armed Services Committee.
Democrats point out that President Trump had never won statewide office before running for president. That's true. But he also had not run for state office and lost. He ran as a successful outsider, not as a failed insider. And unlike O'Rourke, he had actual accomplishments -- including a multibillion-dollar real estate empire.
This is not to dismiss O'Rourke's chances. He raised a whopping $6.1 million in his first 24 hours as a candidate, just edging out Sanders's first day haul of almost $6 million. That is the best of any Democrat running for president so far. As the New York Times noted, "In a single day online, he raised nearly a quarter of what Barack Obama, then a senator, did in the entire first quarter of 2007."
Apparently, Democrats like losers. We'll soon see if one can win the presidency.

What FBI's Counsel Told Congress; Baker's testimony shows Comey wasn't being fully candid about the dossier.

Texto completo: One problem with the Trump-Russia investigation is that the facts continue to be released in dribs and drabs. The unreleased House transcript of the testimony of James Baker, former general counsel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is Exhibit A for why it is so crucial for Americans to get full documentation, and soon.
Bits of the Baker transcript have leaked, including a few explosive lines about the FBI's musings over removing President Trump via the 25th Amendment. But it's his Oct. 3 and Oct. 18 interviews as a whole, which I have obtained, that make for revealing reading. Former Director James Comey worked hard in his own interview to play dumb regarding what the FBI knew about the political hit men who fed the bureau information about the Trump campaign. Mr. Baker was far more candid.
Mr. Comey and others at the FBI like to tell a tale in which the FBI obtained its dossier of Trump allegations via controlled interactions with one "reliable" source—dossier author Christopher Steele. Mr. Baker makes clear the FBI knew that Glenn Simpson, head of the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS, was papering Washington with his scandalous material—which the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign paid him to have Mr. Steele gather.
"My understanding at the time was that Simpson was going around Washington giving this out to a lot of different people and trying to elevate its profile," Mr. Baker testified. More important, the FBI understood it was the target of this pressure campaign. Mr. Baker acknowledges there were "various copies of the dossier floating around Washington," and that they were all being funneled to the FBI.
Mr. Baker explains that top FBI leadership was told Justice Department attorney Bruce Ohr "had some type of relationship" with Mr. Steele and "that somehow through that mechanism . . . information was flowing to the FBI." He says that his "longtime friend," the liberal Mother Jones reporter David Corn, also fed the FBI the dossier. "I know that David was anxious to get this into the hands of FBI. And being the person at the FBI that he knew the best, he wanted to give it to me." Mr. Baker admits that he "assumed" Mr. Corn got it from "Simpson or somebody acting on Simpson's behalf." He further admits a lawyer with ties to the DNC, Michael Sussmann, also passed along to Mr. Baker documents with Trump-Russia accusations.
The former general counsel even tacitly acknowledges that the dossier crowd knew exactly what it was doing in choosing its funnels. Evidence doesn't normally flow to the bureau through Justice Department lawyers or FBI general counsels. But Mr. Baker says that because of Mr. Ohr's "pre-existing relationship" with Mr. Steele, the FBI allowed Justice to play backchannel. And as part of questioning as to why other outsiders chose to come to him of all people, Mr. Baker admits that, well, anything coming from the general counsel's office would be taken seriously.
Mr. Comey and other FBI defenders also like to say the FBI had no reason to doubt Mr. Steele's reliability or motives, or to think the FBI might be subject to political manipulation. Mr. Comey declared in his own House testimony that "I don't even remember hearing the name Fusion GPS" and that it "didn't matter" who funded the work. But Mr. Baker's testimony makes clear the FBI was highly aware of Mr. Simpson and his reputation, and of the risk all this would blow up. The general counsel explained that the FBI's application to eavesdrop on Carter Page through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was one of the few he ever personally reviewed. Why? Because it was "sensitive" and "controversial" and targeted a person with "connections to a candidate for the office of President of the United States."
That, Mr. Baker said, was also why in its FISA application "we were obligated to talk about Simpson and what the hell we knew about him"—namely to "alert the [FISA] court to the fact that there were a range of issues with respect to the providence [sic] of this information and the relationship that we had with respect to Mr. Simpson and his credibility." Mr. Baker nonetheless fails to explain how that "range of issues" was communicated via the obscure footnote the FBI ultimately included in its application, which vouched for Mr. Steele and made only vague reference to an "identified U.S. Person" who might (or might not) have political motives.
As to Mr. Sussmann and his documents, Mr. Baker similarly says he "was concerned about the nature of this material from the first instance." He knew Mr. Sussmann was involved with the DNC and had also given his documents to the New York Times. Yet the FBI appears to have generally closed its eyes and ears to just how thoroughly it was being played.
The Baker interview is itself peppered with references to other documents—emails, FBI interviews, the file used to support the FISA application. It's past time Americans got the full story.

'There is not one category that you can stick a woman in': Hale Centre Theatre celebrates women with 'Steel Magnolias'

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — The year 1987 isn’t one popularly dubbed “The Year of the Woman” — as 1992 and 2018 have widely been — but it nonetheless had its notable moments for women.
Not only was it the year that Aretha Franklin became the first woman inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, but it was also the birth of Women’s History Month.
After several years of the Congress-decreed Women’s History Week, 1987 saw the National Women’s History Project successfully petitioning Congress to make March Women’s History Month, a celebration that has continued ever since.
And it was also the year “Steel Magnolias” opened off-Broadway.
Written by lawyer-turned-actor Robert Harling, “Steel Magnolias” features an all-female cast and tells the story of a small group of Louisiana women who gather at the local beauty shop to share in life’s challenges and triumphs. The play turned into a success that attracted a famous audience — Harling wrote an article reminiscing about the buzz around well-knowns such as Elizabeth Taylor, Cher, Lucille Ball and Bette Davis attending the show — and caught the eye of Hollywood, leading to the popular film adaptation in 1989 starring Sally Field, Shirley MacLaine, Dolly Parton and Julia Roberts (in her first Oscar-nominated role).
“I was probably around 17 (or) 18 when the movie came out, and I love the movie — still love it — … and I found that I related to it in some ways,” said actress DeLayne Bluth Dayton, who stars as M’Lynn in the Monday/Wednesday/Friday cast of Hale Centre Theatre’s version of the show, which opens in the Jewel Box Theatre on March 27. “It's a fictional group of women who are just really grounded in reality.”
Harling wrote the story as a way to process the death of his sister, who died in 1985 at the age of 33 due to complications from Type 1 diabetes — Shelby, Julia Roberts’ character in the film, is based on his sister — and never imagined the story would see any sort of continued success.
"I thought somebody would find it in a drawer when they were throwing out my stuff after I was dead," Harling told Country Living in 2017. "I had no illusions or delusions of grandeur."
Yet the story caught on, an achievement Dayton and actress Elise Pearce, who stars as Shelby in HCT’s Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday cast, attribute to the relatability of the characters and the way Harling captured the essence of women.
"It is so well-written (as if) from the mouth of women that it shocked me to find out that it was written by a man … I said, 'No, that sounds just the way women would phrase it,’” Pearce said with a laugh. “… The dialogue and the way the women chat and talk to each other, you can tell that the playwright was comfortable in this woman's world.”
Dayton echoed Pearce’s sentiments, stating that the characters Harling created aren’t caricatures or cartoony but instead “witty, and intelligent and real characters.”
“What I love the most is the variance in levels of what a women looks like in this show,” she said. “There is not one category that you can stick a woman in, and that's what's so amazing about it.”
A major characteristic of “Steel Magnolias” is the camaraderie among the characters, and a similar friendship has developed among the cast.
“There's a lot of laughter, and then really there's tears, and there's hugs, and there's just really tons of support … ,” Pearce said. “There's such a big age difference between all the women in the cast, and we all come from a variety of backgrounds and beliefs and everything, but the storyline of the show and the supportiveness of everything that this show is about really brings the whole cast together, and it's been really great.”
"As we have gotten to know each other, I have found nothing but support and love, creativity, absolute camaraderie,” Dayton said. “They are intelligent women, they are smart, they are hardworking, and that's what I have loved. It's a small cast, everybody is there to work and to help each other out, and I think that bleeds into the story.”
New York Times writer Maya Salam says that the past year has been a “year of the woman.” From a record number of women holding seats in the House of Representatives, the ever-growing traction of the #MeToo movement and more, the world looks different today than it did 30 years ago when “Steel Magnolias” hit theaters or when Harling penned the piece, but both Pearce and Dayton say the show’s message hasn’t changed.
"I think that maybe someone might say, 'Oh, we need it even more today.' We needed it always,” Dayton said. “It always needs to be there that women find whatever it is to help them feel empowered in whatever way that needs to be.”

Texto completo: Michael J. Bobbitt, who has built a track record of expanding audiences and developing new work as the leader of an award-winning children's theater near Washington, D.C., has been appointed the new artistic director at Watertown's New Repertory Theatre, it was announced Thursday.
Bobbitt, 46, whose tenure will begin Aug. 1, will be the fifth artistic director in the New Rep's 35-year history and the first African-American to hold the position. He will succeed Jim Petosa, who has infused the theater's programming with a sense of topical and political urgency in the past seven years. Petosa announced last fall that he would step down at the end of this season.
The appointment of Bobbitt to head the high-profile New Rep is occurring amid what a New York Times story this week described as “a major leadership transition" that is creating more diversity in nonprofit theaters nationwide. In an interview, Bobbitt told the Globe that he sees a primary task for theater leaders as “really looking at who your community is and making sure your community is reflected onstage." He expressed confidence he could do that at New Rep, which has an annual budget of $1.7 million and attracts 30,000 spectators per year to the Mosesian Center for the Arts.
“Theaters need to get to a place of equity, diversity, and inclusivity in a way that is more about social justice than about optics," added Bobbitt. “It's a big part of who I am. In many ways, it is why I do what I do. I've become obsessed with making sure that people that look like me and people from diverse backgrounds know it is their theater."
Even before he officially takes charge at New Rep, Bobbitt has taken a step toward sending that message. He said he collaborated with Petosa and New Rep managing director Harriet Sheets in choosing plays for the 2019-20 season, and it was his suggestion to include “Fences," a drama by the late August Wilson. The story of an African-American family in 1950s Pittsburgh headed by a trash collector anguished by the fact that his dream of playing Major League baseball was thwarted by racial barriers, “Fences" will be presented in April 2020.
There have been a couple of steps toward diversity in the leadership ranks of Boston-area theaters in recent years. In 2015, David C. Howse, who is African-American, became executive director of ArtsEmerson. Two years ago, Christopher V. Edwards, who is the son of a black father and a white mother and identifies as a person of color, was named artistic director of Actors' Shakespeare Project.
The New York Times story about increasing diversity nationwide among artistic directors cited a survey finding that of the 85 leadership jobs filled in the last four years, 41 percent were by women, with people of color accounting for 26 percent. However, one of the survey's authors told the Times that “The bigger the theater, the less likely the board is to hire a woman, and especially a woman of color." Last year, Linda Chin, who is Asian-American, was laid off as producing artistic director at Wheelock Family Theatre as Boston University moved to consolidate control over Wheelock College.
Bobbitt has served since 2007 as artistic director of Adventure Theatre-MTC, based in Glen Echo, Md. During his tenure, Adventure Theatre presented around 30 world premieres, and audiences grew from 15,000 to 45,000 per year (a number that came close to 100,000 if Adventure Theatre's touring productions were counted). He said he anticipates no difficulty transitioning from running a children's theater to overseeing one that caters primarily to adults.
“The production of youth theater is exactly the same as adult theater," said Bobbitt. “It's just that the audiences are tinier and the productions are shorter." A.W. (Chip) Phinney III, board chair at New Rep, said he has no concerns about Bobbitt making the transition, noting that New Rep will require some of the same skills Bobbitt has already proven to possess at Adventure Theatre. “Growing audiences, picking the right plays, leading the staff, partnering in the community — I think those are all transferable skills," said Phinney. Bobbitt brings a host of other skills to Watertown as well, having been a director, choreographer, playwright, dancer, singer, and actor during his career in addition to running a theater.
Phinney declined to specify the length of Bobbitt's contract but said, “We hope that he will be with us for a long time." Asked whether he hopes Bobbitt can attract a younger and more diverse audience to New Rep, Phinney replied: “We absolutely cherish the loyal audience that we have; they are tremendously important to us. But every theater wants to expand its reach and expand the range of its audience, its diversity. Certainly Michael has demonstrated that he can do it."
Bobbitt says he prefers the word “opportunity" to the word “challenge," but when he describes the broader challenge he will face at New Rep, he does so in terms that would probably have all the other artistic directors in the Boston area nodding their heads in agreement. “Art and commerce, marrying," he said. “Finding that sweet spot."

Texto completo: Sidney Lumet's "Network" is on TCM. And it's a night of Bourne and Bond.
What's on TV
NETWORK (1976) 10:15 p.m. on TCM. A recent staged reimagining has given this Paddy Chayefsky satire of TV-obsessed America a new life on Broadway -- but that doesn't mean the original movie version has lost its bite. Directed by Sidney Lumet, the film follows Howard Beale (Peter Finch), a land mine of a news anchor who, after learning that he is to be fired, goes on live TV and tells the county that he plans to commit suicide on air. He doesn't do it, but the episode garners high ratings, saving Beale's job and shaping the tenor of his subsequent newscasts, which become increasingly intense. Faye Dunaway plays a network executive. Dunaway and Finch won Oscars for their performances, as did Beatrice Straight, for a supporting role, and Chayefsky, for his screenplay. The film now runs alongside the very kinds of programming it seeks to skewer.
JASON BOURNE (2016) 7:44 p.m. and 10:04 p.m. on FXM. Throughout the 2000s, Matt Damon's amnesiac ex-C.I.A. operative Jason Bourne captured attention with few words. The cold, often intimate violence dispatched by Damon's quiet antihero in "The Bourne Identity" (2002), "The Bourne Supremacy" (2004) and "The Bourne Ultimatum" (2007) helped define action movies of the era. After nine years off, Damon returned in this continuation of the series. Its plot weaves in some global concerns from the time Bourne was away, including hacktivism, the growing influence of social media companies and mass surveillance.
What's Streaming
DIE ANOTHER DAY (2002) Stream on Netflix. The same year Jason Bourne arrived on the spy-movie scene to ramp up the violence and pare down excesses of the genre, Pierce Brosnan was firing rockets from an invisible car and fencing with an instructor played by Madonna in this, his final turn as James Bond. From its opening hovercraft chase to its grand-finale fight aboard an airplane, "Die Another Day" is about as over the top as possible. Halle Berry memorably stars opposite Brosnan as an N.S.A. agent. If this movie is too extravagant for your tastes, but you want more wisecracks than "Jason Bourne" makes, consider the decidedly darker CASINO ROYALE (2006), at 8 p.m. on Paramount Network; it features a Bond (Daniel Craig) for a post-Bourne world.
TURN UP CHARLIE Stream on Netflix. The English actor and actual D.J. Idris Elba plays a washed-up English D.J. turned nanny in this new series. His character is recruited to look after Gabrielle (Frankie Hervey), an 11-year-old troublemaker. That unlikely pairing becomes a source of both laughs and sentimentality, Mike Hale wrote in his review for The New York Times. Hale noted that the show mixed "lachrymose family drama in with the odd-couple farce." But, he added, "if you can live without seeing Idris Elba saying 'I'm adorbs' to an 11-year-old girl, you can live without 'Turn Up Charlie."'

On the Subway, Numbers Beat Letters in Service Every Day

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
Subway officials in New York City held a news conference recently to celebrate the system's progress. The on-time rate for trains hit 76 percent, they boasted, signaling a "renaissance" for the floundering system.
But that figure masks a surprising disparity.
While the numbered lines have seen a notable boost in reliability, many of the lettered lines are still delivering poor service. The F train has a miserable on-time rate of about 50 percent -- the lowest in the system.
"It seems like there's always something, from a sick passenger to signal problems," said Paul Galloway, an F train rider who lives in Brooklyn and works at the Museum of Modern Art. "It just seems like a cursed line to me."
It is clear that the subway is improving after hitting rock bottom in the summer of 2017, when a train derailed in Harlem and the on-time rate dipped below 65 percent -- the worst of any major transit system in the world. The subway's leader, Andy Byford, has won accolades for making the system more reliable.
But the diverging fates of the lines represented by letters and numbers can feel like A Tale of Two Subways -- a system where some riders see signs of hope while others continue to endure constant pain.
Subway leaders say there are several reasons for the gulf: schedule changes on the numbered lines that boosted the on-time rate; a computer system on the numbered lines that allows workers to more efficiently dispatch trains; the opening of the Second Avenue subway, which eased crowding on several numbered lines; and signal upgrades that improved service on another numbered line.
The trend has left some riders wondering how to game the system to get where they are going on time.
"The numbered lines have more stops, but they arrive more regularly and are less prone to problems," said Benjamin Kabak, who writes the Second Ave. Sagas subway blog and lives near several lines in Brooklyn. "Do you roll the dice and take the ideally faster way, or do you take the way you know is going to work?"
[Read more on why your subway train might start moving faster.]
The seven numbered subway lines are on time about 79 percent of the time, compared to about 68 percent for the fifteen lettered lines. Trains are considered on time if they reach the final stop within five minutes of the schedule.
One reason the lettered lines are lagging is that they have older equipment. Some lettered lines are slated to get modern signals, which should improve reliability. But Mr. Byford's plan to modernize the entire subway will cost billions of dollars, and it is not clear whether state leaders will approve new funding streams for the transit system this year.
Still, every line has improved as part of a broader effort to make trains run faster, said Sally Librera, the head of the subways department. Workers are increasing speed limits on parts of the system and replacing faulty signals that slowed trains.
Transit officials point to other statistics that show subway service is improving, including fewer major incidents that delay 50 or more trains.
"We recognize that we have more to do," Ms. Librera said. "But we're encouraged by the progress that we're seeing."
The subway now has its best on-time rate in four years -- a figure that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is highlighting as he presses state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing, a proposal to toll drivers entering the busiest part of Manhattan to raise money for the transit system. Mr. Cuomo, who controls the subway, is also pushing for reforms at the transit agency, though the State Senate issued a separate reform proposal.
Critics have raised concerns over the schedule changes in late 2017 that made it easier to ensure that certain numbered trains are on time. On the No. 6 line, five trains were eliminated at Grand Central Station in Manhattan during the morning rush from 7 to 9 a.m., according to documents obtained by The New York Times.
There were 68 trains scheduled on the 6 line during the morning rush in June 2017. The number fell to 63 last year. The on-time rate for the 6 train jumped to 72 percent in January, up from 52 percent in September 2017.
"I'm inherently skeptical when they say we changed the schedule, and now everything is running on time," Mr. Kabak said. "You're running the risk of padding the schedule."
[Read more on how NYC tackled subway crime and how it may be coming back.]
Subway officials denied padding the schedule and said the changes were needed to accurately reflect how long it took to route trains through the system.
"Adjusting schedules to accurately reflect actual system conditions allows for less train congestion and faster, more reliable service," said Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the system. "This, along with other significant factors such as the $800 million Subway Action Plan and deliberately improved operating procedures, have led to the recent subway performance gains."
Though fewer trains are scheduled, the same number of trains are running on the 6 line during the morning rush -- an average of about 61 trains, Mr. Young said. Officials also cut service on the No. 1 and 5 lines, which each lost two scheduled trains in Midtown Manhattan during the morning rush.
While fewer trains could help raise the on-time performance, they also can lead to more crowded trains and less capacity on the system. Each train can carry roughly 1,000 passengers.
Most riders never learned about the schedule changes. The authority's board did not approve them because they only vote on "major" service changes, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority. The schedule changes on the numbered lines were considered "minor" and the board was merely notified.
An investigation by The New York Times in 2017 revealed that the transit agency was running fewer trains. The Lexington Avenue line, which carries the 4, 5 and 6 trains, regularly failed to meet its schedule, effectively canceling dozens of trains and reducing the system's capacity by tens of thousands of riders. At Grand Central Station, just 77 of 90 scheduled trains regularly ran through the stop from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m.
For years, the lettered trains actually had better on-time rates than the numbered trains, but that shifted in January 2018, shortly after the schedule changes took effect. Ms. Librera cited two other factors behind the resurgence: The Second Avenue line opened on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in January 2017, drawing riders who had previously used the overburdened 4, 5 and 6 lines, which bolstered the on-time rate for those lines. New signals on the No. 7 line also improved service.
Most experts agree that the system is bouncing back. Andrew Albert, a board member who represents riders, said he noticed trains running faster along the Lexington Avenue line in Manhattan where they used to move at a snail's pace.
"Absolutely, it's getting better," he said. "I'm thwarted less often, and I notice the running times are much faster."

Reading Eagle to file for bankruptcy protection

Texto completo: The family-owned business that publishes the Reading Eagle newspaper is filing for bankruptcy protection.
Reading Eagle Co., which has published the Berks County newspaper for more than 150 years, announced its board of directors' decision to employees Wednesday afternoon, according to the newspaper.
The company, which also publishes the South Schuylkill News and operates WEEU 830 AM, will continue to publish and broadcast under Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules. It is seeking a buyer, the Eagle reports.
In a letter to readers, company officials said they recognize the company is "an integral part of the community."
"For more than a century you have taken us into your homes and supported us as we've told your stories and reported on the events and policies that shape your lives," officials wrote. "We hope you will stay with us as we move through this period of change."
Company President and CEO Peter D. Barbey told employees Wednesday that it has retained a media broker, Dirks, Van Essen, Murray & April, and has met with several potential buyers over the past few months, according to the Reading Eagle.
Douglas Arthur, managing director at media analyst Huber Research Partners, said papers such as the Reading Eagle are struggling, sustaining large print advertising losses without the capability to make up the difference by converting readers to high-paying digital subscribers. Compare that to a large national outlet such as The New York Times, which grew its digital revenue to $709 million last year and likely added at least 150,000 net digital-only news subscribers in the fourth quarter, according to Arthur, a research analyst covering the publishing industry.
But it is unusual for a paper like the Reading Eagle to file for bankruptcy, leading Arthur to speculate the company has a large debt obligation, such as a pension plan.
When he looks across the rapidly consolidating newspaper landscape, Arthur sees a couple potential suitors that could emerge for the Reading Eagle.
At the top is New Media Investment Group Inc., which owns GateHouse Media and has a significant Pennsylvania presence already. That includes the Pocono Record, Lehigh Valley Business and The Intelligencer, among others.
New Media, in fact, has been on a buying spree in recent years, spending more than $200 million on closed acquisitions last year, according to its website. That pushed its revenue up nearly 14 percent last year to $1.53 billion. On a same-store basis, however, it would have declined 5 percent.
Also in the running, Arthur said, will likely be Tribune Publishing, the owner of The Morning Call and several other papers across the country.
While there have been plenty of rumors about a Tribune sale or merger - which could still happen - the company recently put newspaper veteran Timothy Knight at the helm, which Arthur takes as a sign that the publisher is "settling in for the long haul." In addition, on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call last week, Arthur said the company mentioned it wants to do more deals like the one that brought The Virginian-Pilot newspaper into its portfolio last year.
Indeed, according to a transcript of the earnings call, Tribune Chief Financial Officer Terry Jimenez said the company has a "strong balance sheet" and certain key markets where it can strengthen its position.
Reading, about an hour from Allentown, could be one of those markets, Arthur speculated.
"That might make sense for them," he said. "That's the kind of property they are looking for."
Reading Eagle Co. has 236 full-time employees, the newspaper reports. It has a commercial printing subsidiary, REP, and launched a marketing and promotions company called Pretzel City Productions in 2015.
The newspaper has an average daily circulation of 37,000 Monday through Friday and more than 50,000 on Sunday, according to the Eagle. Its website averages more than 600,000 unique users and 3.2 million pageviews a month.
The paper was first published in 1868. In 1940 the company acquired competitor The Reading Times, which halted publication in 2002. It acquired the South Schuylkill News, a weekly newspaper, in 2015.
Also in 2015, Barbey acquired The Village Voice alternative weekly magazine through his private investment company. The New York publication stopped printing in 2017 and folded last year.

Texto completo: An article in the business section of The New York Times last month put the spotlight on how some companies regularly cheat their workers.
An example cited was two delivery services Instacart and DoorDash that deliver packages and merchandise like groceries to your homes for a fee. Both companies have come under fire for taking the tips customers voluntarily add to their bills for the courier and applying them instead to the employee's minimum pay.
In other words, if a courier is guaranteed a minimum of $10 for the delivery and the customer adds a $1 tip, the tip is considered part of the pay. Instacart winds up paying the worker $9 plus his $1 tip when, in fact, the worker should have received the minimum $10 and the $1 tip. Instacart, incidentally, is valued at $7 billion.
Outraged workers, convinced that Instacart was unfairly taking dollars from their paychecks, have stirred such an outcry that the service has announced it will change its policy and let the workers keep the tips.
That victory for the deliverers is the latest in a string of successful pressure campaigns by workers in the so-called gig economy. Drivers for the ride-sharing services Lyft and Uber recently won a minimum wage in New York City after months of agitating.
But the gig economy isn't the only segment where wage theft takes place. It's estimated that ruthless employers take about $50 billion from workers every year. A study by the Economic Policy Institute in 2014 insisted the figure was more than $280 billion.
Obviously, the practice occurs in Wisconsin and Dane County too. Taking the $50 billion figure and extrapolating the numbers means that it's likely $1 billion is missing from employees' wages each year in the state of Wisconsin, while Dane County workers could be shorted more than $80 million a year.
That's why the nonprofit Worker Justice Wisconsin was formed. It's a combination of what was the Workers' Rights Center and the Interfaith Coalition for Worker Justice and it has doubled-down on reaching out to workers who may be getting shorted on their earnings. The pity is that many of those who become victims either don't know what they can do or are afraid to step forward for fear of losing their jobs altogether.
It's easy to see why. Many who get shortchanged are the most vulnerable among us. It's estimated that the victims of wage theft are mostly low-income workers, especially minorities. Some 62.9 percent are Latino, 18.2 percent white, and 10.4 percent African-American.
Less than three years ago, the U.S. Department of Justice found that two dozen employers, mostly in hotels and restaurants, stole $700,000 from employees in the Dane County area.
And how was it done?
There are several ways, the DOJ's investigation revealed.
They include paying workers less than the legal minimum wage, failure to pay nonexempt employees time-and-a-half for hours worked in excess of 40 hours a week, and asking employees to work offthe- clock before or after shifts.
Other violations include making illegal deductions from wages earned and not giving the employee a pay stub, and misclassification of workers as independent contractors when they are really employees.
And, of course, the tipping scam.
Some employers are guilty of confiscating tips from workers or failing to pay tipped workers the difference between their tips and the legal minimum wage. (In Wisconsin, for instance, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, but wait-staff in restaurants can be paid as little as $2.33, and it's assumed the difference will be made up by the tips they receive. But, what is too often the case, they don't.) While some workers do get help from Worker Justice Wisconsin in the form of advice and even legal help, the problem appears to be growing. The nonprofit, located at 1602 S. Park St., could use all the help it can get in getting justice for workers who put in a good day's work, but wind up being shorted on their paychecks.
Cheating workers needs to be stopped. CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Dave Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison.com, 608-252-6410 and on Twitter @DaveZweifel.

Texto completo: The first drug specifically targeted at treating postpartum depression in new mothers has been approved, the Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday.
Brexanolone, sold as Zulresso, is delivered as a continuous intravenous infusion over the course of 60 hours, the FDA said. The New York Times reported the drug works quickly – within two days – and costs $20,000 or more.
"Postpartum depression is a serious condition that, when severe, can be life-threatening. Women may experience thoughts about harming themselves or harming their child," said Tiffany Farchione, acting director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that postpartum depression affects one in nine women nationally.
Postpartum depression is treated with counseling and medication that can take weeks to work, the National Institute of Mental Health said. Untreated postpartum depression can last for months or years, the institute said.

June 2017: We all know about postpartum depression, but have you heard of postpartum anxiety?
Zulresso will be available only from certified health care facilities through a restricted program called the "Zulresso REMS Program," the FDA said.
Jeff Jonas, CEO of Sage Therapeutics, the company that developed Zulresso, told CNN the drug will be available in June.
The FDA said it approved Zulresso after two clinical studies demonstrated the medicine outperformed a placebo at improving symptoms of depression over 30 days.
Those studies were sponsored by Sage, which is working to offer a pill version of the treatment, The Times reported.

IT'S SIMPLE: TRUMP ENCOURAGES VIOLENCE HE'S NOT TO BLAME FOR ANY SPECIFIC ATTACK, BUT HE IS FOR THE INCREASE IN WHITE-NATIONALIST FEROCITY

Texto completo: The president of the United States suggested last week that his political supporters might resort to violence if they didn't get their way.
The statement didn't get that much attention. I'm guessing you heard a lot more about the college-admissions scandal than about the president's threat of extralegal violence. So let me tell you a more about it.
In an Oval Office interview with writers from the right-wing news site Breitbart, Donald Trump began complaining about Paul Ryan. As speaker of the House, Mr. Ryan blocked efforts by other House Republicans to subpoena and investigate people on the political left. Mr. Trump's loyal allies in the House "wanted to go tougher," Mr. Trump said, "but they weren't allowed to by leadership."
To Mr. Trump, the incident was part of a larger problem: "You know, the left plays a tougher game. It's very funny. I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don't play it tougher. OK? I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump. I have the tough people, but they don't play it tough - until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad."
This wasn't the first time Mr. Trump had mused about violence, of course. He has talked about "Second Amendment people" preventing the appointment of liberal judges. He's encouraged police officers to bang suspects' heads against car roofs. He has suggested his supporters "knock the hell" out of hecklers. At a rally shortly before 2018 Election Day, he went on a similar riff about Bikers for Trump and the military.
I'm well aware of the various see-no-evil attempts to excuse this behavior: That's just how he talks. Don't take him literally. Other Republicans are keeping him in check. His speeches and tweets don't really matter.
But they do matter. The president's continued encouragement of violence - and of white nationalism - is part of the reason that white-nationalist violence is increasing. Funny how that works.
After Mr. Trump's latest threat, I reached out to several experts in democracy and authoritarianism to ask what they made of it. Their answers were consistent: No, the United States does not appear at risk of widespread political violence anytime soon. But Mr. Trump's words are corroding democracy and public safety.
His latest incitement fit a historical pattern, and one with "scary echoes," as Daniel Ziblatt, who co-wrote the recent book "How Democracies Die," told me. Mr. Trump combined lies about his political opponents - Democrats who need to be investigated (for made-up scandals) - with allusions to a patriotic, violent response by ordinary citizens. Latin American autocrats, including Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, have used this combination. So did European fascists in the 1930s.
The United States, thank goodness, does not have armed citizen militias carrying out regular attacks, as those other countries did. But our situation is still worrisome. "Violent talk can, at minimum, encourage lone-wolf violence," Steven Levitsky, Mr. Ziblatt's co-author and a Harvard political scientist, said. "It can also slowly normalize political violence, turning discourse and ideas that were once unsayable and even unthinkable into things that are sayable and thinkable."
These risks are not just hypothetical. In 2017, a House Republican candidate body-slammed a reporter who asked a probing question - behavior with no recent precedent. Mr. Trump praised the now-congressman, Greg Gianforte, for the assault. In the Bright Light Watch survey of political scientists late last year, only 49 percent said the United States did not tolerate political violence, a notable decline from earlier levels. Some respondents cited Mr. Gianforte.
Statistics on hate crimes are notoriously unreliable, but the evidence strongly suggests that they're rising. FBI data show an increase. The Anti-Defamation League reports a 73 percent rise in "extremist-related killings" during the past four years.
Not all attacks come from people who identify with the political right: The 2017 attempted mass murder of House Republicans on a baseball field is one horrific example. But most politically motivated attacks do come from the right. Last year, 39 of the 50 extremist killings tracked by the ADL were committed by white supremacists, and another eight were committed by killers espousing anti-government views.
Drawing a direct line from the purveyors of hateful rhetoric to any specific hate crime is usually impossible. And it's usually a mistake to try. The motive for these crimes - be it in New Zealand last week or Pittsburgh last year - is typically a stew of mental illness, personal anger and mixed-up ideology. Mr. Trump doesn't deserve to be blamed for any specific crime. But he does deserve blame for the trend.
It isn't very complicated: The man with the world's largest bully pulpit keeps encouraging violence and white nationalism. Lo and behold, white-nationalist violence is on the rise. You have to work pretty hard to persuade yourself that's just a big coincidence.

Amid the Backdrop of Violence, Afghans Celebrate a Cricket Win

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- If ever a team needed to win big for its fans' sake, it was this one -- at this moment.
On Monday, Afghanistan's beloved national cricket squad prompted cheers back home by winning its first-ever match in the Test format, the sport's highest level of competition.
The win, against Ireland at a Test match in northern India, is an increasingly rare commodity: a good news story in Afghanistan. Security forces there are fighting a desperate, bloody campaign against the Taliban, and many fear that if the United States reaches a deal with the insurgents, it could jeopardize human rights and the safety of ethnic minority groups.
"People are in love with cricket, and amid the news of suicide attacks, bombing of civilians and losses of security forces, it is the only thing that brings happiness," said Nazim Jar Abdurrahimzai, the game development manager at the Afghanistan Cricket Board.
Afghan fans have been jubilant on social media since the victory. The cricket board has said that celebrations are planned, and that some fans plan to greet the members of the team when they arrive at the Kabul airport on Wednesday.
Praise for the team has also poured in from cricket fans, players and organizations around the world.
Even the former cricket star Imran Khan, now the prime minister of neighboring Pakistan, which has tense relations with Afghanistan, congratulated the country on its "amazing successes in such a short period of their exposure to international cricket."
Afghanistan's first cricket team was founded more than a decade ago by players returning home from a refugee camp in Pakistan. The sport later grew into a national obsession, a status it already enjoyed across much of South Asia.
Afghan cricket stars like Rashid Khan are now mega-celebrities whose faces are plastered across billboards. Television channels and radio stations avidly follow their matches, and the local fan base has rapidly grown.
"Afghanistan's cricket team has surmounted obstacles unknown to most athletes -- terrorism, displacement, war -- and with flair and panache that have won admirers the world over," the cricket journalist Sidharth Monga wrote last year in the Opinion section of The New York Times.
Cricket's Test format, in which matches last up to five days, is the sport's most exclusive club. In 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the first new Test countries since Bangladesh was promoted to Test status in 2000.
In Afghanistan's inaugural Test match last year, the national team was routed by India in just two days. The team's coach, Phil Simmons, said at the time that while his players had a "huge" learning curve to overcome, they also had an admirable work ethic.
"Now we know that we have to work five times as hard," Mr. Simmons said.
The team's Test victory on Monday came on the fourth day of a match at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, in the northern Indian city of Dehradun. Afghanistan is now only the third country -- along with England and Pakistan -- to win after just two appearances at the Test level. (Only Australia won faster, on its first try.)
President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan called the victory "a proud moment for the whole nation."
Mohammad Nabi, one of the team's stars, vowed that it would not be Afghanistan's last. "If we can put up a good score on the board, then we are confident of beating any team in the world," he said.
A major challenge will come this spring, when the team makes its second appearance at the ICC Cricket World Cup in England and Wales. Although Afghanistan is ranked 10th out of 10 teams at the tournament, its captain, Asghar Afghan, said recently that the goal was not merely to show up but to win.

Sharaf Naib, 23, a construction worker in Kabul, said by telephone on Tuesday that he had already built a Cricket World Cup trophy -- out of snow -- in anticipation.
"This is the only thing that gives us a break from the ongoing violence and sad incidents happening in the country," he said of the cricket team's success. "It's our only social life."

Cookbooks Beyond the Kids' Menu

Texto completo: Children don't really need cookbooks that are written just for them. They can learn at your elbow the way children have for hundreds of years.
But cookbooks can be a great way to give kids a taste of ownership in the kitchen, normally a grown-up's domain. And for those adults who may not naturally involve their children in the kitchen, or who don't spend much time there themselves, handing your kid a cookbook of his or her very own can provide a nudge in that direction.
Also, many cookbooks for kids are just plain fun.
The list of children's cookbooks is long (and keeps growing), so I set off to find some of the best. A few books that rose to the top are classics that have been around for years. Others are newer to the landscape, but impressed me with their design and recipes that, while easy enough for a child to make, can be enjoyed by eaters of all ages.
Ask seasoned cooks about their favorite cookbooks for children, and Mollie Katzen's name is bound to come up. Ms. Katzen, a chef and author best known for "The Moosewood Cookbook," wrote three delightful ones: "Pretend Soup and Other Real Recipes: A Cookbook for Preschoolers & Up" (written with Ann Henderson, a teacher, and published by Tricycle in 1994); "Salad People and More Real Recipes: A New Cookbook for Preschoolers & Up" (Tricycle, 2005); and "Honest Pretzels: And 64 Other Amazing Recipes for Kids Who Love to Cook" (Tricycle, 2009).
[ Read more on the best tools for cooking with kids from Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times. ]
Ms. Katzen's goal with "Pretend Soup," she wrote, was to empower young children to take the lead in the kitchen with limited guidance from an adult. Throughout the three books, wholesome recipes with clever names like Salad People, Polka Dot Rice and Tiny Tacos share the pages with more sophisticated numbers, like cucumber soup, focaccia and mango-honey lassi. Each recipe is accompanied by simple, colorful step-by-step illustrations that make it easy for even the youngest cooks to follow along.
On one snowy day, my daughters and I made Counting Soup, a choose-your-own-adventure recipe from "Salad People." My 6-year-old helped me warm the vegetable broth on the stove while my 4-year-old helped me prepare the other ingredients, thawing frozen peas and corn, steaming green beans, grating carrots, cutting tofu into cubes and boiling stelline, the tiny star-shaped pasta. We laid them all out on the table like a buffet, and the girls counted as they dropped spoonfuls of ingredients into their bowls of warm broth.
The biggest hit was made-in-the-pan chocolate cake from "Honest Pretzels": a one-pan vegan chocolate cake that's both stirred together and baked in an 8-by-8-inch baking pan. My younger daughter loved making this, and it was surprisingly moist and tender for such a bare-bones recipe.
For the pasta-loving kid, there's "The Silver Spoon for Children: Favorite Italian Recipes," written by Amanda Grant and illustrated by Harriet Russell (Phaidon, 2009). It features more than 40 traditional recipes like risotto and minestrone, all adapted from "The Silver Spoon," a cookbook that appears in many Italian home kitchens. The book is written for children ages 9 and up, but my 6-year-old loved it, filled as it is with "grown-up food" that she can cook (mostly) by herself. When I handed it to her, she almost immediately started flagging recipes with Post-it notes.
We loved the book's sausage and beans, a simple dish of canned white beans, sweet Italian sausage, garlic cloves, fresh sage and apple juice that's baked in the oven. "Apple juice!?" my oldest daughter cried in disgust. They were both delighted when it worked, hitting all the right notes -- salty, sweet and creamy. It was delicious with crusty buttered rolls. My daughters made it again a few days later with their babysitter standing by. Bookmarked by little fingers for another day: hazelnut cake, homemade pasta and pizza Napoletana.
"Cooking Class: 57 Fun Recipes Kids Will Love to Make (and Eat!)" (Storey, 2015) and "Baking Class: 50 Fun Recipes Kids Will Love to Bake!" (Storey, 2017), both by Deanna F. Cook, offer recipes for a wide range of ages and abilities. Spiral-bound, with glossy, easy-to-clean covers, these cookbooks are bright and colorful, with recipes that range in difficulty from very easy (mug cake, salad dressing) to more complicated (crepes, spring rolls). They are perfect for children who want a thorough introduction to the kitchen, including basic rules for safety, vocabulary, setting a table and -- you're going to love this, parents -- cleaning up. They are written for children ages 8 to 12, but again, younger ones will find something for them here, too.
"Mama! Cake! In a mug!" my 6-year-old exclaimed. I was not excited about this recipe in "Baking Class," but cake baked in a cup in the microwave is tough for little ones to resist, so try it they did, and it worked like a charm. It's nothing fancy, but it's real cake. They made it themselves (I helped measure out the dry ingredients), and they loved watching it rise through the microwave window.
Some of the recipes skew cutesy, but these are kids' cookbooks, after all. When the weather turns warmer, the girls are looking forward to trying the Dig-in-the-Dirt Cake, from "Baking Class," a chocolate ice cream cake made to look like a garden, with chocolate-cookie-crumb "dirt" and "flowers" made of berries and mint leaves. There are plenty of practical recipes too, like omelets, biscuits and California rolls. If you buy both books, you'll find a few repeat dishes, but it didn't bother anyone in my house.
Both Sam Sifton, the food editor of The New York Times, and I are big fans of the American Girl cookbooks. The recipes are easy for children to follow, but worthy of the family dinner table -- dishes like turkey chili, rosemary roast chicken and sautéed green beans with almonds. There are eight books in the series (which Weldon Owen began publishing in 2016), many produced in partnership with Williams Sonoma; they include "Cooking: Recipes for Delicious Snacks, Meals & More" and, coming later this year, "Cupcakes: Delicious Treats to Bake & Share." My girls loved filling and folding the vegetable dumplings from "Around the World Cookbook: Delicious Dishes from Across the Globe," which was like a craft and a cooking project in one.
There are fewer step-by-step instructions and photos in these books, so readers will need a bit more experience, or adults will need to provide more hands-on help. But they are loaded with excellent recipes that are not dumbed down for children, which means that grown-ups will want to eat them, too. It's disappointing that the books are marketed solely to girls, because everyone could find something to love in them.
When your children are done cleaning up the kitchen (ha!), here are four books -- more memoirs with recipes than cookbooks -- they can sink their teeth into.
Two cookbooks by the chef Alice Waters -- "Fanny at Chez Panisse: A Child's Restaurant Adventures With 46 Recipes" (William Morrow Cookbooks, 1997) and "Fanny in France: Travel Adventures of a Chef's Daughter, With Recipes" (Viking, 2016) -- are full of classic recipes, beautiful watercolor illustrations and charming stories told from her daughter's point of view.
Laura Ingalls Wilder fans love "The Little House Cookbook: Frontier Foods from Laura Ingalls Wilder's Classic Stories" by Barbara M. Walker (Harper Collins, 1979). First published in 1979 (a revamped 40th anniversary edition was published in 2018), it contains more than 100 recipes, like pulled molasses candy and corn dodgers, alongside excerpts from the "Little House" "novels.
Older kids might enjoy "Relish: My Life in the Kitchen" (First Second, 2013), a funny and touching graphic memoir by Lucy Knisley, a cartoonist raised by a chef and a food lover. She recounts important moments in her life by what she was eating at the time.
Each chapter ends with an illustrated recipe, like spaghetti carbonara, that just might inspire your kids to head into the kitchen and make memories of their own.

Recipe: Baked White Beans and Sausage With Sage
This incredibly easy one-pan dinner is from the cookbook "The Silver Spoon for Children," with more than 40 traditional recipes adapted from "The Silver Spoon," a book that appears in many home kitchens in Italy. Older children with some experience can follow this recipe as is, but if you've got little ones who want to help, they can stir the sage, beans and apple juice together in a large bowl while the sausages bake, then you can pour the mixture into the hot pan. If you like your beans on the saucy side, add 1/4 cup more apple juice. Serve with buttered crusty rolls and something leafy and green.
4 sweet Italian pork sausages (about 1 pound)
2 whole garlic cloves (do not peel)
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 fresh sage leaves
2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
3/4 cup unsweetened apple juice
Kosher salt and black pepper
1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. In a roasting pan or 9-by-13-inch baking dish, prick the sausages all over with a fork. Add the garlic, drizzle with the olive oil and toss to coat. Bake until the sausages start to brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes.
2. Put on your oven mitts, take the roasting pan out of the oven and set it on a heatproof surface. Using tongs, carefully turn the sausages over. (The sausages will brown on the other side when they go back into the oven.)
3. Tear the sage leaves into little pieces and add them to the sausages along with the drained beans and apple juice. Give the bean mixture a stir.
4. Wearing your oven mitts, put the roasting pan back in the oven and bake until the bean mixture is warmed, about 20 minutes.
5. Put on your oven mitts one last time to remove the roasting pan from the oven. To serve, carefully stir everything together using a wooden spoon, and add a little salt and pepper to taste.
Yield: 4 servings

Recipe: Made-in-the-Pan Chocolate Cake
This surprisingly tender vegan chocolate cake is made entirely in an 8-by-8-inch baking pan: Just toss in the ingredients, stir until you don't see any flour streaks, then bake. For flourish, add a small handful of chocolate chips before baking or sprinkle the finished cake with a little confectioners' sugar. Adapted from Mollie Katzen's "Honest Pretzels: And 64 Other Amazing Recipes for Kids Who Love to Cook," this recipe was developed for kids, but adults love it, too. It's an ideal snacking cake, or you could gussy it up with a simple ganache frosting.
1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour
1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar
1/3 cup/30 grams unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/3 cup/80 milliliters canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar or white vinegar
2 tablespoons semisweet or vegan chocolate chips (optional)
Confectioners' sugar, for dusting on top (optional)
1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt to an 8-by-8-inch square glass or metal baking dish. Whisk the mixture together until uniform in color. Use your fingers to break apart any lumps.
2. Add 1 cup water along with the oil, vanilla extract and vinegar. Stir slowly with a fork or a whisk in small circles to blend. Mash, scrape and stir with a fork and spoon until the mixture becomes a smooth and uniform batter.
3. Scrape the sides of the baking dish with a rubber spatula and spread the batter in an even layer. Sprinkle with chocolate chips, if using.
4. Use a damp paper towel to wipe the edges of the baking dish clean. Carefully transfer the dish to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the batter comes out mostly clean, 28 to 33 minutes. (Instead of looking like you dipped the toothpick in chocolate frosting, it should look like it has some chocolate cake crumbs clinging to it.)
5. Remove from the oven, let cool, then cut the cake into squares. If you're feeling fancy, this tastes good (and looks pretty) with some confectioners' sugar dusted on top.
Yield: 9 to 12 servings

Recipe: Vegetable Dumplings
The Polish have pierogi, the Japanese have gyoza: Many of the world's cultures have some version of dumplings, whether they're filled with meat, cheese or vegetables, and baked, steamed, fried or boiled. This recipe is adapted from the children's cookbook "Around the World: Delicious Dishes from Across the Globe," from the American Girl cookbook series, and was inspired by the dumplings you might get at your local Chinese takeout spot. They're not necessarily authentic, but they are delicious, and folding and frying them is a fun weekend project for kids of all ages. You can use round or square wonton wrappers for this project, but don't forget the sauce: It's what makes these dumplings great.
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon packed light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon peeled and grated fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil (optional)
2 scallions, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons hoisin sauce
1 teaspoon peeled and grated fresh ginger
6 teaspoons canola oil, plus more as needed
1 cup finely shredded green cabbage
1/2 cup finely chopped cremini mushrooms
1/3 cup peeled and shredded carrot
Pinch of salt
Cornstarch, for dusting
24 round or square wonton wrappers
1. Make the dipping sauce: In a small bowl, whisk the soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, ginger and sesame oil (if using) until the sugar dissolves. Cover and set aside.
2. Make the filling for the dumplings: In another small bowl, stir together the scallions, soy sauce, hoisin sauce and ginger. Add 2 teaspoons canola oil to a large nonstick frying pan. Turn the heat to medium and warm up the oil for 2 minutes. Carefully add the cabbage, mushrooms and carrot and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add the scallion mixture and stir to combine. Transfer the dumpling filling to a medium bowl and let cool to room temperature. Wipe out the pan or clean it if necessary.
3. Once the filling has cooled, assemble the dumplings: Put 1 cup water in a medium bowl. Sprinkle a large rimmed baking sheet with 2 to 3 tablespoons cornstarch, using your fingers to evenly distribute it.
4. Lay 1 wonton wrapper on a clean work surface. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the dumpling filling in the center of the wrapper. Dip your fingers in the water and lightly moisten the edges of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half (if using squares, fold the wrapper in half diagonally to form a triangle) and press the edges together to seal. Place the dumpling on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with additional wrappers and the remaining filling until you've used up all the filling. (At this point, you can freeze some of the dumplings in a single layer on the baking sheet. Once they are frozen, transfer them to a resealable plastic bag and freeze for up to 3 months. Don't thaw them before cooking, but add a few minutes to the cooking time.)
5. Cook the dumplings: Brush the same frying pan with 2 teaspoons canola oil, set the pan over medium heat and warm up the oil for 2 minutes. Adding one dumpling at a time but working quickly, dust off excess cornstarch and add as many dumplings as will comfortably fit in a single layer in the pan (don't crowd them or they won't cook evenly). Let cook (no stirring!) until browned on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs, gently flip the dumplings. Carefully pour about 1/2 cup water into the pan (it will bubble up and steam!). Cover and cook until the water is mostly absorbed, about 4 minutes.
6. Transfer the dumplings to a serving platter and cover lightly with aluminum foil to keep warm. Repeat to cook the remaining dumplings, brushing the pan with 2 teaspoons canola oil before each batch.
7. Serve dumplings warm, with the dipping sauce.
Yield: About 24 dumplings

Recipe: Chocolate Mug Cake
If you Google "mug cake," you'll get more than 100 million results for the one-serving cake that's baked in a mug in the microwave. Yet finding the right recipe -- not too dense, not too sweet -- is harder than one might hope. This version, adapted from "Baking Class: 50 Fun Recipes Kids Will Love to Bake!" by Deanna F. Cook, is great, and requires just a few pantry staples. For a molten chocolate mug cake, sprinkle the top with some mini chocolate chips before popping it into the microwave, then remove it a few seconds early. This cute little cake may have been developed for children, but everyone loves it.
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 egg
A few drops vanilla extract
3 to 4 tablespoons granulated sugar, to taste
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
A pinch of kosher salt
1 teaspoon semisweet chocolate chips (optional)
Confectioners' sugar or vanilla ice cream (optional)
1. Microwave the butter in a microwave-safe mug in 10-second increments until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Crack the egg into a small bowl; add the vanilla and whisk to combine using a small whisk or fork. Pour the egg mixture into the mug over the butter and whisk to combine.
2. Add the sugar, cocoa powder and salt and whisk until mostly smooth (a few lumps are O.K.). Scrape down the sides the best you can with a spoon or a small silicone spatula. Sprinkle with mini chocolate chips, if desired.
3. Cook in the microwave on high for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean. Sift a little confectioners' sugar on top or serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if desired. Dig in with a spoon.
Yield: 1 serving

Texto completo: After years of declining readership and endless newsroom cuts, the new owner of the Los Angeles Times is setting a high target in his effort to turn the company around.
Biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, who acquired the long-struggling paper in June from Tribune Publishing Co . for $500 million, said the Times needed to build its digital-subscriber base to five million paying customers.
"I have made a decision to invest what it will take to make sure that the Los Angeles Times remains a viable business for at least another 100 years," Dr. Soon-Shiong said in an interview. "If we get to five million ultimately, that will make that possible."
The target is no small task, as the Times now has 150,000 digital-only subscribers, the company said—almost double what it had when Dr. Soon-Shiong took over.
Dr. Soon-Shiong didn't set a timeline for achieving the goal, but pointed to the digital-subscriber growth numbers posted by the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as proof that it is possible.
He said he envisioned the L.A. Times as a kind of superregional news source, with its primary focus on being the paper of record for California's 40 million residents, rather than trying to compete directly for a national audience with the New York Times or Washington Post. But he also wanted to expand the L.A. Times's audience reach into Mexico, western Canada and across the Pacific Rim, as well as into surrounding states.
The New York Times ended 2018 with 3.4 million digital subscribers, with 2.7 million paying for the news product and the rest subscribing to the lower-cost cooking and crossword apps. That is more than three times what it had three years ago, and the Times recently set a digital subscriber target of 10 million by 2025.
The Journal closed 2018 with 1.71 million digital subscribers, more than double what it had at the end of 2015.
Dr. Soon-Shiong's ambitious digital-subscriber goal is just one step in a broader turnaround effort. He said he had already invested an additional $150 million into the company since closing the deal to acquire the Los Angeles Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune and a string of southern California community papers last summer.
The money has primarily gone to rebuilding the Times newsroom, which has grown to 525 employees from around 400. There has also been significant investment in technology and the creation of a new 10-acre campus that now serves as the Times headquarters after the paper last summer moved out of its historic downtown building.
An inventor of cancer drugs and a biotech investor worth $7 billion, according to Forbes, Dr. Soon-Shiong said he now considered rebuilding the Times his primary occupation.
His purchase of the newspaper followed years of turmoil at the storied paper since it was acquired by Tribune's predecessor company in 2000. The company was later split in two after emerging from a lengthy bankruptcy.
In recent years, Tribune Publishing, which also owns the Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun and New York Daily News, fended off an unsolicited buyout effort , muddled through a much-mocked name change to Tronc Inc., and underwent a contentious shareholder fight pitting Dr. Soon-Shiong against the primary owner, Michael Ferro. Since selling the Times to Dr. Soon-Shiong, the company has returned to being called Tribune Publishing and is now up for sale.
He said the reliance on digital-audience growth for sustainability has been made necessary by what he called the "unfair usurpation" of advertising revenue by giant tech platforms such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc.
"They freely use all the amazing journalism work being produced locally, regionally and nationally while drawing away the revenue stream," he said. "At some point, something will have to be done to address that, because it has become an unfair breach of the infrastructure of democracy."
A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment. Google has said it was committed to helping publishers succeed in increasing their online advertising revenue and expand their other lines of business.
His concern over the dominance of Facebook and Google, which together control close to 60% of the digital-advertising market, according to eMarketer, comes amid increasing calls for government regulators to get involved.
Last week, the Australian unit of the Journal's parent company, News Corp, called on Australian regulators to break up Google's digital-advertising business. Last year, News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch publicly advocated for Facebook to pay publishers fees similar to those cable distributors pay to television channels.
In the U.K., DMG Media Limited, owner of the Daily Mail , has asked regulators to force Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp and compel Google to spin off YouTube.
Dr. Soon-Shiong also said he remained committed to producing a print product for the foreseeable future, despite circulation that has fallen 68% in the past decade on weekdays to 233,000, and 54% on Sunday to 477,000, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.
"We will be the last man standing when it comes to print," he said.

Texto completo: Mark Bittman wants you to know he's not dead.
Since his departure from The New York Times in 2015 to join a food start up, Mr. Bittman has had the unsettling feeling that people think he's six feet under.
"It was like I kind of fell off the map," Mr. Bittman said.
But the 69-year-old journalist and author of 20 books, including "How to Cook Everything," is very much alive. And now he is going to work for Medium, the online platform and publisher, to head Salty, an online magazine focused on food.
"This is something I've wanted to do for a long time," Mr. Bittman said in a phone interview from the South by Southwest conference this month in Austin, Tex. "I pitched it to several different people and came close a bunch of different times."
Mr. Bittman wrote for The Times for three decades and started his column "The Minimalist" in 1997. It lasted until 2010. He spent five years as an opinion columnist and food writer for The New York Times Magazine. Over 1,200 of Mr. Bittman's recipes can still be found in The Times's Cooking section and app.
He has bounced around since leaving The Times. He spent less than a year at Purple Carrot, a vegan meal-kit start-up. He wrote a column for New York Magazine and Grub Street. He started a newsletter. He posted recipes on his personal website. All along, he said, he had the idea of creating his own publication.
"If I dropped dead tomorrow," he said, "is there something we've done that can last?"
Salty, which is making its debut on Tuesday, will comprise recipes, stories related to food and more.
"There's a large part of me that wants people to be interested in food agriculture, or policy, or kids, or immigrants, or race," Mr. Bittman said.
There will be no articles on restaurant openings, think pieces on super foods or profiles of celebrity chefs, he added. Some of the stories he has lined up go into racism in restaurants, how to buy an egg and how your relationship to food changes when you become a parent.
"We're doing practical stories that will help people see food in a way they haven't seen it before," Mr. Bittman said.
Alongside Mr. Bittman at Salty are Melissa McCart, the dining critic for The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; Daniel Meyer, a former restaurant critic for Time Out New York; and Kate Bittman, Mr. Bittman's daughter and a public relations consultant.
Salty is one of several publications planned by Medium. Digiday reported in February that the site was hiring for four original online publications. So far, there are OneZero, on technology, and Human Parts, a health publication that Medium recently revitalized.
Ev Williams, the founder and chief executive of Medium, said more original publications and partnerships were in the works. Among them are a quarterly publication, GAY, created with the author Roxane Gay, a contributing opinion writer for The Times.
Last year, Medium invested $5 million in publishing. This year, Mr. Williams said, it's "several multiples of that." The new publications are meant to increase the number of Medium subscribers, who pay $5 a month or $50 a year.
"It's a really good thing that the market is being retrained to pay for quality content," Mr. Williams said.
Medium is free of ads, and its chief executive plans to keep it that way.
"We're optimistic that there's a better way for creators and consumers of information," Mr. Williams said. "Once the market breaks its addiction to advertising, that will be better for everybody."
The size and budget of each new publication will vary. Salty will receive bigger investment than others, he said, although he did not disclose how much. "He's cutting edge in his category, and he has a following," Mr. Williams said of Mr. Bittman.
Mr. Bittman said he didn't want to have total control over what Salty published, recognizing that he may not find the same things interesting that younger readers do.
"I don't want to be the ultimate arbiter of what we're running," he said.
He said he also liked that Medium was not beholden to the news cycle or obvious clickbait.
"I like their attitude," Mr. Bittman said. "They don't promote stupid stuff. They really promote good things. It's like someone is awake there."

Worse living through synthetic chemistry

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- On Feb. 12, Joaquin Guzman Loera, aka “El Chapo,” was convicted of multiple crimes related to running the Sinaloa drug cartel, Mexico’s largest.
Thirteen days before his conviction, authorities seized enough of the synthetic opioid called fentanyl for 100 million lethal doses. It was hidden in a truck carrying cucumbers through the Nogales port of legal entry. On Feb. 28, authorities at the port of Newark inspecting a container ship that had arrived from Colombia found inside a container supposedly filled with dried fruit 3,200 pounds of cocaine, worth $77 million on U.S streets.
This was two days after Don Winslow published “The Border,” the final volume in his 1,900-page trilogy of novels (“The Power of the Dog” and “The Cartel”) about the cartels and the U.S. “war on drugs.” He could hardly have arranged a better launch for his book, which is already on best-seller lists.
His thesis is that the war on drugs resembles the Vietnam War in its futility and its collateral damage to Mexicans, more than 250,000 of whom have died and another 40,000 have disappeared, according to the Financial Times, in the past dozen years from violence associated with rivalrous cartels and law-enforcement measures.
Those endless photos of confiscated sacks of drugs do resemble old photos of dead Vietcong -- body counts of replaceable bodies. El Chapo, 61, will die in a U.S. “supermax” prison, and his incarceration -- he has been in custody since 2016 -- will make no difference regarding drug flows.
The mayhem and sadism Winslow describes are, he says, derived from credible reports. Wonder what the Central Americans who trek through Mexico to the U.S. border are fleeing? Read Winslow’s description of a 10-year-old Guatemalan living off a garbage dump, alert for trucks bringing garbage from the better neighborhoods.
Winslow might be right about sinister involvements of some U.S. financial institutions in handling the cartels’ billions. He could, however, have omitted the thinly -- very thinly -- disguised President Trump, and his son-in-law who knowingly uses cartel money to rescue himself from a bad Manhattan real estate bet. One reason to read fiction is to avoid reading about those people. However, the upward of $40 billion in profits made from the $150 billion U.S. market -- 30 million consumers of illicit drugs -- must go somewhere. First, to Mexico, “so much cash,” Winslow says, “they don’t even count it, they weigh it.” But then where?
Every day 4,500 trucks pass, necessarily with usually minimal inspection, through three legal entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border. Any wall would be irrelevant to interrupting drug shipments. As is the strategy of bringing down cartel kingpins. The New York Times reports that in 2016 and 2017, when El Chapo was in custody, “Mexican heroin production increased by 37 percent and seizures of fentanyl in places like Nogales more than doubled.”
The “supply side” attack on drugs is frustrated by, among other things, geography and the torrent of south-north commerce. The “demand side” is frustrated by declining prices (the supply-side failure) for increasingly potent products, such as fentanyl, which has passed prescription opioids and heroin in overdose deaths. Made from chemicals, not crops, and patented almost 60 years ago, it is mixed with heroin for an extra kick -- and if doses are not carefully calibrated, a lethal kick.
Says New York University’s Mark A.R. Kleiman: In 1979, a milligram of pure heroin sold for about $9 in today’s prices; today it costs less than 25 cents. “Fifty grams of fentanyl -- just over an ounce and a half -- has the punch of a kilogram of heroin, and it’s way, way cheaper.” Three hundred micrograms -- “roughly the weight of a grain of table salt” -- can kill. And dealers are not precise chemists.
“We have,” Kleiman says, “about 30 times as many drug dealers behind bars today as we had in 1980” but today’s dealers employ cellphones, texting, social media and home delivery. In the most recent Global Drug Survey, Kleiman says, “cocaine users around the world reported that their most recent cocaine order was delivered in less time, on average, than their most recent pizza order.”
He notes that serious cultural change has taken 50 years regarding tobacco, yet it is “still much more widely used than any of the illicit drugs except for cannabis.” And “the fentanyls aren’t going to be the last class of purely synthetic and super-potent recreational chemicals; they’re just the first.” Worse living through chemistry, even if it disadvantages the crop-growing cartels of Winslow’s epic.

Texto completo: The public on Tuesday will see the search warrant and other documents related to last year’s FBI raids on the home and office of Michael Cohen.
What we might learn: The origin of the investigation, the timeline of events, what investigators were looking for in their search and other details into the case of President Donald Trump’s former attorney and fixer.
U. S. District Judge William H. Pauley III on Monday ordered redacted versions of the documents to be released after nine news organizations, including ABC and CBS News, The Associated Press, CNN and The Wall Street Journal, sought to unseal them citing high public interest and a right to access.
In a Monday statement, Cohen’s lawyer Lanny Davis said the release of the documents furthers Cohen’s interest in “continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organization to law enforcement and Congress. ”
More: Did Trump keep his 19 promises to insulate himself from his business? Only he knows.
Opinion: Michael Cohen only flipped because he got caught. That's all we can expect in the Trump era.
Prosecutors had opposed the request, saying disclosure “would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties. ”
The judge’s order will allow for the redaction of information that could impact ongoing investigations. Cohen’s personal information — including phone numbers, email addresses and housing details — will be redacted, according to Pauley’s order.
Pauley acknowledged the media organizations’ point in a 30-page filing on February: “The public interest in the underlying subject matter of the materials — which implicates the integrity of the 2016 presidential election — is substantial," the judge wrote, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
In December, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison by Pauley for crimes including lying to Congress and paying two women to keep quiet about alleged affairs with Trump. He is scheduled to report to prison in early May.
Cohen went before Congress in February to testify about illegal activities and lies he said he did on Trump’s behalf, labeling the president as “a con man” and “a cheat. ”
Of Cohen’s testimony, Trump said, “It was pretty shameful, I think,” adding that Cohen’s appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was a “fake hearing. ”
The New York Times, New York Post, Newsday and the Daily News were also among the news organizations in the legal action to access the Cohen documents.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Top congressional Democrats on Monday asked the FBI to conduct investigations of a Florida woman who started a day spa later alleged to be a front for illegal prostitution and who allegedly sought to sell to Chinese citizens access to events with President Trump and his administration.
The request from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D., N.Y.), along with their Senate counterparts, focuses on Cindy Yang, a U.S. citizen born in China who founded and then sold a massage parlor that was the center of what Florida authorities said was an illegal prostitution ring . New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and two dozen other men were charged late last month with soliciting prostitution.
Ms. Yang wasn't implicated in that prostitution sting, which began after she sold the business. But after the charges were announced, the Miami Herald reported on her efforts to network with Mr. Trump and introduce members of the Chinese Communist Party to South Florida's political scene, including by offering to sell access to events at Mr. Trump's private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.
"If true, these allegations raise serious counterintelligence concerns," the Democrats wrote to Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. "China has frequently used non-traditional intelligence collectors and businesspersons to compromise targets," they said in asking the FBI to conduct investigations "into credible allegations of human trafficking, as well as unlawful foreign lobbying, campaign finance, and other activities by Ms. Yang."
Ms. Yang's lawyer, Evan W. Turk, said he would address the Hill accusations later. "We have seen the Democratic partisan letter and allegations," he said in a statement. "Our firm will represent our client, and her interests as an American. This seems to be another politically driven fishing expedition."
The Republican National Committee, which was part of the Trump fundraiser that Ms. Yang attended, said it denies any wrongdoing by the party or Trump campaign. "We only accept donations in accordance with the law," an RNC official said in a statement. "If we do see any evidence of illegal contributions we report it to the proper authorities. If we were notified by the authorities that a donation were illegal, we would return the money."
Ms. Yang, who also goes by Li Yang, and her husband, Zubin Gong, started a business called GY US Investments LLC in December 2017, according to Florida business records. The company's now-deleted website describes it as working to "assist businesses in America to establish and expand their brand image in the modern Chinese marketplace" and touts its ability to connect clients with events featuring Mr. Trump, according to pages captured by the internet archives .
The congressional letter was also signed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. The lawmakers asked for a response by March 21.
"Although Ms. Yang's activities may only be those of an unscrupulous actor allegedly selling access to politicians for a profit, her activities also could permit adversary governments or their agents access to these same politicians to acquire potential material for blackmail or other even more nefarious purposes," they wrote.
Ms. Yang was photographed with Mr. Trump at his March 2018 re-election fundraiser at the club. Ahead of the event, she contributed $5,400 to a Trump re-election committee, according to Federal Election Commission reports.
The fundraiser's invitation said donors who raised $50,000 from their networks could be photographed with the president. The New York Times reported that at least nine people in Ms. Yang's orbit made the maximum campaign contribution, and quoted a donor who declined to answer a question about whether Ms. Yang had reimbursed her. It is illegal to make a campaign donation in another person's name.
Among other things, the Democrats asked about the counterintelligence risks posed by Ms. Yang's alleged activities and whether other individuals used Mar-a-Lago for similar purposes, "particularly by offering foreigners access to the President, those close to him, or other senior officials in exchange for money."

Texto completo: A popular traveling exhibit that uses real human bodies dipped in plastic to teach anatomy and life science is returning to Michigan this fall.
The "Bodies Revealed" exhibit, which opens at the Grand Rapids Public Museum on Nov. 16, features preserved "real, whole and partial body specimens." Tickets are expected to go on sale in the fall.
It will be the first time the exhibit has returned to Grand Rapids in nearly a decade.
Kate Kocienski, the vice president of marketing and public relations at the museum, told the Free Press that "Bodies Revealed" is on tour by a company called Premier Exhibitions, Inc., and the bodies have been maintained via a "polymer preservation process."
The museum's page for the exhibit said that more than a dozen full human bodies and hundreds of organs will be "respectfully displayed to tell the story of the miraculous systems at work within each of us."
"Bodies Revealed allows people to learn about their own bodies and, ultimately, teach how to take better care of one's own health and make positive lifestyle choices," the site said.
The museum said people of all ages are welcome to observe the skeletal, muscular, nervous, digestive, respiratory, reproductive and circulatory systems, and added that many of the specimens will be in "vivid athletic poses" that offer an understanding of "everyday motions and activities."
Other body specimens on-site will illustrate damage that can be caused by habits, like overeating, smoking and lacking exercise, the site said.
In the past, similar displays have generated controversy, as reported by news outlets from around the world – including, the Irish Times, BBC, The New York Times, NPR and more – largely because of questions about how these individuals died and whether or not the bodies were used with consent.
The bodies that will be on display at the Grand Rapids Public Museum in the fall were donated with consent for the remains to be used for medical research, including public education, Kocienski said. She added the bodies have come from universities in China, primarily from Nanjing Medical University.
This is also not the first time exhibitions like this have come to Michigan museums to drum up interest in science, anatomy and health.
According to the Huffington Post, a traveling exhibit that also featured preserved human bodies, called "Bodies Human," came to the Michigan Science Center in 2012. It was one of the special exhibits promoted as marking the re-opening of the science center, which the Huffington Post reported was known as the Detroit Science Center and closed in 2011 because of financial issues.

Joke's on them: Bribing your way into Yale is a waste of money

Texto completo: By Faye Flam

Bloomberg Opinion

Any parents who bribed and cheated to get their kids into elite universities would be buying into a pervasive misconception. It's easy to assume that because students from elite schools make more money (they do), that going to those schools is what causes them to make more money. This is wrong.

How do we know? When researchers have investigated the value of going to a top high school or college, they've found the long-term financial benefits are, as one paper says, "comparable to zero." That is, students with the same abilities and ambitions will do equally well whether they go to an elite college or not. It's the kids who make the school -- not the school that makes the kids.

In one telling study, a team of Princeton University economists followed students of comparable test scores and grades who applied to the most elite high school in the Boston area - Boston Latin. Some were admitted and others were rejected. The researchers also looked at comparable students accepted and rejected by second-tier selective high schools in the Boston area.

Boston Latin boasts much higher average SAT scores than second-tier schools, and those in turn boasted of higher SATs scores than the nonselective schools. The implication is the quality of education at these elite education boosts SAT scores.

But when the economists compared students with similar grades and test scores at the time they applied to high school, they found their later SAT scores were indistinguishable, whether they went to Boston Latin or not. The economists did the same comparison between similar students applying to second-tier schools and those attending unselective high schools, and again found SAT scores were indistinguishable.

The findings suggest there was absolutely no SAT advantage to going to the better schools. The higher average SATs in Boston Latin were probably caused by the selection process; the schools only admitted kids who did well on other tests, and those other test scores correlate to SAT scores.

This is all laid out in the book "The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success," which I've been rereading. As the author, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, wrote: "We've established that, as a group, the Boston Latin kids do perform better when compared to their counterparts. ... What the data tells us, though, is that the difference ... is not because the school enhances their performance. It's because high achievers continue to excel no matter what education a school offers."

Another pair of economists, one also at Princeton University and the other at the research firm Mathematica, demonstrated that going to an Ivy League school doesn't help people make more money. They found it's more likely that Ivy League schools select for the kinds of students likely to make more money as adults.

In an initial study in 2002 and a follow-up study published in 2011, they compared students at Ivy League schools to those who were accepted but chose, perhaps for financial or personal reasons, to attend less selective colleges. In the second study, they also included students who had applied to Ivy League schools but were not accepted.

On average, Ivy League graduates come out earning twice as much as graduates of less selective schools, but when the researchers compared only students who were accepted into the Ivy League, there was no difference between those who went and those who did not, provided those rejected graduated from some other college.

The 2011 study, which was popularized in this New York Times column, showed that future financial success for comparable students didn't even hinge on where they were accepted, but did correlate with where they applied. The researchers speculate that applying to Harvard shows ambition, and ambition is correlated to financial success.

If the Ivy League bribery scandal played out as prosecutors suggest, with parents paying off officials, then some of the applicants deserve sympathy -- for they are, like everyone else, limited by their own talents and ambitions. And those honest families trying to follow the rules can take heart that even if the cheaters hadn't been caught, they wouldn't have bribed their way into anything of lasting value.

Texto completo: Student protesters demand more action on climate change
WASHINGTON - Students across a warming globe pleaded for their lives, future and planet Friday, demanding tough action on climate change.
From the South Pacific to the edge of the Arctic Circle, students in more than 100 countries walked out of classes to protest what they see as the failures by their governments.
More than 150,000 students and adults who were mobilized by word of mouth and social media protested in Europe, according to police estimates. But the initial turnout in the United States did not look quite as high.
"Borders, languages and religions do not separate us," Havana Chapman-Edwards, 8, who calls herself the tiny diplomat, told hundreds of protesters at the U.S. Capitol. "Today we are telling the truth and we do not take no for an answer."
The "school strikes" were inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, 16, who began holding solitary demonstrations outside the Swedish parliament last year.
Since then, the weekly protests have snowballed from a handful of cities to hundreds, fueled by headlines about the impact of climate change during the students' lifetime. Unless emissions of heat-trapping gases start dropping dramatically, scientists estimate that the protesters will be in their 40s and 50s, maybe even 30s, when the world will reach dangerous levels of warming that international agreements are trying to prevent.
Thunberg, who has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, said at a rally in Stockholm that the world faces an "existential crisis, the biggest crisis humanity ever has faced and still it has been ignored for decades."
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was inspired by the student climate strikers to call a special summit in September to deal with what he called "the climate emergency."

French begin work on analysis of recorders in deadly jet crash
HEJERE, Ethiopia - Analysis of the flight recorders of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines plane has begun, the airline said Friday, and The New York Times reported that the pilot requested permission "in a panicky voice" to return shortly after takeoff as the plane dipped up and down and appeared to gain startling speed.
President Donald Trump in a phone call with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed praised the state-owned airline "as a strong institution" and affirmed U.S. support after Sunday's plane crash killed 157 people, Abiy's office said.
The Times report cited "a person who reviewed air traffic communications" as saying controllers noticed the plane was moving up and down by hundreds of feet.
French authorities have said it is unclear whether data could be retrieved from the recorders.

EPA bans consumer sales of paint stripper linked to deaths
WASHINGTON - The Environmental Protection Agency is banning consumer sales of a paint stripper after personal appeals by families of men who died while using the product.
The final rule announced Friday bars the manufacture and import of consumer products containing methylene chloride.
The EPA is urging consumers not to use it.
The consumer bans begin 180 days after the rule is published. The EPA says it expects retailers to implement it sooner. The rule doesn't affect commercial uses.
California says it's tracked at least five deaths since 2014 among people overcome by the fumes from methylene chloride.
Families of victims had met with Trump administration officials and lawmakers urging the ban.

Senate to probe if DOJ officials discussed removal of Trump
WASHINGTON - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham says his panel will investigate a claim by former FBI Director Andrew McCabe that Justice Department officials once discussed using the Constitution's 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office.
McCabe has said that after former FBI Director James Comey was fired in May 2017, officials at the department, including McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, discussed bringing the Cabinet together to consider using the amendment to remove Trump. The Justice Department said in February that department leaders did not believe there was any basis for invoking the 25th Amendment.
Graham sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr.

High court expands April 23 census arguments
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court will try to resolve all the legal issues about a citizenship question on the 2020 census.
The justices Friday are expanding their April 23 arguments to include whether asking about citizenship would violate the Constitution's call for a once-a-decade count of all people, not just citizens. The court was considering whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add a citizenship question is arbitrary and capricious under federal law.
The court is hearing the Trump administration's appeal of a federal judge's ruling in New York that the decision violated federal law. A judge in California said a citizenship question also would violate the Constitution.
A final answer about a citizenship question is needed soon to allow printing of the census questionnaire.

U.S. airline cites safety in halting flights to Venezuela
FORT WORTH, Texas - American Airlines is stopping flights to Venezuela because of safety concerns after the pilots' union told its members to refuse to work the flights.
American was the last major U.S. carrier to fly to the troubled country. It flew daily to Caracas and Maracaibo from Miami.
The airline said Friday that it temporarily stopped the flights as it evaluated conditions in Venezuela, where civil unrest has increased amid opposition to President Nicolas Maduro.
The airline's decision followed a union president's order Thursday night that American Airlines pilots refuse Venezuela assignments.
United Airlines and Delta Air Lines stopped flying to Venezuela in 2017, and several foreign carriers have also pulled their flights in recent years.

Stitches for Sanders: Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign said the Vermont senator has been treated at a walk-in clinic for a minor injury while campaigning in South Carolina.
Campaign spokesman Arianna Jones told reporters that Sanders cut his head on the edge of a glass shower door Friday and went to a walk-in clinic.
She said Sanders, 77, received a half-dozen stiches and was given a "clean bill of health."
Jones said Sanders is continuing with all scheduled events, including a roundtable on health care, in South Carolina.
Sanders will travel to Nevada ahead of his first rally in the early voting state since launching his presidential bid. The rally will be held Saturday.

Texto completo: Comedian, actor and writer. That's just a short list of the talents of Josh Wolf.
One could add husband and father to the list.
It's also a list that Wolf is incredibly proud of and it's taken a lot of hard work to get there.
“Every night when I get off stage, I take a moment to think, ‘This is my job. Oh, my God,'” he says in a recent phone interview. “I know how lucky I am and for sure don't ever take it for granted.”
Wolf will perform three shows at The Stage at Santa Ana Star beginning today.
The shows will be his first in New Mexico.
“It has taken me a long time to get out there,” he says. “There aren't too many comedy clubs in New Mexico. I'm hoping I get the opportunity to come back after this round.”
If you know Wolf's work, you might say he's everywhere.
He was often a regular guest on the series “Chelsea Lately,” as well as being a guest on “After Lately.”
He also was a finalist on the fourth season of NBC's “Last Comic Standing,” as well as roles on “My Name is Earl” and “Raising Hope.”
Wolf also spent some time on the New York Times best-seller list with his 2013 book, “It Takes Balls: Dating Single Moms and Other Confessions From an Unprepared Single Dad.” The book told Wolf's adventures as a struggling stand-up comedian, while being a single parent in Los Angeles.
Today, he tries to find balance in his life.
He's married to filmmaker Bethany Ashton Wolf.
“Everything we have to do becomes part of the routine,” he says. “It doesn't ever get easy to leave home. My wife is incredibly understanding, because she can be gone for months at a time too. It works for us.”
Wolf is known for his honest look at daily life.
He is constantly challenging himself by not getting complacent, which means writing daily.
“The set is always constantly moving and is a changing piece of art, because it has to be,” he says. “In today's world, there's so much competition from my peers. They keep upping the game, and as a touring comedian, I have to do the same thing. Back in the 1980s, comedians were able to tour for years with one set. Once your set is recorded by an audience, I feel that I have to change up my set and come up with new jokes. It's constant work.”
‘FAIRLY NORMAL' WITH JOSH WOLF
WHEN: 7 p.m. tonight; 7 and 9:30 p.m. Saturday, March 16
WHERE: The Stage at Santa Ana Star, 54 Jemez Dam Road, Santa Ana Pueblo

Conservative lawyers steal page from progressive playbook

Texto completo: For liberals, legislative defeats are just a temporary setback until the real battle begins in court.
Whether it’s environmentalists shutting off water to Central Valley farms or the ACLU demanding sex changes for prisoners, left-wing groups have long used the courts to advance their political agenda. Now, the Resistance has taken it one step further with 46 taxpayer-funded state lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Conservatives have been quick to criticize activist judges legislating from the bench and slow to match the left’s artful use of lawfare as a political tactic — until now. Conservatives are slowly awakening to the importance of lawfare and how legal challenges can thwart the progressive agenda.
What can conservative lawfare accomplish?
Harmeet Dhillon, my RNC counterpart and California RNC committeewoman, just filed suit seeking to prevent the powerful teachers’ unions from taking dues via mandatory paycheck deductions/
Dhillon is following last year’s Janus decision, which restored the First Amendment rights of thousands of union workers. The National Education Association lost 72,325 dues-paying members. More than 6,000 teachers left the New York State United Teachers. According to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, 86,000 workers in California dropped their unions over the past year. That’s a 5 percent net drop in union enrollment.
“Until Janus, California’s government unions could force public servants to pay the unions,” explains Mark Bucher, founder and CEO of the California Policy Center, which has helped educate union members about their rights. “That coercion allowed union leaders to collect $2.7 million per day — about $1 billion per year. No other political player in the state even comes close, and that makes our union leaders the unelected rulers of California.”
Conservative lawfare is challenging fake news peddled by the mainstream media. Nicholas Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School student unfairly vilified for attending a pro-life march, filed suit against the Washington Post and CNN for “using its vast financial resources to enter the bully pulpit by publishing a series of false and defamatory print and online articles … to smear a young boy who was in its view an acceptable casualty in their war against the president.”
News reports that Sandmann’s attorneys have “sent preservation letters to more than 50 media organizations, celebrities and politicians — including The Post, The New York Times, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and actors Alyssa Milano and Jim Carrey — the first step in possible libel and defamation lawsuits.”
Last year’s Supreme Court 7–2 decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop gave the owner permission to refuse certain services based on his First Amendment claim of free speech and free exercise of religion. The conservative lawfare Alliance Defending Freedom took the case to the Supreme Court, defeating the ACLU.
Harmeet Dhillon represented the Young America’s Foundation and Berkeley College Republicans in their legal challenge to UC Berkeley’s censorship of conservative speakers Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter and David Horowitz. Under the settlement, UC Berkeley not only changed its “Major Events Policy” and security fee schedule but also paid out $70,000 in attorney’s fees. My firm along with Freedom X 1st Amendment pioneer Bill Becker represent several injured participants at the Berkeley riots when Milo attempted to speak.
Conservative lawyers throughout the country are fighting battles defending the First, Second and Fifth Amendments with success. Nonprofit law firms such as the Pacific Legal Foundation, the libertarian Center for Individual Rights and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty are making dramatic legal precedents and proliferating. George Mason University renamed its law school the Antonin Scalia Law School. Spontaneously, hundreds of lawyers and firms are building a nationwide movement of conservative lawfare warriors to challenge the progressive agenda. This is a big step toward developing a national network of conservative and libertarian lawyers to share tactics toward defeating the left.

Texto completo: FORT MYERS, Fla. — Picked-up pieces from another 10 days hunkered down in the Fort:
■  The Red Sox are a wagon. They have 22 of 25 players back from a 119-win season. They have the best starting staff in baseball. They will score a ton of runs. Most of the competition in the American League stinks. The Sox are going to make the playoffs, even if everything goes wrong. They are vulnerable in only one area, and we all know what that is . . . the bullpen.
The bullpen wasn't great last season, but Craig Kimbrel was out there, and so was hot-and-cold Joe Kelly. Now both are gone and the Sox have not addressed this area.
It feels a little arrogant. It feels as if the Sox worked it out last year and feel they are smart enough to work it out again in absence of all evidence.
Please don't tell me that they fixed things in the playoffs and therefore they can fix things now. The reason they fixed things in the postseason was because they used starters Chris Sale, Rick Porcello, David Price, and Nathan Eovaldi NINE times out of the bullpen in October. That is not a sustainable system for the 162-game season.
So what do you say, Dave Dombrowski?
“I think we'll be ready," answered the Sox baseball boss. “A few of the guys we haven't seen. Matt Barnes. Ryan Brasier. Heath Hembree. We haven't seen much of them. We just need to get them out there and have them ready, which we still have a couple of weeks to do.
“Any time you have unknowns . . . I still think we have ability out there. We have some guys who have been successful at the major league level. I understand there's no proven closer and until somebody gets out there and does that, there's always an uncertainty, but we think we have enough ability there to get the job done.
“We know why this gets so much attention. It's hard to say anything about our starting rotation. It's one of the best in baseball. Our positional players — we led the league in runs scored — and our defense was good and almost everybody is back.
“So the one area where there's any change is the bullpen. With rare exceptions, bullpens seem to get a lot of focus when I talk to other clubs. It's an area that is kind of up and down from year to year and gets a lot of attention in that regard. We'll be fine out there, I believe. Give the guys a chance and we'll see what takes place."
■ I'm not a fan of baseball's anything-for-a-buck partnership with big-time gambling. The DraftKings connection was bad enough, but now MLB demands that managers send in the daily lineup cards 15 minutes before it public. It's outrageous and begs for corruption. How can MLB keep punishing Pete Rose with all this going on?
■  Also not a fan of relievers being required to face at least three batters (or finish a half-inning), which will start in 2020. It's artificial and tampers with legitimate strategy.
■  Stunned by the lengths parents go to in order to get their kids to elite colleges and universities? Perfect College Match, a company that helps high school pitchers get college scholarships, reports parents scheduling unnecessary Tommy John surgery for their sons in hopes that the boys will come back throwing harder than before. Nice.
■  Quiz: Kenley Jansen will become the all-time leader in games pitched for the Dodgers when he gets into his eighth game this season. Who holds the current record? (Answer below.)
■  Theo Epstein to the New York Times: “In the second half [of 2018] we completely fell apart offensively." The Cubs boss said it probably was an anomaly, but added, “If not, then we're not who we think we are, and we'll have to make sweeping changes. We'll find out this season."
■  Aaron Judge plans to eliminate his distinctive leg kick when he has two strikes on him.
■  I believe the Red Sox would have won the 1986 World Series if Tom Seaver didn't suffer a season-ending injury in September. Seaver compiled a 3.80 ERA over 16 starts with the Sox after Lou Gorman acquired him for Steve Lyons (Cy Young for Psycho) in midsummer.
■  After Carl Yastrzemski noted that producers of the “Impossible Dream" record cut off his head in the album's cover illustration (Yaz said it was to prevent them from paying him royalties), a reader asked if the album art was conceived by the late Eddie Stanky. It was Stanky, you old-timers will recall, who foolishly called Yaz “an All-Star from the neck down" in 1967.
■  Why we will always love the New York Post: In the first days of spring training, the Post ran a piece from Tampa on Jacoby Ellsbury's latest injury. The article included a photo of Ellsbury in a batting cage with a cutline (file photo — of course!). Ellsbury, who signed a seven-year, $153 million contract in 2013, has missed 290 of a possible 810 games with the Yankees thus far. GM Brian Cashman said he expects Ellsbury in camp any day now.
■  Some of us are legitimately happy to see Alex Rodriguez engaged to Jennifer Lopez. Then there's attention-seeking Jose Canseco, who fired off a series of vile tweets charging A-Rod with cheating on J-Lo. Every outrageous Canseco missive is accompanied by a phone number in case you to want hire Jose for a boxing match or maybe a kid's birthday party.
■  The Red Sox attempted to simulate the left-field wall at Fenway when they built JetBlue Park. But Fenway South is nothing like the real thing. The wall in Fort Myers has fans seated behind netting in the upper third of the faux Monster. “I hate it," says Sox left fielder Andrew Benintendi. “They got that net right in the middle and that screws up everything. The other day there were two balls off the net, and one dropped straight down and one shot back toward right. It's not very realistic."
■  One more note on Benny. Born in Cincinnati in 1994, he has been a Bengals fan his whole life. This is not easy. “I've never seen a playoff win, not in my lifetime," says Benintendi. “Marvin Lewis had 16 years. You've got to win in the playoffs and he had seven chances at it. I still root for them even though it's tough sometimes."
■  Julia Ruth Stevens, the adopted daughter of Babe Ruth, died last week at the age of 102. She was a delight. She spent much of her life in New Hampshire and threw out a ceremonial first pitch at Fenway in July 2016 to mark her 100th birthday. When I asked her about the Curse of the Bambino back in the late 1980s, she said, “Daddy never would have done something like that." Years later, she said, “Mostly I think it's a myth, but it is a coincidence definitely that there's been many, many, many years since the Red Sox managed to win a World Series."
■  There's a sign on the Sox clubhouse wall offering car shipping for Sox players who want their spring vehicles moved to Boston after the team leaves spring training. There's a specific fee assigned to what type of vehicle the player wants shipped and it states that the car should have no gas and contain “no more than 200 pounds." When Manny Ramirez saw that sign in 2004, he asked one of the clubbies, “What about me? I weigh 205. That's more than 200 pounds." The clubbie informed Manny that he would not be inside the car during transport.
■  Check out Danny Knobler's “Unwritten: Bat Flips, the Fun Police, and Baseball's New Future." Meanwhile, Bud Selig's memoir, which had no less than three ghostwriters (including Red Sox exec Dr. Charles Steinberg), is due out this summer. Careful not to drop it on your toe.
■  Great moment at Alex Cora's postgame press conference Tuesday at JetBlue. As the manager was attempting to explain his team's six-game preseason losing streak, video of his epic 18-pitch at-bat (which culminated with a home run) magically came on the television in the interview room. Cora quickly switched the topic and narrated his epic at-bat against the White Sox in 2004. “You foul pitches off and then you hit homers," he said.
■  A national media person asked me what I think of the prospect of Epstein someday coming back to Boston to buy the Red Sox.
■  Quiz answer: Don Sutton.

Texto completo: Alita: Battle Angel' ***
PG-13 - 2:22 - This film entry into the manga world of artist Yukito Kishiro, imagined for the screen by producer James Cameron and director Robert Rodriguez, crams in so many plot lines that it risks being overstuffed. Yet it somehow stays true to its mesmerizing vision and emerges as a sci-fi success, if not a triumph. Associated Press
'Arctic' ***½
PG-13 - 1:38 - Overgard (Mads Mikkelsen) crash-lands his plane in the Arctic and struggles to survive. It's the kind of film that might make you want to sign up for a wilderness survival class as soon as you walk out. Associated Press
'Bohemian Rhapsody' **½
PG-13 - 2:15 - As Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, Rami Malek delivers a committed, thoroughly inhabited performance, which winds up transcending the regrettably thin material at hand. Washington Post
'Bumblebee' ***
PG-13 - 1:53 - While hard-core fan-boys may complain it's too soft, this film may turn out to be the perfect way to save "Transformers." This charming tale of a girl and her adorable car-robot flips the script on the tired, bloated franchise. Associated Press
'Captain Marvel' **
PG-13 - 2:04 - Marvel's first female-led film tells the story of a woman overcoming her own self-doubt and the forces that control her to discover latent powers that can literally save the world. It's just the kind of feminist myth we need when our male leaders seem so feckless. Washington Post
'Captive State'
PG-13 - 1:49 - The residents of a Chicago neighborhood carry on after a decade of occupation by extraterrestrial forces. With John Goodman, Machine Gun Kelly, KiKi Layne, D.B. Sweeney, Vera Farmiga. Directed by Rupert Wyatt. Not reviewed. Los Angeles Times
'Escape Room'
PG-13 - 1:40 - Six strangers find themselves in circumstances beyond their control and must use their wits to find the clues or die. Directed by Adam Robitel. Not reviewed.
'Everybody Knows' ***½
R - 2:12 - Members of a large extended family and their friends gather in Spanish wine country to celebrate a wedding, but the focus turns to a teen girl's disappearance. Starring Javier Bardem and PenÃ©lope Cruz. Washington Post
'The Favourite' ***½
R - 2:01 - Oscar winners Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone play a pair of women sucking up to England's Queen Anne in the 18th century. You'd swear they have paid staffs of comedy writers hidden beneath their voluminous skirts. Star Tribune
'Fighting With My Family' ***
PG-13 - 1:48 - Siblings raised by WWE-obsessed parents aspire to the big-time while participating in the family's regional, ragtag wrestling business. The solo writing-directing debut of Stephen Merchant ("The Office") is based on a true story and a colorful documentary. Associated Press
'Glass' **
PG-13 - 2:09 - Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan reminds us he is the ultimate mastermind, the king of the twists. But the true master at work is James McAvoy, who reprises his role from "Split." Tribune News Service
'Green Book' ***½
PG-13 - 2:10 - Movie based on a true story recounts a 1962 road trip when a Bronx-bred Italian-American (Viggo Mortensen) was hired to drive a renowned black pianist, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), to concert engagements across the Deep South. Directed by Peter Farrelly. Associated Press
'Greta' *
R - 1:38 - Psychological thriller starring ChloÃ« Grace Moretz is a maddeningly mixed bag. With nods to "Fatal Attraction" and "Single White Female" -- not to mention homages to Brian De Palma -- "Greta" feels as time-warped as its title character's cozy but slightly confining apartment. Washington Post
'Happy Death Day 2U' **½
PG-13 - 1:40 - Unnecessary sequel actually does a bit more than just regurgitate "Happy Death Day" (2017), posing questions that other slasher films wouldn't touch. Washington Post
'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' **½
PG - 1:44 - Third movie brings the franchise to a close with an affectionate chapter that continues the adventures of the Viking boy-turned-chief Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his faithful dragon, Toothless. Associated Press
'Isn't It Romantic' ***
PG-13 - 1:28 - Rebel Wilson plays a woman who hates rom-coms -- until she bonks her head and ends up in one herself. Associated Press
'The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part' ***
PG - 1:46 - The innocent-looking Lego Duplo characters introduced in the first movie turn into invading space aliens in the sequel. Featuring the voices of Chris Pratt, Will Arnett, Alison Brie, Tiffany Haddish, Charlie Day and more. Chicago Tribune
'The Mule' *
R - 1:56 - The film is a fairly straightforward adaptation of a true story from the New York Times Magazine, but the racist cultural stereotypes and appalling treatment of women are all thanks to screenwriter Nick Schenk and director Clint Eastwood. Tribune News Service
'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' ****
PG - 2:00 - A biracial kid (voiced by Shameik Moore) takes up a legendary superhero mantle in this multidimensional mind-trip from Sony Pictures Animation. The seventh Spider-Man movie to hit the big screen feels more like a one-of-a-kind, wall-crawling experience. Washington Post
'They Shall Not Grow Old' ****
R - 1:39 - Director Peter Jackson's immersive, haunting and often transcendent film about World War I is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Made with restored, colorized footage from the Imperial War Museum. Associated Press
'Triple Frontier'
R - 2:05 - Set in an unnamed area of Latin America, the core story is a heist movie of the familiar "one last job" variety. Starring Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam and Garrett Hedlund. No star rating provided. Los Angeles Times
'Tyler Perry's A Madea Family Funeral'
PG-13 - 1:42 - Tyler Perry reprises his role as the cantankerous matriarch in this entry in the comedy franchise. With Cassi Davis, Patrice Lovely. Written and directed by Perry. Not reviewed. Los Angeles Times
'The Upside' One-half star
PG-13 - 2:06 - A lazy, skirt-chasing ex-con (Kevin Hart) accidentally gets a job taking care of a wealthy businessman who became a paraplegic (Bryan Cranston). It's based on a true story, but it's predictable and lacking in drama and laugh-out-loud moments. Associated Press
'What Men Want' *
R - 1:57 - Taraji P. Henson tries a little too hard in a predictable, gender-switching remake of the 2000 romantic comedy "What Women Want." This time, a woman unlocks the power to read men's minds. Associated Press
'Yardie'
NR - 1:41 - Idris Elba directs this drama about a Jamaican man in 1980s Britain seeking revenge for his older brother's murder years earlier in Kingston. With Ami Ameen, Shantol Jackson, Stephen Graham. Based on a novel by Victor Headley. Not reviewed. Los Angeles Times

J&J loses another talc case A California jury Wednesday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $29 million to a woman who claimed that asbestos in its talc-based powder products had caused her cancer. The Alameda County Superior Court jury found that Johnson & Johnson knew about the potential risks its baby powder was contaminated but failed to warn the woman, Teresa Leavitt. Leavitt received a diagnosis of mesothelioma in August 2017. Her lawyer, Joseph D. Satterley, said she had used Johnson & Johnson talc products for more than 30 years. Johnson & Johnson said it was disappointed with the verdict, citing “serious procedural and evidentiary errors in the proceeding," and would appeal. The company has said decades of testing showed that its baby powder did not contain asbestos or cause cancer. More than 13,000 plaintiffs have sued Johnson & Johnson over what they say are cancers caused by its talc products. The New York Times reported last year that the company spent decades trying to keep negative information about the potential risk of asbestos contamination from reaching the public. In July, a jury in Missouri awarded $4.69 billion to 22 women who claimed that asbestos in Johnson & Johnson products caused them to develop ovarian cancer. — NEW YORK TIMES
TECHNOLOGY
Facebook exec to leave as company recovers from outage Facebook said a change in the way it configured computer servers caused a widespread outage of the social-media network and its other services that stretched over two days. "As a result of a server configuration change, many people had trouble accessing our apps and services," Facebook said in a tweet. "We've now resolved the issues and our systems are recovering." From about noon New York time Wednesday, global users encountered only partially loaded pages or no content at all on Facebook's main social network and its related services, including Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Meanwhile, Facebook also disclosed that chief product officer Chris Cox will leave, the highest-ranking leader to depart since the social-media giant became embroiled in crisis last year. The move follows Facebook's decision to integrate its apps more tightly and use more encryption, a big shift from the company's current focus on public sharing. “This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through," Cox said in a Facebook post. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Fight continues over lost funds for ski-area development The former owner of Vermont's Jay Peak resort is fighting claims from a court-appointed receiver that it should pay millions in damages as part of a settlement. Canadian Saint-Sauveur Valley Resorts Inc. says the federal receiver in the case assumed liability when he took over in 2016, according to the Caledonian-Record newspaper. SSVR says the settlement would prevent the company from filing its own claims against the businessman who bought the ski resort. Court records show SSVR used the federal EB-5 program to fund development at the resort before selling it to Ariel Quiros. The federal Securities and Exchange Commission says Quiros then used the funds to buy the resort and bilked investors out of more than $250 million. The federal receiver has not responded to a request for comment. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
FINANCE
Trump nominee closes in on World Bank job The Treasury official nominated by President Trump to be the next president of the World Bank has cleared a major hurdle, with nominations for the position closing with no other candidates emerging. The World Bank says David Malpass was the only candidate put forward by the bank's 189 member countries. Malpass is currently the undersecretary for international affairs at Treasury. The position came open in February when Jim Yong Kim, who had been nominated by the Obama administration, announced he was stepping down. The World Bank said the bank's 25-member executive board will conduct a formal interview in the coming days with the expectation that it will make a decision before the bank's spring meetings, which start April 12. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MARIJUANA
New Mexico backs off state-run stores A proposal that would make New Mexico the first US state to set up government-operated marijuana stores appeared to be dead Thursday in the current legislative session. Senator John Sapien, a Bernalillo Democrat, said lawmakers still have questions about the measure with only hours left before they adjourn. The bill previously passed by the state House would legalize recreational marijuana in New Mexico. However, it stalled in the Senate Finance Committee and it didn't appear that Senator John Arthur Smith, a Democrat who chairs the panel, planned to give it a hearing. Sapien also said some private companies and medical marijuana providers have concerns over how the bill is written. The idea for state-run pot shops came from a trio of GOP state senators who broke with party orthodoxy to embrace legal marijuana. Ten states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana, while legislative efforts to legalize recreational marijuana are underway in New York and New Jersey. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
TECHNOLOGY
Chinese telecom giant pleads not guilty in sanctions case Huawei Technologies Co. pleaded not guilty Thursday in New York to federal charges that the company defrauded at least four banks by concealing business dealings in Iran in violation of US sanctions. The plea by China's largest smartphone maker marks the formal start of the company's defense in the US case. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer has also been charged in the case and is free on bail in Vancouver while fighting extradition to the United States. Meng, daughter of the company's billionaire founder, was arrested by Canadian authorities in December at the request of US prosecutors. Huawei is accused of using Skycom Tech Co. to violate a decades-old ban on doing business with Iran, including repeatedly lying to the United States and even to Congress regarding whether its business in Iran violated any American sanctions. US prosecutors allege Meng defrauded banks when she personally made a presentation in August 2013 to an executive of one of Huawei's major banking partners in which she repeatedly lied about Huawei's relationship with Skycom. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
TRADE
EU again splinters on trade approach to Trump The European Parliament took the rare step of silencing itself on Thursday, signaling how splintered views are in Europe about trade policy toward President Trump. The assembly threw out its own draft resolution on trans-Atlantic commercial ties, minutes after left-of-center political groups pushed through a floor amendment saying EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom should be denied the green light for negotiations with the United States on cutting industrial tariffs. Such a demand would have dented a push by Malmstrom to gain permission from EU governments to start the trans-Atlantic talks. As a result, right-of-center members turned against the whole report. Malmstrom is aiming to show progress on a July 2018 political accord Trump reached with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that suspended the threat of US levies on EU cars and auto parts and resolve other trade disputes. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Squirrels hand sugar farmers sticky challenge Vermont maple syrup producers are contending with a late start to the season in the Northeast and an abundant squirrel population with the critters chomping on plastic sap tubing and spouts. Damage from wildlife — deer, bear, woodpeckers, and squirrels — is not unusual for maple operations, but this year squirrels are wreaking havoc in some spots. That means producers must sometimes negotiate deep snow to find and replace damaged lines that transport the sap from the maple trees or other chewed equipment, which producers say can be time-consuming and expensive. Ruth Goodrich of Goodrich's Maple Farm in Danville, Vt., the largest maple producing state, says of the squirrels: "Occasionally they declare war. And it seems like they have this year." — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Yes, Trump is a target of ‘harassment’

Texto completo: President Donald Trump often complains that he is the victim of "presidential harassment" — or, as he sometimes puts it, "PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!" The president’s adversaries, of course, dismiss his protests as self-interested whining. But the fact is, Trump has a point. He is the target of an extraordinary combination not just of federal law enforcement and congressional probes, but a long list of less-discussed but potentially consequential investigations by state and local prosecutors and regulators. Together, it adds up to a pile-on of unprecedented proportions — by and large the work of blue-state Democrats.
Recently the New York State Department of Financial Services, the agency that regulates the insurance business, issued what The New York Times called an "expansive subpoena" to Aon, the insurance broker for the president’s companies. The agency leapt into action after former Trump fixer Michael Cohen told the House that Trump had at some point inflated his assets to an insurance company. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and faces serious questions about the truthfulness of his latest testimony, supplied no details. None were needed. "The subpoena that was served on Aon contains no indication that the company or any of its employees engaged in misconduct," the Times reported. "Nor does it specify any possible wrongdoing that is the focus of the inquiry by state regulators." Also in New York, the State Department of Taxation and Finance announced last October that it is investigating Trump’s taxes going back at least 20 years.
Speaking of state law enforcement, the recent New York attorney general race was virtually a contest to see which candidate could vow to go after Trump the most aggressively. Outside of New York, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia are suing Trump, accusing him of violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Then there is the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, based in Manhattan. Prosecutors there are said to be investigating the Trump Organization’s finances, the funding of the Trump inauguration, and the funding of the Trump super PAC Rebuilding America Now. On Capitol Hill, Democrats have long viewed Trump’s tax returns as a sort of Holy Grail of Trump investigations. Beyond that, there is the House Judiciary Committee’s recent decision to demand documents from 81 people associated with Trump — a request so wide-ranging that even some Democrats worry that their party’s investigators have overreached.
The point is, the scrutiny directed at the president from all sides — not oversight of his administration or even investigations into his election — so far exceeds anything in the past that it could well qualify as presidential harassment. Democrats would no doubt respond that Trump is singularly corrupt, or that he brought it all on himself. He did not. What has happened is that Democrats, in Congress and in some key blue states, saw investigation as a way to weaken a president they never thought would be elected and want to ensure is not re-elected in 2020. And Trump, with the most extensive business history ever brought to the presidency, presented a lot of avenues of investigation. When he complains about harassment, he has a legitimate case to make.

Tougher Road to Career Redemption for Titans of Finance and Law Stung by Fraud

Texto completo: William E. McGlashan Jr. was sitting on Richard Branson's private island several years ago when the idea first struck him: He would create a new venture capital fund focused on ethical investing.
He had been inspired during a conference on the island also attended by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple founder Steve Jobs, and Jeff Skoll, the first president of eBay. Soon after, he would recruit them and the U2 singer Bono to the Rise Fund on the promise of doing good.
Yet on Tuesday, Mr. McGlashan was one of 50 people caught up in a federal investigation into college admissions fraud, a scandal that has ensnared prominent parents who stand accused of paying bribes to give their children an edge.
While two Hollywood actresses were the most recognizable figures to face charges, they were outnumbered by business titans who are not household names.
Mr. McGlashan is widely seen as one of Silicon Valley's most powerful investors, a partner at the $103 billion investment firm TPG. The fund he oversaw there invested in prominent brands including Airbnb, Spotify and Uber. He has been placed on leave from TPG and Rise.
Also charged were Gordon Caplan, a top mergers and acquisitions attorney who was a co-chairman of the law firm Willkie Farr, and Doug Hodge, the retired chief executive of Pimco, one of the world's biggest bond fund managers. Mr. Caplan was placed on leave on Wednesday, and Mr. Hodge's name was stripped from the website of Sway Ventures, an investment firm where he was a venture partner.
Mr. Hodge is also listed as a board member for two wealthy private schools in California: Sage Hill School and the Thacher School. Blossom Beatty Pidduck, Thacher's head of school, said on Wednesday that Mr. Hodge had been on the board since 2011 and that the board was discussing whether to let him continue serving. Messages left with Sage Hill were not returned Wednesday.
The actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin were the boldface names in the charges announced on Tuesday by federal prosecutors in Boston, but such celebrities may still be able to find work after their cases are resolved. That won't necessarily be the case for the high-powered lawyers and money managers on the list.
"Professionals, their stock in trade has to be their integrity," said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "Celebrities have a different stock in trade."
Mr. Caplan, who worked on complex deals for Hudson's Bay including the sale of Lord & Taylor's former flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, would lose his law license in New York if convicted of a felony. Mr. McGlashan, whose reputation drew star power to a fund with the idea of positive social change, may have a hard time raising money if he has a felony conviction on his record. And Mr. Hodge, who told Harvard Business Review last year that he was surprised "how quickly opportunity came my way" after his retirement, could see those chances to do something new dry up.
After the charges were announced, the firms quickly sought to distance themselves from the accused. TPG's announcement noted that the charges against Mr. McGlashan were for "personal misconduct," and Willkie Farr pointed out that the case against Mr. Caplan was "a personal matter and does not involve Willkie or any of its clients." Willkie also removed Mr. Caplan's biography from the firm's website.
A lawyer for Mr. Caplan and a spokesman for Mr. McGlashan declined to comment on Wednesday. Mr. Hodge could not be reached for comment.
Neither TPG nor Willkie is likely to be undone by the charges against a leadership figure, but both firms may face uncomfortable questions from clients and investors. TPG, for example, has long cultivated an image as a progressive and trustworthy institution. It moved quickly to install Jim Coulter, its chief executive and a co-founder, as acting chief of the Rise Fund.
Mr. McGlashan is listed as one of several "key men" in agreements with investors who committed money to TPG, but his suspension -- or potential permanent exit -- would not unwind those agreements unless several more of TPG's top managers departed, according to a person familiar with the firm's operations, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Investors in the fund have committed money for several years, and the case is unlikely to have a direct financial impact on the fund.
On Wednesday, Mr. McGlashan stepped down from the board of STX Entertainment, the film studio that he helped found with the producer Robert Simonds. The news was shared in an internal memo sent to STX employees and reviewed by The New York Times. STX is funded in large part by TPG, which said in the memo that it remained committed to the studio, whose movies include the teen comedy "The Edge of Seventeen."
Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor and a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics, said she expected few clients would leave Willkie Farr because of the charges against Mr. Caplan, who in April was named a "deal maker of the year" by The American Lawyer, a trade magazine. But she said the case could give potential clients a reason to ask questions about the firm's culture and its process for selecting lawyers to manage the firm.
"They made the choice to have this person represent the firm," Ms. Roiphe said.
Charging documents filed by federal prosecutors describe how parents were willing to pay William Singer, the founder of the Edge College & Career Network, a college preparatory business, up to $75,000 to arrange for cheating on standardized tests or hundreds of thousands of dollars to bribe college coaches to recruit a student. Mr. Singer, who has pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy and obstruction of justice, cooperated with the investigation.
According to prosecutors, Mr. Singer advised Mr. McGlashan to claim that his son had learning disabilities, which would allow the student more time to complete an entrance exam, and Mr. McGlashan gave $50,000 to Mr. Singer's charity. The men also discussed creating a fake football recruiting profile for his son.
Mr. Hodge paid more than half a million dollars to get two of his children into the University of Southern California, according to prosecutors, who also said his discussions with Mr. Singer had been captured on secret recordings.
Mr. Caplan was also caught on tape, the authorities said. In discussing the scheme to improve his daughter's college entrance exam score in return for $75,000, prosecutors said, Mr. Caplan asked Mr. Singer a number of times if anyone has gotten "caught" or "ever gotten into an issue with this."
At one point, prosecutors said, he told Mr. Singer: "Keep in mind I am a lawyer. So I am sort of rule-oriented."

Texto completo: La nueva fiscal general estatal de Nueva York, Letitia James, envió citaciones a Deutsche Bank e Investors Bank el lunes por los registros que involucraban la fallida oferta del mandatario Donald Trump para comprar el equipo de fútbol americano “Buffalo Bills” y otros negocios relacionados con la Organización Trump.
Un día después de emitir las citaciones, James pidió a los legisladores en Albany cerrar la “laguna” legal que prohíbe a los fiscales del estado presentar cargos similares contra personas indultadas por cargos federales.
“Tenemos un acuerdo en ambas casas, anticipamos que el proyecto de ley se aprobará en un par de semanas”, dijo a New York Post.
La citación del Deutsche Bank investiga solicitudes de préstamos, hipotecas, líneas de crédito y otros registros de transacciones financieras relacionadas con el Trump International Hotel en Washington, el Trump National Doral en el sur de Florida y el Trump International Hotel and Tower en Chicago , informó The New York Times.
Se le pidió a Investors Bank, con sede en Nueva Jersey, registros relacionados con Trump Park Avenue.
James también ha solicitado registros vinculados por los intentos de Trump de comprar los “Buffalo Bills” en 2014. El acuerdo se vino abajo después de que Terry Pegula, propietario del equipo de hockey Buffalo Sabres, compró el equipo de la NFL por $1,400 millones de dólares.
James, quien prometió en su campaña investigar al presidente, inició el proceso civil luego de que Michael Cohen, antiguo abogado de Trump, testificara ante un panel del Congreso el 27 de febrero.
En el Congreso se están realizando varias investigaciones sobre Trump, sus negocios y su campaña, y por el asesor especial Robert Mueller.
Deutsche Bank confirmó a The New York Times que había recibido la citación, pero Investors Bank se negó a comentar. La Organización Trump no respondió a las solicitudes de comentarios del periódico.
En febrero, una coalición de 16 fiscales generales, incluyendo a James por NY, presentó una demanda contra Trump, en un intento por frenar la “emergencia nacional” con la que el mandatario busca recaudar fondos para construir el muro en la frontera con México.

Texto completo: A tweet by Alyssa Milano saying the activist and actress is transgender, a person of color, an immigrant and disabled faced backlash from both sides of the aisle.

The debate began Friday, International Women's Day, when Milano tweeted she was celebrating her "transgender sisters." When someone asked if she's transgender, Milano responded she is "everything" and encouraged fans to not be afraid of what they don't know. "I'm trans. I'm a person of color. I'm an immigrant. I'm a lesbian. I'm a gay man. I'm the disabled. I'm everything. And so are you ..."

The criticism was swift, as people pointed out that Milano is a straight, cisgender, able-bodied white woman who hasn't had the same experiences as people with different backgrounds. One person pointed out that her tweet reflected the "I don't see color" approach, which they called "oppression and erasure."

Milano apologized in another tweet Saturday, but added that she's glad her comment "invoked conversation." She said her intention was to reflect words from the poet Rumi: "This is a subtle truth. Whatever you love, you are."

It's Regina Hall, not Regina King

Actress Regina Hall, who has starred in the "Scary Movie" franchise, 2014's "About Last Night" and many other movies over the last 20-plus years, is having a moment.

But that hasn't stopped some from confusing her with fellow actress Regina King.

Hall revealed during an interview with New York Times Magazine that another magazine once mistook her for fellow actress Regina King, the winner of this year's Best Supporting Actress Oscar, saying it "happens a lot."

"Years ago, I got a layout in a magazine -- I can't remember which one," Hall said. "The magazine said it was using a picture of me in a bright red dress. I'm thinking, 'I wonder when I wore a bright red dress.' Then there was the layout -- of Regina King. She and I laugh about it. Regina, it's a good thing I love you."

Hall was asked about how her recent successes, such as starring in the 2017 hit "Girls Trip" and last year's critically lauded "Support the Girls," for which she was the first black woman to ever win the New York Film Critics Circle's Best Actress award, have impacted her. One way: She has several upcoming high-profile projects, including Showtime's series "Black Monday" and summer's "Shaft" reboot.

"'Girls Trip' made a lot of money, which matters, and then the critics were so responsive to Support the Girls. It's weird," she said. "I've always had steady work, but I guess there are lists in Hollywood. I was on the top of one before. Now I'm on the bottom of a more difficult one."

When pressed, Hall explained the difference between those lists.

"There are certain films with predominantly black casts. The list of who's considered for parts in those is a whole different one than the list of who's considered for films with roles that could be played by anybody," Hall said. "I remember there was a script that I read that I loved, and my agent told me, 'They went after Amy Adams, and she's not doing it.' And I said, 'I'll do it!' And he was, like, 'They love you, but they're going to Natalie Portman.' 'Oh, right.' There's always another."

Hall has starred in a number of movies with mostly black casts that she mentioned -- "Think Like a Man" and "Barbershop: The Next Cut," for example -- and said she has no plans to abandon those moviegoers.

"Black audiences are what I've considered my base, and I will always make movies for that base," Hall said.

Texto completo: More than 11/2 tons of cocaine was seized in Newark, in the largest cocaine bust at Port Newark in 25 years, authorities said.
On Feb. 28, about 1.6 tons of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $77 million, was seized at Port Newark, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced in a statement. The seizure was the result of a joint raid by CBP, the U.S. Coast Guard, Homeland Security Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the New York Police Department and the New York State Police.
"This is a significant seizure, in fact it is the largest cocaine seizure at the Port of New York/Newark since May 1994," Troy Miller, director of CBP's New York Field Operations, said in the statement. "This interception prevents a massive quantity of drugs from getting to the streets and in the hands of our children."
CBP turned over the mass shipment of cocaine to Homeland Security Investigations, which will continue to investigate.
The multi-agency effort to seize drugs at ports of entry is meant to intercept them before they're disseminated throughout the country, preventing the drugs from ever reaching the streets. Cocaine, much like heroin, is often cut with fentanyl, a powerful opioid that is up to 100 times stronger than morphine and often causes fatal overdoses.
"Cocaine, New York's nemesis of the '90s, is back — indicating traffickers' push to build an emerging customer base of users mixing cocaine with fentanyl," said Ray Donovan, DEA special agent in charge.
The drug bust is the largest at Port Newark this century. In May 1994, more than 3 tons of cocaine was discovered in cargo at the port, The New York Times reported. CBP agents staked out those drugs, waiting for the shipment to be broken down and distributed. Three men were arrested in July that year.

AMERICANS NEED NOT FEAR THE 'SOCIALIST' LABEL IN EUROPE, SOCIALISM IS SIMPLY PART OF LIFE. AND EUROPE IS NOT VENEZUELA.

Texto completo: Two of my children were born in socialist France. They survived. In fact, their births were great experiences: excellent medical care, wonderful postnatal follow-up, near-zero cost. My son's bris, in a Paris deserted through the August exodus, was another story, but I won't get into that.
France has one of the world's most elaborate social-protection systems. The ratio of tax revenue to gross domestic product, at 46.2 percent, is the highest of all Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. In the United States, that ratio is 27.1 percent. Look no further to grasp Franco-American differences.
This French tax revenue is spent on programs - universal health care, lengthy paid maternity leave, unemployment benefits - designed to render society more cohesive and capitalism less cutthroat. Of the French Revolution's three-pronged cry - "Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité" - the first has proved most problematic, freedom being but a short step, in the French view, from the "Anglo-Saxon" free-market jungle. Socialist presidents have governed France for half of the past 38 years.
The country has paid a price for its social solidarity, particularly in high unemployment. But France has prospered. It has a vibrant private sector. It is a capitalist economy, among the world's seven largest. Its socialism is no European exception. The continent decided after World War II that cushioning capitalism was a price worth paying to avoid the social fragmentation that had fed violence.
The parties that produced Europe's welfare states had different names, but they all embraced the balances - of the free market and the public sector, of enterprise and equity, of profit and protection - that socialism or its cousin social democracy (as opposed to communism) stood for. Socialism, a word reborn, has none of the Red Scare potency in Europe that it carries in the United States. It's part of life. It's not Venezuelan misery.
A 21st-century American election is about to be fought over socialism. Amazing! When the Berlin Wall fell beneath communism's weight three decades ago, unbridled capitalism strode forth over the rubble in search of global opportunity. Ideological struggle seemed over.
But growing inequality and marginalization - byproducts of financial globalization - have thrust socialism center stage. Grace Blakeley, an economist and self-styled democratic socialist in London, told me, "For most people today, socialism is freedom from a lousy warehouse job or working 80 hours a week in a job you detest for people you detest."
Right. The charismatic voice of such sentiment in the United States is the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the lightning rod of a new American politics.
"The definition of democratic socialism to me, again, is the fact that in a modern, moral and wealthy society, no American should be too poor to live," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez tells NBC's Chuck Todd. Like Britain's leftist Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, she favors significant state intervention in the economy. Mr. Trump, unerring in his instinct for the jugular, declares, "We believe in the American dream, not the socialist nightmare."
Europe demonstrates, however, that socialism and the free market are compatible. The basic issue before the Democratic Party now is how far left to go. Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist. Kamala Harris calls herself a progressive. John Hickenlooper, conciliator, says he can "get stuff done."
The notion that American elections are won in the center was buried by Mr. Trump. The energy in the Democratic Party lies in the progressive camp. It stems from anger at a skewed economy and millennial disgust at the elitist turn that cost the Democrats their working-class base and much of small-town America. This opened the way for Mr. Trump.
My own inclinations are centrist, but not a "centrism" that cares more for Goldman Sachs than the opioid crisis. I don't see how the Democrats can eschew a new era's left-leaning energy and win.
A word of caution: The United States was founded in contradistinction to, not as an extension of, Europe. Self-reliance is to America what fraternity is to France: part of its core. American space - so immense, so un-European - conjures in Americans a bristling independence of spirit that wants government out of their lives.
Nations do not cast off their cultural essence. I don't think soaking the rich - Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's proposed 70 percent wealth tax - is going to get a Democrat to the Oval Office. Nor are the accusations of "worker exploitation" that chased Amazon and 25,000 jobs out of New York - a stupid waste.
The dirty secret of European welfare states is that they tend to be business-friendly. As Monica Prasad, a sociology professor at Northwestern University has pointed out, Sweden has a lower corporate tax rate than the United States. The sweet spot for Democrats is getting business to buy in to progressive reform. America can be nudged in a French direction without losing its self-renewing essence.
France is also home to the yellow-vest protests from the marginalized. So much for social cohesion, you might say. But there's a lesson. As James McAuley observed in The New York Review of Books, those vests reflect, above all, a "material demand to be seen." Socialism is no silver bullet. The basic requirement of any Democratic candidate is to make the forgotten, the struggling and the invisible of American society feel visible again.

THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THE ANTI-VAXXERS THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED NOT ONLY TO A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, BUT ALSO TO A CRISIS OF PUBLIC SANITY

Texto completo: How many studies do you have to throw at the vaccine hysterics before they quit? How much of a scientific consensus, how many unimpeachable experts and how exquisitely rational an argument must you present?
That's a trick question, of course. There's no magic number. There's no number, period. And that's because the anti-vaccine crowd (or anti-vaxxers) don't traffick in anything as concrete, mundane and quaint as facts. They're not really engaged in a debate about medicine. They're immersed in a world of conspiracies, in the dark shadows where no data can be trusted, nothing is what it seems and those who buy the party line are pitiable sheep.
And, boy, are they living at the right time, when so much information and misinformation swirl by so quickly that it's easy to confuse the two and even easier to grab hold and convince yourself of whatever it is you prefer to believe. With Google searches, you find the ostensible proof you seek. On social media, you bask in all the affirmation you could possibly want.
The parents who are worried or sure about grave risks from vaccines reflect a broader horror that has flickered or flared in everything from the birther movement to "Pizzagate," that nonsense about children as Democratic sex slaves in the imagined basement of a Washington pizza joint. Their recklessness and the attendant re-emergence of measles aren't just a public health crisis. They're a public sanity one, emblematic of too many people's willful disregard of evidence, proud suspicion of expertise and estrangement from reason.
Again and again, until blue in the face, medical authorities have debunked the renegade assertion that there's a link between autism and the M.M.R. vaccine - so-named because it inoculates against measles, mumps and rubella. Last week, a group of Danish researchers who looked at more than 650,000 children over 10 years announced that it had found no such association.
Again and again, until out of breath, a legion of medical authorities has also explained why making sure that all or nearly all children are vaccinated is so crucial: It creates a critical mass of resistance, known as herd immunity, that doesn't give a disease the chance to spread.
Nonetheless, enough parents plug their ears that the World Health Organization lists "vaccine hesitancy" - a euphemism if ever I heard one - among 10 global health threats in 2019.
The anti-vaxxers choose their own alternative facts. Take Darla Shine, the wife of Bill Shine, who just announced his resignation as White House communications director. Last month, amid alarms about new cases of measles, she took to Twitter with the cockamamie claim that not being vaccinated and coming down with measles or mumps was a good thing looking at the big picture, a hardiness builder that could help a person fight cancer down the line.
"I had the #Measles #Mumps #Chickenpox as a child and so did every kid I knew," she tweeted, adding that her own kids were, regrettably, vaccinated. "They will never have the lifelong natural immunity I have. Come breathe on me!" Thanks but no thanks. I suspect my breath is better spent elsewhere.
A week and a half ago, a Republican state representative in Arizona said on her Facebook page that pressure on parents to vaccinate children "is not based on American values but, rather, Communist." Bet you didn't know that the original symbol of the Russian Revolution wasn't a hammer and sickle. It was a syringe.
I shouldn't joke, and I should add that anti-vaxxers run the political gamut. They're on the left, their professed concern for social welfare proven hollow by the risk that their unvaccinated children pose to newborns and others who haven't yet been - or can't be - vaccinated. They're on the right, among people who see the government and its edicts as oppressive forces. Paranoia has no partisan affiliation.
I should also add that alternative facts had currency long before Kellyanne Conway christened them as such and that junk science, nutty hypotheses and showy apostasies have been around forever. Humans aren't rationalists. We're romantics, and the world is wondrous when you believe that you belong to some brave and special tribe and have experienced enlightenment - about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, about the existence of extraterrestrials, about the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, about vaccines - that all the less perceptive, more gullible conformists out there simply can't comprehend.
But there are differences now that make the cranks that much more baffling, numerous and pernicious. For starters, they fly ever more stubbornly in the face of sophisticated research and hard-earned knowledge. Beneficiaries of wisdom that prior generations lacked, they toss it away, wasting and mocking progress itself.
At the same time, in many educational circles, there's as much talk of students' individual truths as of the truth. Joan Donovan, the director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard's Shorenstein Center, said that social science and history courses increasingly emphasize that truth is situational and that "very few things are always true all the time." That healthy skepticism can turn unhealthy when it leads to the rejection of incontestable realities. There's "a crisis of authority, a crisis of expertise," Ms. Donovan told me.
There's also a man in the White House, at the Resolute Desk, who makes grand pronouncements based on random conversations; implores Americans to distrust traditional institutions and conventional sources of information; and promotes conspiracy theories (millions of illegal votes, a celebration among Muslims in Jersey City on 9/11, and on and on). He has specifically echoed and validated the apprehensions of anti-vaxxers. Whether he's symptom or cause doesn't matter. He's dangerous either way.
Then there's the internet, which turbocharges everything. "I don't want to say it's the only force, because there was Holocaust denialism before the internet - there was even AIDS denialism before the internet - but it's an enormous, enormous force: the most effective echo chamber in the history of mankind," said Michael Specter, a staff writer for The New Yorker who is the author of the 2009 book "Denialism," about irrational thinking. He added, "It's very difficult for people, no matter how well educated they are, to parse what's the wheat and what's the chaff on the internet."
For example, anti-vaccine propaganda - some of which was spread by Russian trolls and bots as part of their sowing of discord before the 2016 election - can look as official and trustworthy as legitimate information. "And as websites get better and Twitter becomes something that people not only look at but rely on, it's very difficult to get away from falsehoods and conspiracies," Mr. Specter told me. "We're living in a world where facts are just another element of your decision-making process."
One of the best explanations of that came in a 2016 essay in The New Times Magazine by Jonathan Mahler, who noted "a radical new relationship between citizen and truth." He wrote that millions of people "are abandoning traditional sources of information, from the government to the institutional media, in favor of a D.I.Y. approach to fact-finding."
They turn to the internet, which is both a hall of mirrors and an overstuffed bazaar. It lets them customize their input and thus tailor their reality, which is reinforced by the like-minded company they keep online. They become surer that climate change is a hoax, that the deep state plots against the bold warriors who threaten it, that a fake Melania Trump is sometimes used as a substitute for the actual one. And they open the floodgates to so much fiction that fact is swept away.
Where's the vaccine against that?

Texto completo: Aunque el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos se anotó un importante logro febrero, luego de que un jurado hallara culpable a Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , líder del Cártel de Sinaloa, el tráfico de cocaína al país parece no tener fin.
Apenas el 28 de ese mismo mes, aproximadamente 3,200 libras (unos 1,400 kilos) de cocaína con un valor estimado en la calle de $77 millones de dólares fueron incautados en un operativo intersinstiucional en el Puerto de Entrada Nueva York / Newark, sobre el cual apenas informaron autoridades.
Pruebas hechas a sesenta paquetes revelaron que el contenedor estaba lleno de droga, por lo que oficiales de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP), la Guardia Costera, la Administración de Control de Drogas (DEA), el Departamento de Policía de Nueva York (NYPD) y la Policía del Estado de Nueva York (NYSP) procedieron a la incautación, la segunda más alta en ese puerto y la mayor en casi 25 años.
“Esta es una incautación importante, de hecho, es la mayor incautación de cocaína en el Puerto de Nueva York / Newark desde mayo de 1994”, dijo Troy Miller , director de Operaciones de Campo de Nueva York de CBP.
No queda claro si toda la droga se distribuiría en los Estados Unidos, ya que un porcentaje del tráfico se envía luego a Canadá. También se desconoce el grupo criminal al que se le atribuye el cargamento, pero el Reporte de la Oficina de Drogas y Crimen de las Naciones Unidas de 2018, la mayor parte de esta droga se envía de México, Centro y Sudamérica.
Las rutas son variadas, tal como fiscales federales explicaron en la Corte Federal de Brooklyn, sobre cómo la organización criminal de Guzmán Loera adquiría la droga de países como Colombia y Ecuador para enviarla a México y de ahí a Estados Unidos , aunque también había envíos que evitaban México.
Aunque “El Chapo” no opera el Cártel de Sinaloa, éste sigue siendo uno de los más poderosos en México, donde también ha aumentado la participación del Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), liderado por Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias “El Mencho” , por quien autoridades estadounidenses ofrecen $10 millones de dólares.
Las autoridades no especificaron a qué grupo criminal atribuyen la cocaína incautada ni su origen, pero ABC citó a una fuente relacionada con la investigación que afirmó que el cargamento llegó a Newark desde Buena Ventura, Colombia, y su siguiente parada era Amberes, Bélgica.
“Las organizaciones criminales transnacionales confían en las redes ilícitas de todo el mundo para suministrar, transportar y distribuir cocaína y otras drogas peligrosas”, dijo Brian Michael , agente especial a cargo de la oficina de Investigaciones de Seguridad (HSI) Newark.
Un reporte del New York Times indica que a pesar del juicio contra Guzmán Loera, las drogas nunca han dejado de cruzar la frontera, ya que en 2016 y 2017, los años en que el mexicano fue arrestado y enviado para ser procesado en Nueva York, la producción de heroína mexicana aumentó en un 37 por ciento y las incautaciones de fentanilo en lugares como Nogales aumentaron a más del doble, según la DEA.
En tanto, el Departamento de Estado indicó que el 90 por ciento de toda la cocaína introducida de contrabando en los Estados Unidos todavía ingresa al país desde México.
El reporte de Naciones Unidas señala que en 2016 hubo un récord en producción de cocaína, con 1,410 toneladas, un 25 por ciento más que el año anterior y el 69 por ciento de esa droga tuvo su origen en Colombia cuyas organizaciones criminales tienen fuertes lazos con las mexicanas.

Texto completo: Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.
Hi. I'm Jamie Condliffe; greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news.
Can Facebook profit from privacy?
You can't have missed it: Facebook plans to shift people toward private messaging and away from the public broadcasting on which its business was built. Think encrypted communications among smaller groups of people, and ephemeral messages that can be deleted. In theory, that change could help the company overcome some of the problems it has faced.
But Facebook has promised privacy features before that have never appeared -- something skeptics were quick to point out after the plan was revealed on Thursday.
"I understand that many people don't think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform," Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, wrote in a 3,200-word manifesto describing the shift.
If we are to assume he means it, there's still a huge problem: He lacks a business model.
A shift to a private Facebook would crimp its current revenue streams. Most of its profits come from targeted ads enabled by the open sharing of content. In the encrypted future that Mr. Zuckerberg imagines, that will be hard. The company would also effectively rule out expansion into big potential markets like Russia and China, because it won't run servers in countries with authoritarian governments.
So how can it make money? Mr. Zuckerberg mentions commerce and payments, which fits with reports that Facebook is building a cryptocurrency. But that's all he says, really.
Mr. Zuckerberg seems O.K. with the lack of a plan. "The basic way that we've approached things is first to focus on building the consumer service that people really want," he said to Wired. "That will be the foundation. If we do that well, the business will be fine."
Of course, a trick for monetizing private messaging may be hidden in his back pocket. If it isn't, his critics' skepticism may be proved right.
Big Tech antitrust, in the House
Earlier in the week, Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the House antitrust subcommittee, proposed an idea to curb Big Tech's dominance.
During the Great Depression, the Glass-Steagall Act forced banks to separate commercial and investment banking operations. Mr. Cicilline told the Financial Times that something similar could apply to tech.
"It's an interesting idea whether there would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information," he said.
Sadly, this feels like a nonstarter. Splitting the operations of banks was relatively straightforward; the data sales and platform components of companies like Google and Facebook are (whatever Mr. Zuckerberg says) deeply intertwined.
Still, it's probably one of many options. "There aren't easy answers" to Big Tech antitrust questions, Mr. Cicilline said to Bloomberg Opinion in January. "We're not going to approach this, like, 'Here's my solution."'
He has the wind at his back. Congressional hearings with Facebook and others last year revealed that lawmakers in both parties have antitrust concerns about tech companies. And the Federal Trade Commission recently announced a task force of 17 lawyers dedicated to "monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets." The commission's director of competition, Bruce Hoffman, said some companies could be forced to "spin off" previous acquisitions.
How far these efforts will go -- and how quickly -- remains unclear. It may be difficult to prove violation of federal antitrust law until the laws are updated to better apply to technology companies. And splitting a company like Facebook or Google would require costly, lengthy legal battles that the government may yet balk at.
Who's to blame for robo-car deaths?
Arizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they wouldn't charge Uber with a crime after one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian last year. Instead, they said investigators should look into what the safety driver "would or should have seen that night."
One interesting point about the news was raised by Frank Douma, a researcher at the University of Minnesota's Center for Transportation Studies:
"It's a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decision-making."
The "handoff problem" -- that humans are too easily distracted to safely retake control of an autonomous vehicle in an emergency -- is well documented. The Uber accident provided a first glimpse of how the law would deal with that issue. It suggests that, for now, the onus remains on the "driver."
Huawei is angry. Maybe too angry.
The Chinese telecom giant Huawei sued the United States government on Wednesday over a ban that prevents government agencies from using the company's products because they may violate national security. Days earlier, Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer, sued the Canadian authorities for arresting her.
Huawei is aggrieved by the Trump administration's hardware ban and its lobbying of other governments to shun the company's products when building 5G wireless data networks. The lawsuits are just one response: A defensive advertising campaign and outspoken interviews were already in play.
Those more conventional lobbying approaches may have been working: Countries like Britain and Germany, which have considered the White House's pleas, have wavered and may ultimately use Huawei hardware.
But the lawsuits make Huawei look rash and aggressive. Is that the kind of company a government wants to help build critical infrastructure?
And some stories you shouldn't miss
The National Security Agency stopped its controversial phone spying. The system, which analyzed logs of Americans' domestic calls and texts and was introduced to surveil conspirators in Al Qaeda, has been scrapped.
Google said it was paying male workers too little. It gave $9.7 million in additional compensation to level things up for 10,677 employees, about 69 percent of them men. But the survey that led to the raises did not address a critical question: Are women hired at a pay grade below their qualifications?
Net neutrality is back in Washington. Congressional Democrats announced bills that seek to reinstate net neutrality rules. Whether the bills can pass is another matter.
Chinese hackers hit universities. An elaborate set of attacks sought to steal research about military maritime technology.
Artificial intelligence cameras can spot shoplifters before they steal. Software can identify "restlessness and other potentially suspicious body language," according to Bloomberg.
You don't know data overload. Gizmodo invites you to meet the digital hoarders who collect "terabytes of text files."

Texto completo: It’s a happy accident that the five books I’m looking forward to reading this spring are all by women, and an even happier one that this column coincides with Women’s History Month:
The Dreamers by Karen Thompson Walker – San Diego hometown girl, UCLA alum, and New York Times bestselling author.
In her previous novel, “The Age of Miracles,” Walker imagines a world where the days and nights are inexplicably growing longer while her young protagonist, Julia, is experiencing her own off-kilter experience of adolescence. Walker’s new novel has a similar theme: Inexplicably, the residents of a small Southern California college town are falling asleep, and they don’t wake up. The only clue to this mysterious illness is that the sleepers are experiencing unusually high levels of brain activity that suggest heightened dreams. Vogue, Huffington Post, Real Simple, and BuzzFeed all called Walker’s second novel one of the most anticipated books of 2019, and I’m not surprised. Walker has an exquisite ability to imagine near-future dystopian circumstances that illuminate the provocative reality of the human experience. (Out now)
The Other Americans by Laila Lalami – Critically acclaimed novelist, Pulitzer-Prize finalist, American Book Award-winner, Los Angeles Times critic-at-large, Fulbright Fellowship recipient, Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, and UC Riverside creative writing professor.
Lalami’s newest novel tells the story of Driss Guerraoui, a Moroccan immigrant in California killed by a speeding car while crossing the street. Lalami introduces an extraordinary cast of characters, each connected to the event in some way, as this family saga and murder mystery are woven to reveal a tapestry of immigration and “other” in America. The book has received rave reviews from the likes of Roxane Gay, J.M. Coetzee, and Viet Thanh Nguyen, and it was named one of the most anticipated books for 2019 by Entertainment Weekly, The Boston Globe, and New York Magazine/Vulture. It’s also received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and Booklist. (Out March 26)
The City in the Middle of the Night by Charlie Jane Anders – Award-winning novelist (Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Lambda Literary Award); prolific short story writer (Tin House, Monkey Bicycle, and Boston Review, to name a few); organizer of the monthly San Francisco reading series Writers with Drinks; publisher, along with Annalee Newitz, of the magazine other; and the creator of the Ballerina Pie Fight — and yeah, it’s exactly what you think it is.
That’s a lot about the author and not a lot about the book, but imagine a tale of a dying planet and its reluctant young revolutionary, Sophie, told by the person I just described and you’ll see why this novel is compelling enough to be named one of Book Riot’s Most Anticipated Books of 2019. (Out now)
Magical Negro by Morgan Parker – Author of “There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyoncé” (a Time magazine Best Paperback of 2017) among others; National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship recipient; Pushcart-Prize winner; writer for The Paris Review, Best American Poetry, The New York Times, and The Nation; creator and host of Reparations, Live! at the Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, and an Angeleno.
Wry. Intelligent. Lyrical. Urgent. Atmospheric. Profound. These are just some of the adjectives used to describe this important book of poetry about black womanhood that Publishers Weekly awarded a starred review. (Out now)
Finding Dorothy by Elizabeth Letts – New York Times bestselling author whose writing career was inspired in part by Mrs. Barclay, the children’s librarian at Malaga Cove Library in Palos Verdes.
Letts imagines the life of Maud Gage Baum, wife of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” author Frank Baum, taking the reader back to 1938 and Hollywood’s production of her late husband’s masterpiece. Seventy-seven-year-old Maud — the daughter of a suffragette and one of the first women in the Ivy League — is determined to ensure that the film’s producers stay true to the spirit of the real secrets behind it which only she knows. Letts started writing at the age of 40 with much success: two New York Times bestsellers and a BookPage starred review for this newest book. (Out now)
This eclectic list of accomplished women celebrates the rich diversity of California authors and the power of the female voice offering us the perfect reading list for Women’s History Month.

Texto completo: It’s a happy accident that the five books I’m looking forward to reading this spring are all by women, and an even happier one that this column coincides with Women’s History Month:
The Dreamers by Karen Thompson Walker – San Diego hometown girl, UCLA alum, and New York Times bestselling author.
In her previous novel, “The Age of Miracles,” Walker imagines a world where the days and nights are inexplicably growing longer while her young protagonist, Julia, is experiencing her own off-kilter experience of adolescence. Walker’s new novel has a similar theme: Inexplicably, the residents of a small Southern California college town are falling asleep, and they don’t wake up. The only clue to this mysterious illness is that the sleepers are experiencing unusually high levels of brain activity that suggest heightened dreams. Vogue, Huffington Post, Real Simple, and BuzzFeed all called Walker’s second novel one of the most anticipated books of 2019, and I’m not surprised. Walker has an exquisite ability to imagine near-future dystopian circumstances that illuminate the provocative reality of the human experience. (Out now)

The Other Americans by Laila Lalami – Critically acclaimed novelist, Pulitzer-Prize finalist, American Book Award-winner, Los Angeles Times critic-at-large, Fulbright Fellowship recipient, Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, and UC Riverside creative writing professor.
Lalami’s newest novel tells the story of Driss Guerraoui, a Moroccan immigrant in California killed by a speeding car while crossing the street. Lalami introduces an extraordinary cast of characters, each connected to the event in some way, as this family saga and murder mystery are woven to reveal a tapestry of immigration and “other” in America. The book has received rave reviews from the likes of Roxane Gay, J.M. Coetzee, and Viet Thanh Nguyen, and it was named one of the most anticipated books for 2019 by Entertainment Weekly, The Boston Globe, and New York Magazine/Vulture. It’s also received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and Booklist. (Out March 26)
The City in the Middle of the Night by Charlie Jane Anders – Award-winning novelist (Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Lambda Literary Award); prolific short story writer (Tin House, Monkey Bicycle, and Boston Review, to name a few); organizer of the monthly San Francisco reading series Writers with Drinks; publisher, along with Annalee Newitz, of the magazine other; and the creator of the Ballerina Pie Fight — and yeah, it’s exactly what you think it is.
That’s a lot about the author and not a lot about the book, but imagine a tale of a dying planet and its reluctant young revolutionary, Sophie, told by the person I just described and you’ll see why this novel is compelling enough to be named one of Book Riot’s Most Anticipated Books of 2019. (Out now)
Magical Negro by Morgan Parker – Author of “There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyoncé” (a Time magazine Best Paperback of 2017) among others; National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship recipient; Pushcart-Prize winner; writer for The Paris Review, Best American Poetry, The New York Times, and The Nation; creator and host of Reparations, Live! at the Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, and an Angeleno.
Wry. Intelligent. Lyrical. Urgent. Atmospheric. Profound. These are just some of the adjectives used to describe this important book of poetry about black womanhood that Publishers Weekly awarded a starred review. (Out now)
Finding Dorothy by Elizabeth Letts – New York Times bestselling author whose writing career was inspired in part by Mrs. Barclay, the children’s librarian at Malaga Cove Library in Palos Verdes.
Letts imagines the life of Maud Gage Baum, wife of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” author Frank Baum, taking the reader back to 1938 and Hollywood’s production of her late husband’s masterpiece. Seventy-seven-year-old Maud — the daughter of a suffragette and one of the first women in the Ivy League — is determined to ensure that the film’s producers stay true to the spirit of the real secrets behind it which only she knows. Letts started writing at the age of 40 with much success: two New York Times bestsellers and a BookPage starred review for this newest book. (Out now)
This eclectic list of accomplished women celebrates the rich diversity of California authors and the power of the female voice offering us the perfect reading list for Women’s History Month.

Texto completo: President Trump met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, Vietnam last week as a follow-up to their previous summit in Singapore last June. Despite the media reports, there has been significant progress.
Not reaching an agreement does not necessarily mean failure. After firing 24 missiles in 2016 and 18 in the first eight months of 2017, North Korea has launched none since. Three hostages have been released and the remains of fallen American soldiers have been returned. Past administrations gave North Korea billions of dollars in aid (President Clinton gave $4 billion in 1994 and President Bush gave $400 million in 2007, according to the New York Times) and received nothing in return. President Trump gave nothing and received something in return. When he did not get a good deal in Vietnam, he walked, and did so without damaging the relationship.
Speaking of relationships, there are two broad types, according to Harvard Business Review: transactional and transformational. Transactional relationships involve setting goals and holding parties accountable. Transformational relationships involve building trust, addressing the other party's concerns and bringing them along. While past presidents took the transactional approach, President Trump is taking the transformational approach. For an agreement to be successful in the long run, we need address the concerns of the North Koreans. How does North Korea protect itself if it fully disarms? How can the U.S. guarantee North Korea's safety beyond the Trump presidency? Addressing such issues will be critical to long-term disarmament.
Yes, we will be working with a despot who has killed thousands of North Koreans, but our highest priority here is to prevent him from killing Americans. The rest can come later. Diplomacy often involves interacting with unsavory characters to achieve our goals.
To be sure, I wasn't a fan of American presidents meeting with dictators. I felt that it legitimized bad behavior and fed the thinking that misbehavior would lead to a seat at the table. I disagreed with President Obama when he said he would be willing to meet with leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea. I disagreed with President Trump when he agreed to meet with Kim Jong Un.
President Trump has, however, produced results with such meetings, and results matter. Diplomacy is a painfully slow process and denuclearization will take time, but negotiation is a far better alternative to missiles threatening Guam, Japan and Taiwan.

Eyes wide open; Lydia Panas' 'Sleeping Beauty' photo exhibit awakens audience at Muhlenberg College

Texto completo: None of the women in Lydia Panas' "Sleeping Beauty," a photography exhibit on view at the Baker Center of the Arts at Muhlenberg College through April 13, is sleeping. That clever negation of title is intentional. Despite their reclining poses, her subjects seem very much awake, as conscious of being gazed at as we are of gazing at them. The viewer becomes not a voyeur, but a participant, making this exhibit eerily interactive.
Like many of Panas' shows, the 17 30" x 30" pigment prints of "Sleeping Beauty," along with its accompanying video installation, are meant to be viewed collectively and not as a set of individual portraits. Her mostly young subjects share similar poses as they recline on luxuriantly grassy ground, some resting on their sides, others flat on their backs. One drapes her arm serenely over her side, another uses her hand as a headrest, still another rests her hands gently on her belly.
Yet this sense of tranquility is tempered by a disquieting feeling of confrontation, of vulnerability mixed with challenge. Panas' subjects might be at rest, but they are acutely self-conscious, and that in turn makes the viewer self-conscious. The result might be a bit intimidating.
"That is part of the power of this work. There's a discomfort, a resistance. The subjects are looking back at you and judging you just as much as you are judging them," says Panas from her Kutztown home. "I know the show is challenging, but at the same time I'm trying to create a feeling of empathy - to ask the viewer to try to put themselves into the subject's position, to be a woman, to be looked at, to be bombarded with the contradictory message of being told to be strong yet beautiful, and powerful yet quiet."
Panas photographed her subjects on her Kutztown farm, as she has done for most of her projects for the past 30 years. Her work has been exhibited widely in the U.S. and internationally, and has been represented in numerous public and private collections, including the Brooklyn Museum, the Bronx Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts Houston, the Allentown Art Museum, and many others. Her work has appeared in numerous periodicals, including the New Yorker, the New York Times Magazine, The Village Voice, French Photo, and Hyperallergic.
Panas' subjects are mostly people that she knows, such as family, friends or students. They are "posed" only so far as she asked them all to recline on the ground outdoors. "But that's where my direction ends. I never ask them to show any particular emotion - all I ever do is ask them to just be themselves, to feel comfortable. I'm just trying to capture them as they are, without any kind of a mask," she says.
Panas works with a medium format, non-automated film camera, a process that is slow, meditative and calm. "Not seeing the results immediately, as one would with a digital camera, keeps my head in the game longer and gives a sense of momentum and intensity that builds during a session," she says. "I'm concentrating more on what I feel than what I'd see on that little digital screen."
She'll be clicking away frame after frame until, Panas says, "Something comes through in their facial expression that reminds me of something I understand, that I relate to. It's some moment of recognition I photograph, something common to all of us, something human. I'm trying to make a human connection, not just a photograph."
For Panas, that shared moment might recall some childhood feelings of her own vulnerability. Her subjects seem to share her empathy. "There's a certain amount of comfort in the process for them," she says. "It's a very Zen kind of thing. Many times after a session is over they will say, 'You know, I felt so good after that.'"
That Zen thing is especially evident in the show's video installation, a collection of "video portraits," each lasting a minute or less, of some of Panas' subjects. Some of the women appear to be in deep mediation, while others seem to be on the verge of sleep. The only sounds are occasional birdsong and gentle breezes; the only motion is the fluttering of eyelids, a wind-tossed wisp of hair, or a softly rising and falling chest.
Most of the women in these photographs are young, mostly because she finds older subjects unwilling to pose. "But honestly, I love photographing young women. It takes me back to a part of me that still feels that youthful sense of defiance," she says. "I relate to young people and to how young women haven't become who they are yet - there's still this beautiful fight."
Certainly, reaction to "Sleeping Beauty" will be to a large part gender-specific. Doubtless many women will see their own conflict between expectations of submissiveness and strength. Men might feel uncomfortably defensive, besieged by such a show of self-awareness and challenge. In a recent visit to the exhibit, I sensed an awkward silence among many of the viewers. If they discussed the images at all, it was in hushed tones, as if these photos could hear as well as see.
"What I'm trying to do is convey what it feels like for a woman to be very alert, very aware of who she is and her own strength, but who is also given contradictory messages of behavior," Panas says. "Here I might be the one with the power, since I have the camera, but I'm also the one on the ground with them, and identify with them."

Texto completo: A friend gave Bob Parent a tip: be at the Open Door on West 3rd Street on Sunday.
Mr. Parent, a photographer with a knack for showing up at the right time and place, didn't need much encouragement. He arrived at the jazz club early in the evening of Sept. 13, 1953. It was unseasonably cool for late summer. The New York Times front page detailed the marriage of Senator John F. Kennedy and the glamorous Jacqueline Bouvier in Newport, R.I. The Brooklyn Dodgers had just clinched the pennant in Milwaukee.
The show that night was billed as the Thelonious Monk Trio. Monk, 35, was already a prolific composer and piano innovator, yet it would take a decade for his brilliance to be fully appreciated by mainstream America. The trio was rounded out by Charles Mingus, 31, on standup bass and the youngster Roy Haynes, a 28-year-old hotshot drummer everyone called "Snap Crackle."
The Open Door was a dark little joint that Mr. Haynes would later characterize as "a dump." The jazz historian Dan Morgenstern was slightly more generous in his description: "It was a strange place but had great music." There was an out-of-tune piano in the front room that was presided over on most nights by a woman known as Broadway Rose. She sang popular songs of the day.
Mr. Parent set up in the back room where the bands played. Then 30 years old, he had been making good side money shooting photos for magazines like Downbeat and Life; record companies sometimes bought his pictures for album covers. "Bobby was a terrific guy," Mr. Morgenstern recalled. "He had a job at the United Nations doing press stuff. He was always around."
There was nothing about the Open Door to signal that magic was about to happen or that jazz history was about to be made. The place was half-empty, and Sunday was a dark night at many of the big nightclubs in New York City. Bob Reisner, a part-time jazz critic for The Village Voice, was also a promoter, and he booked minor clubs. Reisner knew he could get great musicians on Sunday, even at a second-rate venue like the Open Door.
With Monk, Mingus and Haynes, he had certainly booked a top-shelf trio, reason enough to make the trip downtown. The word on the street that afternoon -- and what a savvy Bob Parent already knew -- was that there was a good chance Charlie Parker would sit in with the trio.
Parker, the saxophone bebop pioneer, still only 33, had been trying to shake off a bad stretch in his tumultuous career. For reasons unclear, possibly drug- related, Parker had his cabaret license pulled. Without that card he was not allowed to perform in New York clubs where alcohol was served. This ban forced him on the road for some time. Now he was back in the city and living in a rowhouse in Alphabet City with his longtime girlfriend Chan Richardson and their three children. He was eager to get his card back.
Monk was also working without his cabaret card. It would be four more years before he was able to recover his. The cabaret laws were a biased and punitive system that capriciously caused financial suffering for scores of musicians. Any police officer in the city could pull a musician's card, and there was little they could do about it. On this night, Parker and Monk were taking a chance.
There are no known audio recordings of this gig. The only record of the occurrence of this particular quartet was captured by Bob Parent's Pressman Speed Graphic camera. Mr. Parent developed a signature technique that allowed him to work without flashbulbs, which performers found distracting. It gave his work a dark and intimate feel.
One photo from the Open Door that night has since become a jazz icon. It shows Parker standing out front, wearing a light suit, two-toned loafers, his arms thrust forward, blowing what appears to be his famous King brass alto saxophone. To Parker's left is Monk on upright piano, microphone slung over the instrument. Two drinking glasses and a dinner plate perched on top. At Monk's right is Mingus, slouched over his bass. Along the back wall is Mr. Haynes, his eyes fixed on his bandmates, himself under the gaze of the two mysterious mermaids painted on the wall behind him.
It has since been called by many "the greatest photo in jazz."
Bob Parent died in 1987, and his photo archive is curated by his nephew Dale Parent. "We refer to it as 'the Photo," said Dale. "It's a monument to his craft and we take great pride in its appreciation."
Charlie Parker's stepdaughter Kim, who is now 75, has a copy of the picture that she keeps in her home in Pennsylvania. "I am thankful for all the photos," Ms. Parker said. "I live with the ghosts." For her, the photo is priceless. "I'm looking at it now," she said when reached on the phone. "Roy Haynes had a crush on me at one point," she recalled. "Monk was my favorite, loved Monk. I wish I was there that night."
Mr. Haynes is now 93, the only living member of the quartet that night. He still has memories of that performance. "It was beautiful, man," he said recently. "I was at a very young age. So I was enjoying it. Playing with great people. "
"It's a terrific band, a pity no one recorded it," said Mr. Morgenstern. There is no set list. It's a fair bet that the Thelonious Monk composition "52nd Street Theme" was performed, but we can only speculate.
Though the club was far from packed, for those who were there it undoubtedly was a memorable night. Four legends of the great American art form, together for an all-too-brief moment.
That brings up an interesting question. A lesser-known photograph shows a glimpse of some audience members. In the background, at a front table, there sits a dark-haired man in a dark shirt smoking a cigarette. It has been speculated over the years he may very well be Jack Kerouac.
It was at this time that Kerouac was researching the underground jazz scene for a book that would later become "The Subterraneans." And according to Joy Johnson, the author of a Beat scene book, "Minor Characters," and Kerouac's girlfriend for a time in the late 1950s, it would have made sense for Kerouac to have been at the Open Door. His devotion to Charlie Parker was well known.
"It's certainly possible," she said. "He was in New York at the time the photo was taken." She has seen the photograph, and she said it looks enough like him. "There is no way of knowing for sure," she added. "Also I question whether he would have been sitting at a front table, given how broke he was at the time."
The moment when New York was the jazz capital of the world has passed. Mingus, Monk and Bird are all dead, and their brief intersection was marked only by a few people, an otherwise unremarkable night in the city captured on film. Even the Open Door is a memory, torn down to make way for the Bobst Library at New York University.

Texto completo: Alita: Battle Angel' ***
PG-13 - 2:22 - This film entry into the manga world of artist Yukito Kishiro, imagined for the screen by producer James Cameron and director Robert Rodriguez, crams in so many plot lines that it risks being overstuffed. Yet it somehow stays true to its mesmerizing vision and emerges as a sci-fi success, if not a triumph. Associated Press
'Arctic' ***½
PG-13 - 1:38 - Overgard (Mads Mikkelsen) crash-lands his plane in the Arctic and struggles to survive. It's the kind of film that might make you want to sign up for a wilderness survival class as soon as you walk out. Associated Press
'Bohemian Rhapsody' **½
PG-13 - 2:15 - As Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, Rami Malek delivers a committed, thoroughly inhabited performance, which winds up transcending the regrettably thin material at hand. Washington Post
'Bumblebee' ***
PG-13 - 1:53 - While hard-core fan-boys may complain it's too soft, this film may turn out to be the perfect way to save "Transformers." This charming tale of a girl and her adorable car-robot flips the script on the tired, bloated franchise. Associated Press
'Cold Pursuit' *½
R - 1:58 - A beat-by-beat remake of the 2014 Norwegian thriller "In Order of Disappearance," director Hans Petter Moland puts Liam Neeson behind the wheel of a snowplow with vengeance on his mind. The movie delivers -- in its own soulless way. Chicago Tribune
'Dr. Seuss' The Grinch' **½
PG - 1:30 - Benedict Cumberbatch voices the green Christmas grouch in this adaptation (the third) of Dr. Seuss' 1957 children's book. This computer-animated version is beautiful to look at, but the new material doesn't resonate. Tribune News Service
'Escape Room'
PG-13 - 1:40 - Six strangers find themselves in circumstances beyond their control and must use their wits to find the clues or die. Directed by Adam Robitel. Not reviewed.
'Everybody Knows' ***½
R - 2:12 - Members of a large extended family and their friends gather in Spanish wine country to celebrate a wedding, but the focus turns to a teen girl's disappearance. Starring Javier Bardem and PenÃ©lope Cruz. Washington Post
'The Favourite' ***½
R - 2:01 - Oscar winners Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone play a pair of women sucking up to England's Queen Anne in the 18th century. You'd swear they have paid staffs of comedy writers hidden beneath their voluminous skirts. Star Tribune
'Fighting With My Family' ***
PG-13 - 1:48 - Siblings raised by WWE-obsessed parents aspire to the big-time while participating in the family's regional, ragtag wrestling business. The solo writing-directing debut of Stephen Merchant ("The Office") is based on a true story and a colorful documentary. Associated Press
'Glass' **
PG-13 - 2:09 - Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan reminds us he is the ultimate mastermind, the king of the twists. But the true master at work is James McAvoy, who reprises his role from "Split." Tribune News Service
'Green Book' ***½
PG-13 - 2:10 - Movie based on a true story recounts a 1962 road trip when a Bronx-bred Italian-American (Viggo Mortensen) was hired to drive a renowned black pianist, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), to concert engagements across the Deep South. Directed by Peter Farrelly. Associated Press
'Greta' *
R - 1:38 - Psychological thriller starring ChloÃ« Grace Moretz is a maddeningly mixed bag. With nods to "Fatal Attraction" and "Single White Female" -- not to mention homages to Brian De Palma -- "Greta" feels as time-warped as its title character's cozy but slightly confining apartment. Washington Post
'Happy Death Day 2U' **½
PG-13 - 1:40 - Unnecessary sequel actually does a bit more than just regurgitate "Happy Death Day" (2017), posing questions that other slasher films wouldn't touch. Washington Post
'The House With a Clock in Its Walls' Zero stars
PG - 1:39 - Supernatural thriller manages to find the perfect un-sweet spot -- it's too scary for little kids, not scary enough for older ones, not funny or clever enough for their parents, and too redundant for everyone. Associated Press
'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' **½
PG - 1:44 - Third movie brings the franchise to a close with an affectionate chapter that continues the adventures of the Viking boy-turned-chief Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his faithful dragon, Toothless. Associated Press
'If Beale Street Could Talk' ***½
R - 1:59 - Director Barry Jenkins ("Moonlight") delivers a heartbreaking story of obstacles and injustices in 1970s Harlem. Associated Press
'Isn't It Romantic' ***
PG-13 - 1:28 - Rebel Wilson plays a woman who hates rom-coms -- until she bonks her head and ends up in one herself. Associated Press
'The Kid Who Would Be King' ***
PG - 2:00 - The Arthurian legend gets a modern and more youthful spin in this surprisingly delightful film full of action, heart, a crazy-haired Patrick Stewart (as "old" Merlin) and a few genuinely good gags. Associated Press
'The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part' ***
PG - 1:46 - The innocent-looking Lego Duplo characters introduced in the first movie turn into invading space aliens in the sequel. Featuring the voices of Chris Pratt, Will Arnett, Alison Brie, Tiffany Haddish, Charlie Day and more. Chicago Tribune
'The Mule' *
R - 1:56 - The film is a fairly straightforward adaptation of a true story from the New York Times Magazine, but the racist cultural stereotypes and appalling treatment of women are all thanks to screenwriter Nick Schenk and director Clint Eastwood. Tribune News Service
'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' ****
PG - 2:00 - A biracial kid (voiced by Shameik Moore) takes up a legendary superhero mantle in this multidimensional mind-trip from Sony Pictures Animation. The seventh Spider-Man movie to hit the big screen feels more like a one-of-a-kind, wall-crawling experience. Washington Post
'They Shall Not Grow Old' ****
R - 1:39 - Director Peter Jackson's immersive, haunting and often transcendent film about World War I is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Made with restored, colorized footage from the Imperial War Museum. Associated Press
'Tyler Perry's A Madea Family Funeral'
PG-13 - 1:42 - Tyler Perry reprises his role as the cantankerous matriarch in this entry in the comedy franchise. With Cassi Davis, Patrice Lovely. Written and directed by Perry. Not reviewed. Los Angeles Times
'The Upside' One-half star
PG-13 - 2:06 - A lazy, skirt-chasing ex-con (Kevin Hart) accidentally gets a job taking care of a wealthy businessman who became a paraplegic (Bryan Cranston). It's based on a true story, but it's predictable and lacking in drama and laugh-out-loud moments. Associated Press
'Vice' *½
R - 2:12 - Christian Bale nails it as Dick Cheney, plotting his rise from a misdirected young man in Wyoming to one of the most notorious gray eminences in American politics. But the rest of the movie, written and directed by Adam McKay, is an absurd mess. Washington Post
'What Men Want' *
R - 1:57 - Taraji P. Henson tries a little too hard in a predictable, gender-switching remake of the 2000 romantic comedy "What Women Want." This time, a woman unlocks the power to read men's minds. Associated Press

TEENS' B'WAY 'CHILL'

Texto completo: There's a universal feeling of striving to find your best self that's strung throughout a handful of high school musicals currently thriving on Broadway.
The latest, "Be More Chill," isn't just centered around introspective teenage characters: It's found new life through theatergoers far younger than the Broadway average. And if it weren't for those fans, the musical - which premiered and closed after a short, local run four years ago - may have never seen that larger stage.
"Be More Chill," with music and lyrics by Joe Iconis and book by Joe Tracz, is reaping the benefits of a relatively new period where the average ticket holder - a middle-class white woman in her 40s - isn't the norm in every audience. Following a sold-out Off-Broadway run, the musical moves to the big stage, where it's being embraced as a cult favorite by high school- and college-aged theatergoers.
In its first week in previews on the Great White Way, the show broke a house ticket sales record, tracked a 98-percent nightly sell-out and had to relocate its stage-door entrance to contain fan mobs.
"It's been so surreal and gratifying to see actual young people relate to the show," Iconis says. "I spent so long saying to people, 'if young people would ever be tricked into coming to the theater, I think they'd really like this.'"
The production joins several others encapsulating the high school experience onstage - "Mean Girls," "Dear Evan Hansen" and "The Prom" included - all of which debuted while Broadway experiences a demographic shift.
The 2017-2018 season saw the highest number of teenage ticket holders ever: 2.1 million, compared to 1.6 million the season prior. According to data collected by The Broadway League, Broadway is literally becoming more chill.
"Our audience has consistently been getting younger, and 25 percent of our audience is under the age of 25," says Charlotte St. Martin, president of The Broadway League, which tracks ticket sales data and leads programs to boost Broadway's exposure. 
Tom Melcher, who runs Manhattan-based theater review site Show Score, echoes her sentiment, saying we're experiencing a "clear renaissance or reemergence of passion for musical theater among younger people."
But "Be More Chill" is not solely attracting younger crowds. Instead, it's managing to diversify and balance the average theater audience, bringing together fans young and old.
"Even though it's technically about young people, the deeper meaning of what's going on is something that's not exclusive to them," says Iconis, a Long Island native. "I've always thought of it as a show about anxiety and depression and pressure and all of these huge issues disguised as a teenage sci-fi musical comedy."
Social 'Chill' down
On a Saturday afternoon, the "Be More Chill" audience ranges from grade schoolers to senior citizens - all bobbing their heads along to catchy tunes and laughing in agreement at embarrassing teen moments. It's a 180-degree shift from the play's mediocre premiere run in New Jersey four years ago.
It received an adequate review in The New York Times, but closed after a four-week run in Red Bank.
Then, social media took over.
First, it was Tumblr posts, then Instagram fan art, Reddit discussions, Spotify streams and YouTube covers. Before long, teens across the country were singing George Salazar's "Michael in the Bathroom" without having seen the show.
"I think the gateway drug for 'Be More Chill' has been 'Michael in the Bathroom,'" Iconis says of the song about a teen experiencing anxiety at a house party. "That's a song that kids gravitate toward because they relate to what's going on under the lyrics."
Lauren Ealy, 19, who runs a "Be More Chill" Facebook fan group, traveled from Vancouver, Canada, to see the musical during its Off-Broadway run in September, after originally "falling in love" with the show on Tumblr in 2017.
"We watched this fandom build," director Stephen Brackett says. "I wish I could say there was some mastermind behind all of this, but it was really, truly organic."
Marketing angst
Broadway shifted into the social sphere in the early 2000s, with major networks bringing series like "Glee" and "Smash" to younger viewers' living rooms. Then there were live theater TV specials ("Sound of Music," "Hairspray"), and productions like "Hamilton," which saw the major impact the internet has on the stage through use of ticket lotteries, hashtags and influencer marketing.
Nick Sala, who serves as the company manager for Inside Broadway, an educational nonprofit that teams up with schools (including Bronx Theatre High School and Manhattan East) to bring students to productions, says many kids already know the shows well before they arrive.
"And they didn't learn about it from us," he says. "They know it from the marketing teams, who get the word out on social media. Kids are watching, they're sharing and responding to it."
With a direct line to a "chiller" audience, Broadway struck gold. "Be More Chill" hit $300,000 ticket sales on the first day of its Off-Broadway run with zero marketing costs.
Following an organic start, "Be More Chill" and other teen-centric productions have made more conscious efforts to target and engage with younger audiences online. They've even offered ways to combat the obvious financial gap between teen and adult fans.
"Chill" offered discounted tickets to those under the age of 30, accepted YouTube video submissions to an online karaoke contest, and released a cast album before opening on Broadway. Other youth-targeted productions, like "Mean Girls," have employed similar strategies by offering digital lotteries targeted toward the tech-savvy and giving fans direct access to their favorite stars through Instagram takeovers.
Minding the age gap
Still, director Stephen Brackett credits the "outpouring of love" for "Chill" and other youth-oriented musicals to groups of teens looking for more theater content they can identify with. While differing in plot, all of the high school musicals currently on Broadway mimic an identifiable structure: the nerds versus the mean girls.
With lessons about parenting, drug addiction, mental health and sexuality strung throughout the subtext, the production and its high school counterparts are an ideal fit for the city's educational programs that bring teens to Broadway.
The Broadway League has tagged 19 shows this season - "Be More Chill," "Dear Evan Hansen"  included - as appropriate for sophomores and above. These productions team up with the New York City Department of Education to participate in educational programs like Inside Broadway's "Create the Magic" and the League's "Broadway Bridges," both of which help expose students to live theater.
"Our goal is to get where all 70,000 sophomores see a Broadway show before they graduate each year," the League's director St. Martin says.
While "Be More Chill" found its teenage niche, it's important to remember "age is not a predictor of taste," Show Score's Melcher says, encouraging older crowds to give the show a chance. 
"We're seeing more shows attract teens, but age, gender and ethnicity, is not a predictor of who likes what. We've found this again and again, that it can't always be predicted. I'm 55 years old, so does that mean I shouldn't go to 'Be More Chill?' The answer is always no."

In short, Trump tries to needle the opposition party

Texto completo: The Democrat Party?
President Trump would prefer his supporters refer to the opposition party that way. During a rambling, two-hour speech Saturday, Trump referred to one of his critics as "the new star of the Democrat Party," and to "the new Democrat platform" and "Democrat lawmakers."
"Not Democratic," declared Trump. "It's Democrat. We have to do that. . . . I [like] to say in the speech, the 'Democrat Party,' because it doesn't sound good. But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't."
For the record, it's officially called the Democratic Party, same as it has been since 1844, when it replaced its predecessor, a faction formed by Thomas Jefferson in 1798 that was called the Democratic-Republican Party. Also for the record: "Democrat" is typically defined as noun ("He is a patriot and a democrat") and "democratic" is as an adjective ("Jefferson had democratic ideas").
But references to "the Democrat Party" - and variants in which "Democrat" is used as a modifier - have been around for decades, rising and falling over the years. It's mostly a Republican thing, a way to needle Democrats.
But it has sometimes been used by Democrats, too; President Obama said in 2009 that leaders "understand that what makes an idea sound is not whether it's Democrat or Republican but whether it makes good economic sense for their workers and companies."
Mostly, however, it's been used in the way Trump would like - as a way to help neuter the opposition and rally the faithful.
According to the late New York Times political columnist and language aficionado William Safire, Minnesota Gov. Harold Stassen (R) urged Republican nominee Wendell Wilkie to use the phrase during the 1940 presidential campaign. Stassen, who managed Wilkie's campaign, told Safire in 1984 that he did so to emphasize that the Democratic Party wasn't especially democratic - that it was controlled by party bosses and big-city political machines.
"Why, Republicans asked for years, should we allow the Democrats to get away with the adjective 'democratic'?" wrote Safire. "As a result, partisan Republicans, especially those who had been head of the Republican National Committee, called the opposition 'the Democrat party.' "
Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) referred to opponents of his rabid Communist-hunting tactics as "the Democrat Party" in the early 1950s, making the phrase briefly toxic. But it subsequently made its way into various Republican Party platforms over the years.
President George W. Bush repeatedly employed it during his years in office, including in his 2007 State of the Union speech ("I congratulate the Democrat majority," he said), though it wasn't always clear Bush was trying to get under Democrats' skins. After Democrats complained about his use of it, Bush joked in a speech to House Democrats, "Now look, my diction isn't all that good. I have been accused of occasionally mangling the English language. And so I appreciate you inviting the head of the Republic Party."
Among the modern promoters of the phrase have been former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Fox News commentators and conservative radio titan Rush Limbaugh, who uses it often on the air.
Trump has been trying to make Democrat as a modifier happen since the presidential campaign. He has used the phrase repeatedly in tweets, such as in May 2016 when he wrote, "I so look forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat primaries are rigged, email investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!"
In September, he upped the rhetorical ante, saying in a speech, "When you see 'Democratic Party,' it's wrong. There's no name, 'Democratic Party.' "
Well, there is, of course.
Democratic National Committee spokesman Daniel Wessel says Trump is engaging in "name-calling" by corrupting the party's name. He called it "a weak attempt to try to distract from the fact that he's done nothing on the issues that matter most to voters, like lowering prescription drug prices or increasing access to quality, affordable health care. Trump knows he can't beat us in a policy debate, so all he can do is resort to petty attacks."
Calling anyone something other than their preferred name is usually considered rude, but it's not entirely clear why dropping the "-ic" from Democratic and using it as a modifier is an insult. According to the New Yorker magazine, pollster Frank Luntz tested the phrase with a focus group in 2001; he found that only "highly partisan Democrats" were upset by it.
But linguistic expert Paul Thibodeaux says "Democrat," used the Republicans' way, may grate on listeners for other reasons.
"I think that has to do with Democrat being a noun and Democratic being an adjective," said Thibodeaux, a cognitive psychologist at Oberlin College who studies how language influences perception. "Republican sort of works as an adjective or a noun. [Saying] 'He's a Republican' makes more sense than 'He's a democratic.'"
What's more, he said, the sound of the word 'Democrat' has associations with other words that people don't like: "Autocrat." "Plutocrat." "Bureaucrat."
Not to mention that whole "rat" thing at the end.

Texto completo: Joe Biden’s strategist says the former vice president is 95 percent likely to run for president in 2020.

Officials familiar with the discussions told the New York Times that Biden’s strategist, Steve Ricchetti, thinks Biden is all but in and will announce soon.

There are already more than a dozen Democrats running in the primary competition, and Biden is already leading them in most of the polls.

“I absolutely believe he’s going to run,” Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., said after speaking to Biden on the phone this week. “There may still be some doubt in his mind but there’s no doubt in my mind.”

Richmond said he believes if Biden were to run, he would be the Democratic Party’s “best candidate to beat Trump.”

Biden has not yet made an official announcement on if he were to run or not, but the Times noted he has been privately speaking with influential Democratic donors to gauge their level of support.

If he were to run, Biden would be facing off with 14 candidates who have already launched, including Sens. Kamala Harris, Calif., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Cory Booker, N.J., Kirsten Gillibrand, N.Y., Amy Klobuchar, Minn., Elizabeth Warren, Mass.

City Will Add 4 Statues of Women

Texto completo: A world-renowned jazz singer. A public health champion. A teacher who helped desegregate New York's public transit. And a lighthouse keeper who is credited with saving dozens of lives.
On Wednesday, the city announced that these four female historical figures would be honored with statues in New York. The announcement followed a monthslong process seeking to fix what New York's first lady, Chirlane McCray, called a "glaring" gender imbalance in the city's streets and parks.
Statues of the four women -- Billie Holiday, Helen Rodríguez Trías, Elizabeth Jennings Graham and Katherine Walker -- will be placed in the boroughs they once called home. Once the statues are installed, all five boroughs will have at least one public statue of a woman.
Only five female historical figures are depicted in statues in New York City in outdoor public spaces, according to She Built NYC, a city effort to expand representation of women in public art and monuments. All of those statues are in Manhattan, like the sculpture of Eleanor Roosevelt in Riverside Park and the bronze of Harriet Tubman in Harlem.
Last year, the city introduced an initiative to honor women with a significant connection to New York, and it called upon the public to make suggestions. (And New York Times readers made some recommendations of their own.)
"We pledged to do better by the leaders, achievers and artists who have not gotten their due in the histories written by men," Ms. McCray said in a speech announcing the new statues. The announcement was meant to coincide with the first week of Women's History Month.
In November, the city announced that it planned to install a statue of Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in the House of Representatives.
In 1972, Ms. Chisholm became the first woman to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president, and the first black woman to seek the presidential nomination of either major party. She died in 2005 at 80.
"Is one new statue of a righteous, working, trailblazing achiever enough?" Ms. McCray said on Wednesday. "No."
Each new statue is expected to cost between $300,000 and $1 million, and the city has said it is trying to commission female artists to do the work.
Billie Holiday Is Coming to Queens
A monument to Holiday, the famed jazz singer, will be built near Queens Borough Hall, the city said. Born in 1915, Holiday came to New York with her mother when she was about 13 years old.
Holiday helped break down racial barriers in the arts before the civil rights movement. She was one of the first black women to sing with a white orchestra. And her song "Strange Fruit," a protest song about lynching, continues to shake the public consciousness.
Elizabeth Jennings Graham Will Grace Manhattan
In 1854, Graham, a teacher in her 20s, boarded a New York streetcar without noticing the sign refusing service to black people. When the conductor tried to haul her from the car, she clung onto his coat, and a policeman eventually threw her out onto the sidewalk.
She ultimately sued the Third Avenue Railroad Company and won more than $200 in damages. It was a first step in desegregating New York's streetcar lines.
A statue of Graham will eventually have a home near Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan.
Helen Rodríguez Trías Returns to the Bronx
Dr. Rodríguez Trías was an outspoken advocate of improved maternal and family heath care. As a pediatrician in New York, she worked with sexually abused children and those susceptible to AIDS.
In the late 1980s, Dr. Rodríguez Trías developed programs for families affected by H.I.V. at the New York State Department of Health's AIDS Institute. She also became the first Latina director of the American Public Health Association.
The monument of Dr. Rodríguez Trías will be installed in St. Mary's Park in the Bronx, near Lincoln Hospital, where she was the head of the pediatrics department.
Katherine Walker Will Stand on Staten Island
Walker spent nearly three decades as the keeper of the Robbins Reef Lighthouse, which lighted the way for ships that were passing through the busy shipping channel between Staten Island and Bayonne, N.J. She took the job after her husband died, and she raised her two children at the lighthouse during the early 1900s.
As part of her job keeping the lighthouse, Walker signaled for assistance when shipwrecks occurred. Historians credit her with helping to save the lives of at least 50 people.
Walker's statue will be installed at the Staten Island Ferry landing. Every school day, she would take her children to class on the island in a rowboat.

RESEARCH ON FLU OK TO RESTART ; UW-MADISON

Texto completo: Controversial research at UW-Madison to make a deadly flu virus more dangerous, halted by the government in 2014, has been approved to start again.
The work by campus scientist Yoshihiro Kawaoka involves modifying bird flu viruses such as H5N1 so they can spread among ferrets, an animal model for studying the flu in humans.
The research aims to identify changes that could cause the viruses to spread easily among people, "so that public health officials can monitor for these changes in nature and begin to stockpile vaccines and antivirals to combat it," Rebecca Moritz, the university's manager for select agents - or germs considered bioterrorism threats - said in a statement.
Kawaoka conducts such studies at University Research Park in a lab classified as biosafety level 3-agriculture, the highest level at UW-Madison and half a notch below the top level anywhere of BSL4.
But opponents, including many fellow scientists, have said the research could cause a flu pandemic if an enhanced virus escaped from the lab or was replicated by terrorists.
Some criticized the federal government, which issued a moratorium on the studies in 2014, for quietly approving them again in recent months without publicly explaining why. The developments were first reported last month by Science magazine.
Creating "potentially pandemic pathogens creates a risk - albeit a small one - of infecting millions of people with a highly dangerous virus," scientists Marc Lipsitch of Harvard University and Tom Inglesby of Johns Hopkins wrote last week in The Washington Post.
"For this kind of research, there is no justification for keeping risk-benefit deliberations secret," they wrote.
Kawaoka and Dutch scientist Ron Fouchier caused an international stir in 2011 when they said they had separately altered the H5N1 virus so it could spread in ferrets. In 2012, they agreed to a yearlong moratorium.
A few months after Kawaoka was allowed to resume the work in 2014, the Obama administration called for another stoppage. The announcement followed incidents involving anthrax, flu and smallpox at federal facilities.
In 2017, the government issued a framework through which grant reviewers are expected to consider the benefits and risks of the research, known as "gain-of-function" studies.
$600,000 grant
This January, UW-Madison was informed by the Department of Health and Human Services that it could resume the work, Moritz said. A $600,000 grant for the research comes from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.
Fouchier was also told he could restart his studies, according to Science and The New York Times.
The UW-Madison work has not yet begun again, and the university hasn't determined when it will, Moritz said. "Resumption of the research will depend on Dr. Kawaoka's research priorities and personnel availability," she said.
Moritz responded on Kawaoka's behalf to a request for information from the Wisconsin State Journal that was sent to both of them.
Reporting requirements for the new grant include Kawaoka immediately notifying federal officials if he creates an H5 strain that is highly deadly and able to spread among ferrets, or resistant to antiviral drugs, Moritz said.

Assurances offered
Kawaoka's Influenza Research Institute at University Research Park is a stand-alone building that has built-in redundancies and is monitored by lab personnel, law enforcement and others, Moritz said.
Contingency plans have been developed to prevent the spread of viruses, she said. For example, local fire departments have been told not to enter the facility and let any fire burn, and first responders can't treat lab workers in a medical crisis unless they have been decontaminated.
"There is no such thing as a zero risk in research and no system is perfect," Moritz said. "But we continuously work to create a culture of safety and security and embrace systems that mitigate our risks and get us as close to zero as possible."
Local opposition to Kawaoka's research has been minimal. In 2014, Tom Jeffries, then a member of UW-Madison's Institutional Biosafety Committee, told the State Journal that Kawaoka should genetically modify his flu viruses to minimize the risk to humans.
Without doing that, the research is "increasing the probability of having a pandemic rather than decreasing the probability," said Jeffries, a molecular biologist.
Kawaoka said disabling the viruses would make findings less meaningful. "What you learn applies to the attenuated strains, but may not apply to the authentic viruses," he said.

That subpoena - acknowledged Tuesday by broker Aon PLC - signaled another line of inquiry into Trump's private business, this time by New York's Department of Financial Services.
"As is our policy, we intend to cooperate with all regulatory bodies," Aon spokeswoman Donna Mirandola wrote in an email. She declined to answer further questions, saying, "We do not comment on specific client matters."
Tuesday was a case study in Trump's new reality of besiegement as multiplying investigations by state authorities, federal investigators and congressional Democrats began to dig into his business, charity and presidency simultaneously.
The White House rebuffed one such inquiry, telling House Democrats it would not provide documents about its process for granting security clearances. But that did not end the confrontation. It probably just delayed it: Democrats are discussing whether to demand that information under subpoena.
And, for Trump, other troubles were just behind that one. Another committee of House Democrats said they were preparing to ask for about 10 years of Trump's tax returns. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, unlike other presidents in the recent past.
And still another committee - House Intelligence - announced it had hired a former federal prosecutor to lead its investigation of Trump's alleged ties to Russia. Daniel Goldman, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, has a history of prosecuting securities fraud, racketeering and international organized crime.
As the inquiries multiplied, Trump's tweets got short.
"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!" the president wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, seemingly viewing all these inquiries as an effort by his enemies to overwhelm him.
At an afternoon event at the White House, Trump told reporters that Democrats had hurt their chances of working with him on policy issues.
"It's too bad, because I'd rather see them do legislation," Trump said. "Instead of doing infrastructure, instead of doing health care, instead of doing so many things that they should be doing, they want to play games."
The Trump Organization declined to comment Tuesday. Trump still owns his business, although he has handed day-to-day control of it to his sons Don Jr. and Eric, and to longtime executive Allen Weisselberg.
The past few days have accelerated the probes into Trump's past and present, particularly following testimony by Cohen, once Trump's self-described "fixer." Cohen spent seven hours telling a House committee about the inner workings of Trump's company.
At one point, Cohen said Trump used exaggerated statements of his own wealth to impress journalists, reassure lenders and persuade insurance companies to lower his premiums.
"When we were dealing ... with insurance companies, we would provide them with these copies so that they would understand that the premium, which is based sometimes upon the individual's capabilities to pay, would be reduced," Cohen testified.
"And all of this was done at the president's direction and with his knowledge?" asked Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo.
"Yes," Cohen said.
That testimony preceded the subpoena from New York's Department of Financial Services, which regulates insurance in the state. The Trump Organization is headquartered in Manhattan.
The department sent Aon a nine-page subpoena, according to the New York Times, which first reported that it had been issued. The department asked for all communications between Aon and Trump or the Trump Organization, as well as internal documents in which Aon employees discuss Trump.
Two people familiar with the subpoena said the Times' description was accurate.The Department of Financial Services did not respond to requests for comment. The scope of the inquiry and the department's focus are still unclear.
Separately, congressional Democrats spent the early days of this week laying out detailed demands for documents from Trump, his family, his underlings and his business partners. On Monday, the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to 81 people and entities asking for documents the committee wants to examine in a host of Trump-related inquiries.
Judiciary's document request seeks information from Trump's two adult sons, business associates, political confidants and others. It touches on a wide array of matters, including the president's business dealings with Russia, the firing of James Comey as FBI director and hush payments made to women who say they had affairs with Trump.
Democrats, led by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., plan to seek Trump's tax returns under a 1924 law that gives chairmen of House and Senate tax-writing committees broad powers to demand the tax returns of White House officials, according to people briefed on those plans.
People involved in that effort said they are being deliberate so as not to make a mistake that jeopardizes the investigation.
"If we had done this a month and a half ago, we would not be prepared, we would be falling on our face, and we'd be looking at the rationale for what we're doing," said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-N.J.
Trump has made clear to associates that he will resist this demand, according to three people who have been briefed on the discussions but spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.
If Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refuse, that would be likely to set off a court battle that would drag the process out for months or more than a year and into the 2020 election season.
"What the president will do is: He will, first of all, respond grudgingly and slowly. They will then negotiate," said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., a staunch ally of Trump's. "They will be subpoenaed. They will take that all the way to the Supreme Court."

Texto completo: Co-op Food Stores board seeks input on plastic bags
A debate is underway in the Upper Valley and the country at large over the appropriate use of plastic items, including plastic shopping bags. Some community members have expressed a desire for the Hanover Consumer Cooperative Society (the Co-op) to stop making plastic bags available to Co-op shoppers at checkout. The board of directors is studying this topic and would like to invite Co-op members and non-member shoppers to provide feedback on the issue. You can share your preferences by completing the board’s survey, available at www.coopfoodstore.coop (click on “Survey” at the top right of the webpage). Paper copies of the survey are also available at the customer service desk at the Co-op food stores in Hanover, Lebanon and White River Junction. The survey is open until 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.
The board thanks everyone who has taken the time to respond so far, and looks forward to studying the results of the survey.

Catholic Church should ordain women, allow priests to marry
As the parent of a child who, at the age of 13, was sexually molested by a Roman Catholic priest, I took a particular interest in the recent Vatican Summit on Child Protection. It appears that the issue the summit addressed, sexual molestation, is systemic and has been a part of the culture of the institution for a century, possibly many centuries.
The most effective action that could be taken would be to allow priests to marry and to ordain women. No organized Christian church is entirely guiltless regarding this issue, however none has witnessed nor condoned such egregious behavior as has the Roman Catholic Church. While embracing a beautiful faith, it has become corrupted, an institution dominated by single males.

Data shows marijuana danger
It’s no surprise that the temporary mental health facility in Middlesex, Vt., is failing. Vermont has the highest per-capita mental health burden in the country; its entire mental health system is stretched beyond its means. Vermont also has the second-highest rate of marijuana use in the country, and these statistics are connected.
As former New York Times journalist Alex Berenson describes in his new book, Tell Your Children, dozens of studies over three decades in Sweden, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and elsewhere have shown that marijuana use can cause psychosis and schizophrenia in some users.
Marijuana lobbyists have tried to discredit these findings and Berenson’s book, but the science is solid. Even U.S. researchers agree. In the Chapter Highlights of its 2017 report on cannabis, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine stated, “Cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use the greater the risk.” A new meta-analysis from Oxford and McGill universities found that marijuana use can also cause depression and suicidality. While use during adolescence is a key factor, even adults can be affected, and we have no way of predicting who is at risk. Genetics play a role, but people with no family history of mental health problems have developed them after using marijuana.
The experience of states that have commercialized marijuana shows that commercialization makes it cheaper and easier to obtain, complete with advertising designed to attract young people. Colorado’s use rate jumped from sixth in the nation to first after one year of retail sales. Thirty percent of current users report symptoms of cannabis use disorder, and they account for 80 percent of sales. Meanwhile, total tax and fee revenues (medical plus commercial) are plateauing at less than 1 percent of the state’s budget, but the black market has soared.
Vermont doesn’t need a system that encourages more use, creating more addiction and mental illness, while collecting barely enough income to cover administrative costs. That’s not progressive, it’s crazy.

Emulate the bipartisan spirit
I commend former Hartford Selectwoman and now state Rep. Rebecca White for choosing not to spread herself too thin in her decision not to pursue another term on the Hartford Selectboard to devote full energy to her state-level responsibilities. I have often been concerned about her lack of maturity and the platforms she has espoused, but perhaps she will pleasantly surprise me by honorably representing all the constituents of the Windsor 4-2 district, and not just those she considers her base. She would do well to emulate the bipartisan spirit of some veteran Democratic representatives whom I consider good friends.
One thing I hope she does not do is emulate U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., whose ignorance is exceeded only by her arrogance. I say this because there are some disturbing parallels between these two women as to both ideology and inexperience in the positions to which they’re elected.
One politician who would do well to emulate White’s example is U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has launched another quixotic campaign for the presidency that even many Democrats do not support because of his age and extremism. Sanders raised $6 million within 24 hours of announcing his candidacy, part of which he should use to support himself in lieu of accepting his Senate salary, since he will be the equivalent of a lame-duck senator for the next year and a half. Or even better, he should resign from the Senate. It is the honest thing to do, and would be an excellent test of whether Sanders has the moral and ethical scruples he has often accused the president of lacking.

The new American nightmare
The re-emergence of socialism as a political force in the U.S. has been met with a return to McCarthyism and red-baiting. Progressives and socialists are under attack with decades-old tactics facilitated by the bourgeois mass media and betrayal of centrist Democrats.
While addressing the U.N. General Assembly in September 2018, President Donald Trump highlighted the supposed failure of socialism and communism, emphasizing that “all nations of the world should resist socialism and the misery that it brings to everyone.”
During the 2019 State of the Union address, Trump said, “tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.” This is connected with the manufactured crisis orchestrated by the United States and its neo-fascist allies, like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, against the “troika of tyranny.” On Feb. 18, Trump said, “The days of socialism and communism are numbered, not only in Venezuela, but in Nicaragua and in Cuba as well.” Trump even said that, “Maduro is not a Venezuelan patriot, he is a Cuban puppet.” Cue the Monroe Doctrine, Reagan and the dirty wars of the 1980s.
The imperialist drumbeats to war are echoed in unison once more by the capitalist media. The neoconservatives of the Project for the New American Century, including war criminal Elliot Abrams and John Bolton, are now in command.
The re-emergence of socialism is a direct result of the terminal crisis of the capitalist system. Neoliberal economic policies have brutally dismembered the welfare state, plunging the working class into poverty. The 2019 Oxfam report titled “Public Good or Private Wealth?” shows that 26 people now own the same wealth as 3.8 billion people. This is the barbarity of capitalism. Only progressives, socialists, communists and anarchists are fighting against it. As Malcolm X once said, “I see America through the eyes of the victim. I don’t see any American dream; I see an American nightmare.”

The president fails this test
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, take note. Like yourself, President Donald Trump recently took a DNA test. The results are now in, and Trump has been shown to be: 100 percent mendacious, 100 percent lascivious, 100 percent bully, 100 percent racist, 100 percent white supremacist, zero percent competent, zero percent trustworthy, 100 percent phony.
Of course we already knew this. The test just confirms it.

Texto completo: Illustration Abigail Posner, head of Strategy for Google's Brand Unit, speaks Tuesday at Macky Auditorium at the University of Colorado as part of the Leo Hill Leadership Speaker Series.

Google's Abigail Posner said that the leaders of today are leaders because they are game-changers who come up with transformative ideas.
"The leaders of today are not there because they are mitigating risk," Posner said Tuesday while speaking at the University of Colorado. "They are there because they are creating change."
Posner is the head of strategy for Google's Brand Unit, a creative think tank for agencies and brands. Prior to her time at Google, Posner worked at advertising agencies DDB New York and Publicis New York.
She came to Macky Hall as part of the annual Leo Hill Leadership Speaker Series that started in 2017. Posner was the third speaker in the series, which also has featured former Secretary of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency Director Robert Gates and NASA astronaut Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel to space.
At Google, Posner launched an industry-first thought leadership series — Humanizing Digital — on human beings' emotional relationships with the digital space, according to a news release from CU. She blogs regularly on topics around beauty at Beautyskew.com , has published a range of articles on marketing, digital culture and beauty, and is a contributor to Advertising Age and Google's sites.
Serene Singh, a University of Colorado student and Rhodes Scholar during an introduction said Posner has a degree in social anthropology from Harvard University and, in addition to her work in marketing, is an accomplished blogger with work that has appeared in publications such as The New York Times.
"Abigail is an incredibly accomplished and impressive woman," she said. "She is also the funniest and kindest and most ambitious woman you will ever meet."
Posner said that leadership equals creativity, and all people are inherently creative, because it's a quality that separates humans from animals.
"Human kind has been accessing this hardwired sense of creativity throughout history," she said. "It's only by you accessing your hardwired innate sense of creativity that you become the leaders that you ought to be and are meant to be."
She said innovation doesn't start without the question of "why."
"Without this innate ability to seek the answer to why our species would not survive," she said. "Once you do that, you will have a foundation for so many new ideas. I guarantee you."

Former executive says Insys paid doctors phony 'fees'

Texto completo: Matter of factly calling the payments bribes, a former vice president of Insys Therapeutics stood by a giant spreadsheet in court Tuesday and described how the drug company funneled phony “speaking fees" to doctors in exchange for prescribing its highly addictive opioid painkiller.
Alec Burlakoff, who has pleaded guilty to racketeering charges and is testifying in US District Court in Boston against Insys founder John N. Kapoor and four former colleagues, said Kapoor encouraged the program in late 2012 to spur doctors to prescribe Subsys, an under-the-tongue fentanyl spray.
But Kapoor insisted that each practitioner generate at least twice as much revenue for Insys by writing Subsys prescriptions than he or she received from the company.
Burlakoff stood next to an enlarged spreadsheet that executives prepared in December 2012. One column showed what each “speaker" received every time he or she supposedly met with other doctors to promote Subsys. The amounts ranged from $1,000 to $1,600 to $2,400 depending on whether Insys designated them local, regional, or national experts.
In truth, he said, the designation “national expert" was ludicrous and some doctors had only sordid reputations for running “pill mills."
Another column showed how many prescriptions the practitioners wrote for Subsys, while another displayed how many they wrote for competing fentanyl products.
Assistant US Attorney Fred Wyshak Jr. asked Burlakoff what another column listing sums of money represented.
“That's the amount of money we paid in bribes to date," said Burlakoff, the former vice president of sales, prompting one of the defense lawyers for the five defendants to object.
Kapoor and four other former executives of the Chandler, Ariz.-based company are on trial for allegedly conspiring to violate the federal criminal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, by paying bribes and kickbacks to practitioners. Prosecutors typically use RICO to go after alleged mobsters.
It is the first criminal trial of pharmaceutical executives who marketed an opioid painkiller since the nation's deadly opioid epidemic began.
Burlakoff, whom jurors first saw last month dressed as a bottle of Subsys spray in a jaw-dropping in-house rap video, said that at least one executive strenuously objected to the company tracking how many Subsys prescriptions participants in the speakers program wrote.
Matthew Napoletano, Insys's former head of marketing, who has already testified under immunity for the government, rose from his chair at a meeting with Kapoor, Burlakoff, and other executives, Burlakoff said. Napoletano said such a spreadsheet could be viewed as evidence of a crime.
But the company went forward with the payment program.
The payments were hardly the only way Insys prodded doctors to write Subsys prescriptions, Burlakoff said. Leaders of the sales team, including Joseph Rowan, a former regional sales director who is among the defendants, would buy coolers full of steaks for doctors, according to Burlakoff.
In other cases, he said, Insys executives would put staffers in the offices of big Subsys prescribers on the payroll of the drug company; those staffers were often spending considerable time on the phone with insurers trying to get them to approve Subsys prescriptions, and “now doctors would no longer be complaining" about the expense of paying those employees to do that.
Burlakoff, who became vice president of sales in 2012 after spending years at Cephalon, Eli Lilly and Company, and other drug makers, said Insys didn't only provide incentives to physicians; the company also gave incentives to members of the sales team.
Sales representatives at Insys, he said, had a starting salary of $40,000 a year, less than half of what such employees typically made at other drug companies. But they received an extraordinary commission of 10 percent on the sales they made each quarter, and it wasn't capped.
Several sales representatives, he said, made $110,000 in a quarter based just on the commission.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The White House has rebuffed a request from the House Oversight Committee for documents related to the administration's security-clearance decisions, amid questions about the clearance granted to President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
The committee had renewed its request last week after news reports that Mr. Trump ordered a top official, then-chief of staff John Kelly, to overrule concerns expressed by U.S. intelligence officials and White House counsel Don McGahn and grant Mr. Kushner a top-secret security clearance.
Mr. Trump has denied involvement in Mr. Kushner's or any other official's security-clearance process. When Mr. Kushner received a top-secret clearance in May, his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said that his client's application had been "properly submitted, reviewed by career officials, and went through the normal process." Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Lowell, said in a new statement Friday that his client "was not aware of nor told of any request for or action by the President to be involved in the security clearance process."
The oversight committee had requested documents related to the security clearances of specific White House officials , including Mr. Kushner; former staff secretary Rob Porter, who held an interim clearance for more than a year despite accusations of physical abuse from two former wives, which he has denied; and national security adviser John Bolton.
White House counsel Pat Cipollone, in a letter Monday to Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said his staff had offered to send an official from the Personnel Security Office to brief the committee and provide documents "describing the security clearance process."
But he said that committee had "failed to point to any authority establishing a legitimate legislative purpose for the Committee's unprecedented and extraordinarily intrusive demands" and that the White House had "offered compromises to address the Committee's requests while protecting the legitimate and well-established interests of the Executive."
Mr. Cummings in a statement Tuesday rejected those assertions. "The White House's argument defies the Constitutional separation of powers, decades of precedent before this Committee, and just plain common-sense," he said. "There is a key difference between a president who exercises his authority under the Constitution and a president who overrules career experts and his top advisers to benefit his family members and then conceals his actions from the American people." He said he would consult with the rest of his committee on "next steps."
Mr. Cummings on Friday asked the White House if it had memos by Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGahn cited in a New York Times report in which they laid out their concerns about Mr. Kushner's clearance. White House staff "refused to confirm or deny—three times," Democrats on the Oversight Committee wrote Friday.
The president has previously signaled that he would be willing to cooperate with document requests by Congress, even as he on Tuesday denounced congressional investigations into him and his associates as a "disgrace."
Mr. Trump, asked Monday if he would comply with document requests, said he cooperates "all the time with everybody."

Texto completo: The impeachment process has begun. If you want to quibble, think of it as the pre-impeachment process. Whatever you call it, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler is not fooling around.
Nadler said Sunday on ABC News that he would ask for documents from more than 60 people in President Donald Trump's family, business, White House and Justice Department. That seemed like a lot, but he understated the case. The New Yorker who would lead impeachment hearings launched on Monday what he called an "investigation into threats against the rule of law" and requested documents from 81 "agencies, entities and individuals. "
This isn't overkill, it's playing catch-up. What we’re seeing now is the oversight and scrutiny that should have started on Day One of this administration. It's also laying the foundation for impeachment.
Last week’s Michael Cohen hearing before the House oversight committee was a dramatic headline moment for Americans, especially those who voted for a Democratic House: This is it, the time for accountability has arrived. It was also the public-facing moment that put things into sharp focus for people who don’t live and breathe politics. That is to say, most of the country.
Yet Nadler's news release was in its way even more dramatic — from the title of the inquiry that signals exactly what's at stake (the rule of law) to its sweeping description (covering "alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption and other abuses of power") to its request for documents from scores of people.
Read more commentary:
Democrats use Michael Cohen hearing to put Trump family on notice: They're next.
Cohen testimony was a WWE body slam against Trump. Here's why it's credible.
The Trump investigations are coming at last. Can Republicans handle the truth?
The list of alleged and potential misdeeds grows by the day. There are at least 17 law enforcement investigations that we know of into Trump’s administration, transition, campaign, inauguration, foundation and business, and that is on top of multiple new and ongoing Capitol Hill investigations. Cohen’s public and private testimony last week gave Congress many new avenues to follow up, including new leads on the Trump Tower Moscow project and possible insurance fraud by the Trump Organization. Cohen also said he was talking to federal prosecutors in New York about another investigation into Trump wrongdoing but couldn’t disclose what it was. This could make 18 law enforcement investigations.
There are now more leads to follow
We were still digesting all of this when The New York Times reported Thursday that, according to four unnamed sources "briefed on the matter," Trump had overruled intelligence professionals to get a top-secret security clearance for his son-in-law, Jared Kushner — a report quickly confirmed by The Washington Post with its own anonymous "current and former administration officials. " That kicked an existing congressional investigation of administration security clearance procedures into even higher gear.
Then on Saturday, The Post reported that as a result of Cohen’s private testimony last week, Congress is also investigating whether Cohen discussed a pardon with anyone in the administration, according to anonymous sources "familiar with the matter. " Possibly related, or possibly another new front: Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, said on MSNBC that "explosive," potentially game-changing information related to “lying and obstruction of justice” arose from the private testimony. And there's more to come Wednesday, when Cohen returns for a second closed session with the House Intelligence Committee.
If the public Cohen hearing was a marker laid down by the new House Democratic majority, it was also a vivid illustration of House Republican resistance. They did not mount a defense of their fearless leader. Instead they went after Cohen and his credibility and, when it was over, Trump's top two allies on the panel asked the Justice Department to investigate Cohen for perjury.
Cohen, who heads to prison in two months for tax fraud, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress, among other charges, is indeed an "admitted liar," as conservatives have repeatedly branded him. But if even half of the leads he is providing to congressional committees pan out with documentation or are otherwise backed up by further investigation, he will have proved to be a high-value witness.
This should have happened long ago
The onslaught of congressional investigations is a direct result of House Republicans having shirked their obligations for two years in the face of Trump's norm-shattering, possibly legally compromised presidency. It is overwhelming and at the same time long overdue, particularly for impatient impeachment advocates such as liberal billionaire Tom Steyer.
"Not acting has its costs," he told the USA TODAY Editorial Board a few weeks ago. "When you normalize this kind of behavior and keep allowing him to do things that we’ve never allowed presidents to do, you have a different country at the end. "
Steyer said he fears that "slow-walking" the process could kill it — leaving Trump in office for nearly two more years until the 2020 election. But he concedes that Democrats and special counsel Robert Mueller "do need to finish the job and tie it all up in a bow," in terms of fact-finding and evidence.
That process, as it unfolds in the courts and in Congress, will expose wrongdoing and educate the public. As Nadler said Sunday, "Before you impeach somebody, you have to persuade the American public that it ought to happen. ”
If and when impeachment becomes inevitable, because of all that’s being done now, the factual groundwork will have been laid. Most of America hopefully will not be shocked or appalled. And perhaps at least some Republicans will decide, at long last, that this can’t go on.

Texto completo: President Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last week was criticized by both parties in Washington long before Air Force One even touched down in Hanoi. Washington’s political class seemed terrified that the nearly 70 year state of “war” with North Korea might actually end. In the end the only positive thing they could say about the meeting was that Trump apparently walked away with nothing to show for it.
The location of the meeting – Hanoi, Vietnam – serves as a great example of what can be won in peace versus what is lost in war. After losing nearly 60,000 US service members in an unnecessary war that took a million Vietnamese lives, the US loss of the Vietnam war resulted not in a communist takeover of southeast Asia but something very different: the domino theory failed because communism was destined to fail. Now we are close trading partners with an increasingly pro-market Vietnam. The result of trade and exchange versus war is a better life for all.
Unfortunately for Washington, the real lesson of Vietnam has not been learned. That is why the Republicans, Democrats, and the entire mainstream media spoke as one against President Trump’s decision to take a bold step and actually meet again, one-on-one, with one of our “enemies” to see if we can avoid nuclear conflict.
One leading Democrat, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), attacked Trump for meeting with Kim because speaking to the North Korean “gives him legitimacy.” Does it make any sense that we should not even speak with our nuclear-armed adversaries because it gives them “legitimacy”? He’d rather have a nuclear war as long as Kim remains “illegitimate”? This is sadly the kind of thinking that prevails in Washington.
The media reported that Trump walked away from the meeting before the scheduled signing ceremony and closing press event. The talks broke down, it was reported, because Kim demanded an end to all sanctions before any reduction in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. Washington sighed with relief and said all together, “better no deal than a bad deal.”
Meanwhile the North Koreans held a rare press conference clarifying that they only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling one of their main nuclear facilities. Further, press reports began to surface that National Security Advisor John Bolton threw additional demands on the table which led Kim to draw the meeting to an early close.
Who’s telling the truth? We likely won’t know. But given Bolton’s strong opposition to any kind of peace agreement with North Korea it’s hard to doubt that he had something to do with the blow-up of the summit. As the New York Times reported over the weekend, while Trump’s advisors were shocked when he decided to meet Kim face-to-face the first time for negotiations, John Bolton wasn’t worried at all. As the Times writes, “Mr. Bolton told colleagues not to worry. The negotiations, he said, would collapse on their own.” And so they did.
Will Trump continue to allow his diplomatic efforts to be undermined by his own staff? Let’s hope the president will ignore Washington, ignore the neocons, and continue to work for peace with North Korea.

Texto completo: All serious butterfly collectors remember their first gynandromorph: a butterfly with a color and pattern that are distinctly male on one wing and female on the other.
Seeing one sparks wonder and curiosity. For biologist Nipam H. Patel, the sighting offered a possible answer to a question he had been pondering for years: During embryonic and larval development, how do cells know where to stop and where to go?
He was sure that the delicate black outlines between male and female regions appearing on one wing - but not the other - identified a key facet of animal development.
“It immediately struck me that this was telling me something interesting about how the wing was being made,” said Patel, a biologist who now heads the Marine Biological Laboratory, a research institute in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, affiliated with the University of Chicago.
The patterning on the gynandromorph’s wing shows that the body uses signaling centers to control where cells go during development and what tissues they become in creatures as diverse as butterflies and people, Patel said.
Gynandromorph butterflies and other half-male, half-female creatures, particularly birds, have fascinated both scientists and amateurs for centuries. The latest sensation was a half-red, half-taupe cardinal that became a regular visitor in the backyard of Shirley and Jeffrey Caldwell in Erie, Pennsylvania. Although the bird would have to be tested to confirm that it is a gynandromorph, its color division strongly suggests that it is, scientists say.
Split-sex creatures are not as unusual as they may seem when one discovery goes viral, as the cardinal’s did. It extends beyond birds and butterflies to other insects and crustaceans, like lobsters and crabs.
Scientists say these instances of split-sex animals and insects could offer clues to why some human diseases strike one sex more than the other.
Researchers thought they had figured out the genetics of birds and bees, but gynandromorphs suggest that there is more to learn, said Jennifer Marshall Graves, a distinguished professor at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.
Mammals have X and Y chromosomes, birds and insects have Z and W, and some reptiles can change their sex depending on temperature, or a combination of temperature and sex chromosomes, she said.
It was believed that the sex of a bird was determined by a protein made by the DMRT1 gene, which would reach all the cells of the bird through the bloodstream, Graves said. But for two sides of the bird to share the same bloodstream but not the same sex, there must be more to the story.
Hormones cannot be the sole drivers of sex either, but they most likely play some role, said Arthur Arnold, a distinguished research professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. In a paper published in 2003 in PNAS, Arnold showed that in gynandromorphic zebra finches, brain cells on the female side were more masculine than comparable cells in a typical female.
How gynandromorphs are born at all still remains a mystery. For birds, the most likely explanation is that a female makes an unusual double-nucleus egg cell, one with a Z chromosome and one with a W chromosome, and each is fertilized by a Z sperm, making some cells ZZ and others ZW in the same individual, Arnold said.
“Although this happens regularly, it’s very rare,” he added. Gene editing is tricky in birds, so it has not been possible to experimentally induce this phenomenon in birds, so it’s not well understood, he said.
The same process is very unlikely to happen in mammals, he said. Female mammals naturally have two of the same sex chromosomes, and the instant a mammalian egg and sperm fuse, “dramatic changes prevent the entry of a second sperm.”
Gynandromorphs occur naturally, usually resulting from a random genetic error, Patel said. The phenomenon can be inherited - with some flies and moths passing unstable sex chromosomes down to their offspring, he said. But it is also possible that stress can cause the unusual sex split.
Although many of the birds studied have been roughly 50 percent male on one side and 50 percent female on the other, a 2010 study in chickens showed that the cells were not that evenly distributed.
Animals can also develop as mosaics, with some cells genetically different from others. Some of Patel’s butterflies, for instance, show male coloration and patterns on parts of a wing, rather than the entire side.
Arnold said his own research on sex genes has implications for treating a variety of human diseases that seem to vary by gender. His UCLA collaborator, Rhonda Voskuhl, has found, for instance, that in multiple sclerosis, a genetically female mouse with two X chromosomes fares worse than a mouse with an X and a Y, even if they have the same hormones. Understanding why females fare worse could help explain and treat MS in people, where there is also a gender difference, with women accounting for three times as many cases as men.

Texto completo: ALBANY – For Gov. Andrew Cuomo and top state lawmakers, taking a stance in favor of legalizing marijuana for adult use was the easy part.
Figuring out how to divvy up the tax revenue marijuana will bring in? That's the hard part.
Cuomo and legislative leaders still speak of legal, recreational marijuana as an inevitability in New York, though they have all signaled a new law may have to wait until the state budget is approved later this month.
But deciding what to do with a potential infusion of marijuana tax revenue remains a key sticking point, which was reinvigorated Tuesday when Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio came out in favor of saving a slice for the New York City subway system.
Cuomo's office estimates legal marijuana would bring in $300 million a year to the state's coffers when it is fully up and running, which likely wouldn't happen before 2021.
"It's easier said than done," Cuomo said Thursday on WAMC-FM in Albany. "The devil's in the details, and you have to do it with safeguards and protections."
How much to tax? The first step is figuring out how much to tax. Across the country, states that have already legalized marijuana have struggled with the delicate balancing act of setting an acceptable tax rate.
Set the rate too low, and states risk losing out on much-needed revenue. Set it too high, and they risk driving marijuana users to the black market, where the product could be cheaper.
As such, the tax rates fluctuate wildly: From 10 percent plus sales tax in Michigan to 37 percent in Washington state, the highest rate in the nation.
Some states also charge their normal sales tax; others don't.
In neighboring Massachusetts, the state charges 17 percent in excise and sales taxes, plus local governments have the option to tack on a tax of up to 3 percent.
Cuomo's plan: 22 percent Cuomo's proposal, which he unveiled in January, calls for three separate taxes.
The first tax would be on marijuana growers: $1 per dry-weight gram of cannabis flower plus $0.25 per dry-weight gram of cannabis trim.
Then there is a 20 percent state tax on marijuana when it's sold from a wholesaler to a retailer.
If the wholesaler is also the retailer, then the retail customer pays it directly at the time of sale.
The third tax? Two percent that goes to the county where the retail dispensary is located.
All told, it would be a 22 percent tax on top of the per-gram taxes on marijuana growers. Sales tax wouldn't apply.
A pair of key Democratic state lawmakers, Assembly Majority Leader Crystal-Peoples Stokes, of Buffalo, and Sen. Liz Krueger, of Manhattan, have their own proposal, too.
It ultimately ends up in a similar place: a 15 percent excise tax plus the existing 4 percent state sales tax and a per-gram tax on growers. Local governments would be able to charge up to 2 percent.
Where they differ Where Cuomo and the key lawmakers differ is how they would split up the revenue.
Peoples-Stokes and Heastie have repeatedly said the bulk of the money should go toward communities that have been hit hard by strict drug laws over the years.
Across the state and nationwide, black and Hispanic people have been far more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession.
It has been particularly pronounced in New York City, where black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at 8 times the rate white people were from 2015 through 2017, according to The New York Times.
Peoples-Stokes and Krueger's bill would take about half of the marijuana revenue and put it toward grants for "community-based nonprofits."
Those grants would have to go toward job training, mental-health treatment, adult education or other support services in communities that were "disproportionately affected by past federal and state drug policies."
About a quarter of the revenue would go into the state lottery fund, which distributes money for education. And the remaining quarter would be put toward funding public-education programs about drug use and addiction.
"When it comes to marijuana, and I've been clear to the governor and the mayor, is the first commitment from those revenues should be really toward community investments, particularly to those communities that have been impacted by the criminal justice issues," Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, D-Bronx, told reporters Tuesday.
Weed for rails? Cuomo's original proposal is less specific, saying the revenue would go toward things like administering the marijuana program, improving traffic safety, small-business loans and public-health education.
But his plan would essentially give the governor's office total control over how the money is spent — something lawmakers often fight against.
On Tuesday, Cuomo unveiled a new plan: He and de Blasio want to keep a piece of marijuana revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the beleaguered New York City transit system.
It's an idea first floated three months ago by transit advocates and some city officials three months ago, including then-Public Advocate candidate Melissa Mark-Viverito, who dubbed it the "Weed for Rails" plan.
Cuomo and de Blasio didn't say how much they want to keep for the MTA, and Cuomo's office later clarified that the money would come from marijuana sales in New York City, not the entire state.
"I agree with folks in Albany that say some of that money needs to go to other important imperatives," de Blasio told reporters Wednesday. "But part of it should go to the MTA."
Mixed reaction The transit proposal got a mixed reaction among state lawmakers.
Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, sounded amenable — so long as the revenue comes from New York City's share.
"If the mayor and city council are comfortable with using their proceeds in that way, I don't have a problem with it," she told reporters Wednesday.
Her Republican counterpart, Minority Leader John Flanagan of Suffolk County, said the idea is ridiculous.
"This is nuts," Flanagan said. "The notion that we would legalize recreational marijuana and hope and pray that somehow a lot of people will smoke so we can have good buses and subway cars, that's ludicrous."
Local governments looking for more Local governments, meanwhile, are looking for a bigger cut of the revenue pie. Counties say the local tax should be 4 percent — the same as the current county-level sales tax in most parts of the state.
Stephen Acquario, executive director of the state Association of Counties, said 2 percent doesn't cut it, particularly when counties and municipalities will have to respond to any on-the-ground issues marijuana legalization brings.
"Only with sufficient funding will local governments be able to work in partnership with the state to oversee public health, public safety, criminal justice, consumer protection and economic development," he said in a statement.
The New York Conference of Mayors, which represents cities and villages across the state, held a series of panel discussions on Wednesday in Albany to examine marijuana legalization and what they can do to prepare.
Pushing lawmakers and Cuomo for more local revenue was a common theme.
"I do think we should be very mindful of how the legislation will impact revenue sharing," said Susan Sommer, general counsel for the NYC Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice.
"There should be enough coming to local governments to ensure we can do what we know to be the right things for our communities."

Texto completo: The New York Times' chief White House correspondent is headed to Indiana.
Maggie Haberman, a Pulitzer Prize recipient and political reporter for two decades, will speak at 5:30 p.m. March 18 at Indiana University's Buskirk-Chumley Theater.
Former U.S. Rep. Lee Hamilton will also present Haberman with the Lee H. Hamilton Public Service Fellowship at the event.
The 45-year-old Haberman joined The Times in 2015, and was part of a team that won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for its stories investigating Donald Trump's advisers' connections to Russia. She'd previously worked for Politico, The New York Post and The New York Daily News.
The Pulitzer board praised the team for its "deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation's understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect's transition team and his eventual administration."
Haberman also won the White House Correspondents' Association's 2018 Aldo Beckman Award and the Newswomen's Club of New York's 2018 Front Page Award for Journalist of the Year.
The lecture is free and open to the public.

The great hypocrisy of the Green New Deal

Texto completo: Not ready for prime time. That was the consensus reaction to the Green New Deal, released last month by freshman Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
The Economist called the proposal “deeply unserious.” A Washington Post editorial labeled it as “fantasy.” New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote that it would result in “the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the Washington elite in our history.”
But the Green New Deal isn’t just lousy policy. It’s incredibly hypocritical.
In boosting the plan, for instance, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “the world will end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” It was a hyperbolic summary of an alarmist and scientifically unsound United Nations report on greenhouse gas emissions.
Enter, the hypocrisy.
If a climate change-induced existential crisis were, indeed, just around the corner, the most rationale response would be to gin up all the nuclear power the world can get. After all, in 2017 nuclear provided more than half (56 percent) of the country’s emissions-free electricity — more than triple the amount we get from wind and 18 times more than solar generates generation.
But, according to the now-deleted FAQ sheet from Ocasio-Cortez’s office, “The Green New Deal makes new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear plants unnecessary.” Launching “a massive mobilization of all our resources into renewable energies,” while eliminating emissions-free nuclear power is the most inefficient and expensive approach to carbon reduction possible.
The hypocrisy doesn’t end there.
Green New Dealers are trying to sell their policies in the name of economic security and justice. However, policies that take away affordable, reliable power from American families are highly regressive. Higher energy costs hit low-income households hardest, because they spend a higher percentage of their budget on energy. The higher these costs climb, the more they are forced to make difficult choices between keeping the heat on or providing food for their family or perhaps going to the doctor.
Higher energy prices mean more than just having less money available for other necessities. It means having to spend more for all of the goods and services you purchase. That’s because energy is a critical component of manufacturing, communications and transportation—all of which are involved in getting goods and services to your household.
The Green New Deal doesn’t lead to more economic security and justice. It leads to greater economic strain, with low-income families being stressed the most.
And where’s the justice in cronyism and corporate welfare. The Green New Deal would open the floodgates of both.
Ocasio-Cortez rightly blasted New York’s special tax breaks for Amazon’s proposed HQ2. Offering up billions in state and city special tax breaks left a sour taste in many peoples’ mouths.
Cronyism works for big companies because they can offer a lot: investment, jobs and prosperity. But it is not a strategy for long-term economic success because it comes at the expense of other investments and opportunities. The investments will come when there’s an attractive, level-playing field for all companies to compete.
The Green New Deal would introduce significantly higher level of cronyism because Ocasio-Cortez wants the federal government (i.e., American taxpayers) to pay for the whole thing.
Remember Solyndra, the half-billion dollar solar boondoggle that went belly up? That’s just a small taste of things to come under a Green New Deal that puts potentially trillions of dollars up for grabs. As was the case with Solyndra, when the feds start picking energy technologies and companies to fund, they are essentially gambling with other peoples’ money. And there is never a guarantee the bet will pay off.
Solyndra is merely one example of a failed company that could not survive even with the federal government’s help. And there are many other examples of green cronyism that even more closely parallel New York’s erstwhile deal with Amazon, which Ocasio-Cortez found so distasteful. Taxpayers gave money or government-backed loans to companies that already enjoyed large market capitalization and/or substantial private investors. Federal “investment” wasn’t needed. But, hey, who’s gonna turn down free money?
The economic pain of green cronyism cuts deeper than wasted taxpayer money. When Washington steers money to — or away from — “favored” businesses or technologies, private-sector investment follow. This not only stifles competition and innovation, it also centralizes control in the hands of politicians, elites and lobbyists.
That’s the big picture. But the Green New Deal has very personal ramifications as well. It would change the way you live your life — from what car you drive, to how cool or warm you you’re your home, to what you eat.
The stench of hypocrisy makes it all that much worse.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
After multiple conversations this week with Amazon officials, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wanted to show them just how much support for the company there really was in New York City.
So after those calls -- including one with the Amazon chief executive, Jeff Bezos -- the governor's top aide, Melissa DeRosa, spoke with the president of the city's pre-eminent business group, the Partnership for New York City, about how to follow up. They quickly settled on a strategy for a letter addressed to Mr. Bezos that would appear as a full-page newspaper advertisement.
Time was of the essence.
By Wednesday, emails began flying; phones were ringing seemingly everywhere, from union halls and public housing apartments to executive suites of companies like Goldman Sachs and Warby Parker and the offices of local congressional representatives.
In some cases, the pitch came from Ms. DeRosa. In many others, it came from the president of the partnership, Kathryn Wylde, whose group paid for the ad.
"I wanted the letter to symbolize that New Yorkers of diverse backgrounds know how to work together," said Ms. Wylde, who came up with the idea for the letter.
Others, particularly businesses in or near Long Island City, Queens, where Amazon canceled plans for a headquarters last month, learned about the impending letter from Elizabeth Lusskin, the president of the Long Island City Partnership.
"The idea was to put together a diverse range of voices in a short amount of time," said Ms. Lusskin, who was asked to help on Thursday morning. "There are many, many more people who would have, if asked, been part of this. We were trying to get together a broad range."
Six people described the efforts to create the letter, but some would only do so on the condition of anonymity. One person said the call to Mr. Bezos took place on Tuesday; the person said on Friday that Mr. Bezos had seen the ad.
Unions that had not previously expressed a position on Amazon signed on, including the New York branch of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Hotel Trades Council, which represents hotel workers, and unions representing teachers and hospital workers.
"Every worker has the right to organize, but we know that having a job is essential to that process," George Gresham, the president of 1199 Service Employees International Union, said in a statement.
Not every union that got a call decided to add its name, according to two union officials who said Ms. DeRosa, along with Ms. Wylde, had reached out. Several people said they had received a call to add their names to the letter with only a few hours to decide whether to sign; others were given a little more time.
A spokeswoman for the governor, Dani Lever, disputed the union officials' account, saying that no one Ms. DeRosa called had said no.
By Thursday afternoon, more than 70 signatories had joined, including public housing tenant leaders, the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter, pastors, as well as businesses in Queens.
There was no evidence that the letter, which appeared as a full-page ad in The New York Times on Friday, had changed Amazon's decision to abandon the deal, in which the company promised to create up to 40,000 jobs in Long Island City in exchange for a state grant of $500 million and state and city tax breaks that would have eventually totaled more than $2 billion.
On Friday, the governor told WNYC's Brian Lehrer that the company had not conveyed any change of heart. "I have no reason to believe that Amazon is reconsidering," Mr. Cuomo said. "Would I like them to? Certainly."
But the letter may have tempered some of the political opposition to the Amazon plan; as the contents of the letter and breadth of support became known, many of the voices of opposition grew silent or appeared to soften their messages.
The local elected officials who had been most critical of the deal -- State Senator Michael Gianaris and City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer -- declined to comment in response to Mr. Cuomo's efforts to lure the company back.
State Senator Leroy Comrie, a Queens Democrat who recently replaced Mr. Gianaris as the nominee to the obscure but powerful Public Authorities Control Board (it would have had veto power over the Amazon deal), issued a statement on Friday that stressed his willingness to work with Amazon.
"I was disappointed in Amazon's retreat rather than choosing to work together to address the concerns of the affected communities, and ensure the best outcome for New York taxpayers," Mr. Comrie said. "If Amazon chooses to come back I would be glad to work with them."
Even the office of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose surprise win last year helped galvanize resistance to the company, and whose opposition to Amazon led to a Times Square billboard blaming her for the pullout, seemed to be more measured in its comments.
"If elected officials spent half as much time talking to the community as to Jeff Bezos, I think we would already have come to an agreement that works for everybody," Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, said.
Mr. Cuomo, in the radio interview, sought to diminish the importance of Amazon's most strident opponents; he called Mr. Van Bramer and Mr. Gianaris "irrelevant," adding that "there are other ways that the state can get it done. I told Amazon that."
The governor was even more dismissive of Make the Road New York, a coalition representing minority and working-class New Yorkers that opposed the Amazon deal, saying he did not know what the group was.
The group was one of 78 associations that co-signed their own letter, released on Friday, reiterating their opposition to any economic development plan that "excludes investments in local communities," citing what they said was "Amazon's predatory practices."
Mr. Cuomo was particularly unpersuaded.
"This is a blow to the state, and I'll do everything I can to reverse it," he said. "You punch until you hear the bell, and the bell hasn't sounded."

Kushner security clearance raises new questions

Texto completo: President Trump early last year directed his then-chief of staff, John F. Kelly, to give presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance -- a move that made the retired Marine general so uncomfortable that he documented the request in writing, according to current and former administration officials.
After Kushner, a senior White House advisor, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, pressured the president to grant Kushner the long- delayed clearance, Trump instructed Kelly to fix the problem, according to a person familiar with Kelly's account, who described internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Kelly told colleagues that the decision to give Kushner top-secret clearance was not supported by career intelligence officials, and he memorialized Trump's request in an internal memo, according to two people familiar with the memo and with Kelly's concerns.

It is unclear how Kelly responded to Trump's directive. But by May, Kushner had been granted a permanent security clearance to view top-secret material -- a move that followed months of concern inside the White House about his inability to secure such access.
Kushner's lawyer publicly indicated the process had gone through normal channels, but Kelly disagreed, according to a person familiar with his reaction.
Kelly, who left the administration at the beginning of this year, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump's push to get Kushner clearance and Kelly's concerns about it were first reported by the New York Times, which also reported that then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn had concerns about Kushner's clearance.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to weigh in Thursday evening, saying: "We don't comment on security clearances."
Democrats say they plan to scrutinize Trump's role in securing Kushner's clearance. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) noted Thursday that his committee had already launched an investigation into the White House security clearance process and had yet to receive a response to its request for documents.
"The committee expects full compliance with its requests as soon as possible, or it may become necessary to consider alternative means to compel compliance," he said in a statement.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) said in a statement that his panel would also continue investigating the clearance process.
"The revelation that President Trump personally intervened to overrule White House security officials and the intelligence community to grant a top-secret security clearance to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is the latest indicator of the president's utter disregard for our national security and for the men and women who sacrifice so much every day to keep us safe," Schiff said. "There is no nepotism exception for background investigations."
In the first year of the administration, Kushner held an interim security clearance that allowed him to view top-secret and sensitive compartmented information, or SCI, which is intelligence related to sensitive sources. He was able to attend classified briefings, get access to the president's daily intelligence report and request information from the intelligence community.
But there was widespread concern in the White House about his lack of a permanent clearance.
In February 2018, Kelly limited the access of employees with interim security clearances to top-secret information after abuse allegations against a top aide. That policy caused Kushner's clearance to be downgraded to the "secret" level, a far lower level of access.
Kushner's lack of SCI access suggests that the CIA hadn't signed off on his receiving that level of intelligence, security experts said. He had struggled to obtain even his top-secret clearance, in part because of his contacts with certain foreign government officials, the Washington Post previously reported.
U.S. intelligence intercepted communications of foreign officials who discussed how they could manipulate Kushner, taking advantage of his business arrangements, financial difficulties at the time and his lack of foreign policy experience, according to current and former U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.

Texto completo: NFL draft combine: On-field workouts begin in Indianapolis
More than 300 NFL players are in Indianapolis this week to be evaluated and interviewed by teams in advance of the draft in April. So far, some players have gone through medical tests, interviews and measurements (we finally know how tall QB prospect Kyler Murray is. ) From Friday through Monday, NFL coaches and general managers actually get to watch the players do what they do in on-field workouts. Here are 10 players who could raise their draft stock with a good showing at the combine. Plus, check out USA TODAY Sports' latest mock draft, which projects the entire first round.
Residents survey damage as deadly California floods recede
Officials say that two towns affected by the historic floods in northern California will be accessible by car Friday after residents were forced to use kayaks and canoes on watery streets. Located about 80 miles west of Sacramento, the towns of Guerneville and neighboring Monte Rio were the two hardest-hit communities. The raging Russian River, swollen to near its highest level in a quarter-century, killed at least one person and flooded 2,000 homes, turning some towns into "islands. " Authorities had been particularly worried about mudslides from areas burned out by the 2017 North Bay wildfires that destroyed almost 150,000 acres in Sonoma and surrounding counties. Another half inch of rain may fall in the North Bay late Friday and early Saturday, the National Weather Service said, but not enough to significantly raise main rivers.

After a year of upheaval, NYCB picks new leaders

Texto completo: After a stormy year in which longtime New York City Ballet director Peter Martins resigned amid scandal, followed by a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment that led to the departures of three top male dancers, the company has announced new leadership. Jonathan Stafford, 38, a former dancer and part of the interim leadership team, has been appointed artistic director of the company and its training arm, the School of American Ballet.
Former NYCB star Wendy Whelan, 51, who retired in 2014 after a 30-year career, will be associate artistic director, starting March 12. Resident choreographer Justin Peck gets an additional title: artistic adviser.
Stafford and Whelan broke the news to the dancers in a packed meeting Thursday morning. "You could hear a pin drop in the studio," said principal dancer Teresa Reichlen. Applause followed the silence, said Reichlen, who was nearly moved to tears.
Whelan breaks a thick glass ceiling at the internationally esteemed NYCB, which, since its inception, has been led exclusively by men: founder George Balanchine, followed by Martins in partnership with choreographer Jerome Robbins, and then Martins alone. In a career of extraordinary distinction, Whelan mastered more than 50 ballets and was a favorite with audiences and such leading choreographers as Robbins, Alexei Ratmansky, Christopher Wheeldon, Twyla Tharp and William Forsythe. Since retiring, Whelan has pursued a solo career, also to great acclaim. She applied for the NYCB directorship, and a petition to hire her collected nearly 16,000 signatures.
Speaking by phone Thursday, Stafford and Whelan said that Stafford will handle the day-to-day artistic operations of the school and the company. Whelan will oversee programming, commissioning new works, coaching dancers in rehearsals and teaching.
"I feel extremely good about where I've landed," Whelan said. "I hope to learn from Jon and continue with what I do well, which is artistic collaborations and reaching outside the company for commissions."
Whelan said the dancers' response to their announcement reminded her of when Martins took over the company, a transition she witnessed as a young dancer.
"Anytime there's a change, there's a lot of confusion and questions," she said. "That's the natural way for things to go. This will be the same. It will take a lot of work. . . . We're trying to remove all this negative, bad energy and bad thinking."
Negative press has been the norm at the company for more than a year, with headlines such as the New York Post's "It's 'Swine Lake' at the NYC Ballet/#MeTutu I was sexually exploited by abusive 'frat boy' dancers." Former SAB student Alexandra Waterbury has sued the company and dancer Chase Finlay, alleging the sharing of sexually explicit images of unknowing female dancers. Finlay resigned and dancers Amar Ramasar and Zachary Catazaro were fired.
"For many years," Waterbury's complaint alleges, NYCB has "encouraged and permitted its male dancers to abuse, assault, degrade, demean, dehumanize and mistreat its female dancers and other women."
In January 2018, Martins stepped down amid accusations of violence and sexual harassment, which he denied but that several of his dancers described to The Washington Post and the New York Times.
NYCB and its school came under more criticism for the way they handled the complaints - by jointly commissioning an investigation that did not corroborate the allegations yet which prompted the company to draw up policies to better protect the dancers. The turmoil this past year has raised concerns among ballet insiders and other observers about an enabling culture at NYCB that has left dancers and students at SAB vulnerable to abuses inside and outside the studio.
"I can speak emphatically that there's not an unhealthy climate here," Stafford said. New measures he has instituted include annual performance reviews, which allow dancers to voice their concerns. He's also invited in former Balanchine stars to coach the dancers, including Patricia McBride, Edward Villella and Mikhail Baryshnikov. But Stafford had no definitive word on whether Martins would be among those coaches when his ballets were being rehearsed.
"Peter Martins's involvement will be under consideration," he said. "This is a really great moment in time when Wendy and I can look at everything."
Reichlen said the appointments felt like "a step in the right direction."
"First of all, acknowledging that the job was larger than one person could handle was great for the boards of both the school and the company to decide," she said.
"Wendy's always been my idol growing up, so for me to continue to work with this amazing woman - it gave me a lot of hope for the direction of the company," Reichlen added. "They're making a huge statement by hiring a woman, and her breadth of knowledge and experience, and the number of choreographers she's worked with is so vital for the specific mission of our company."
Whelan said she will continue with plans to perform "The Day," an hour-long solo choreographed by renowned modernist Lucinda Childs, accompanied by cellist Maya Beiser. She'll dance it in July at Jacobs Pillow Dance Festival, with plans for New York's Joyce Theater, the Kennedy Center and also Paris, in 2020. But she said she doesn't have plans beyond that.
Whelan's 2016 documentary about her last year as a ballerina, "Restless Creature," captured acute tensions between her and Martins; he took her out of "The Nutcracker," for example, leaving her distraught. But she said her new post was not a vindication.
"This feels like my opportunity to make the changes that I needed, to understand the dancers at a new level than what I left with," she said. "When I left I was confused, really coming out of a skin of the company that was what I grew up in."
With a few years' distance, Whelan said, she has gained an understanding of herself and her past, and this is what she wants to bring to the dancers "in a human way."
"I want to offer them what I felt was lacking: communication. I want to get that communication right, and get it kind and caring."

Texto completo: New York City Council Member Jumaane Williams is now one seat away from mayoralty.
Last night, Williams won the special election for public advocate. He emerged from a crowded field of 17 candidates to take 33 percent of the vote. New York City Council Member, and lone Republican in the race, Eric Ulrich finished second with 19 percent of the vote. Former Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito finished third with 11 percent of the vote.
"This campaign may have been relatively short but tliis journey has been long-it traces back across years of working with all of you on the front lines of the issues that matter to all of us-of fighting for transformational change in the streets and in the halls of government," said Williams at his victory party. "As your public advocate, 1 promise that we will take up these causes and more, with energ)', passion and resolve-to do what's right, no matter the political winds. I know I'll have all of you by my side in these fights."
The special election brought low voter turnout with more than 365,000 of an available 4.67 million active voters showing up to the polls. According to The New York Times, the New York City Board of Election spent up to $15 million on the special election.
Williams' rise from Councilmember to prominent fixture among progressive activists to the second-highest position in the city government coincided with the rise of the Working Families Party. He thanked the party for their support throughout his political career.
"A decade ago, 1 got connected up with the Working Families Party, before my first race for City Council and together we won," said Williams. "We fought to end the abuse of stop and frisk together, we fought for paid sick days together, we even mounted a statewide campaign this past fall together, and now this win is yours too, WFP. To Tish James, you left some pretty big shoes to fill...to the mayor, I'm not running for your job, but I'm going to work with you to make sure we work on behalf of the people."
In return, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio heaped praise on Williams and said he looked forward to engaging with him on issues affecting New Yorkers.
"I join all New Yorkers in congratulating Jumaane Williams for being elected New York City's public advocate," said de Blasio. "As a former public advocate, I know firsthand how important tliis office is to our city. The public advocate holds our entire city government accountable and amplifies the voices of all New Yorkers. I look forward to working with Public Advocate Williams to continue making tliis the fairest big city in America."
WFP State Director Bill Lipton declared Williams' victory a victory for the progressives and a victory for working class New Yorkers who want to hold City Hall accountable.
"This is another big victory for the progressive movement that swept away the corporate Democrats in the IDC and ousted Republicans from the State Senate," stated Lipton. "Tonight is proof positive that progressives in this state have never been stronger. We won't stop until we've built a New York that works for the many, not the few."
The public advocate's office has a $3.5 million budget and serves as the watchdog for City Hall. The public advocate has the ability to hold public hearings and, in a power not often used, introduce legislation.
Although Williams told de Blasio that he's not here to take his job, it's a fact that the previous two recent public advocates, de Blasio and New York State Attorney General Letitia James, have moved on to other positions. With rumors of de Blasio eyeing a presidential run, Williams would take over as mayor if de Blasio left early to pursue the White House.
New York State Assemblyman Michael Blake, who finished with only 8 percent of the vote, acknowledged to his supporters that it was a tough night, bur reminded New Yorkers of the mission at hand and what he hopes any public advocate would accomplish.
"This effort was never going to be an easy climb, and your hard work over the past few months is truly inspiring," stated Blake. "Our Jobs and Justice movement speaks out loud and clear, united by a belief that all New Yorkers deserve an equal opportunity to thrive. We are a movement which understands that addressing the root causes of inequity matters more than slogans. We believe that in order for all New Yorkers to [get) a fair shot at the Anerican Dream, we must deliver on jobs and justice for the people."
In a Deinocratic-dominated city like New York, one might find it surprising that a Republican, Ulrich, made a good showing in a non-mayoral election. But it didn't surprise New York GOP Chairman Ed Cox, who saw in the results a city that's fed up with the mayor and his stewardship of the five boroughs.
"Tonight, tens of thousands of New Yorkers sent a message that they are unhappy with the direction of tliis city under liberal Mayor de Blasio and want real accountability," stated Cox. "We congratulate Councilman Ulrich on running a hard-fought race and distinguishing himself as a true common-sense candidate. Wliile he came up short, tliis race affinned that Republicans can compete in New York City and issues matter."

Texto completo: A 45-year-old restaurant known for incredible sushi.
A nearly 100-year-old spot serving old-school Italian, at least to those lucky enough to get a table.
A struggling-pizzeria-turned-success-story, thanks to artisanal pies.
"This is very nice you know, because we really accomplished something," said Chizuku Fukuyoshi, who has run the sushi restaurant Sagami in Collingswood with her husband, Chef Shigeru Fukuyoshi, since 1974. (It is the second time the restaurant has been nominated.)
"I think we helped to spread the knowledge of Japanese food in this area," she said. "When we opened, there were quite a few Japanese restaurants in New York, where we were from, but over here they didn't know it at all. Now, everybody knows about Japanese food and we are very happy about that."
She credited her entire team with helping Sagami secure the Beard nomination.
"We have good employees who been here for so many years. At other restaurants, they seem to come and go and jump around, the servers and the cooks. Here, many have been here 20 years or more. They are good and we must be doing good for them, too.
"My husband works so hard, but now he is old," she said. "We are so very happy."
Sagami is among the six New Jersey restaurants named as 2019 James Beard Awards semifinalists. The James Beard Foundation made the announcement Wednesday.
The James Beard awards honor the best culinary talent in the country in categories that include best new restaurants, outstanding bar programs, bakers and rising star chefs 30 or younger, among others.
Finalists will be announced March 27 in Houston and the winners will be named May 6 in Chicago.
Here are New Jersey's nominees:
Maricel Presilla, Cucharamama in Hoboken, nominated for outstanding chef Maricel Presilla, the owner and chef of funky colorful pan-Latin restaurant Cucharamama, is not only an outstanding chef but a highly educated Latina who has earned a Ph.D. in medieval Spanish history from New York University. Cuban-born Presilla not only turns out some marvelous eats at Cucharamama but a block away at Zafra, her first Hoboken restaurant.
Presilla, who is considered to be a pre-eminent expert on Latin and Caribbean cuisine, has been feted numerous times before. Six years ago, her book, "Gran Cocina Latina: The Food of Latin America" was named Cookbook of the Year by the James Beard Foundation and Best General Cookbook by the International Association of Culinary Professionals. In 2012, she was named by the James Beard Foundation Best Chef-Mid Atlantic. Presilla is one of only two chefs in New Jersey who has ever won a James Beard award. The other is Craig Shelton, then of The Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, names Best Chef Mid Atlantic region in 2000.
Sagami in Collingswood, nominated for outstanding restaurant A block building in the shadow on the high-speed PATCO line and congested Route 130, Sagami is a Collingswood gem.
At 74, Chef Shigero Fukuyoshi continues to create some of the best at Sagami the way he learned as an apprentice in the early 1970s in a New York City restaurant.
This is the second time Sagami has received an Outstanding Restaurant nod from the Beard Foundation; the first was in 2007.
Shigeru Fukuyoshi and his wife, Chizuko Fukuyoshi, who manages Sagami, opened their restaurant in 1974 on the Camden border. Generations of South Jerseyans and Philadelphians have sat in Sagami's cozy wooden booths, where Chizuko recalls holding babies that now bring in babies of their own.
Go: Sagami, 37 Crescent Blvd. in Collingswood; 856-854-9773.
Chef Vola's in Atlantic City, nominated for outstanding service Never been to Chef Vola's?
Us neither. Reservations need to be made months in advance (by leaving a message on their phone line) for this old-school Italian restaurant, which has operated out of an unassuming house on Albion Place since 1921. The place has a top-secret feel, down to its private website, which you need a log in to access. But when the food is consistently great and the service exceptional, word of mouth is all that matters.
Diners adore Chef Vola's butterflied, bone-in veal parmigiana, draped with tomato sauce and served with a steak knife. Plus the piled-high spaghetti and clams, homestyle tossed salad, and banana cream pie.
Go: 111 S. Albion Place; 609-345-2022.
Chef Joey Baldino of Zeppoli in Collingswood, nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic Chef Joey Baldino must have a sense of humor about the Beard awards by now, as he's been nominated eight times, seven times as Best Chef in the Mid-Atlantic Region.
In its first year, Baldino's Zeppoli was nominated as Best New Restaurant. He also owns Palizzi Social Club, a private club and restaurant, in South Philadelphia.
In his tiny BYOB restaurant in West Collingswood, Baldino has championed Sicilian cuisine since opening Zeppoli in 2011. Baldino learned the ropes at the revered Anna Tasca Lanza cooking school in the Sicilian countryside. He also trained at The French Culinary Institute.
Each summer, Baldino hosts authentic Sicilian barbecues on the restaurant patio that sell out in minutes.
"Dinner at the Club: 100 Years of Stories and Recipes from South Philly's Palizzi Social Club" by Baldino and former Courier-Post restaurant critic Adam Erace is due out later this year.
Go: Zeppoli, 618 W. Collings Ave., Collingswood; 856-854-2670, zeppolirestaurant.com.
Randy Forrester of Osteria Radici in Allentown, nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic In winter 2017, the husband and wife team of Randy and Ally Forrester opened Osteria Radici, serving modern Italian food in the tiny borough of Allentown, tucked along the westernmost border of Monmouth County. Randy is the chef, making his own bread and pasta daily. Ally runs the front of house.
Four months later, the restaurant was named a James Beard semifinalist for best new restaurant. It was the only restaurant in New Jersey to be included on the list.
"I have wanted to be a chef since I was a teenager," Randy said last year. "I have dedicated half of my life to the industry and working toward the goal of opening a restaurant.
" It is surreal to learn that we have received national recognition for our first restaurant."
Go: 4 S Main St.; 609-223-2395, osteriaradici.com.
Dan Richer of Razza Pizza Artigianale in Jersey City, nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic This isn't the first time that Dan Richer has been nominated for a James Beard Award. He has been named several times, starting in 2011 when he was a Rising Star Chef semifinalist for his first restaurant, Arturo's Osteria & Pizzeria in Maplewood.
Richer, a self-effacing New Jersey born-and-bred Rutgers graduate, calls himself a humble pizza craftsman. But the pizzas that the 39-year-old crafts are so darn good that a glowing, 3-star New York Times review declared it "the best pizza in New York." Yes, that's right, New York?
He makes those Neapolitan-style pizzas by breaking nearly every rule, not using the requisite tomatoes, flour or even mozzarella that the powers that be say is needed to make the best Neapolitan pizzas. "I try to find out if there is a better way, better ingredient," he said.
He has also said that he had no desire to take his crafts-making skills across the river.
Does the craftsman think about taking his skills across the river where the handful of other, undeniably fancier, three-star restaurants ply their trade?
"New Jersey is where I live," he has told USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. "New Jersey is where I grew up. I never wanted a big restaurant or lots of restaurants. I'm just trying to make a great product and share it with my community"
Cannoli Classico is a favorite for many diners at Zeppoli Restaurant in
Collingswood.

Texto completo: Some prominent New Yorkers are asking Amazon to reconsider its abandonment of the Big Apple.
The company, which had announced the opening of a second headquarters in the Queens, Long Island City area of New York, shifted gears in early February in response to community protest over the generous tax breaks the state offered the retailer.
But in a letter signed by 40 CEOs (including the heads of Goldman Sachs, Hearst, Jet Blue, Citi Group and Deloitte), politicians (including three New York members of Congress) and the presidents of New York University and the United Federation of Labor, they ask Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to change his mind about pulling out of the city.
The ad is posted on the New York Times website, which is running the ad Friday.

New York Gov. Cuomo Appeals to Amazon to Reconsider; No signs that the tech company is rethinking its decision to scuttle its plans for a New York City headquarters

Texto completo: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that he has been in contact with Amazon.com Inc. executives, urging them to rethink their decision to abandon plans for a headquarters campus in Queens.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters on Long Island that there is no sign yet that the tech company has changed its mind. A person familiar with the matter said Mr. Cuomo spoke with Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos after the company abruptly told state officials it was scuttling the new development on Feb. 14.

"I've had many conversations with Amazon. I hope that they reconsider," Mr. Cuomo said.
The overture shows the lasting reverberations of Amazon's reversal of its plan to come to New York. Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio offered up to $3 billion of state and city incentives to bring the company to the Long Island City neighborhood. In return, Amazon promised to invest $2.5 billion and create 25,000 jobs.
Kathy Wylde, CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a business group, drafted an open letter to Mr. Bezos that is set to publish Friday in the New York Times. That paper first reported Mr. Cuomo's outreach to Mr. Bezos.
"Everybody's been exploring if there are ways to save this," Ms. Wylde said in an interview. "We wanted to put together a very eclectic group of New Yorkers to say people from all walks of life—business and labor—want to see Amazon here."
The letter's signatories include former New York City Mayor David Dinkins as well as the president of the New York State AFL-CIO and the CEOs of Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.
Mr. de Blasio has faulted Amazon since the collapse of the deal. Mr. Cuomo has blamed Democrats who control the New York state Senate. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins nominated a vocal opponent of the Amazon deal, state Sen. Mike Gianaris of Queens, to a state board that could have vetoed the project.

Texto completo: Alejandro G. Iñárritu, the Mexican director of the Oscar winners "Birdman" and "The Revenant," will lead this year's Cannes Film Festival jury, the festival said in a statement on Thursday.
Iñárritu, who has twice won the Academy Award for best director, will be the first Mexican to be president of the jury in the festival's 72-year history. Last year's jury president was Cate Blanchett.
In a statement, Iñárritu said, "Cannes is a festival that has been important to me since the beginning of my career." He added that "Cinema runs through the veins of the planet and this festival has been its heart."
Iñárritu has a long history with the festival. His first film, "Amores Perros," had its premiere at Cannes in 2000 and won immediate acclaim for its interweaving of three tales.
"It's rare that a director can enter films with this much verve and emotional understanding," wrote Elvis Mitchell in The New York Times. "In his very first film Mr. González Iñárritu makes the kind of journey some directors don't, or can't, travel in an entire career."
In 2006, Iñárritu won Cannes' best director award for "Babel," and in 2017 he created a virtual-reality installation for the festival, "Carne y Arena" ("Flesh and Sand" in English), which was the first such work to be included in Cannes' Official Selection.
"Cannes embraces all types of cinema," Pierre Lescure, president of the festival, said on Thursday in a statement, "and through the presence of 'Babel's' director, it is Mexican cinema that the festival will be celebrating."
"Not only is he a daring filmmaker and a director who is full of surprises, Alejandro is also a man of conviction, an artist of his time," Lescure added.
This year's festival runs from May 14 to May 25.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Pam Tanowitz - Choreographer
Pam Tanowitz is a celebrated New York based choreographer and collaborator known for her unflinchingly postmodern treatment of classical dance vocabulary. In 2000, she founded Pam Tanowitz Dance to explore dance-making with a consistent community of dancers.
In January 2019, Tanowitz was named the first Bard Fisher Center Choreographer in Residence. In 2016, Tanowitz was presented with the Juried Bessie Award for "using form and structure as a vehicle for challenging audiences to think, to feel, to experience movement; for pursuing her uniquely poetic and theatrical vision with astounding rigor and focus." Other honors include an Outstanding Production Bessie award in 2009 for her dance "Be In the Gray With Me", a Foundation for Contemporary Arts award in 2010, Guggenheim Fellowship in 2011, the Hodder Fellowship from Princeton University in 2013-14, a Fall 2016 fellowship at the Center for Ballet and the Arts at NYU, and named a 2016-2017 City Center Choreography Fellow. Her work was selected by The New York Times Best of Dance series in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018.
When awarding Ms.Tanowitz the 2017 BAC Cage Cunningham Fellowship, Mikhail Baryshnikov, the center's artistic director, said in a statement that "her work is not an imitation of dance history, but is a distinct intellectual journey." Her 2017 dance "New Work for Goldberg Variations", created for her company in collaboration with pianist Simone Dinnerstein, was called a "rare achievement" (The New York Times). Her most recent work, the 2018 creation Four Quartets, inspired by T.S. Eliot's literary masterpiece and set to music by Kaija Saariaho, was called "the greatest creation of dance theater so far this century" (The New York Times).
She has been commissioned by The Joyce Theater, The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bard Summerscape Festival, Vail International Dance Festival, New York Live Arts, The Guggenheim Museum's Works & Process series, Danspace Project, Lincoln Center Out of Doors, Chicago Dancing Festival, Baryshnikov Arts Center, Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Duke Performances, Peak Performances, FSU's Opening Nights Series, and the Institute for Contemporary Art/Boston.
Tanowitz has created or set work for City Center's Fall for Dance Festival, The Juilliard School, Ballet Austin, New York Theater Ballet and Saint Louis Ballet; and has been a guest choreographer at Barnard College, Princeton University.

Texto completo: “Si Maduro no podía aguantar una entrevista de Jorge Ramos, no se debió sentar con él”, afirmó tras llegar a Miami, deportada desde Venezuela, la productora María Martínez-Guzmán, vicepresidenta de Univision Noticias , miembro del grupo retenido el lunes durante una entrevista fallida con Nicolás Maduro en el Palacio de Miraflores.
“Pensábamos que (Maduro) se podría parar” de la entrevista, “pero nunca pensábamos que nos iban a confiscar los equipos. Confiscar no es la palabra. Nos robaron nuestros equipos “, dijo Martínez-Guzmán. “Los que más bruscos estaban, los más toscos, eran cubanos”, afirmó convencida sobre el entorno de Maduro, por ser ella cubano estadounidense.
Maduro interrumpió la entrevista luego de 17 minutos, dijo el mexicano Ramos. “Para frustración de los agentes de seguridad, María (Martínez-Guzmán) se las arregló para hacer una llamada fugaz al presidente de Univisión News, Daniel Coronell, quien a su vez le advirtió al Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos y anunció a muchos medios de comunicación lo que estaba pasando”.
“Si le hacen esto a Jorge Ramos, imagínate lo que les pasa a otros periodistas en Venezuela”, comentó Elyangélica González, corresponsal venezolana de Univision, asilada en Florida.
“Nos apuntaron con una pistola en la cabeza por 30 segundos”, declaró el también periodista mexicano Pedro Ultreras en referencia a otro episodio durante su estadía el fin de semana en la zona fronteriza con Colombia. “Pensamos que nos iban a matar”.
“El gobierno de Maduro se aferra a que el mundo no conozca lo que pasa en ese país”, sentenció Ultreras en referencia a la difícil labor de los periodistas locales y extranjeros en esa nación. “Los colectivos son sicarios del gobierno”, agregó.
Ultreras viajó a Venezuela para cubrir la crisis que atraviesa el país suramericano y allá comenzó a ser perseguido por unos sujetos con perdigones. Según el canal, él no sabía si eran miembros de la Guardia Nacional o colectivos paramilitares fieles a Maduro.
Logró escapar, pero luego enfrentó otro momento de pánico cuando le apuntaron con una pistola. “Era (una situación) muy difícil, para luego llegar a Caracas”, relató en referencia al episodio que vivió el equipo de Ramos el lunes.
Según el Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Prensa (SNTP) de Venezuela, en lo que va de año suman “al menos 30 detenciones de periodistas y trabajadores de los medios” en ese país.
El martes, mientras el equipo de Univision era deportado, el corresponsal Daniel Garrido de Telemundo News también fue detenido por agentes de Maduro.
Ramos resumió su experiencia en una columna en español que publicó hoy The New York Times , titulada “El dictador de Venezuela se gana su título”.
“Fui deportado de Venezuela el martes 26 de febrero después de una entrevista tirante con Nicolás Maduro, el mandatario del país. En medio de nuestra conversación se levantó y se fue, y sus agentes de seguridad confiscaron nuestras cámaras, las tarjetas de memoria con la grabación y nuestros celulares. Sí, Maduro se robó la entrevista para que nadie pudiera verla”, es parte del artículo.
Aquí va mi columna para The New York Times en español sobre lo que nos pasó en Venezuela.

How Trump’s split-screen presidency transfixes a divided US

Resumen: The president’s domestic travails may be peaking at the same moment as one of his critical foreign ventures. Beyond the outcome of the hearing or the summit, what will this test of multifront governing reveal?

Texto completo: On one side of the screen, President Trump sits pensively, leaning forward, tapping his fingers together. Next to him, a smiling Kim Jong-un takes his seat.
Behind the US and North Korean leaders are a row of their nations’ flags, interspersed, a screen of white, red, and blue. They’re at the start of a summit that American officials hope will lead to curbs on North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, and perhaps to eventual denuclearization.
On the other side of the screen sits Michael Cohen. The president’s former lawyer is impassive, for the most part, as he testifies before a congressional committee that he believes Mr. Trump to be a “con man” and a “cheat.”
He then gets into a tense, almost-shouting match with Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who’s defending the president. Mr. Cohen has little left to lose – he’s already going to jail.
Just another day, another routine clashing of news images in the split-screen presidency of the 45th chief executive of the United States.
The use of “split-screen” as an image to describe the clashing events and themes of this Washington era is almost a cliché at this point, of course. It’s an obvious way to describe an administration that’s saturated in events and a country that’s divided on partisan lines.
The president takes an action. His critics produce a reaction. As events, they’re separate, different sides of the wide screen. But they’re also intertwined, each one altering, at least a bit, the meaning of the other.
It’s interesting that during the campaign, Trump warned that a Hillary Clinton presidency would have looked like this, as well. “Crooked” Hillary would have been the subject of so many investigations it would hobble her administration, he said.
Instead that’s been the story of Trump, says Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government in the school of public affairs at American University. Trump has been dogged by criticism that inevitably occupies his mind and takes up some of his time.
“That’s been his entire presidency, and I expect it likely will be his presidency for the foreseeable future,” Professor Edelson says.
Some of Trump’s biggest split-screen days of clashing news have involved foreign travel. He was departing on an Asia tour in November 2017 when special counsel Robert Mueller dropped his first big indictments, against ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort and others.
The president was at Windsor Castle with Queen Elizabeth last July when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking into the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee computers.
But Wednesday was perhaps the most head-swiveling split-screen day yet. Trump greeted Mr. Kim with a public embrace at the beginning of a two-day summit. Then Cohen took the stage in a public hearing before the House Oversight Committee, in the first big event scheduled by the chamber’s new Democratic majority.
Cohen appeared, if not relaxed, at least focused and effective in making the points he wanted to make. Trump had not expected to win, he said, but had thought running for president a great way to market himself and his company.
“Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make the country great,” said Cohen.
The president’s former lawyer showed lawmakers a $35,000 check signed by Trump in August 2017 that he said was partial reimbursement for the hush money paid to adult actress Stormy Daniels.
Cohen claimed to have overheard a phone call to Trump from former associate Roger Stone alerting the then-candidate that Wikileaks was about publish emails that would damage Mrs. Clinton’s campaign.
Cohen described a whispered conversation between Trump and Donald Trump Jr. in which the son may have told his father about an upcoming Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and Russians who had Clinton “dirt” to offer.
Partisan reviews Taking a break from the proceedings, Oversight Committee member Rep. Jim Cooper (D) of Tennessee said in an interview that much of Cohen’s testimony was very predictable but also very important.
“I hope the nation is watching because this is a very valuable insight to the way the president operated primarily before he was president, but also some during the presidency,” says Representative Cooper.
Republican defenders of the president on the panel felt otherwise, and pointed out that Cohen has already been convicted once of lying to Congress, among other crimes, and is positioning himself to write a book and perhaps engage in profitable television ventures.
But not all GOP members of the panel were harshly negative about the hearing. In a brief interview, Rep. Justin Amash (R) of Michigan says a lot of it was partisan theater, but the panel heard some new things and maybe some new things that could be corroborated.
At one point, Cohen said he had been intoxicated by working for Trump. Representative Amash, asked whether he thinks Republican Trump defenders have been similarly intoxicated, says he thinks that’s true.
“A lot of Republicans have abandoned their principles for the president, and I similarly think a lot of Democrats are abandoning their principles because of the president,” the Michigan Republican says.
Impact on foreign affairs Can domestic scandals “taint” presidential achievements in foreign affairs? That’s happened in the past, in the sense that presidential opponents have portrayed White House actions taken at moments of domestic policy stress as attempts to distract voters.
President Bill Clinton, for instance, launched cruise missile strikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan only three days after testifying in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Critics charged Mr. Clinton was acting to try and get the Lewinsky matter off front pages.
That’s not really a fair charge, says Edelson of American University. In general, chief executives have been able to compartmentalize their serious decision-making.
“That’s not fair to a president. It’s not a good thing for the country,” he says.
In regards to Trump, the nation needs to resolve the issues and allegations swirling around his actions, from hush-money payments to Ms. Daniels to the many items related to special counsel Mueller’s Russia investigation.
“It’s hard for everyone to have this going on,” says Edelson.
Besides Clinton, one other US chief executive who faced a serious split-screen, domestic-international situation was Richard Nixon. In 1973, as the Watergate scandal gained steam, the president increased his diplomatic efforts, including superpower nuclear negotiations.
In June of that year, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev visited Washington. Nixon and he made important progress toward a second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, and signed a number of other secondary accords. Transcripts of their discussions show jovial, almost friendly chats. Neither brought up the subject of Watergate allegations.
On Monday, June 25, 1973, the lead story of The New York Times dealt with the end of the summit and the hopes of Nixon and Brezhnev for world peace. Across the page, above the fold, was a story of almost equally prominent play. “Dean On Stand,” it said.
Nixon’s former counsel John Dean was appearing before the Senate Watergate Committee. It was a key moment in the scandal. By August, Nixon had resigned.

Texto completo: This year's Whitney Biennial, considered the country's most important showcase of contemporary art, has 75 participating artists -- and one who has already withdrawn.
The biennial, no stranger to controversy, is an indicator of currents in the field as well as a career booster for the artists included. Past editions have sparked debates over identity and representation, but this year, before the list of participants was even released, a Chicago-based artist, Michael Rakowitz, pulled out of the exhibition in a protest against a museum vice chairman, Warren Kanders. Mr. Kanders is the chief executive of a company that manufactures equipment, including body armor and tear gas, for law enforcement agencies and militaries. The New York Times received a copy of Mr. Rakowitz's letter to the curators, dated Dec. 18, withdrawing from the show.
The exhibition's curators, Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta -- both of whom work at the Whitney -- said in an interview Sunday that they respected Mr. Rakowitz's decision and regret that he won't be involved in the biennial's 79th iteration, for which they tried to bring together "as broad a range of artists as we could in all kind of senses of that word, whether that's medium-wise, interest-wise, geographically, demographically, generationally," in Ms. Hockley's words.
Indeed, the list of participants, which The Times has previewed, is very diverse. Among the more high-profile names are Nicole Eisenman, Jeffrey Gibson, Barbara Hammer and Wangechi Mutu. People of color are a majority, and it's one of the youngest groups in the biennial's history, with three-quarters of the participants under the age of 40. Only five have ever exhibited in a Whitney Biennial before.
Ms. Hockley explained that these choices weren't due to a fascination with all things "hot, young, new," but rather grew out of traveling around the country and seeing how many artists were facing "an incredible amount of pressure coming from all sides," including the burden of debt from M.F.A. programs, the collapse of smaller galleries that might help launch their careers and the difficulty of finding and keeping affordable studio space.
For most artists, inclusion in the 2019 Whitney Biennial is not only a tangible milestone but also an affirmation of their work and an encouragement to keep going. "It's a huge deal, because it allows me to move forward in a greater way," said Brendan Fernandes, whose installations and performances combine visual art and dance. For the biennial, Mr. Fernandes, a former ballet dancer who is based in Chicago, will present a new version of a piece titled "The Master and Form," which consists of archaic-looking wooden scaffolding and devices that allow performers to hold the five basic ballet positions for long periods of time. "For me it is a social-political space, a piece that questions the agency of the body, the agency of the dancer and our labor," said Mr. Fernandes.
The Los Angeles-based artist Ragen Moss is also concerned with the body and how it functions within society -- what she describes as the "beautiful tension that we each experience as this round, awkward, spatial, embodied being that is also inscribed by language." Ms. Moss makes hanging, transparent sculptures that she embeds with layers and paints and that are evocative of human forms. For the Whitney Biennial, she made nine sculptures representing types, including a lawmaker, a laborer and a rule breaker, that were her answer to the question, "What are the characters or ways of being that our particularized moment are forcing us to reckon with?"
To its curators, the 2019 biennial feels very much like a product of its time, with artists "grappling with questions about race, gender, financial inequality, gentrification, the vulnerability of the body," said Ms. Panetta. But she added that the work in the show mostly strikes a tone that's less "agitprop-like or angry" than one might expect in 2019. "It's really work that feels more productive, forward looking, with a kind of optimistic and hopeful tenor to it."
Her hopeful tone is somewhat at odds with the controversy that has been dogging the Whitney in recent months -- and that led Mr. Rakowitz to pull out of the biennial.
The protests over Mr. Kanders's presence on the Whitney's board began last November, when Hyperallergic reported that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents had used Safariland's tear gas on asylum seekers at the Mexican border. In response, 95 members of the Whitney staff signed a letter to the museum's leadership demanding that the board of trustees "consider asking" for Mr. Kanders's resignation and requesting "the development and distribution of a clear policy around trustee participation." Ms. Hockley signed the letter; Ms. Panetta did not.
Adam Weinberg, the Whitney's director, responded with a letter to the staff and trustees that said the institution "is first and foremost a museum. It cannot right all the ills of an unjust world, nor is that its role."
Mr. Kanders also wrote a letter defending his company as a manufacturer and supplier of "nonlethal products."
Mr. Rakowitz, who makes conceptual art projects that often focus on vulnerable people and communities, saw the photographs from the border as a disturbingly clear visualization of what he called "toxic philanthropy."
"I felt like I'd be betraying everything that I've ever cared about in the work that I make" had he participated in the exhibition, he said in an interview. "You wouldn't compromise the integrity of a work on paper by showing it in unsafe conditions. You should not compromise the integrity of an artist and ask them to show with funding and permission from people that make conditions unsafe for others."
Commissioned for the biennial to create new work for a project re-creating the artifacts and sites destroyed in the Iraq War, Mr. Rakowitz said he decided that the best way to support the Whitney's employees was to withdraw from the show as an act of both protest and solidarity. "I felt like the only way to truly leverage any kind of voice was to say that often times what an artist doesn't do is more important than what they said they will do," he explained.
There has been closer scrutiny in recent years of whom museums pick to serve on their boards. In January the art-and-labor-focused organization WAGE put out a call inviting artists in the 2019 Whitney Biennial to "put [their] exceptionality to work" by withholding their art from the show until they got paid for their participation and the demands laid out in the Whitney staff letter were met. The Whitney confirmed that participants in the 2019 biennial are being paid. (The Times later learned the amount is $1,500, the fee WAGE suggested.)
The activist movement Decolonize This Place has also been leading protests at the Whitney, beginning with a gathering and burning of sage in the museum's lobby in December. The following month, the group held a town hall meeting that was attended by more than 200 people, including employees of the Whitney. In an interview, Amin Husain, an organizer with the group, called the Whitney Biennial "a Band-Aid of representation."
His co-organizer, the artist Nitasha Dhillon, said, "What we're saying is that this structure needs to change, and it needs to begin somewhere."
Asked about the protests, Mr. Fernandes said that they had resonated with him, leading him to ask, "What is my responsibility as an artist that's in this biennial within this museum?" Ultimately, though, he decided he could be most effective by remaining in the exhibition and speaking through this work. "I am an artist that has a political voice, and my voice needs to be heard," he said.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
A decade-old arrest of Councilman Jumaane Williams has surfaced in the final stretch of the New York City public advocate's race, roiling what had already been an unpredictable contest as his rivals demanded more information just before the polls were set to open on Tuesday.
Mr. Williams, 42, on Monday acknowledged that he had been arrested a decade ago on harassment and criminal mischief charges and spent a night in custody after what he called a "verbal disagreement" with his girlfriend at the time. Charges were dropped and the arrest record itself is sealed.
Mr. Williams is seen as a leading candidate in the public advocate contest after he finished a close second in his insurgent run for lieutenant governor last year against the Democratic incumbent, Kathy Hochul.
The field for the special election features 17 candidates, and several female rivals used the last-minute revelation of the arrest to raise questions about Mr. Williams's fitness for the position. Another City Council member, an ally of Mr. Williams, called for an investigation into who leaked what had been a sealed arrest record.
A law enforcement official said Mr. Williams's girlfriend at the time had called the police on the evening of Jan. 9, 2009, after a dispute with Mr. Williams that included him throwing items at her, putting her in fear for her safety.
A chair, a wall and a Christmas ornament were damaged but the damages did not exceed $250 in value. There were no injuries, and Mr. Williams was arrested.
In an interview on Monday, Mr. Williams said the events leading up to the 2009 arrest began as an argument, but he did not recall what it was about. During the argument, Mr. Williams said that he threw his girlfriend's purse on the floor and left the apartment to get food for both.
"I went to turn to leave and I tripped over a chair the chair hit the wall and a snow globe fell from a half shelf," he added. Mr. Williams said he did not intentionally damage the chair or the snow globe. He denied throwing anything at the woman.
After returning from getting food, Mr. Williams said that he was surprised to see police officers at his home. "They told me to turn around and put your hands behind your back," he said. He said he did not know who had called the police.
A police official said that arrests are mandated in domestic violence cases where there is probable cause. Mr. Williams said he was not formally charged with anything and returned to court one more time in the matter. During that appearance, the judge dismissed the case and sealed the records.
Mr. Williams's ex-girlfriend, whom The New York Times is not identifying because she was an alleged victim in a possible abuse case, declined to comment. She had been with Mr. Williams for five years at the time of the arrest.
Campaigning in Brownsville, Brooklyn, a day after news of his arrest became public in The New York Daily News on Sunday, Mr. Williams said, "I still wonder why something that was dismissed and sealed, why that would be leaked?"
Mr. Williams said the incident is being used to perpetuate stereotypes about black men.
"There is a tendency to talk about black men in this way as angry. There is a tendency to use things like this to inform that. It's a thing," Mr. Williams said.
He also criticized Melissa Mark-Viverito, a former City Council speaker, and Nomiki Konst, a progressive activist, for holding a joint news conference to call attention to the arrest.
"They both know how easy it is for 'black man syndrome' to take hold," Mr. Williams said. "I wish they would be more responsible. If you want to have this discussion, there is a better way."
Ms. Mark-Viverito and Ms. Konst, who have sparred aggressively with each other at debates, joined together to call for more information from Mr. Williams.
Ms. Mark-Viverito said she was "deeply concerned" by the arrest report. "Let's not forget," she said pointedly, "this public advocate's race began because of violence against women."
It's true that a February special election is taking place because the previous public advocate, Letitia James, left the office after she was elected New York State attorney general. And that office only became open last year because the former attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, resigned in disgrace following accusations that he had physically assaulted multiple women.
Another female candidate for public advocate, Dawn Smalls, who is a lawyer, on Monday called for Mr. Williams or his lawyer to release his sealed arrest record, even as she said "the timing of this report raises red flags given the election is tomorrow."
The disclosure of the arrest led the City Council majority leader, Laurie A. Cumbo, to send a letter to the Police Department's inspector general's office requesting that the leak be investigated for violations of police and city policies.
Mr. Williams's supporters continued to stand by him on the eve of the election.
"Jumaane has been transparent. It was a learning experience, it was a long time ago and no one got hurt," said Gale A. Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, who endorsed Mr. Williams. "This is not a #MeToo situation."

Who's Deplorable Now? Democrats wonder if they still need the Midwest.

Texto completo: It must be exhausting these days serving as a Democratic political operative. The party remains in a seemingly endless debate over how much to favor some demographic groups of American voters—and how much to punish others.
At one point there seemed to be a Democratic consensus that the party's disappointing performance in 2016 had a lot to do with ignoring or deploring blue-collar voters in the Midwest. And at least some of the party's current and potential 2020 presidential candidates still hold this view. This week in the New York Times, Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report from Iowa:
With polls indicating that electoral viability is as important to voters as any policy issue, a handful of the party's prospects are already holding up their Midwestern credentials to make the case that they are the ones who can turn Big 10 country — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin — blue again.
But the Timesmen add:
Yet far away from the mounting snowdrifts that line every curb here, there is a growing school of thought that Democrats should not spend so much time, money and psychic energy tailoring their message to a heavily white, rural and blue-collar part of the country when their coalition is increasingly made up of racial minorities and suburbanites. The party should still pursue voters who have drifted toward Republicans, this thinking goes, but should also place a high priority on mobilizing communities more amenable to progressive politics.
The numerical swap between the three Rust Belt states that handed Mr. Trump the White House and the most alluring trio of Sun Belt targets is nearly even: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin have a combined 46 electoral votes, while North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona offer 42. And an aspirational "reach" state like Texas would offer a larger trove of electoral votes for Democrats than the combined total of Ohio and Iowa, states that have started to slip away from the party.
Perhaps Democratic politicos are just trying to play the policy hand they've been dealt. If one were to design an agenda to alienate blue-collar voters in the industrial Midwest, it would look a lot like the Green New Deal.
But deploring traditional Middle Americans who work with their hands might not be any more fun for the Democratic nominee in 2020 than it was for Hillary Clinton in 2016. That's because assembling a winning coalition without them may require a lot of psychic energy.
Public broadcaster David Bernstein of WGBH in Boston writes in Politico about the increasing strength President Trump is showing in some recent polls of Hispanic-Americans. Mr. Bernstein throws cold water on the Sun Belt strategy:
Now, here's the brutal truth for Democrats: If Hispanic Americans are in fact showing surging approval of Trump, he could be on his way to matching or exceeding the 40 percent won by George W. Bush in his 2004. If Trump does 12 percentage points better than his 2016 numbers with the growing Hispanic vote, it pretty much takes Florida, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina off the table for Democrats, who would need to sweep Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House. At the same time, that 12-point shift would give Trump a clear shot at winning Colorado and Nevada, states where Hispanic voters make up well over 10 percent of the electorate and where Clinton won by 5 percentage points or less in 2016.
Democrats may have helped Mr. Trump's re-election chances when they decided that limiting border wall funding was more important to them than securing legal status for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Louise Radnofsky and Natalie Andrews report in the Wall Street Journal:
Even when lawmakers began meeting behind closed doors to hammer out a 2019 spending deal that would include some money for border barriers, Democrats in both chambers agreed early in the process in a meeting in Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office that the Dreamer issue would stay off the negotiating table unless the president intervened and insisted on it.
Some argued that temporary protections in exchange for a permanent wall was a bad deal. A senior Democratic aide said the decision was made because there was limited time to resolve a range of spending issues, and throwing immigration policy into the mix could have thwarted negotiations.
House Democrats now plan to introduce a version of a bill next month to grant permanent protections to the Dreamers, an aide to Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D., Calif.) said. But the measure will be heard by the Judiciary Committee before it has a vote, meaning it could be several weeks, if not months, before a floor vote.
And of course Democrats gave away their leverage to force Senate passage by refusing to give the President the wall funding he sought. It's almost as if Democrats would rather use immigration as a political weapon than craft a legislative solution.
Sean Sullivan of the Washington Post reports on another challenge for Democrats hoping to pursue a Sun Belt strategy. The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela could become an electoral crisis for certain U.S. politicians. Mr. Sullivan writes:
Adding to the tension is growing concern among Democrats that Trump and his allies, seizing on the party's leftward shift, will move to portray his potential 2020 challengers as socialists and point to Venezuela's collapse as a symbol of what's wrong with the views they espouse.
Florida Democrats are disavowing the recent refusal by presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described democratic socialist, to label Maduro a dictator and call for him to go, though Sanders has criticized him.
"They are clearly ignorant comments, and someone who's running for president of the United States should be better briefed and knowledgeable about this crisis in Venezuela and how it impacts the Florida political landscape," said Christian Ulvert, a Florida Democratic strategist who is of Nicaraguan descent and whose husband's family has roots in Venezuela.
Sounds like pretty soon the Democrats may be back up north looking for candidates with Midwestern roots. But who's going to break the news to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her Green New Deal comrades that the party may still need Middle America?

Update
Over the weekend Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute noted that after your humble correspondent published a story on the University of California, San Diego's intention to hold a biology conference with "only women speakers," the university removed this reference from the description of the conference on its website. However the university now chooses to describe its event, attendees will learn this week whether the school has chosen to enforce its gender ban during two days of research presentations.

Texto completo: It’s hard to package history, race and truth in one cinematic box.
Hollywood claims to have done this with the “The Green Book,” which won three Academy Awards Sunday night, including Best Picture.
The story was based on the friendship between Anthony “Lip” Vallenlonga, an Italian-American bouncer from the Bronx and renowned African-American musician Don Shirley, whom Vallenlonga in 1962 chauffeured through the Deep South.
As he accepted the best picture Oscar, "Green Book" director Peter Farrelly said the film that featured Mahershala Ali as Shirley and Viggo Mortensen as Vallenlonga was about “love” at a time when race, class and prejudice divided much of the country.
But there is no love for Vallenlonga from members of the Shirley family, who say they and their potential contributions to the film were shut out.
When Ali won the supporting actor Oscar, Shirley's family was on Skype.
“Everybody was happy for Mahershala Ali and the first words out of his mouth was thank you to Dr. Don Shirley," said Shirley’s niece, Jasmin Shirley.
But jubilation turned to anger when it was announced that the "Green Book" received an Oscar for Best Original Screen Play,” and then Best Picture.
“I was livid. . . . There was no recognition of my Uncle Donald or our family,” Jasmin Shirley said. Indeed, director Spike Lee seemed ready to walk out of the Dolby Theatre after the best picture win, and the Twitterati seemed miffed that Hollywood picked a white savior film over "Black Panther" and Spike Lee’s "BlacKkKlansman. "
In their acceptance speeches, director Peter Farelly and screenplay writer Nick Vallenlonga never mentioned the Shirley family, but in a post-awards media press conference Vallenlonga, son of Anthony Vallenlonga, addressed the controversy.
“If you are discussing the Don Shirley family thing, that falls on me," Vallenlonga said. "Don Shirley himself told me himself not to speak to anyone. He told me the story that he wanted to tell. ”

But members of Shirley’s family say the depiction of Don Shirley is just not true. For starters, they say Vallenlonga was hired to drive Shirley on a tour of historically black colleges and universities, not a tour of segregated venues across the South. The lens through which the story is framed is another issue.
Video: Donald Shirley, in his own words
“The thing that bothers our family is the focus of the film is all about a white man who was an extreme racist who was still a racist at the end,” said Karole Shirley Kimble, daughter of Shirley’s brother Maurice. “Clearly, our family has a legacy of black excellence and family pride. Our concern is that (this) white director presented one person’s perspective. ”
What is not in dispute is that Vallenlonga used the real "Green Book" to find places for he and Shirley to eat and sleep. The guidebook was created by Victor Green, a New York city postal worker, and published between 1936 and 1967. It was as cherished as the family bible for many African American families who often made long trips across the country on dark highways lined with segregated corridors and hate.
The book grew in popularity and size thanks to J. D. Rockefeller and his Esso gas stations, but fell out of favor in the 1960s once accommodations were integrated. A Smithsonian Channel documentary, “The Green Book Guide to Freedom,” featuring home movies of African American families, debuts Monday night.
Kimble said had the movie makers asked the family, they would have gotten a more realistic view of Shirley’s tour.
“They didn’t (include) my family," Kimble said. "They didn’t listen to the other side of the story. They listened to other whites talk about my uncle. ”
Donald Walbridge Shirley was born in Pensacola, Florida, on Jan. 29, 1927. His parents were Jamaican immigrants. His father, Edwin, was an Episcopal priest and his mother, Stella, worked as a schoolteacher. She died two days after delivering Shirley's brother, Maurice, who eventually became a psychologist. Two other brothers, Calvin Hylton Shirley and Edwin Shirley Jr. , became physicians. Donald Shirley earned three doctorates.
“Grandfather Shirley believed that there was a time to work and a time to play. He believed in the scripture that obedience is better than sacrifice and he molded his children and grandchildren in that way,” said Kimble, adding that after their mother died the brothers worked hard at cooking and cleaning so that their father wouldn't get married again. But Edwin Shirley did marry again after he moved the family to Fort Lauderdale, and he and his new wife had a daughter, Edwina.
A prodigy, Shirley began playing piano at age 2. By 9, he was studying music theory at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music. He started playing professionally in 1955 at age 18 with the Boston Pops, performing Tchaikovsky’s "Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat. "
“At every stop his family was there,” said Jasmin Shirley, adding that he learned to play from his mother, who was the organist at St. Cyprian Episcopal Church in Pensacola.
The Shirleys lived in St. Cyprian's parsonage, in the shadows of the Belmont-DeVilliers neighborhood, a booming African American business corridor in 1930s Pensacola. The area was filled with churches, business owners, medical professionals, funeral homes and large family homes.
“I remember the Shirley boys playing in this house,” said Maggie Polkinghorne Wilson, 84, whose brother was Lt. James Porkinghorne, a Tuskegee Airman and World War II pilot.
Shirley attended the Catholic University of America as well as the University of Chicago, and earned doctorates of music, psychology and liturgical arts. But he became disenchanted with musical performance.
In a 2018 video from a planned, never completed documentary with the working title of “Let It Shine: Don Shirley," he was filmed in his New York City apartment above Carnegie Hall, where he talked about his goals.
“I was dead set on being, all my life, what I was trained to be, although I had to go through the back doors of the nightclub,” Shirley said.
Despite performing with symphonies in Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and other cities, Shirley ended up taking the advice of New York theater producer Sol Hurok, who told him that white audiences in the United States were not ready for a “colored” playing classical piano on the concert stage. He was better received in overseas venues from Africa to Europe.
“He was a child prodigy but he couldn’t be a classical pianist because of the color of his skin. You can hear the pain in his voice. You can see his anger. He was angry because he was disrespected,” Jasmin Shirley said of the documentary.
The film portrays Shirley as a lonely man who was estranged from his family. But Kimble said Don Shirley kept up with his family until he died on April 6, 2013.
“His biggest treat was traveling to Milan, Italy, and performing at La Scala, the world’s largest opera house,” Kimble said.
Shirley recorded hundreds of pieces, and two of his favorites was a remake of “Bridge Over Trouble Waters,” and “This Little Light of Mine. ”
Shirley blended classical music with jazz and pop music to create his own style. But to his own frustration, most of his performances were in nightclubs instead of concert halls, and he sought to differentiate himself from regular nightclub performers.
“They smoke while they're playing, and they'll put the glass of whisky on the piano, and then they'll get mad when they're not respected like (classical pianist) Arthur Rubinstein," Shirley said in a 1982 New York Times interview. "You don't see Arthur Rubinstein smoking and putting a glass on the piano. . . . The black experience through music, with a sense of dignity, that's all I have ever tried to do. ”

Where to Begin? A Guide to Getting Into Podcasts

Texto completo: As a content-obsessed millennial, I have made podcasts part of my daily routine for years. I listen while commuting, cooking, running errands, putting away laundry, washing dishes or during any relatively mindless activity that can be done while wearing wireless headphones.
My bond with podcasts is so cemented that it comes as a shock when someone I meet at a party -- or someone in my family, or a friend I thought I knew -- tells me that they, in the year 2019, do not listen to podcasts. And never have. And don't really get what it's all about. And, worse, don't quite know how to start.
Their reasons range from "I don't have time" to "It's passed me by" to "What should I even listen to?" Luckily, those concerns are easily answered and dispatched. For anyone who wants to become a full-fledged podcast listener, here's what you need to know to get into it, from experts who know best.
The Right App
To keep and organize your podcasts, you'll need a podcast app that allows you to subscribe to new shows and listen. If you're brand-new to podcasts, the stock podcast app already installed on your smartphone is the easiest point of entry; for iPhone, you have the Apple Podcasts app, and for Android users, the easiest option is to play podcasts through the Play Music app.
Beyond that, there is a huge range of third-party apps to choose from, but the app I use regularly and like best -- and the favorite among the podcast experts interviewed for this article -- is Pocket Casts, which costs a one-time payment of $3.99 on both Android and iOS.
Nicholas Quah, who writes the podcast industry newsletter Hot Pod and is a podcast critic for Vulture, uses six different podcast apps, but prefers Pocket Casts. Dana Gerber-Margie, co-founder of the Bello Collective, a volunteer-run podcast review website and newsletter, has used many apps, most recently Stitcher, and made the switch to Pocket Casts because others "couldn't handle the amount of subscriptions that I was maintaining." (Currently, she subscribes to 1,427 podcasts in all and regularly listens to between 40 and 50.)
Jody Avirgan, podcast host for FiveThirtyEight and ESPN's "30 for 30," too, uses Pocket Casts, because of the way it's filtered and organized, but emphasized there's not "a huge difference between the apps, especially for someone who's totally starting from scratch."
Take the Show on the Road
Now that you have an app, make sure you can listen wherever and whenever you have the most time. Podcasts are all about killing two birds with one stone by listening while you do other things. For Mr. Quah of Hot Pod, "that's part of the fun of it."
"A lot of the world feels a little boring sometimes, so having that layer on top of it is great," he said.
For many people, commuting by car takes up a large chunk of the day, so make sure your ride is wired for sound. For those using mass transit, I cannot recommend enough a pair of sound-canceling headphones. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, picked the Sony H.ear On 2 headphones as its favorite. But if that's too steep a cost, at least invest in a pair of wireless earbuds; for those, Wirecutter recommends the Jabra Elite 65t. Once you banish cords from your life and can connect your phone with the touch of a button, your podcast habit will kick into high gear.
Beyond that, I'd recommend getting a cheap, portable Bluetooth speaker at home. I carry mine around the house as I'm puttering, sticking it in a cabinet in the kitchen, on a shelf in the hall or in a nook outside the shower to fully maximize my podcast-listening time. (And for those who want their speaker inside the shower, get a waterproof model: Wirecutter recommends the Tribit X-Boom.)
Finding Favorites
Now that you have your app and gadgets, you're ready for the fun part: finding podcasts you're going to love.
If it feels overwhelming, it's not just you: Though podcasts have been around for at least a decade, there's still no central database or clearinghouse for the thousands of podcasts out there, Ms. Gerber-Margie said.
"A lot of discovery happens via the way you choose to listen. There's no 'New York Times best-seller list,"' she said.
However, big podcasting powerhouses are a great first place to look. National Public Radio produces many worthwhile podcasts, including "Invisibilia," "Planet Money" and the daily news show "Up First." Likewise, public radio stations across the country produce a ton of great shows, like "Last Seen" by Boston's WBUR and "Making Obama" by Chicago's WBEZ, and large podcasting studios -- Radiotopia, Gimlet Media, Maximum Fun -- will give a range of solid choices with excellent production value. (We list some of our favorite shows below.)
To mix in niche or offbeat podcasts with your brand-name shows, Mr. Quah of Hot Pod suggests going the old-fashioned route: word-of-mouth endorsements.
For Kelly Moffitt, a producer with StoryCorps and the author of the newsletter "Flyover Podcast" about shows made between coasts, she sees podcasts as a way to hear from people not represented in traditional media, particularly in rural areas. Some of her favorite shows are from Appalachia ("The Front Porch" from West Virginia Public Broadcasting) and Mississippi ("Gravy" produced by the Southern Foodways Alliance). Her advice for finding a great new show?
Google "'podcast' along with the place you want to hear a podcast from," she said.
Ms. Gerber-Margie suggests looking at groups on Reddit and Facebook -- such as Reddit's podcast subreddit and the Facebook group Podcasts We Listen To -- for recommendations from ordinary people "who just want something to listen to on their commute," she said. Another option: Join The New York Times's Podcast Club on Facebook for discussions and recommendations.

Texto completo: After all the drama and controversy surrounding the first host-less Academy Awards in 30 years, Anne Hathaway is here to remind us that it might not be so bad.
The actress, 36, co-hosted the 2011 Oscars with James Franco, in what became one of the most awkward and infamous moments in the award show's now-91 year history. Critics complained Franco looked half-asleep, leaving Hathaway to overcompensate with her own enthusiasm.
"No matter what happens with today's show, just remember, it's already been worse," she wrote. "Happy Oscars!"

This isn't the first time Hathaway has acknowledged her disappointment in the hosting gig. In a 2015 interview with The New York Times Magazine, she gave a word of advice to the next Oscars host, Neil Patrick Harris.
"Do the opposite of what I did, and you’ll be fine," she joked. "He’ll be great. "

‘Weavers’ make stronger social fabric

Texto completo: Eventually, someone who writes on public policy comes up against the limits of words. There are only so many times you can urge, condemn, cajole, wheedle, praise, remind, prod, propose and coax before your vocabulary and patience both give out. This is not to say that public argumentation makes no difference. But for a columnist, that influence consists mainly of throwing 750 words over a high wall and hoping they land with a pleasing thud on some doer or decider.
Having mastered the arts of opinion writing, cultural criticism and human decency, David Brooks of The New York Times is now undertaking a project at the Aspen Institute called "Weave," designed to recognize and help people directly involved in social repair.
Many people are involved in the unholy work of ripping and shredding our social fabric — through dehumanizing language, racial prejudice and other evidence of tribalism. The groups Brooks highlights are the weavers, laying down the warp and weft of communities. They promote community dialogue and deal with various categories of need from youth development to suicide prevention. But they share the goal of strengthening human ties, trust and reciprocity as alternatives to isolation, loneliness and despair.
In his manifesto, Brooks argues for what he calls "relationalism" as opposed to the "hyper-individualism" of a society based on the maximization of choice and self-actualization. A critic might respond that liberal individualism has done a pretty good job as the basis for democracy, capitalism and pain-free dentistry. But Brooks is diagnosing an excess of individualism leading to "social isolation, distrust, polarization, the breakdown of family, the loss of community, tribalism, rising suicide rates, rising mental health problems, [and] a spiritual crisis caused by a loss of common purpose."
In Brooks’ relationalism, the answer is not found in a political ideology, but in an alternative way of being human. In this view, success is not measured by the goods we accumulate but in the number and quality of the relationships we form. Such relationships tend to push our attention outward, toward the welfare of others. "The central journey of modern life," Brooks argues, "is moving self to service." And a rich relational life delivers a deeper more satisfying form of happiness than consumerism. We are actually liberated by the deep commitments we make in life.
Brooks’ message is likely to resonate precisely because it is not political. The atomizing tendency of American life does deepen and complicate problems such as drug addiction and suicide, in which isolation can contribute to a downward spiral of self-destructive behavior. But many Americans can identify with the broader challenge of loneliness, which seems to be the flip side of autonomy.
Brooks is making the case that there is already a movement of human connection in this country, among people who don’t yet recognize themselves as part of one. He has served this movement by giving it a compelling, non-sectarian, non-partisan frame, allowing diverse groups to consider themselves part of each other. In this case, the frame serves the picture well.

Texto completo: Senior law enforcement officials putting their names to sensitive details of ongoing investigations -- particularly ones involving the president's relations with Russia -- is a problem.

Former FBI Director James Comey shattered expectations of privacy with a big book deal.

Now Andrew McCabe, who briefly served as acting director of the FBI in 2017 after President Donald Trump fired Comey, is making the rounds to promote his new book, "The Threat."

McCabe was forced out of the FBI last year after the agency's inspector general accused him of dissembling about his communications with the media (a charge he denies; he's suing the FBI for wrongful termination and defamation).

More recently, he disclosed that the Justice Department's deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, considered invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.

McCabe also said that he personally ordered investigations of Trump after Comey was fired to learn if the president might be a Kremlin asset.

That's a lot of stuff. It's also tailor-made for a Deep State crowd determined to see a hidden hand inside the federal government trying to engineer a coup and to see McCabe as the embodiment of a law enforcement agency gone rogue.

When it comes to McCabe, his current critics, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, have said he was so biased that the Robert Mueller probe and efforts to scrutinize Trump more closely must be biased by extension.

The FBI believed that Russian agents told Carter Page and another Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, that the Kremlin wanted to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.

The FBI had good reason to keep casting its net wider, given what we now know about the actions of other Trump advisers like Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone and Michael Cohen.

Trump was pursuing a business deal in Moscow during primary season and almost up until Election Day in 2016. He has a business history rife with Russian money.

Trump fired Comey, then bragged about it to the Russian ambassador to the U.S. in the Oval Office while also publicly disclosing classified information.

He has continued to overlook Russia's effort to sabotage the 2016 campaign, despite the consensus between law enforcement and his own intelligence officials that such a thing occurred. He has been personally solicitous of Russian President Vladimir Putin (think Helsinki) for reasons that aren't explained by anything other than self-aggrandizement.

If further persuasion is needed about Trump's potential culpability, spend time with a blockbuster report that the New York Times published.

In deeply reported detail it lays out two years of what it describes as a "sustained" and "secretive assault by Trump on the machinery of federal law enforcement." Among the chief revelations in the piece is that Trump reportedly tried to install an ally to oversee a separate investigation being run out of the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan that involves the president and his business.

Trump's lawyers have already argued that Comey's firing, for example, could never be deemed obstruction of justice because the entire Justice Department reports in to the president. There is a counter-argument here as well: Ultimately, the president is not above the law, and he can't use his powers to undermine or interfere with an investigation or judicial proceeding.

All of this involves interpretation of the law, obviously. So litigate it. And stop putting stage props like McCabe in the meat grinder and stop letting the president, the nation's chief law enforcement official, do any more damage to law enforcement institutions than he already has.

Lee Radziwill's disastrous stage debut

Texto completo: Somewhere in the mid-1960s, Lee Radziwill (nee Bouvier), the younger sister of Jacqueline Kennedy and a socialite officially known as Princess Lee Radziwill following her 1959 marriage to Prince Stanis?aw Albrecht Radziwill, decided that she wanted to be an actress.
Improbably, Radziwill, who died Feb. 15 at the age of 85, made her 1967 theatrical debut in Chicago at the Ivanhoe Theatre, a venue on the North Side of Chicago that now is the ignoble home of a liquor store known as Binny's Beverage Depot. But this was long before bargain beers. Radziwill starred in a production of "The Philadelphia Story." In the annals of Chicago showbiz history, it was, to say the least, an extraordinary and mostly disastrous night.
Like Radziwill, whose life was filled with color and complexity, it does not deserve to be forgotten.
By most accounts, it was Truman Capote who talked Radziwill into this unwise new career. As Sam Kashner detailed in a 2016 Vanity Fair profile, Radziwill had come to know the iconic literary tastemaker after working for Ladies Home Journal as a fashion and culture writer. Although she could hardly say so in public, Radziwill was enjoying a higher level of freedom following the assassination of her brother-in-law, John F. Kennedy. During the Kennedy presidency, most mentions of Radziwill had involved some kind of comparison to her sister; most of them were unfavorable. The prevailing narrative was that the two sisters were fierce rivals, with Radziwill constantly plotting ways to steal her sister's thunder. Aristotle Onassis, for one, had a complicated interest in both Bouviers.
Read between the lines of Capote's project, and you intuit that he did not so much see an actress so much as fantasized an alignment between Lee -- an astonishingly beautiful and sophisticated woman -- and Philip Barry's Tracy Lord, a character that had been tailored to the needs of Katharine Hepburn in 1939. Hepburn appeared in the play on Broadway, but a Hollywood comeback vehicle clearly was top of mind. And that is precisely what happened when George Cukor adapted the play to film in 1940. So close in style were the real Radziwill and the fictional Lord, Capote must have thought, that the two surely could merge. He glossed over the inconvenient truth that his favorite new actress was not really an actress at all. She'd never been on a stage.
At least Capote saw enough risk to push the idea of Radziwill making her debut in Chicago, rather than on Broadway. As it happened, the producer and manager of the 600-seat Ivanhoe, Charles Booth, had been knocking around New York, making the rounds of agents. As he later told the Tribune, he found himself at one that had signed Radziwell the day before. "Princess Radziwill is not just another actress," Booth told this newspaper, describing the clamor for tickets. "She is one of the beautiful people gone straight."
At the time, the Ivanhoe Theatre was a stock house with an attached, 500-seat restaurant. It did not produce schlock -- in 1971, Tennessee Williams himself spent weeks inside the theater, readying a production of his play "Outcry" (that did not go very well either). Still, the closest most Chicagoans in 1967 got to the Bouvier mystique was by watching the musical "Camelot." Radziwill's arrival here was a big deal. She made the cover of Life magazine. And the four-week run sold out like it was "Hamilton." Yet the front-row tickets, the Tribune reported, still could be had for $4. This was before the days of dynamic pricing.
Capote carefully prepared his protegee's debut, albeit over the objections of her husband. Yves Saint Laurent was brought in to design the costumes -- an unusual credit for a Chicago theater just down Clark Street from Wrigley Field. Kashner even described members of the cast, presumably including Radziwill, getting regular intravenous injections of Vitamin B as a means of overcoming their exhaustion.
The surreal opening night (is that Rudolf Nureyev?) was the subject of one of the late, great Roger Ebert's best essays, what is called in the trade a "scener." It was headlined "Truman, Lee & the Prince" (1967 was the year that Ebert starting writing for the Chicago Sun-Times).
"On the sidewalk in front of the Ivanhoe Theatre," Ebert began, "the watchers were watching the watchers watched."
Ebert reported the presence of dozens of reporters and a slew of camera crews, along with "adolescent girls and neighborhood ladies." He sighted Marshall Korshak, Stanley Paul, Virginia Kay, Mrs. William Wrigley. Even a grumpy Prince Radziwill. He eventually found Debbie Reynolds, but Ebert did not find Jacqueline Kennedy, who was conveniently out of the country; at the time, many thought the timing was no coincidence. The Tribune's more prosaic coverage found "Arthur Rubloff and his wife" and Burr Tilstrom, the creator of "Kukla, Fran and Ollie."
Here is how Ebert, then 25, described Capote's appearance:
"He was about 4 feet 11 inches tall, and in his gold-rimmed glasses, you could hardly see him.
'Welcome to Chicago,' a television reporter said brightly.
'Thank you,' said Truman Capote, and for the moment that was all he said. His voice sounded like a tape recording of a shortwave broadcast of Woody Allen calling for help."
After the show, there were press interviews and mulling around and general star-gazing. Radziwill, who was billed as Lee Bouvier, already had made enemies of the Chicago press, having refused to speak to any one of them after deciding to dispense an "exclusive" interview to The New York Times.
Alas, Chicago had critics.
"Lee Bouvier stirred up far more excitement amid Chicago's curiosity seekers than she did on the stage of the Ivanhoe Theatre," William Leonard wrote in the Tribune, going on to say that few of the laugh lines got laughs and that among the best things that could be said about Radziwill's performance was that she knew her lines somewhat better than some of her fellow cast members.
Reynolds was asked by the Los Angeles Times what she thought. All she could manage was, "I'm not going to intrude on this." And days later, Radziwill's hardly chivalrous co-star, John Ericson, ticked off by unequal billing, told the Tribune he was working with "an amateur actress."
In a fabulous coda seven years later, Radziwill said to People Magazine that she thought the director was "stone deaf." Tribune columnist Maggie Daly called up the producer George Keathley, who said:
" 'The Philadelphia Story' was directed by Sidney Breeze, who does have a hearing aid. When an actor or actress is lousy, he turns off his hearing aid. So Lee Radziwill is correct."
Still. You name another time a princess had the guts to show up in a Chicago play, as orchestrated by Truman Capote. Whatever else happened that night, Radziwill showed the same courage and chutzpah that characterized much of her life. At the Ivanhoe that year, she was followed by Zsa Zsa Gabor, who did not attract anything like the same attention.
Think about that as you buy your next 12-pack.

Texto completo: AP Pro Football Writer
Misbehaving owners of sports teams have drawn headlines pretty much since sports have been around.
Now, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft faces misdemeanor charges of soliciting a prostitute after police said he was twice videotaped paying for a sex act at a massage parlor in Florida amid a crackdown on sex trafficking.
He joins a list of current and former NFL owners accused of crimes or social misconduct.
Last year, Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson sold the team after allegations surfaced of sexual and racial misconduct in the workplace. Following a six-month investigation by the league, he was fined $2.7 million. Richardson, the team’s founder, then sold the franchise to David Tepper for $2.2 billion.
Cleveland Browns owner Jim Haslam had legal troubles while CEO of Pilot Flying J, one of the nation’s largest truck-stop chains. Company executives either pleaded guilty or were convicted in a fraud scheme worth more than $50 million. Haslam claimed he didn’t know about the scheme in which customers were underpaid on promised rebates for fuel purchases, and he was not charged.
Haslam bought the Browns in October 2012, six months before the FBI and IRS raided company headquarters. The NFL never disciplined him.
Jim Irsay, whose Indianapolis Colts won a Super Bowl for the 2006 season under his leadership, had acknowledged having a painkiller addiction in 2002 and sought treatment. The DEA investigated the case, but local prosecutors did not file charges.
Then, in March 2014, Irsay was arrested near his home in suburban Carmel and was held overnight after he failed sobriety tests and police found prescription medications in his car. The police said the drugs in Irsay’s vehicle were not associated with any of the prescription bottles found inside. He was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated, along with four felony counts of possession of a controlled substance; police also found $29,009 in cash.
He again sought treatment and in September 2014 pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of driving while intoxicated, agreeing to undergo drug testing for a year. Irsay also admitted he was under the influence of the painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone when he was arrested.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Irsay for six games and fined him $500,000.
Ed DeBartolo Jr., who built the San Francisco 49ers’ 1980s-90s dynasty with Bill Walsh as coach, was involved in one of the biggest owners’ scandals in the sport’s history. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony when he paid $400,000 to former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards in exchange for a riverboat gambling license.
DeBartolo was suspended from the NFL for one year in 1999 for his role in the gambling fraud scandal. He also handed over control of the team to his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, and never returned to the 49ers.
Former Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose had to sell the team in 1985 to pay off more than $25 million in debts to Atlantic City casinos.
Football hardly stands alone in the owners’ misbehavior market.
Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott was sued by former employees in the early 1990s for being a racist and, at one point, was quoted in The New York Times as saying Adolf Hitler initially was good for Germany; that her use of racially inappropriate words was in jest; and that she didn’t understand why certain ethnically insulting words were offensive.
In 1993, Schott was suspended for one year by Major League Baseball and fined $25,000 for language that MLB’s executive council deemed “racially and ethnically offensive.”
Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was fined $2.5 million and banned from the NBA for life in 2014 for racist comments he made to a friend. Sterling scolded her for posting pictures on Instagram in which she was accompanied by Basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson and Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp, both black.
“Why are you taking pictures with minorities, why?” Sterling was recorded as saying. “Don’t put him on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. ... And don’t bring him to my games, OK? ... Yeah, it bothers me a lot that you want to promo, broadcast that you’re associating with black people. Do you have to?”
The Rigas family owned the NHL’s Buffalo Sabres in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was forced to relinquish control of the team after indictments on bank and security fraud charges for raiding the coffers of their cable company, Adelphia. The Sabres played the 2003-04 season under NHL operation before being purchased out of bankruptcy by Thomas Golisano.
Last year, NASCAR’s Brian France, whose family owns the stock car racing circuit and many of the tracks where it competes, was arrested in New York on charges of aggravated driving while intoxicated and criminal possession of a controlled substance. He immediately took a leave of absence and his uncle, Jim France, stepped in as chairman and CEO.
Perhaps the most documented misbehavior by a franchise owner occurred with George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees.
A 15-count indictment was handed up in 1974 in Cleveland federal court for violations of election laws. Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to make illegal campaign contributions, then was suspended by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for two years. That suspension was lifted after 15 months for good behavior.
Steinbrenner frequently was fined for publicly criticizing umpires and for tampering. He was forced to resign as the team’s managing general partner in 1990 for dealings with and a $40,000 payment to self-described gambler Howard Spira. Steinbrenner returned to his position on March 1, 1993.

AJC SEPIA BLACK HISTORY MONTH: Marian Anderson: Her operatic prowess prevailed through discrimination

Texto completo: Draped in fur, outfitted in a long-sleeve orange sweater and black skirt (seen in black-and-white photos as a gray ensemble) and with eyes tightly closed, Marian Anderson let the first verse of "My Country Tis of Thee" roll off her tongue before a crowd of 75,000 in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
On April 9, 1939, "genius (drew) no color line"-- proclaimed then-Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes -- as the rendition became one of the contralto singer's most famed performances. This year marks 80 years since the operatic songbird stood just feet away from the marble, seated Abraham Lincoln statue.
The Easter Sunday performance set the stage for Anderson to eventually become the first black person to perform at the Metropolitan Opera.
Anderson was born Feb. 27, 1897, in South Philadelphia. Her singing career began in Union Baptist Church, where she sang in the junior church choir at 6 at the urging of her aunt. From there, the songstress performed at local events and later joined several other singing groups, including People's Chorus, a prestigious African-American ensemble in Philadelphia.
Anderson began formal singing lessons at 15, according to The New York Times. Anderson would eventually perform in a New York Philharmonic voice competition, where she won first prize. The young singer saw small success, but recitals and concert opportunities dwindled.
Anderson instead performed abroad, garnering fame in Europe, most notably after her Wigmore Hall concert in London in the early 1930s.
Howard University had hosted Anderson numerous times, but as her popularity outgrew their venue size, they searched for larger venues such as Constitution Hall to hold her concerts.
Despite her stature, Anderson wasn't allowed to perform at Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution, an organization devoted to historic preservation and patriotism. Constitution Hall was (and remains) the biggest performance venue in D.C., seating 4,000 people, but did not have segregated bathrooms at the time.
Howard University requested an exception to their rule but was denied.
In a sternly worded resignation letter from the DAR, member and then-first lady Eleanor Roosevelt voiced her disappointment with the organization.
"I am in complete disagreement with the attitude taken in refusing Constitution Hall to a great artist," Roosevelt wrote. " You had an opportunity to lead in an enlightened way and it seems to me that your organization has failed."
After public outcry, Roosevelt arranged for Anderson to perform on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
Anderson would go on to more prestigious stages, such as her 1955 performance as the fortuneteller Ulrica in Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi's "Un ballo in maschera" at the Metropolitan Opera. It was the only time the singer sang in an opera role. It would also be the only time she performed at the Met.
Anderson retired from singing in 1955 and would go on to receive many prestigious awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, the Congressional Gold Medal in 1977, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1978, the National Medal of Arts in 1986 and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1991. Anderson was also the first recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award of the City of New York and was awarded honorary doctoral degrees from Howard University, Temple University and Smith College.
Anderson's musical legacy would live on in her nephew James DePreist, one of the few renowned black conductors. Anderson lived with him and wife Ginette DePreist until her 1993 death. ( James DePreist died in 2013.)
In a 2014 interview with Smithsonian.com, Ginette DePreist described Anderson as "a very humble, very sweet lady."
"She always said, 'All I want to be remembered for is the voice the Lord gave me, (which) hopefully made people happy," DePreist said.

Texto completo: 'Alita: Battle Angel' ***
PG-13 - 2:22 - This film entry into the thrilling manga world of artist Yukito Kishiro, imagined for the screen by producer James Cameron and director Robert Rodriguez, crams in so many plot lines that it risks being overstuffed but somehow stays true to its mesmerizing vision and emerges as a sci-fi success, if not a triumph. Associated Press
'Aquaman' **
PG-13 - 2:22 - Jason Momoa's charisma is as formidable as his brawn, but this movie about the long-haired, shirtless superhero is soggy with Atlantis mythology and drowns in special effects. Associated Press
'Bohemian Rhapsody' **½
PG-13 - 2:15 - As Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, Rami Malek delivers a committed, thoroughly inhabited performance, which winds up transcending the regrettably thin material at hand. Washington Post
'Bumblebee' ***
PG-13 - 1:53 - While hard-core fan-boys may complain it's too soft, this film may turn out to be the perfect way to save "Transformers." This charming tale of a girl and her adorable car-robot flips the script on the tired, bloated franchise. Associated Press
'Cold Pursuit' *½
R - 1:58 - A beat-by-beat remake of the 2014 Norwegian thriller "In Order of Disappearance," director Hans Petter Moland puts Liam Neeson behind the wheel of a snowplow with vengeance on his mind. The movie delivers -- in its own soulless way. Chicago Tribune
'Cold War' ****
R - 1:28 - Writer-director Pawel Pawlikowski draws on his own parents' relationship for inspiration for his near-perfect film set in post-WWII Poland. In Polish, French, German, Russian, Italian and Croatian with subtitles. Washington Post
'Dr. Seuss' The Grinch' **½
PG - 1:30 - Benedict Cumberbatch voices the green Christmas grouch in this adaptation (the third) of Dr. Seuss' 1957 children's book. This computer-animated version is beautiful to look at, but the new material doesn't resonate. Tribune News Service
'Escape Room'
PG-13 - 1:40 - Six strangers find themselves in circumstances beyond their control and must use their wits to find the clues or die. Directed by Adam Robitel. Not reviewed.
'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' ***
PG-13 - 2:14 - The nifflers are cute. But there's something far less adorable that has also escaped in this Harry Potter prequel, which takes a turn for the dark side that will satisfy adult fans. Washington Post
'The Favourite' ***½
R - 2:01 - Oscar winners Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone play a pair of women sucking up to England's Queen Anne in the 18th century. You'd swear they have paid staffs of comedy writers hidden beneath their voluminous skirts. Star Tribune
'Glass' **
PG-13 - 2:09 - Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan reminds us he is the ultimate mastermind, the king of the twists. But the true master at work is James McAvoy, who reprises his role from "Split." Tribune News Service
'Green Book' ***½
PG-13 - 2:10 - Movie based on a true story recounts a 1962 road trip when a Bronx-bred Italian-American (Viggo Mortensen) was hired to drive a renowned black pianist, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), to concert engagements across the Deep South. Directed by Peter Farrelly. Associated Press
'Happy Death Day 2U' **½
PG-13 - 1:40 - Unnecessary sequel actually does a bit more than just regurgitate "Happy Death Day" (2017), posing questions that other slasher films wouldn't touch. Washington Post
'The House With a Clock in Its Walls' Zero stars
PG - 1:39 - Supernatural thriller manages to find the perfect un-sweet spot -- it's too scary for little kids, not scary enough for older ones, not funny or clever enough for their parents, and too redundant for everyone. Associated Press
'If Beale Street Could Talk' ***½
R - 1:59 - Director Barry Jenkins ("Moonlight") delivers a heartbreaking story of obstacles and injustices in 1970s Harlem. Associated Press
'Instant Family' **½
PG-13 - 2:00 - Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne star as a couple who are unable to conceive children of their own and who choose to adopt -- not just one child, but three siblings. Based on co-writer/director Sean Anders' own experience. Washington Post
'The Invisibles'
NR - 1:50 - Historical drama about Jews hiding in plain sight in WWII Berlin. With Max Mauff, Alice Dwyer. Written by Claus Rafle, Alejandra Lopez. Directed by Rafle. Not reviewed. Los Angeles Times
'Isn't It Romantic' ***
PG-13 - 1:28 - Rebel Wilson plays a woman who hates rom-coms -- until she bonks her head and ends up in one herself. Associated Press
'The Kid Who Would Be King'***
PG - 2:00 - The Arthurian legend gets a modern and more youthful spin in this surprisingly delightful film full of action, heart, a crazy-haired Patrick Stewart (as "old" Merlin) and a few genuinely good gags. Associated Press
'The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part'***
PG - 1:46 - The innocent-looking Lego Duplo characters introduced in the first movie turn into invading space aliens in the sequel. Featuring the voices of Chris Pratt, Will Arnett, Alison Brie, Tiffany Haddish, Charlie Day and more. Chicago Tribune
'The Mule' *
R - 1:56 - The film is a fairly straightforward adaptation of a true story from the New York Times Magazine, but the racist cultural stereotypes and appalling treatment of women are all thanks to screenwriter Nick Schenk and director Clint Eastwood. Tribune News Service
'Never Look Away'****
R - 3:08 - German writer-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's third feature film, based on the life of German painter Gerhard Richter, is an unparalleled masterpiece. Tribune News Service
'On the Basis of Sex'***
PG-13 - 2:00 - Felicity Jones plays feminist icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg in an adoring biography that ends well before she's sworn in as a Supreme Court justice. The wonderful Armie Hammer plays her husband. Associated Press

'Smallfoot' **½
PG - 1:36 - In a reverse-Bigfoot tale, a happy-go-lucky Himalayan Yeti (voiced by Channing Tatum) finds evidence of humans. It's predictable, but the journey is worth watching. Tribune News Service
'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'****
PG - 2:00 - A biracial kid (voiced by Shameik Moore) takes up a legendary superhero mantle in this multidimensional mind-trip from Sony Pictures Animation. The seventh Spider-Man movie to hit the big screen feels more like a one-of-a-kind, wall-crawling experience. Washington Post
'Stan & Ollie'***½
PG - 1:37 - Barely recognizable Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly star in a generous, warmhearted film about the comic duo of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Directed by Jon S. Baird. Washington Post
'A Star Is Born'***½
R - 2:17 - Bradley Cooper makes his directorial debut with a lavishly delightful remake that stars Lady Gaga as an unknown singer who becomes a pop sensation. Washington Post
'They Shall Not Grow Old'****
R - 1:39 - Director Peter Jackson's immersive, haunting and often transcendent film about World War I is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Made with restored, colorized footage from the Imperial War Museum. Associated Press
'The Upside' One-half star
PG-13 - 2:06 - A lazy, skirt-chasing ex-con (Kevin Hart) accidentally gets a job taking care of a wealthy businessman who became a paraplegic (Bryan Cranston). It's based on a true story, but it's predictable and lacking in drama and laugh-out-loud moments. Associated Press
'Vice' *½
R - 2:12 - Christian Bale nails it as Dick Cheney, plotting his rise from a misdirected young man in Wyoming to one of the most notorious gray eminences in American politics. But the rest of the movie, written and directed by Adam McKay, is an absurd mess. Washington Post
'What Men Want' *
R - 1:57 - Taraji P. Henson tries a little too hard in a predictable, gender-switching remake of the 2000 romantic comedy "What Women Want." This time, a woman unlocks the power to read men's minds. Associated Press

Resumen: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas this week suggested revisiting a cornerstone of modern press freedom, the 1964 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan case, which established knowing or reckless disregard of falsity as a pre-requisite for libel actions by public officials, a standard later extended to libel actions by public figures as well. In a letter to the AP, dated Feb. 15, Atlanta-based attorney L. Lin Wood called on the news cooperative to "retract and correct" what his letter asserts are "defamatory statements."

Texto completo: BY DAN SEWELL
The Associated Press
CINCINNATI - The Kentucky teen at the heart of an encounter last month with a Native American activist at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington is suing The Washington Post for $250 million, alleging the newspaper falsely labeled him a racist. His attorneys are threatening numerous other news organizations, including The Associated Press.
President Donald Trump cheered the lawsuit, tweeting Wednesday that "Covington student suing WAPO. Go get them Nick. Fake News!" The legal action, and possible future ones, comes at a time of intense scrutiny of Trump's relationship with the press, which he has repeatedly labeled the "enemy of the people."
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas this week suggested revisiting a cornerstone of modern press freedom, the 1964 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan case, which established knowing or reckless disregard of falsity as a pre-requisite for libel actions by public officials, a standard later extended to libel actions by public figures as well.
In papers filed Tuesday in federal court in Kentucky, Nicholas Sandmann and his parents alleged that the Post had engaged in "targeting and bullying" and modern "McCarthyism."
"The Post ignored basic journalist standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump ... by impugning individuals perceived to be supporters," according to the complaint.
In a statement Wednesday, the Post said it was "reviewing a copy of the lawsuit" and planned "to mount a vigorous defense."
Sandmann's attorneys also are threatening legal action against The Associated Press and other news organizations. In a letter to the AP, dated Feb. 15, Atlanta-based attorney L. Lin Wood called on the news cooperative to "retract and correct" what his letter asserts are "defamatory statements." Sandmann also provided his version of the events.
The Associated Press took great care to ensure its stories were measured and fair, reporting the facts of what transpired and adding details as they emerged, said spokeswoman Lauren Easton, adding that AP stands by its stories.
The actions of Sandmann and his Covington Catholic High School classmates have been intensely debated since video and photographs emerged of them wearing "Make America Great Again" hats and facing off against Omaha Nation elder Nathan Phillips.
Both Sandmann and Nathan Phillips say they were trying to defuse tensions that were rising among three groups on a day Washington hosted both the anti-abortion March for Life, attended by the Covington students, and the Indigenous Peoples March. But video of Sandmann and Phillips standing very close to each other , with Sandmann staring and at times smiling at Phillips as he sang and played a drum, gave some who watched it a different impression.
Interpretations changed over the days following the incident as witnesses released more cellphone video footage. Phillips had approached Sandmann, but well before that, both his group and Sandmann's were confronted by a third group that appeared to be affiliated with the Black Hebrew Israelite movement.
Videos show members of the religious group yelling disparaging and profane insults at the students, some of whom shouted back. Video also shows the Native Americans being insulted by the small religious group. Sandmann's legal team has released its own video , "Nick Sandmann: The Truth in 15 Minutes." It shows scenes from the confrontation, clips from news coverage and interviews, and examples of harsh Tweets and comments aimed at Sandmann and his high school.
Phillips did not immediately return efforts to reach him for comment.
First Amendment lawyers contacted by the AP were hesitant to comment without reading the full legal complaint. Floyd Abrams, who worked on the landmark Pentagon Papers case of 1971, wrote in an email that "the press does get a good deal of leeway in voicing opinions about matters they have seen and are commenting on."
One legal question might be whether Sandmann would be treated in court as a public or private figure. Abrams observed that "sometimes individuals involved in newsworthy events are treated as involuntary limited purpose public figures," meaning they would have to meet a higher legal standard than would a private citizen.

Texto completo: Como de si de una telenovela se tratara, Emily Zamora está demandando al padre de su hijo, el magnate Mark Gorton, quien la abandonó al descubrir que había mentido sobre sus orígenes humildes.
Ahora Zamora está solicitando $37,500 dólares mensuales para la manutención de su hijo de 4 meses, incluyendo $9 mil para la niñera.
Gorton (52) es el creador del servicio de intercambio de música LimeWire y ha invertido millones de dólares en el grupo de ciclismo profesional Transportation Alternatives.
Los abogados de Zamora (23) dicen que su ex-amante millonario, que le dobla la edad y es educado en las prestigiosas universidades Harvard, Yale y Stanford, la abandonó después de enterarse de que proviene de una familia trabajadora.
“Emily es una niña joven e ingenua y estaba avergonzada de sus orígenes”, reconoció su abogado Raoul Felder a New York Post después de una comparecencia ayer ante el tribunal en Manhattan.
Allí Zamora exigió que los pagos de manutención infantil de Gorton se incrementaran de $6 mil a $37,500 dólares al mes.
Después de conocerse a través de un sitio de citas en línea, Zamora afirmó falsamente a Gorton que su madre había asistido a Harvard, pero en realidad es una cocinera en un restaurante italiano en Texas, mientras que su padre es un empleado de correos.
Gorton contrató a alguien para investigar a la joven y descubrió que le había mentido.
En la corte, los abogados de Gorton pintaron a Zamora como a una cazafortunas. Su abogado admitió que “es una mentirosa. No se trata de ser pobre. Es sólo que una mentirosa no llega a ser recompensada por las mentiras que dijo y exige millones de dólares en manutención infantil”, dijo Eric Wrubel al juez Michael Katz.
Mientras tanto, el juez regañó a Zamora por haber llevado al bebé de la pareja a la corte. “Estás utilizando al niño (…) En el futuro, no puedes traerlo para desfilar frente a la prensa”.
La joven madre afirmó que no había podido encontrar a nadie que vigilara al bebé.
Además de LimeWire, Gorton posee la firma de servicios financieros Tower Research Capital LLC. Y a “Transportation Alternatives” le ha regalado más de $10 millones de dólares desde 2002, según The New York Times.
Katz no emitió un fallo en el caso ayer y prometió hacerlo en una fecha posterior.

Después de conocerse a través de un sitio de citas en línea, Zamora afirmó falsamente a Gorton que su madre había asistido a Harvard, pero en realidad es una cocinera en un restaurante italiano en Texas, mientras que su padre es un empleado de correos.
Gorton contrató a alguien para investigar a la joven y descubrió que le había mentido.
En la corte, los abogados de Gorton pintaron a Zamora como a una cazafortunas. Su abogado admitió que “es una mentirosa. No se trata de ser pobre. Es sólo que una mentirosa no llega a ser recompensada por las mentiras que dijo y exige millones de dólares en manutención infantil”, dijo Eric Wrubel al juez Michael Katz.
Mientras tanto, el juez regañó a Zamora por haber llevado al bebé de la pareja a la corte. “Estás utilizando al niño (…) En el futuro, no puedes traerlo para desfilar frente a la prensa”.
La joven madre afirmó que no había podido encontrar a nadie que vigilara al bebé.
Además de LimeWire, Gorton posee la firma de servicios financieros Tower Research Capital LLC. Y a “Transportation Alternatives” le ha regalado más de $10 millones de dólares desde 2002, según The New York Times.
Katz no emitió un fallo en el caso ayer y prometió hacerlo en una fecha posterior.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Wednesday that a Hackensack woman, who was the bride of an Islamic State fighter and now wants to come home will not be allowed back in the United States.
“I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
Lawsuit: ISIS bride Hoda Muthana's family files lawsuit against Trump
Muthana traveled to Syria and married and had a child with an ISIS fighter and now wants to face the U. S. justice system.
But Pompeo said earlier Wednesday that Muthana is not an American citizen and "does not have any legal basis, no valid U. S. passport, no right to a passport," contradicting statements by her family and her Florida-based lawyer, who said she was born in Hackensack in 1994.
Muthana, who was raised in Alabama, left the United States to join ISIS four years ago at age 19. In Syria, she called for Americans to be attacked, and she spread the group's propaganda online.
She is one of about 1,500 foreign women and children – the spouses and children of Islamic State militants – held in a Kurdish-run detention camp in northern Syria.
Muthana is there with her 18-month-old son. The child's father is not alive. Two of her previous husbands, both Islamic State militants, are also dead. Muthana is not allowed to leave the camp and has armed guards protecting her from Islamic State sympathizers. She is asking to be allowed to return to the U. S. to face due process.

"The government needs to engage with her, but not just her; all of these people who joined ISIS" from the West, said Hassan Shibly, Muthana's lawyer.
"If she broke the law, then the justice system can deal with her, and if she didn't break the law, she should come back anyway, so it can be determined if she is a threat. "

Shibly said Muthana has realized she made a mistake in moving to Syria and wants to return to the USA to face justice and "pay any debts she has to society. " He said she wants to speak out against the Islamic State and help de-radicalize other Americans.
Muthana abandoned her family and fled to Syria in 2014, a year after she graduated from high school. She briefly studied at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.
Shibly shared a letter Muthana wrote this week in which she described herself as "naive, angry and arrogant" when she decided to journey to Syria.
"During my years in Syria, I would see and experience a way of life and the terrible effects of war, which changed me," Muthana wrote. "Seeing bloodshed up close changed me. Motherhood changed me. Seeing friends, children and the men I married dying changed me. Seeing how different a society could be compared to the beloved America I was born and raised into changed me. "
Shibly, executive director of the Florida Council on American Islamic Relations in Tampa, said it was not clear from a legal standpoint whether Muthana's "marrying into ISIS" could warrant a "material support charge" to Islamic State activities, which range from terror attacks in the USA and Europe to beheadings in Iraq and Syria.
Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, said that if he were advising Muthana, he would tell her that coming back to the USA would be "risky. " Dershowitz told the New York Post her case would be a "close call" even if all she did was tweet and send emails.
Muthana claimed to have had no contact with U. S. authorities, and Shibly said she can leave the camp only if the U. S. government asks for her release. It's not clear if it has. U. S. immigration authorities were not available to answer questions about her case, including whether a U. S. citizen can be barred from entering his or her own country.
In a briefing, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino would not address Muthana's specific case, but said repatriating foreign terrorist fighters to their countries of origin was the "best solution to preventing them from returning to the battlefield. "
Pompeo subsequently issued the statement Wednesday in which he claimed that Muthana was not a U. S. citizen and would not be allowed back in.
Shibly, however, provided USA TODAY with a copy of Muthana's birth certificate, which lists her place of birth as Hackensack, New Jersey.
Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said that Pompeo can't just assert that someone born in the U. S. is not a U. S. citizen.
"I gather that the government's argument is that she was born to a diplomat who was in the United States on official business, and so was not entitled to birthright citizenship. That's correct as a matter of law if it's true, but it's not true just because the government says so," he said in a Twitter message to USA TODAY.
Only six American militants have returned from fighting or training with militant groups in Syria, according to New America, a Washington-based foreign policy research institute.
All were taken into custody. Muthana may be the first American spouse or partner of an Islamic State fighter who has sought to return home. The New York Times has reported that another woman, dual U. S. -Canadian national Kimberly Gwen Polman, 46, is also in the al-hawl refugee camp in Syria. She left Canada in 2015.
A similar case in Britain involves Shamima Begum, 19, from London, who gave birth to a baby boy over the weekend in the same camp where Muthana is held.
Begum, who left Britain for Syria at age 15 and married an Islamic State fighter, wants to return to Britain for the sake of her child's welfare, but British authorities, including the nation's interior minister, indicated they might try to block her return. They might find that difficult to do because a British national can't theoretically be prevented from returning home unless that person is also a national of another country. Begum isn't.
The woman's London-based lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said Tuesday that the British government informed him that it is trying to strip Begum of her British citizenship.
As for Muthana, "whether it's a few years in jail, 20 years in jail or no jail, she's open to the legal process, and she's not asking for a free pass, just due process," Shibly said.

Keep it glassy 'Luminous' exhibit brings Tacoma's Museum of Glass to Spokane's MAC

Texto completo: In the summer of 1971, glass artist Dale Chihuly drove about an hour outside of Seattle to Stanwood, to join up with other "hippies" looking to explore glassblowing together. Chihuly believed that breathing down a heavy metal tube to form a bubble inside a molten blob of hot glass was a group effort. John and Anne Gould Hauberg were the patrons who helped share the load by donating some land and funds to fuel Chihuly's vision.
John Hauberg described Chihuly's arriving entourage that summer as a ragtag "artists' commune," according to a 1993 New York Times article. The small group consisted of "an architect, a cowboy poet, a glass artist and a photographer," Hauberg was quoted as saying that they were "given to living in vans."
From those counter-culture beginnings, a one-summer glassblowing workshop on a rainy and rugged tree farm became the world's most comprehensive center for glass art education, known as the Pilchuck Glass School, still going strong today. In the 13th century, glassmaking was a secretive craft concentrated on the Venetian island of Murano. Nearly 700 years later, starting in the latter half of the 20th century, the making of glass has become a wide open frontier of artistic expression emanating from the Pacific Northwest.
According to his website, Chihuly embraced new techniques and a communal model of glassblowing. His inspiration came from modern cultural and political contexts, including rejecting traditional Euro-American artistic conventions in favor of alternative Native American models. American glass art in general expanded its associations with indigenous cultures that had been marginalized by the political establishment.
Over the past five decades, thousands of artists interested in glassmaking have flocked to the Northwest, cementing the region's reputation as a modern Mecca for glass. In 2002, the Museum of Glass opened in Chihuly's hometown of Tacoma and has become the West Coast's largest glass studio and workshop.
The resulting works made by the visiting artists to the Museum of Glass make up the bulk of a new exhibition opening this Saturday at the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture. The show, "Luminous: Dale Chihuly and the Studio Glass Movement," features works by 33 international artists working in glass, including a single show-stopping installation, the Laguna Murano Chandelier, created by the tendril-loving godfather of glass himself.
"We've never had an entirely glass exhibition at the MAC, yet right across the state (in Tacoma) there is a treasure trove for us," said Wes Jessup, the MAC's executive director. "The idea with this show was to bring a variety of work, work that shows the breadth of the studio glass movement, everything from more traditional containers and masters of color  to more boundary-pushing and experimental works."
Jessup curated "Luminous" by requesting pieces from the Museum of Glass's permanent collection. The Chihuly piece came from a private collector.
"We have a host of traveling exhibitions, but this is only the second time we have had an exhibition this large curated out of our permanent collection and sent to another museum," said Rebecca Engelhardt, collections and exhibitions manager at the Museum of Glass. "The first was to the National Glass Center in the U.K."
Since 2009, the Museum of Glass has operated a fully functioning hot shop with four glassblowers on staff who support artists in their explorations of glassmaking. Artists from all over the world travel to the MOG for residencies designed to hone their skills or attempt to learn new ones. The only requirement for visiting artists is that they leave one piece behind for the MOG's permanent collection.
"It give us an interesting variety of things," Engelhardt said. "We get artists who are veterans in glass, or experienced artists who have never touched glass before, but who use our staff artists to make their vision. And of course, we get emerging artists."
The richness of the MAC's all-glass exhibition lies in its variety and breadth. Among the more than 30 artists whose work will be shown is Seattle-based glass artist Erich Woll, whose delightful piece "Mistakes Will Be Made" depicts a gaggle of sleek-necked blue-footed boobies. One of the most important glass artists living today, Murano-born Lino Tagliapietra, has a large piece of grouped vessels on a fabricated table that forms what he calls "Manhattan Sunset."
Preston Singletary, whose art has become synonymous with the relationship between European glass blowing traditions and Northwest Native art, features a "Killer Whale" with mystical sand-carved Tlingit designs. Contemporary glass movement pioneer Therman Statom's wall of glass boxes are painted and filled with found objects.
Just these pieces alone would be reason enough to head to the MAC. The fact that there are dozens more works by other artists on the forefront of the glass movement makes "Luminous" more than a must-see. It's a cause for celebration. Just don't wave your arms too wildly among all those breakables.
"The show is like a snapshot of what has been happening in glass for the past 10 years," Jessup said.
"We are excited to share the collection with the rest of the state," Engelhardt said. "We want people to appreciate the medium of glass; it's still kind of the new kid on the block."

A double standard, right off the rack; Showing their sexism, hypocrites throw a fit over Harris' sequined jacket

Texto completo: Every four years, aspiring presidential nominees leave behind families, jobs and, frequently, their dignity to prove they are worthy of the votes of everyday people.
Senators, governors, million- or billionaires, they traipse through cornfields in Iowa, eat barbecue in South Carolina, get sand between their toes at clambakes in New Hampshire, all in the pursuit of showing they are human beings too.
If you've been paying attention, you've probably noticed that this peculiar feature of American political life has already begun.

It's called retail politicking, and sometimes the tradition literally involves retail locations: drugstores, bookstores, gift stores. Or, in the recent case of Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris, a clothing store on Lady Street in Columbia, S.C.
There, after some reporters pointed out a loud jacket, the U.S. senator from California tried it on. It was a vintage sequined thing with shoulder pads that screamed "I'm from the '80's!" Ever the Bay Area pol, she joked that its rainbow colors made it perfect for Pride Week.
And then, unfortunately, she bought it. The political reporters covering Harris' South Carolina visit tweeted videos and photos of her as she preened in front of a mirror wearing the coat. It was a spontaneous campaign-trail moment, unexpected and a little bit playful. It just so happened that the reporters who witnessed the moment were women, and that they happened to be watching a woman -- a presumed presidential front-runner -- doing something a lot of women love to do.
It was too much for Very Serious Journalist Brit Hume. "This is just embarrassing," tweeted the Fox News anchor. "So now journalists are going shopping with Harris, helping pick out clothes and then putting out glowing tweets about it."
James Taranto of the Wall Street Journal chimed in: "This is a CBS reporter noting, without evident disapproval, that a CNN colleague is helping dress a Democratic candidate she's supposed to be covering."
David Martosko of the Daily Mail added: "If this is what the 2020 campaign is going to be like, President Trump's complaints about the media could have even more staying power with his base than the last time around."
Come on now, fellas. This is the kind of clueless sexism that we can expect to see repeated through the 2020 campaign cycle, particularly as there are so many women running.
When it came to Hume's arrogant tweet, it wasn't just his sexism on display.
It was also his hypocrisy, and the pernicious double standard that finds virtue in "manly" pursuits such as hunting and skydiving and triviality in "female" pursuits such as shopping.
In 2015, a bunch of political reporters, including MSNBC's Kasie Hunt and the New York Times' Ashley Parker, went trap shooting with then-aspiring presidential candidate Lindsey Graham, a GOP senator from South Carolina.
Parker, who is now with the Washington Post, wrote that she was glad for the diversion. "After all, in a world in which politicians are increasingly poll-tested and scripted, it was revealing -- not to mention refreshing and fun -- to spend a freewheeling morning with a man who hopes to become the next president of the United States."
No one accused those reporters of getting too cozy with Graham.
Likewise, in 2004, Hume went skydiving with former President George H.W. Bush to celebrate his 80th birthday. Afterward, Hume touted his "exclusive" interview with Bush. At the time, you will recall, President George W. Bush was running for reelection. Skydiving with Dad was a publicity stunt for Hume's network, and almost forgivable.
But when the Very Serious Journalist sat down for his interview, he whiffed: "Do you think the criticism of your son has been harsher and more unfair than you felt the criticism was of you?"
Oh Brit, that was just embarrassing.
::
On the campaign trail, weird symbiotic relationships develop between reporters and the campaigns.
Media critics have used these moments to accuse reporters of going native, that is, of protecting or cozying up to a candidate to maintain access.
Mostly, this is an unfair criticism. No reporter wants to be thought of as soft or co-opted. But sometimes, you get caught up in the insanity of spending long hours, days and weeks with a small group of people with adversarial interests who are traveling together in a highly charged environment.
Small details -- like what a candidate ate for lunch -- become ridiculously important. (After all, you never know when such data will provoke a major incident, as when then-presidential candidate John Kerry ordered the wrong kind of fromage on his cheesesteak in Philadelphia.)
New York Times reporter Amy Chozick devoted a substantial portion of her brutally honest bestseller "Chasing Hillary" to the warped relationship she developed with Clinton's handlers -- men, mostly -- who would freeze her out, berate her or tell her no one respected her work if they didn't like one of her stories.
Those tensions were never apparent in her coverage.
::
Between now and November 2020, there will be countless unscripted moments on the campaign trail.
Candidates will be out wooing voters, dragging behind them packs of reporters desperate for anything that smacks of unrehearsed humanity.
You cannot attack a reporter for telling you what she's observing. Nor can you take one campaign trail anecdote out of context, as Hume did, and pretend that this is the totality of the candidate's news coverage. If the candidate tromps through a pumpkin field in southern Wisconsin with his wife and kids on Halloween, that's what you write about. (I did, with then-Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan.)
If the candidate roams through the Iowa State Fair eating pork chops on a stick (they all do at some point), you follow. (In 2011, I chased after former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was deciding whether to run in 2012, and watched her order deep-fried butter on a stick. Everything she ate that day seemed like a calculated rebuke of then-First Lady Michelle Obama's campaign for healthful childhood eating.)
Trail reporters don't follow candidates around because they expect to have nuanced discussions about policy, although that occasionally happens.
They are out with candidates to make sure their readers and viewers know what would-be presidents are saying, or promising. To make sure that if a candidate breaks news, they catch it. To get a response to an important news event.
You want to be there when a vice presidential candidate tests a new attack line accusing her running mate's opponent of "palling around with terrorists."
You want to be there when a candidate says he's visited "all 57 states," -- not because it means the candidate is stupid but because it's a measure of his fatigue.
And maybe you want to be there when a serious presidential candidate who happens to be a woman tries on a colorful coat, and uses the moment to slyly acknowledge LGBTQ rights. Or is that just too trivial compared to trap shooting and skydiving?

Texto completo: Unlike citizens of most every other nation, Americans are not required by law to carry identification when they are simply walking around. Just as there is no national religion, there is no official language here, and we are free to gab in any tongue we choose.
So what possessed a United States Customs and Border Protection officer who last spring stopped two American women in a small Montana city and asked for their identification because, he said, he heard them speaking Spanish?
Well, there’s an easy answer to that rhetorical question: It was the false color of law, the un-American pretense that a uniform creates the right to invade others’ privacy without probable cause, that led the officer to pretend he could ask for something he had no right to.
Because, plain and simple, there is no national ID card here, and there is no need to carry anything with you as you go about your daily business — or to show even a driver’s license to law enforcement if there is no real reason to do so. But the undeniable truth is that police officers around the country quite often act as if this is not the case. It simply makes life easier for them if they can figure out who you are and run your name through the system when they have any suspicions at all.
In some small way, the fact that we can stroll ID-free helps keep the fully bureaucratic state at bay.
And that’s why we are glad that the two women in Montana, Ana Suda and Martha Hernandez, are suing the government agency in a symbolically important case brought by the ACLU.
They were in a convenience store in Havre, Montana, on May 16, 2018 when, the lawsuit alleges, Agent Paul A. O’Neal commented on Hernandez’s accent, calling it “very strong.” He then asked where they were born. Hernandez was born in California and Suda in Texas.
When the women expressed shock at the agent’s question, The New York Times reports, he said he was “dead serious” and asked to see their identification.
The pair were in possession of their valid Montana driver’s licenses, and, probably smartly, deciding to produce them, maintain as we might that they didn’t have to.
The officer briefly detained them in the store’s parking lot, the suit alleges. The women filmed the encounter on their phones, and asked on camera why they were being stopped.
“Ma’am the reason I asked you for your ID is I came in here and I saw you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here,” the agent said. The town is 35 miles from the Canadian border.
The agency has lots of real work to do. Frivolous lawsuits would only make that harder. But this kind of fighting back against false authority is so very important for Americans to continue to do in an increasingly un-private age. It is not against the law to speak Spanish — or Klingon, for that matter.
Government intrusion on individual liberty, whatever its rationale or purported justification, must be kept within reasonable limits.
In a society that values liberty, it is untenable for government agents to use accents or choice of language as a starting point for infringing on individual liberty.

Texto completo: Cute bunnies sing a tribute to pit bulls, a film-noirish character obsesses over key lime pie, and a Viking struggles comically to reach Valhalla. That's just a bit of what you can expect at this year's edition of SPIKE & MIKE'S SICK & TWISTED FESTIVAL OF ANIMATION, which returns to the Magic Bag starting Thursday. The annual show of animated shorts that are everything from politically incorrect to racy to raunchy was launched in California in 1990 by Spike Decker and the late Mike Gribble. Over the years, it has given boosts to the work of animators Mike Judge ("Beavis and Butt-Head"), Matt Stone and Trey Parker ("South Park") and Tim Burton ("The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "Frankenweenie").
9 p.m. Thursday, Sunday and Feb. 28 (doors at 8 p.m.), the Magic Bag, Ferndale. 248-544-1991. themagicbag.com. $8 advance.
Jacques Heim has an academic background in theater, film and dance and an intense passion for architecture. More than 25 years ago, he combined them and came up with DIAVOLO | ARCHITECTURE IN MOTION, a Los Angeles dance company whose mission involves exploring how humans are affected emotionally, physically and socially by the spaces they inhabit. Meticulously designed architectural pieces serve as the inspiration for each of the company's works, which are marked by choreography that's stylistically varied and intensely physical. Fans of NBC's "America's Got Talent" may recall Diavolo from a couple of years back. The group made it to the finals of the 2017 season.
8 p.m. Saturday, Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts, Detroit. 313-887-8501. musichall.org. $30-$50.
So you think the cello is a mournful-sounding musical instrument that belongs at stuffy chamber musical recitals? Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser, due Saturday at the Fox, just might beg to differ. The two Croatian musicians make up the duo 2CELLOS, and they've been gaining fame and acclaim since their version of Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal" ignited on YouTube back in 2011. Though their concerts include original material, it's the performers' takes on pop and hard-hitting rock hits that have been turning heads. Their five albums, including last fall's "Let There Be Cello," include covers of everything from "My Heart Will Go On" and Ed Sheeran's "Perfect" to "Smells Like Teen Spirit," "Highway to Hell" and "Welcome to the Jungle."
3 & 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Fox Theatre, Detroit. 800-745-3000. 313presents.com. $47.50 and up.
More than half a century before #MeToo, a lineup of fiercely talented women ruled record stores and the radio airwaves with hits marked by hurt, pain and messages of female empowerment. New York jazz and cabaret singer CAROLE J. BUFFORD will be paying tribute to them Saturday when she brings her show "You Don't Own Me: The Fearless Females of the 1960s" to the Detroit Institute of Arts. Expect a set list that includes tunes made famous by Lesley Gore, Janis Joplin, Dusty Springfield, Carole King and Tina Turner. Bufford, appearing for a third time as part of Detroit's Cabaret 313 series, has won high praise even from hard-boiled New York critics. Stephen Holden of the New York Times has described her as "the real thing" and "an earthier, more acerbic 21st-Century Barbra Streisand."
6:30 & 8:45 p.m. Saturday, Rivera Court at the DIA, Detroit. 313-405-5061. cabaret313.org. $60 ($125 for preferred seating and $25 for ages 40 and younger). A 7 p.m. dinner ($60) will be served in the Kresge Court for concertgoers attending the 8:45 show.
Will Netflix film "Roma" make Academy Awards history by taking the best-picture prize? Will Glenn Close finally win the Oscar that has eluded her for decades? You can await the answers to these and other pressing Hollywood questions Sunday night at the annual RED CARPET GALA at the MJR Southgate Digital Cinema 20. The celebration, one of 49 official Oscar Night America parties being held across the U.S., benefits the Southgate Community Players. Guests can enjoy champagne, wine and appetizers from local restaurants in the lobby before heading into a theater to watch the 91st edition of the Academy Awards on the big screen. Raffle baskets and a 50/50 raffle drawing are also part of the fun.
8 p.m. Sunday (doors at 7 p.m.), MJR Southgate Digital Cinema 20. scponstage.com. $35 advance, $40 at door.
Valentine's Day has come and gone, but an aura of amour lingers over Tangent Gallery, where the 32nd annual EROTIC POETRY & MUSIC FESTIVAL takes center stage Saturday. The evening of poetry, music, dancing and visual art will include spoken-word presentations by a dozen performers, including actor-musician-writer Jimmy Doom and Libertarian activist-political candidate Scott Boman. Also part of the fun: performance artist Satori Circus (and Konrad Lee, his lounge-singer alter ego); burlesque dancers, including Magenta DeMure and Ravenna Munster, and tarot readings from twin-sister act GeminEye Tarot. Vendors will be selling sweet and savory fare along with erotic edibles. Proceeds from the evening partially benefit Paws with a Cause, which supplies assistance dogs to people with disabilities.
8 p.m. Saturday, Tangent Gallery, Detroit. tangentgallery.com. $20 at the door, $15 advance tickets available at brownpapertickets.com.
Things are likely to get hot Sunday at Beacon Park — and we're not talking about the weather. While the University of Michigan Wolverines (No. 7 in this week's AP basketball poll) and the Michigan State University Spartans (No. 10) square off on the court in Ann Arbor, fans of both teams will gather for a WATCH PARTY in the park's Winter Lodge (it's actually a 40-by-100-foot heated tent), where the game will unfold on a giant screen. The tent will be transformed into a sports bar with a DJ, craft cocktails and beer as well as tailgate-inspired food items. Another party is scheduled for March 9, when U-M and MSU square off in East Lansing.
3-6 p.m. Sunday (game starts at 3:45), Beacon Park, downtown Detroit. empoweringmichigan.com/beacon-park. Free.
Top-rated off-road motorcyclists take the stage Saturday at Ford Field for Round 8 of the MONSTER ENERGY SUPERCROSS 2019 season. The races, held across the U.S. from January through May, find off-road motorcycles battling obstacles and attempting steep jumps on a dirt track. Organizers say the 2019 season has been unfolding in surprise fashion. After six rounds, only two points separated the top four athletes in the 450SX class.
7 p.m. Saturday, Ford Field, Detroit. (Practice and qualifying start at noon; opening ceremonies are at 6:30 p.m.) 800-745-3000. supercrosslive.com. $15 and up.
Kiddies can enjoy a night (or an afternoon) at the theater this weekend when Warren's Little Door Theatre debuts its production of "THE SNOW QUEEN." The musical adaptation of the beloved Hans Christian Andersen story follows the adventures of pure-of-heart Gerda, who embarks on a risky adventure to rescue her childhood friend Kai from the clutches of the frosty Snow Queen. Along the way, she encounters a robber girl, witches, royalty and a talking reindeer that assists her on her mission. Emily Thomson, Claire Zemmith and Daniel Drobot lead the cast of the Little Door production. Theater founder Shannon Hurst directs.
7 p.m. Friday, 2 p.m. Saturday-Sunday (also March 1-3), Little Door Theatre, Warren. littledoortheatre.com or brownpapertickets.com. $10.

President Trump: ISIS wife Hoda Muthana won't be allowed to return to United States

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Wednesday that an American woman who was the bride of an Islamic State fighter and now wants to come home will not be allowed back in the United States.
“I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
Muthana traveled to Syria and married and had a child with an ISIS fighter and now wants to face the U. S. justice system.
But Pompeo said earlier Wednesday that Muthana is not an American citizen and "does not have any legal basis, no valid U. S. passport, no right to a passport," contradicting statements by her family and her Florida-based lawyer, who said she was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1994.
Muthana, who was raised in Alabama, left the United States to join ISIS four years ago at age 19. In Syria, she called for Americans to be attacked, and she spread the group's propaganda online.
She is one of about 1,500 foreign women and children – the spouses and children of Islamic State militants – held in a Kurdish-run detention camp in northern Syria.
Muthana is there with her 18-month-old son. The child's father is not alive. Two of her previous husbands, both Islamic State militants, are also dead. Muthana is not allowed to leave the camp and has armed guards protecting her from Islamic State sympathizers. She is asking to be allowed to return to the U. S. to face due process.

"The government needs to engage with her, but not just her; all of these people who joined ISIS" from the West, said Hassan Shibly, Muthana's lawyer.
"If she broke the law, then the justice system can deal with her, and if she didn't break the law, she should come back anyway, so it can be determined if she is a threat. "

Shibly said Muthana has realized she made a mistake in moving to Syria and wants to return to the USA to face justice and "pay any debts she has to society. " He said she wants to speak out against the Islamic State and help de-radicalize other Americans.
Muthana abandoned her family and fled to Syria in 2014, a year after she graduated from high school. She briefly studied at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.
Shibly shared a letter Muthana wrote this week in which she described herself as "naive, angry and arrogant" when she decided to journey to Syria.
"During my years in Syria, I would see and experience a way of life and the terrible effects of war, which changed me," Muthana wrote. "Seeing bloodshed up close changed me. Motherhood changed me. Seeing friends, children and the men I married dying changed me. Seeing how different a society could be compared to the beloved America I was born and raised into changed me. "
Shibly, executive director of the Florida Council on American Islamic Relations in Tampa, said it was not clear from a legal standpoint whether Muthana's "marrying into ISIS" could warrant a "material support charge" to Islamic State activities, which range from terror attacks in the USA and Europe to beheadings in Iraq and Syria.
Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, said that if he were advising Muthana, he would tell her that coming back to the USA would be "risky. " Dershowitz told the New York Post her case would be a "close call" even if all she did was tweet and send emails.
Muthana claimed to have had no contact with U. S. authorities, and Shibly said she can leave the camp only if the U. S. government asks for her release. It's not clear if it has. U. S. immigration authorities were not available to answer questions about her case, including whether a U. S. citizen can be barred from entering his or her own country.
In a briefing, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino would not address Muthana's specific case, but said repatriating foreign terrorist fighters to their countries of origin was the "best solution to preventing them from returning to the battlefield. "
Pompeo subsequently issued the statement Wednesday in which he claimed that Muthana was not a U. S. citizen and would not be allowed back in.
Shibly, however, provided USA TODAY with a copy of Muthana's birth certificate, which lists her place of birth as Hackensack, New Jersey.
Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said that Pompeo can't just assert that someone born in the U. S. is not a U. S. citizen.
"I gather that the government's argument is that she was born to a diplomat who was in the United States on official business, and so was not entitled to birthright citizenship. That's correct as a matter of law if it's true, but it's not true just because the government says so," he said in a Twitter message to USA TODAY.
Only six American militants have returned from fighting or training with militant groups in Syria, according to New America, a Washington-based foreign policy research institute.
All were taken into custody. Muthana may be the first American spouse or partner of an Islamic State fighter who has sought to return home. The New York Times has reported that another woman, dual U. S. -Canadian national Kimberly Gwen Polman, 46, is also in the al-hawl refugee camp in Syria. She left Canada in 2015.
A similar case in Britain involves Shamima Begum, 19, from London, who gave birth to a baby boy over the weekend in the same camp where Muthana is held.
Begum, who left Britain for Syria at age 15 and married an Islamic State fighter, wants to return to Britain for the sake of her child's welfare, but British authorities, including the nation's interior minister, indicated they might try to block her return. They might find that difficult to do because a British national can't theoretically be prevented from returning home unless that person is also a national of another country. Begum isn't.
The woman's London-based lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said Tuesday that the British government informed him that it is trying to strip Begum of her British citizenship.
As for Muthana, "whether it's a few years in jail, 20 years in jail or no jail, she's open to the legal process, and she's not asking for a free pass, just due process," Shibly said.

Lashing out crime: When whipping post was staple of law and order

Texto completo: "The New York and Boston papers and magazines, that were wont to describe the Delaware whipping post as 'an effete relic of barbarism,' " the Laurel State Register noted in January 1905, "probably do not regard it as quite so effete or barbaric since President Roosevelt has recommended its introduction into the District of Columbia."
When the European colonists arrived in southern Delaware during the 17th century, they brought with them an attitude toward criminals that had its roots in the dark corners of the Middle Ages.
Justice was often swift and brutal. Instead of incarceration, criminals were sentenced to a variety of corporal penalties that included whipping, branding, lopping off ears, and in the most severe cases, drawing and quartering.
During the 19th century, most states abandoned corporal punishment of criminals; but in 1873, the New York Times reported, "Corporal punishment is an important feature of the Delaware penal code. For instance, whipping is a part of the punishment of all minor degrees of murder, and for burglary, mayhem, violent assault, kidnapping, highway robbery, attempted poisoning, arson, larceny, counterfeiting, and other felonies and misdemeanors."
Many in Delaware saw the whipping post as being essential to maintaining law and order in the state; and in 1904, the state found a willing ally when President Theodore Roosevelt suggested the implementation of the lash for the District of Columbia.
According to the State Register, "Ever since President Roosevelt recommended the establishment of the whipping post in the District of Columbia, the District authorities have been agitating the question.
"In his message the President very strongly argued this mode of punishment for wife beaters. The District Grand Jury in making its final report to the present term of the Supreme Court says: 'The desirability of establishing the whipping post as a means of punishing wife beaters and petty larceny offenders has been investigated by this body and the majority of the members are of the opinion that it would prove very effective in decreasing the number of these reprehensible crimes.' "
In addition, the Washington Post quoted Major Richard Sylvester, superintendent of the District police force, as saying "In my opinion the application of the lash in one or two cases in the District of Columbia and the holding of the apparatus in readiness for the future would (do) more to stay the cruel treatment of wives and children and prevent the snatching of pocketbooks, assaults, and robberies, than almost anything that could be devised. Put up the whipping post and it will act as a scarecrow."
During the debate about making the whipping post part of the District of Columbia legal system, Delaware continued to flog its criminals.
In April 1905, the State Register reported, "Roy Thompson was whipped at the post in Georgetown Saturday until blood spurted from cuts on his back. Sheriff Lynch plied the cat with vigor forty times across his bare shoulders. George P. Insley and Charles Lofland and Theodore Bell ... were given ten lashes each for larceny."
Criminals continued to be flogged in Sussex County well into the 20th century. In 1932, a crowd of 2,000 people, men, women, and children, some of the women with babies in their arms, braved a chilly February wind to witness five prisoners being whipped at the new Sussex County jail at Georgetown.
The last flogging in Delaware occurred in 1952; and the scarecrow of the whipping post was formally abandoned 20 years later.

Texto completo: Palm Beach County public school leaders are preparing to pay top dollar for a law firm to defend an $800 million pot of money that two charter schools want a piece of.
School Board members are expected today to approve paying up to $250,000 to high-profile law firm Boies Schiller Flexner to represent them in court, in what will likely be a closely watched legal battle over the fate of a new school property tax.
The move comes a month after the two charter schools, Palm Beach Maritime Academy and the Academy for Positive Learning, sued in state circuit court for a share of the money from the four-year property tax approved by voters in November.
The tax is expected to raise about $200 million a year for teacher raises, increased school security and mental health services. The referendum approved by voters prohibits the county’s 49 charter schools from receiving any proceeds.
This month, the School Board's general counsel, JulieAnn Rico, negotiated a tentative agreement with Boies Schiller Flexner that would allow it to charge the School Board up to $250,000 for legal work, records show.
Under the agreement, the firm’s partners would bill the School Board $650 an hour, associate attorneys would bill $450 an hour and paralegals would bill $150 an hour.
Although the contract awaits approval from board members today, court records show the firm is already representing the School Board, filing a response in court last week to the charters’ lawsuit.
It is not the first time the board has tapped the firm. In 2017, board members approved paying its attorneys up to $150,000 to
sue the state over a new law requiring it to share property tax dollars with charter schools.
The stakes in the lawsuit could be high. If the charters prevail in court, the School Board could be required to share 10 percent of the earnings from the special tax with the county’s charters, or about $80 million. The outcome could have broader repercussions for school districts across Florida.
Charter schools are publicly financed but privately managed. In Florida they generally get the same per-student funding as traditional public schools, but school districts receive some local tax earnings that charters do not.
In their suit, the charters argue that excluding them and their students from a piece of the tax earnings violates a state law requiring that charters “shall be funded as if they are in a basic program or a special program, the same as students enrolled in other public schools in the school district.”
In a response filed in court last week, the School Board rejected that argument, saying that while many of the board’s state and local property taxes have to be shared with charters, that requirement does not apply to money derived from voter-approved referendums.
The School Board “does not have an obligation to distribute the referendum revenues to charter schools under these statutory provisions, nor under any other statutory provision,” wrote Jon Mills, a Boies Schiller Flexner attorney.
Boies Schiller Flexner, led by celebrity lawyer David Boies, is known for representing Al Gore during the 2000 Florida election recount and the U.S. government during its 1998 antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft.
More recently, it came under controversy while representing movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as he faced accusations of sexual assault and sexual harassment in 2017.
The New Yorker magazine revealed in 2017 that the firm had hired private investigators to organize smear campaigns against Weinstein’s alleged victims and to mislead journalists looking into their claims.
The New York Times, a longtime Boies Schiller Flexner client, fired the firm after those revelations, calling its actions “reprehensible.” The firm apologized, saying it hired the private investigators but did not direct their work.
The firm currently represents Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is his handling of an incident in which he accused American Media Inc. of threatening to publish intimate photos of him and his girlfriend.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine -- It wasn't easy for photographer Smith Galtney, 47, to find what he calls his "calm, content midlife." It lay on the far side of a chaotic early adulthood. Getting there, he first had to climb the ladder of New York's cutthroat music business, kick a drug habit, bail out to nowheresville Maine and then master a whole new system of self-expression.
It was a difficult path to tread but Galtney pulled it off.
The proof is on the walls at the University of Southern Maine's AREA Gallery on the Portland campus. That's where you'll find his first solo photographic exhibition, "My Principal Ghost."
The subtle collection of black-and-white images are about photographing something that isn't there, something you can't see -- in this case, the past. The images are Galtney's attempt at showing the continuance of his own convoluted, chaotic youth by photographing its concrete imprint on the present.
A rundown clapboard house sits in a patch of unkempt bushes just beyond a manicured lawn in one picture. It suggests something unsettling lurking just outside of a comfort zone. Another photo shows last year's cat-o-nine tails dissolving into random windblown fluff. It's perhaps a reminder of each season's impermanence.
Two images show a box of an old friend's cremated remains. It was someone he used to do drugs with, someone who didn't make it. The box of ashes is all that's left.
Born and raised in New Orleans, Galtney's father died when he was a teenager. At the dawn of the '90s, he left his southern home, entering college in New York City. He intended to be a filmmaker. Instead, he ended up in a class taught by influential rock music critic Robert Christgau. That changed everything.
Impressed by his work, Christgau set Galtney up with an internship at the Village Voice. That led to a successful music writing career that saw him published in the New York Times, GQ, Rolling Stone, Time Out New York and others.
But even at the height of his career, Galtney wasn't happy. He also had a growing drug and alcohol addiction. After getting married to a supportive man with a good job on Wall Street, Galtney got out of the city and moved to Panther Pond in Raymond in hopes of putting his life together and figuring out what he wanted to do next.
First, he went to rehab. It was after that when his husband urged him to take a photography class. That's when it clicked.
Now, Galtney is a graduate of the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies photography program here in Maine and the International Center of Photography in New York. He works as Director of The Bakery Photo Collective in Portland. In 2014, he was commissioned by the Frannie Peabody Center to create "SeeingME: Profiles of Resilience," a series of portraits highlighting the diverse individuals who represent the AIDS/HIV community in Maine.
Q: It must have been awesome being a music writer in New York City?
A: It was a great job throughout my 20s and even into my 30s. But eventually what happens is the musicians you're interviewing start getting younger than you. I had a big identity crisis throughout the early 2000s. There were so many things coming at me that made me think, I'm not a part of this anymore.
Q: Did you have some kind of turning point where you knew you were really done?
A: Yeah, to put it all much shorter, I grew up loving music. I became a rock critic and I reached a good height in the business. In 2001 I wrote two features for GQ. I was very well paid for them. They flew me to Nashville to hang out with Lucinda Williams for a weekend. I was like, "Yeah, this is what I want to do."
Then, I kind of had a moment.
She was a wreck that weekend -- and this is when I was still drinking -- and I just got trashed with her. She was a sad drunk. It wasn't a cool drunk and I didn't write about any of it. I realized, I just can't do this to a person. It was in that moment I realized I'm pretty [bad] at this job. I never had it in me to be mean to people. I always wanted to be their friend. I wasn't a really good journalist.
Q: Was that the low point for you?
A: Then there was some serious drug bottoming out. It got pretty gnarly. I went to rehab.
Q: Wow. By this time you'd moved to Panther Pond, out in Raymond. This is when you took up photography in a serious way?
A: Yes. If you quit alcohol and drugs, it's usually a pretty good idea to pick up an activity that's totally new. At first, I started cooking because if you do meth for an extensive period of time, the last thing you're going to do is whip up some pancakes. Cooking was interesting for a little while but it's not quite my thing.
Q: When you finally found photography, was it love at first sight?
A: I can't recall a more instantaneous obsession. I'd been sober for about six or seven months [when I took my first class] but it was like, holy [excrement], this is something.This is going to get me. There was something about photography that was so fearless for me. Writing used to stir up every insecurity -- but with photography, if it sucked, I was like, "Let's take some more."
Q: I first became aware of your work through social media pictures of your bulldog, Kate. I'm happy to see she's in this show. You've said she was crucial to your journey out of rehab and into photography. In this picture, she's facing away from you, looking into a beam of light. Is this photo about her passing?
A: She was amazing. Bulldogs are just very still and pliable. She taught me how to become a photographer. Her passing was so much worse than I expected. It brought on this crazy life assessment. I was like, "You have no idea what you've given me." There's something about that picture. It's like, her work is done. She going into the light. She's saying: "You're good from here. You don't need me anymore."
There's an opening reception for "My Principal Ghost" at 5 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 21, at the University of Southern Maine's AREA Gallery in the Woodbury Campus Center, on the Portland Campus. Galtney will host an artist's talk at 6 p.m. The exhibition will be on view through March 29.

Thomas calls for re-examining libel as court rejects Cosby case

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday called for reconsideration of the Supreme Court's landmark decision making it more difficult for public officials to claim defamation as the court turned down a request from an accuser of Bill Cosby.
The court declined to take the case of Kathrine McKee, who accused Cosby of raping her more than 40 years ago. She sued after Cosby's attorney leaked a letter that she said distorted her background to "damage her reputation for truthfulness and honesty" and to shame her.
Thomas said he agreed with his colleagues not to accept McKee's "factbound" appeal.
But he launched a detailed critique of the landmark libel ruling, which he said was a "policy-driven" decision "masquerading as constitutional law." No other justice joined his concurrence.
But President Donald Trump has also expressed support for making it easier to sue for defamation, and during the campaign - and afterward - he complained about "hit pieces" in The Washington Post and The New York Times.
"I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money," Trump said during the campaign. Over the weekend, he complained about a "Saturday Night Live" skit and wondered about "retribution."
Some media law experts expressed concern over Thomas' declaration.
Jonathan Peters, a professor of media law at the University of Georgia, said New York Times v. Sullivan "is essential to our modern understanding of press freedom."
Peters said the ruling "had the immediate impact of emboldening news organizations to cover the civil rights movement more forcefully - and later the Vietnam War and Watergate."
But Thomas and Justice Antonin Scalia have said the court may have intruded into a space in which it was not needed.
"We should not continue to reflexively apply this policy driven approach to the Constitution," Thomas wrote. "Instead, we should carefully examine the original meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we."
The media for decades has depended on New York Times v. Sullivan as a shield for reporting on public figures. But Thomas said Justice Byron White had also expressed concern after he was in the majority in the case.

President Trump: ISIS wife Hoda Muthana won't be allowed to return to the United States

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Wednesday that an American woman who was the bride of an Islamic State fighter and now wants to come home will not be allowed back in the United States.
“I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
Muthana traveled to Syria and married and had a child with an ISIS fighter and now wants to face the U. S. justice system.
But Pompeo said earlier Wednesday that Muthana is not an American citizen and "does not have any legal basis, no valid U. S. passport, no right to a passport," contradicting statements by her family and her Florida-based lawyer, who said she was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1994.
Pompeo's assertion that Muthana "does not have any legal basis, no valid U. S. passport, no right to a passport," contradicts statements by her family and her Florida-based lawyer, who said she was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1994.
Muthana, who was raised in Alabama, left the United States to join ISIS four years ago at age 19. In Syria, she called for Americans to be attacked, and she spread the group's propaganda online.
She is one of about 1,500 foreign women and children – the spouses and children of Islamic State militants – held in a Kurdish-run detention camp in northern Syria.
Muthana is there with her 18-month-old son. The child's father is not alive. Two of her previous husbands, both Islamic State militants, are also dead. Muthana is not allowed to leave the camp and has armed guards protecting her from Islamic State sympathizers. She is asking to be allowed to return to the U. S. to face due process.

"The government needs to engage with her, but not just her; all of these people who joined ISIS" from the West, said Hassan Shibly, Muthana's lawyer.
"If she broke the law, then the justice system can deal with her, and if she didn't break the law, she should come back anyway, so it can be determined if she is a threat. "

Shibly said Muthana has realized she made a mistake in moving to Syria and wants to return to the USA to face justice and "pay any debts she has to society. " He said she wants to speak out against the Islamic State and help de-radicalize other Americans.
Muthana abandoned her family and fled to Syria in 2014, a year after she graduated from high school. She briefly studied at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.
Shibly shared a letter Muthana wrote this week in which she described herself as "naive, angry and arrogant" when she decided to journey to Syria.
"During my years in Syria, I would see and experience a way of life and the terrible effects of war, which changed me," Muthana wrote. "Seeing bloodshed up close changed me. Motherhood changed me. Seeing friends, children and the men I married dying changed me. Seeing how different a society could be compared to the beloved America I was born and raised into changed me. "
Shibly, executive director of the Florida Council on American Islamic Relations in Tampa, said it was not clear from a legal standpoint whether Muthana's "marrying into ISIS" could warrant a "material support charge" to Islamic State activities, which range from terror attacks in the USA and Europe to beheadings in Iraq and Syria.
Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, said that if he were advising Muthana, he would tell her that coming back to the USA would be "risky. " Dershowitz told the New York Post her case would be a "close call" even if all she did was tweet and send emails.
Muthana claimed to have had no contact with U. S. authorities, and Shibly said she can leave the camp only if the U. S. government asks for her release. It's not clear if it has. U. S. immigration authorities were not available to answer questions about her case, including whether a U. S. citizen can be barred from entering his or her own country.
In a briefing, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino would not address Muthana's specific case, but said repatriating foreign terrorist fighters to their countries of origin was the "best solution to preventing them from returning to the battlefield. "
Pompeo subsequently issued the statement Wednesday in which he claimed that Muthana was not a U. S. citizen and would not be allowed back in.
Shibly, however, provided USA Today with a copy of Muthana's birth certificate, which lists her place of birth as Hackensack, New Jersey.
Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said that Pompeo can't just assert that someone born in the U. S. is not a U. S. citizen.
"I gather that the government's argument is that she was born to a diplomat who was in the United States on official business, and so was not entitled to birthright citizenship. That's correct as a matter of law if it's true, but it's not true just because the government says so," he said in a Twitter message to USA TODAY.
Only six American militants have returned from fighting or training with militant groups in Syria, according to New America, a Washington-based foreign policy research institute.
All were taken into custody. Muthana may be the first American spouse or partner of an Islamic State fighter who has sought to return home. The New York Times has reported that another woman, dual U. S. -Canadian national Kimberly Gwen Polman, 46, is also in the al-hawl refugee camp in Syria. She left Canada in 2015.
A similar case in Britain involves Shamima Begum, 19, from London, who gave birth to a baby boy over the weekend in the same camp where Muthana is held.
Begum, who left Britain for Syria at age 15 and married an Islamic State fighter, wants to return to Britain for the sake of her child's welfare, but British authorities, including the nation's interior minister, indicated they might try to block her return. They might find that difficult to do because a British national can't theoretically be prevented from returning home unless that person is also a national of another country. Begum isn't.
The woman's London-based lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said Tuesday that the British government informed him that it is trying to strip Begum of her British citizenship.
As for Muthana, "whether it's a few years in jail, 20 years in jail or no jail, she's open to the legal process, and she's not asking for a free pass, just due process," Shibly said.

Texto completo: Cities around the country that offered Amazon the world in unsuccessful bids to host the company’s second headquarters must be wondering how on earth one of the winners of that competition, New York, could have allowed its deal to go sour.
The answer has a lot to do with politics, which is played with a hardball in the city that never sleeps. But it also has something to do with economics, and in particular with economic development.
The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant announced last week that it was pulling out of its agreement to build a new campus in Long Island City, Queens, where it promised to create more than 25,000 jobs in return for nearly $3 billion in city and state subsidies.
The decision to pull the plug came after the company faced a wave of fierce criticism from progressive activists, lawmakers and unions, despite enjoying broad public support around the state.
A reconstruction of the deal’s collapse by The New York Times points to several reasons:
The company has been used to deferential treatment at home in Seattle, where last year it waged a fierce public relations campaign that bullied the City Council there into repealing a new corporate tax that was aimed at addressing the city’s urgent homelessness and affordable housing problems. Thus it was unprepared for the rough-and-tumble of contentious New York politics.
Amazon’s anti-union stance did not endear it to either lawmakers or powerful unions.
Its deal was negotiated with city and state leaders behind closed doors, without public input.
The company was not willing to engage with community activists and build relationships with key players.
And it had developed no strategy to cope with the sudden rise of progressive politicians such as U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of Queens, who was highly skeptical of the deal.
“Amazon underestimated the power of a vocal minority and miscalculated how much it needed to engage with those audiences to make HQ2 a success,” Joseph Parilla, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, told the Times, using the shorthand reference to the second headquarters.
On the economic side, New York — unlike many other cities for whom the creation of high-paying jobs is the holy grail — simply did not need Amazon so badly. That perhaps presented the opportunity to ask why one of the world’s richest companies, which according to one analysis will pay no federal income tax on $11.2 billion in profit last year, needed to be enticed by tax breaks on a vast scale.
It’s a good question.
Economists have long cautioned that such incentives are rarely the deciding factor in where companies choose to locate. In fact, Amazon declined the biggest subsidies offered by other places, which ranged up to $9.7 billion, because it wanted to be in New York City. (Northern Virginia, the other winner in the Amazon sweepstakes, offered a relatively modest package, $570 million.)
Nor is it clear that the economic benefits produced by tax subsidies for corporations are in fact widely shared in the communities where they locate, rather than flowing primarily to upper-income groups.
A better way for city and state governments to approach economic development is to refrain from putting the taxpayers on the hook for rich subsidies to private corporations, and instead to invest in infrastructure — not only the physical kind.
To be sure, good roads and bridges, convenient air service, ample water and sewer capacity are all important. But also key is a ready supply of skilled labor. (Besides the direct job-creation subsidies it offered, Virginia committed to using $1 billion in taxpayer money to improve transportation and develop a pipeline of skilled technical workers.)
Other attributes that attract companies are good schools and reliable child care, an ample stock of good-quality affordable housing, vibrant cultural, social and recreational opportunities, and a host of other less-tangible things that come under the general heading of good quality of life.
Making those investments, which benefit all residents, seems far more sensible than lavishing tax breaks on companies that don’t need them.

Serena Williams, 'outsiders' to present awards

Texto completo: Serena Williams, who has as much impact off the tennis court as on it these days, is headed to Hollywood next. Or, at least, to a celebration of Hollywood.
The world-renowned athlete, who recently appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for Bumble and made a surprise cameo on "Lip Sync Battle" last month to reprise her role from the 2016 music video for Beyoncé's "Sorry," will be one of the eight non-actors to present at the Oscars on Sunday, the New York Times reported.
Williams, 37, will introduce "A Star is Born," while seven other celebrities will each take on one of "Black Panther," "BlacKkKlansman," "Bohemian Rhapsody," "The Favourite," "Green Book," "Roma" and "Vice."
"Along with inclusion, which we definitely want to embrace, the big theme of the show is about movies connecting us -- not in this theater but in a big, sweeping, cultural way," Donna Gigliotti, the lead producer of the Academy Awards, told the New York Times.
"There are so many things to balance. Some viewers want to see glamour. You have to pay attention to where there is humor and where there is music. When do we guess that people at home might get up to make popcorn in the kitchen, and what can we have on right after that to bring them back?"
The other seven presenters have not been announced and a spokesperson for the Academy did not return a request for comment.
The 2019 Oscars have already seen a laundry list of changes -- but few that have stuck -- as the annual awards show aims for a return to legitimacy.
The ceremony will go without a host for the first time in 30 years after Kevin Hart stepped down following backlash for homophobic tweets that resurfaced online.
Plans for a "popular film" category were also quickly scrapped after criticism that the award was announced so 'Black Panther" could be recognized without the Academy having to give its top trophy to a superhero movie.
The most recent controversy, however, came when the Academy announced intentions to eliminate four categories -- cinematography, film editing, live action short and makeup and hairstyling -- from the live telecast in order to cut time from the three-plus-hour broadcast.
But stars, including Brad Pitt, Kerry Washington, Emma Stone, Spike Lee, George Clooney, Alfonso Cuarón and dozens more protested, signing an open letter that blasted the decision.
"Since its inception, the Academy Awards telecast has been altered over time to keep the format fresh, but never by sacrificing the integrity of the Academy's original mission," they wrote.
"When the recognition of those responsible for the creation of outstanding cinema is being diminished by the very institution whose purpose it is to protect it, then we are no longer upholding the spirit of the Academy's promise to celebrate film as a collaborative art form."
The Academy relented and reversed its decision.

Vegetarian foods are McGee's jam; More athletes turning to plant-based meat substitutes and raving about the results.

Texto completo: This is not the All-Star break Magic Johnson and LeBron James envisioned when basketball's best player announced in July he was joining the Lakers.
Still, there are some bright spots to this disappointing season, and high among them has to be the play of JaVale McGee. The last four seasons, the onetime Shaquille O'Neal punching bag has gone from being a joke to a bit player on two championship teams, to now a fairly important piece to the Lakers' fleeting postseason hopes.
Though it's not unusual for an athlete to have a late-career surge, McGee's began when he gave up meat.

"I was in Dallas and I had gained weight and knew becoming a vegetarian was the quickest way to lose it," he said. "I just wasn't sure if I could do it."
It was 2015, and he was a bench player for the Mavericks struggling to find minutes. A trip to Whole Foods led him to discover a producer of plant-based meat substitutes called Beyond Meat -- and with it, renewed energy.
"I was just looking for vegan stuff, saw the name and was like, 'Let me try this,' and it was really good," McGee said. "Like I couldn't tell the difference between that and meat. I thought, 'If I can make it taste good and I'm not really a cook, imagine what a chef could do.' "
McGee is not the only NBA player to experiment with a plant-based diet after discovering the El Segundo-based company. In fact, Beyond Meat has made a specific pitch to woo athletes to become evangelists for its products.
That funky baseball cap Boston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving often wears -- with the caped steer -- is the Beyond Meat logo. Indiana Pacers guard Victor Oladipo eats the food, as do Philadelphia 76ers marksman J.J. Redick, Sacramento Kings forward Harrison Barnes and New York Knicks center DeAndre Jordan.
Jordan convinced former Clippers teammate Chris Paul to eat it, and when Jordan signed with the Mavericks, he got Dennis Smith Jr. to try it too. Now when they are on the road with the Knicks, Smith calls Jordan with vegetarian restaurant options near the team hotel.
"I'm not the kind of person that forces things on people but if you ask me about it, I'm singing," Jordan said.
The plant-based craze has crossed into the NFL as well, with Houston Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins also serving as ambassadors for Beyond Meat.
Beyond Meat is on a growing list of companies developing meat substitutes, which Allied Market Research says will be a $7.5-billion market worldwide by 2025. Its biggest competitor is Impossible Foods, based in Redwood City, and other large companies are entering what is seen as a growth market. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, for example, has invested in both companies, and food giant Tyson Foods is an investor in Beyond Meat.
Last month, Beyond Meat announced a partnership with Carl's Jr. This week it is expected to announce partnerships with some NBA players who regularly consume the company's burgers after games, including a commercial featuring Irving.
Players on meatless diets talk about having more energy and quicker recovery after games. McGee said his skin is clearer. Jordan talked about the positive influence on the environment -- that producing meat substitutes uses less water and creates fewer greenhouse gases than producing beef. And a recent study the University of Michigan conducted concluded that Beyond Meat's production does require less water, energy and land than traditional meat producers.
Given the opportunity to visit Beyond Meat's headquarters and sample some prototypes, I got a closer look at what they were doing with sunflower seeds and peas. The company's research and development department is peppered with beef slivers under microscopes. Scientists are analyzing images of the molecular structure of animal flesh on a screen next to their products, to get the composition as close as possible with a few tweaks -- more protein and no cholesterol.
If there was a checklist for a tasty product, Beyond Meat does a pretty good job. But people like what they like. And people like meat -- moo meat.
Full disclosure: I saw that "What the Health" documentary and was moved to go vegan. After a couple of weeks, I was moved to eat a steak and take my chances.
If you're wondering whether the athletes who rave about plant-based diets are only tricking themselves into thinking they have more energy, some nutritionists are backing them up. Nutrients, a peer-reviewed science journal, recently released a study stating plant-based diets have consistently been shown to reduce body fat while increasing vascular flow and tissue oxygenation.
"Diets emphasizing plant foods have also been shown to reduce indicators of inflammation," the study found.
None of which is new information to nutritionist and New York Times bestselling author Cynthia Sass. She said in addition to the physical benefits, a plant-based diet also may lead to clearer thinking and better disposition. She said the biggest drawback for professional athletes is the commitment.
"It requires more nutrition knowledge in order to make choices that properly meet nutrient needs," said Sass, a sports nutrition consultant for the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Nets. "It can also be challenging for athletes in team sports who may have less control over their meals when traveling and limited access to plant proteins and other key foods."
Translation: It's easier to eat healthy at home; it's the road trips that can kill you.
Not everyone is sold on swearing off meat completely.
"There is no perfect human diet," said Chris Algieri, a former junior welterweight champion boxer who now works as a nutritionist for Daniel Jacobs, the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, and holds a master's degree in clinical nutrition.
"Individual difference between people is so great that there isn't a single 'right way' when it comes to nutrition. What works for some athletes may be a total disaster for others. I personally don't follow a plant-based diet because it does not suit me. I have tried it and did not have good results, but that is just my personal experience and not to say it can't work for other athletes."
Getting more of the masses to buy into a plant-based diet won't be easy, which is why Chief Executive Ethan Brown is hitching the company's wagon to athletes. They get us to buy shoes we don't need and movies not worth watching. He believes if enough of them buy into his brand of healthful eating, it can spark a movement.
"They have the power to change the world," Brown said. "I don't know if they really feel that way yet, but it's true. They have the opportunity to influence an entire generation of kids to eat healthier and help save the environment."
Irving said he mentioned his diet change during an interview at the beginning of last season, and Beyond Meat offered to send him samples.
"I was noticing that I wasn't able to recover as fast after games and workouts," he said. "I did a lot of research and learned that my diet could be a factor.
"It was good timing as I was struggling to find quality plant-based foods that still had a lot of flavor."
But can he and other NBA evangelists really get people to grill tasty sunflower seeds instead of ground beef?
"Not only do I think it will be a permanent change among athletes," Irving said, "but I think we will see people who aren't professional athletes making the change as well."

RESPONSE TO ATTACK; Lake Erie bill backers say ads smear campaign; Issue is on ballot for Feb. 26 vote

Texto completo: Toledoans for Safe Water said at a news conference Monday that its proposed Lake Erie Bill of Rights is being smeared on radio advertisements by a Columbus-based firm with deep pockets.

Markie Miller, Toledoans for Safe Water organizer, said Strategic Public Partners Group is putting fear into the public with 11th-hour falsehoods leading up to Toledo's special election Feb. 26. She said it is doing so under the name of a group called Toledo Jobs and Growth Coalition, which she and others contend was created as a front to attack their proposed amendment to Toledo's city charter.

The firm has represented major pharmaceutical companies, the American Chemistry Council, Coca Cola Corp., FedEx, Bank of America, Ford Motor Co., the National Football League, and others, according to a joint statement by her group and Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie.

We expected this in a way, Ms. Miller said.

Sean Nestor, who also belongs to Toledoans for Safe Water, said in a Facebook post that Toledo Coalition for Jobs and Growth is one of two shadow PACs that were formed in the last week out of nowhere to attack the Lake Erie Bill of Rights.

The other, he said, is a group called Real Solutions for Lake Erie. Neither has websites. Real Solutions for Lake Erie recently had a Facebook page created. But nearly all posts are from critics who claim it is a phony group created to attack the campaign.

The former has been airing on local radio stations a series of attack ads, while the latter is focused on social media, according to Mr. Nestor.

It shouldn't surprise anyone that an innovative effort to protect Lake Erie and hold its polluters accountable is being hit with a well-funded smear campaign full of outright lies, Mr. Nestor wrote in his Facebook post. The same people that make money by not cleaning up their mess are paying slick [public relations] firms to convince people to vote against protecting their own water supply.

Brandon Lynaugh, a partner at Strategic Public Partners Group, is listed on Lucas County Board of Elections documents as the coalition's treasurer.

Mr. Lynaugh refused to be interviewed, but said in a statement on behalf of the coalition that the Lake Erie Bill of Rights is a misguided effort that threatens the economic security of Toledo families. The statement went on to contend that small businesses, places of worship, and labor organizations will all suffer under this proposal, but gave no explanation.

The coalition has not run any television ads.

According to the website OpenSecrets.org, Strategic Public Partners is a lobbying-public relations firm listed as a political action committee - or PAC - and has donated to several of Ohio's Republican members of Congress.

Recipients have included U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), U.S. Rep. Bob Latta (R., Bowling Green), and U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan (R. Urbana).

Among the coalition's multiple claims is that the Lake Erie Bill of Rights campaign is being run by out-of-state extremists.

Flanked by about 30 other Toledoans inside One Government Center, Ms. Miller flatly denied that. Many of those in attendance were locals who had gathered signatures to get the proposal on the ballot. Toledoans for Safe Water also had its ballot initiative represented in front of the Lucas County Board of Elections and the Ohio Supreme Court by Terry Lodge, a Toledo attorney.

Sam Wright, an ACLE member, said he finds the accusation baseless and insulting.

I find it extremely offensive and I think it's just fear mongering, Mr. Wright said. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a local initiative.

Ms. Miller acknowledged early in the campaign and again Monday that the only outside involvement has been consulting from the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, which is based in Mercersburg, Pa., and has worked with communities in at least 10 states to enact what are known as rights to nature laws. It also has done work in Nepal, India, Cameroon, Colombia, Australia, and other countries.

Such efforts, according to a six-page analysis published Feb. 8 by Ohio State University Extension, have a bad track record in courts nationwide.

In a second prepared statement submitted to The Blade, Mr. Lynaugh said the coalition stands behind its radio ad. He said it is designed to highlight the fact that an out of state organization called the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund is pushing these reckless and legally dubious issues on local ballots all across the country without regard to their negative impact on jobs and local economies.

Records show only one contribution has been made to Toledoans for Safe Water by a person affiliated with the CELDF. That was a $100 donation on Sept. 21, 2018 by Tish O'Dell, of Broadview Heights, Ohio, who is CELDF's Ohio organizer.

Toledo Jobs and Growth Coalition is too new to have campaign contributions on file. Mr. Lynaugh said the group is a ballot issue committee that will file all the required reports outlining campaign contributions and expenditures at the next filing deadline.

A lengthy article about the proposed bill led the Sunday New York Times National page.

I hope people realize the world is watching, Ms. Miller said. This might be a local effort, but it's a local effort that's part of a larger national movement - the community rights movement, the rights of nature.

Both Toledoans for Safe Water and Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie are Toledo-based groups formed in response to Toledo's 2014 algae-driven water crisis. ACLE was created by two-time Toledo mayoral candidate and former Toledo city councilman Mike Ferner.

Texto completo: The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to take up a defamation lawsuit filed against comedian Bill Cosby by a woman who said he raped her more than 40 years ago.

The justices rejected the appeal from actress Kathrine McKee, who said Cosby defamed her when his lawyer, Martin Singer, wrote and leaked a letter to the New York Daily News calling her a liar and a criminal, according to court filings.

A federal district court in Massachusetts, however, tossed our McKee’s lawsuit, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1 st Circuit agreed by ruling that McKee, under New York Times v. Sullivan, is a limited purpose public figure.

McKee came forward in December 2014 after numerous women accused Cosby of sexual assault, and said the actor forcibly raped her in 1974. The actress told the New York Daily News about the sexual assault and also appeared in a photo shoot for New York magazine alongside other Cosby victims.

McKee’s lawyers said that despite speaking publicly about her allegation against Cosby, she “has not become a prominent advocate in any public controversy, and has not publicly called for any change in the laws, or any social reforms, and has consistently maintained her privacy other than to say, as many other women have said, ‘me too.’”

In her petition to the court, lawyers for McKee urged the justices to take up the case “at this historical moment.”

“A person who decries sexual misconduct should not be stripped of the protections of private figure statue, such that she has virtually no recourse to protect her reputation through a defamation lawsuit. McKee should not be victimized twice over,” they wrote.

In agreeing with the Supreme Court’s decision not to consider McKee’s appeal, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the high court reconsider the standard set in New York Times v. Sullivan, in which the court said a public figure must show a false statement was made with “actual malice" to win a defamation case.

“ New York Times and the court’s decisions extending it were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law,” Thomas wrote. “Instead of simply applying the First Amendment as it was understood by the people who ratified it, the court fashioned its own ‘federal rule’ by balancing the ‘competing values at stake in defamation suits.’ We should not continue to reflexively apply this policy-driven approach to the Constitution.”

Texto completo: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, better known as PETA, is facing extreme backlash over a "cruel" tweet that appears to celebrate the death of Karl Lagerfeld.
Shortly after an announcement that Lagerfeld – the eccentric German designer who was the creative director of Chanel, Fendi and his eponymous fashion line – died early Tuesday, PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk released a statement about her "nemesis. "
"Karl Lagerfeld has gone, and his passing marks the end of an era when fur and exotic skins were seen as covetable. PETA sends condolences to our old nemesis's loved ones," the official Twitter of PETA UK posted less than an hour after his death.

Social media users instantly slammed the animal rights organization as "cold," "disrespectful" and "cruel" for capitalizing on the designer's death with anti-fur campaign commentary.
Twitter users challenged their level of taste ("no class at all"), blasted the group's insensitivity ("respect those who have passed. No matter what they wear") and even compared PETA to the National Rifle Association ("It’s like the NRA of animals. ")
@TheJediVegan said PETA's response was, "a bit cold on the announcement of someone’s passing. Should care for all living beings, whether you agree with them, or like them. "
@DrinkWaterShane agreed: "So y’all can only feel empathy and compassion towards animals. . . . this is just wrong, he literally passed hours ago. "
@CarolinaVictim, who self-identified as a vegetarian, wrote that PETA should be "ashamed of such a low level comment" after "someone just died. " She continued, "Learn to be a little more human and then you can defend your visions. … This is just a cruel/unnecessary tweet for a moment like this. "
"Most ridiculous tweet ever especially since Chanel announced that they were stopping using fur and exotic skin," User @Lt0912 pointed out. The fashion house made the announcement in December, while under the direction of Lagerfeld.
Despite growing backlash, PETA's founder stood by her earlier statement.
"Perhaps you did not realize that I am almost 70, almost of the same generation as Mr. Lagerfeld, and that while I didn’t design it, I wore fur for years. Hence, there is nothing snarky in the remark that those times have passed. Grief, with which I am familiar, is real, and so our condolences for anyone who loved and lost someone are too, regardless of that person’s opposing position on fur," Newkirk said in a statement obtained by Fox News and People.
Newkirk continued: "Slamming PETA expresses the commenters' nastiness: PETA expressed none. "
An unapologetic supporter of fur in fashion (even though he didn't wear it himself), Lagerfeld invited the wrath of PETA, which tried to throw a pie at him at a New York event in 2001. They missed and hit Calvin Klein.
In a 2015 interview with The New York Times, Lagerfeld defended his use of furs and exotic skins: "I think a butcher shop is even worse. It’s like visiting a murder. It’s horrible, no? So I prefer not to know it. "

Texto completo: Actress Mandy Moore is talking more about her marriage to musician Ryan Adams, following a New York Times piece she participated in detailing the singer/songwriter's alleged history of championing aspiring female artists and then manipulating and harassing them.
On Marc Maron’s WTF podcast on Monday afternoon, Moore said their relationship was marred by an “unhealthy dynamic” from the start.
“I was living my life for him. … I had no sense of self,” she told Maron. “I felt like I was drowning. It was so untenable and unsustainable and it was so lonely. I was so sad. I was lonely with him. ”
Moore said she routinely passed on major acting opportunities, fearing how Adams would react of she was away from home too long.
“I would do little jobs. It’s not like I completely stopped working. I would do things here or there, but it became abundantly clear while I was working, things would completely fall apart at home,” she added. “I couldn’t do my job because there was just a constant stream of trying to pay attention to this person who needed me and wouldn’t let me do anything else. ”
"Six months later, I got 'This Is Us. ' "
Moore's interview comes days after musician Phoebe Bridgers went into more detail about her own relationship with Adams.
In the Times piece, the 24-year-old said she and Adams had a whirlwind relationship that ended after he became, as the Times reports, "obsessive and emotionally abusive. "
To the outlet, Adams refuted Bridgers account through his lawyer. He described their relationship as "a brief, consensual fling" and denied her claim he threatened to withhold songs they recorded together.
"It’s been a weird week and I wanted to say a couple things," Bridgers began in an Instagram post shared Saturday, thanking her friends, bands and mother. "They all supported and validated me. They told me that what had happened was (expletive) up and wrong, and that I was right to feel weird about it. I couldn’t have done this without them.
"Ryan had a network too," she continued. "Friends, bands, people he worked with. None of them held him accountable. They told him, by what they said or by what they didn’t, that what he was doing was okay. They validated him. He couldn’t have done this without them. "
Bridgers then made a call for people to point out their friends' out of line behavior.
"Guys, if your friend is acting (expletive) up, call them out. If they’re actually your friend, they’ll listen," she wrote. "That’s the way this all gets better. "
Mandy Moore, Adams' ex-wife who also talked to the Times, praised Bridgers for her post.
"Spot on," the "This Is Us" star commented. "(Heart emoji) you, friend. "
Moore, who was married to Adams from 2009 to 2016, told the Times she empathizes with the women who have accused her ex of exploiting and then stifling female artists' ambitions because she experienced it herself during their marriage.
“Music was a point of control for him,” she told the outlet. “His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time – my entire mid-to-late 20s. "
"What you experience with him – the treatment, the destructive, manic sort of back-and-forth behavior – feels so exclusive,” Moore said. “You feel like there’s no way other people have been treated like this. ”
After the Times story published, Moore posted a message on Instagram about the importance of speaking up.
"Speaking your truth can be painful and triggering but it’s always worth it," she captioned an image of herself used for the Times' story. "My heart is with all women who have suffered any sort of trauma or abuse. You are seen and heard. #sisterhoodforever"
Via Adams' lawyer, he wrote-off Moore's accusations as “completely inconsistent with his view of the relationship,” claiming he applauded her “well-deserved professional success. ”

BIBI TELLS THE TRUTH NETANYAHU'S TWITTER GETS HONEST ABOUT IRAN

Texto completo: Just before a U.S.-sponsored conference that was supposed to be about Iran but isn't, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu changed the subject back again. At the conference in Warsaw, he said, Israel would be meeting in public with Arab foreign ministers "to advance the common interest of war with Iran," according to a tweet from his office.
Yikes. Twitter pounced. Headlines blared. The prime minister's office swiftly erased the tweet and claimed there was a translation error. A new tweet changed "war with Iran" to "combating Iran."
It's tempting to think of this as a blunder. A better way to see Mr. Netanyahu's tweet is as a so-called Kinsley gaffe, named for the editor Michael Kinsley: when a politician accidentally tells the truth.
In other words, Mr. Netanyahu was right the first time. Israel and America's Arab allies are indeed at war with Iran. And despite efforts this week to entice war-weary European allies to join the effort, for Arab and Israeli delegations the conference was a chance to further coordinate their campaign against Iran.
Much of this happened behind closed doors. But in his public speech on Thursday here, Vice President Mike Pence hinted at what was going on. Everyone who spoke at the inaugural banquet, he said, talked about the common threat that Iran posed to the region.
Mr. Pence was referring to two panel discussions moderated by Dennis Ross, a former U.S. diplomat. The first panel featured the foreign ministers of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. When one was asked about Israel's air strikes in Syria, he responded that sovereign states have a right to self-defense, according to two officials in the room.
A decade ago, it would have been unimaginable for any Arab diplomat to defend Israeli strikes in Syria. To this day, these countries do not formally recognize Israel. But Iranian aggression has given old rivals common cause.
None of this is surprising. Israel has been bombing Iranian and Hezbollah positions in Syria for years. The outgoing chief of staff for the Israel Defense Forces openly acknowledged this campaign in an interview last month with Bret Stephens of The New York Times.
After Syria began collapsing in 2011, and Iran's regional campaign became more aggressive, Arab states changed their longstanding practice of staying out of the Israel-Iran war. Now Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates bomb the positions of Iran's Houthi proxies in Yemen. For a few years, Gulf states funded and armed Syrian opposition groups against Iranian, Russian and Syrian regime forces. The Saudis now boast of their own economic war against Iran's financial and oil sectors.
All of this relates to "advancing the common interest of war with Iran." There's no doubt that Netanyahu's remarks made European nations that are still trying to keep Iran in the 2015 nuclear deal uncomfortable. Seizing on this disconnect, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted Mr. Netanyahu's deleted message, adding: "We've always known Netanyahu's illusions. Now, the world -and those attending #WarsawCircus -know, too."
This kind of messaging only works on the uninformed. The Iranians have been waging war in the region, too, whether in Syria, Yemen or through stealthier means in countries such as Bahrain. What's more, they have continued to wage this war after agreeing in 2015 to the nuclear bargain from which the U.S. withdrew last May. Iran's war has even extended to Europe. Last month, the European Union imposed new sanctions against the country over a series of terror plots it said Iran's intelligence service orchestrated in 2015 and 2017.
So it's worth asking which is worse: Mr. Netanyahu accidentally acknowledging the Arab-Israeli war against Iran, or European diplomats pretending Iran is not really at war with them?

Texto completo: Trump has 4 in mind for post at United Nations, sources say
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is considering four people to be his next United Nations ambassador: Goldman Sachs Group partner Dina Powell; the current ambassadors to Canada and Germany, Kelly Craft and Richard Grenell, respectively; and John James, a former Republican Senate candidate from Michigan, according to people familiar with the matter.
The people asked not to be identified because Trump hasn't made a decision. Top White House aides have also discussed nominating Trump's daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump if no front-runner emerges.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert withdrew her nomination to replace Nikki Haley in the job, partly due to issues that arose around a nanny Nauert once employed. The nanny was a legal U.S. immigrant but wasn't authorized to work, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Powell is a veteran of the Trump administration who served as a deputy national security adviser before returning to Goldman Sachs last year. Craft was deeply involved in Trump's renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and is married to Joe Craft, a billionaire Republican fundraiser and executive at coal producer Alliance Resource Partners.
Grenell manages the U.S. relationship with the German government, which has grown tense because of a variety of conflicts, including the president's consideration of tariffs on imported cars.
James fell short in an attempt to unseat Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow last year.

No plan for Smollett to do follow-up police interview
CHICAGO - Attorneys for "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans Monday for him to meet with Chicago detectives for a follow-up interview that police have requested about his reported assault.
Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers. She said in an emailed statement that his lawyers "will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."
Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in "MAGA Country."
Police said Saturday that the investigation had "shifted" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.
Smollett's lawyers said the actor feels "victimized" by reports that he played a role in the assault.

New York City guidelines take aim at hairstyle discrimination
NEW YORK - New York City doesn't want people to have their hairstyles held against them, and it unveiled novel guidelines Monday against hairdo discrimination.
The new legal guidance says the city's existing human rights law protects New Yorkers' right to "maintain natural hair or hairstyles that are closely associated with their racial, ethnic or cultural identities."
The New York Times reported that they are believed to be the first such measure nationwide.
In effect, the guidance enables people to seek fines and other remedies if they've been harassed or punished in workplaces, schools or public spaces because of their hair texture or style. Hair nets, ties and the like can still be required for health and safety reasons.

Roger Stone posts photo of judge with cross-hairs symbol
NEW YORK - Roger Stone criticized the federal judge overseeing his criminal case on Monday, blasting her as a partisan appointee of President Barack Obama and posting a photo of her face featuring what appeared to be a cross-hairs symbol.
The embattled confidant to President Donald Trump posted the picture of Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Instagram but quickly deleted it after the New York Daily News asked him about the apparent rifle scope symbol in the left hand corner.
Stone, who was indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation last month, claimed he "didn't notice the symbol" on the photo that he said he got off the Internet.
Stone deleted the photo and replaced it with one cropping out the cross-hairs.

Mexico to close infamous island penal colony
MEXICO CITY - Mexico will close a famed island penal colony off the country's Pacific coast and convert it into a cultural and environmental education center, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Monday.
The federal prison on the largest of the Islas Marias will release about 200 of its approximately 600 inmates and the rest will be relocated to other prisons.
The prison founded in 1905 on Maria Madre passed through periods of infamous brutality. When Panama closed its Isla Coiba penal colony in 2004, Isla Marias was the last one remaining in the Americas.
He noted that the last riot there occurred in 2003 because it was over capacity. At that time there were 8,000 prisoners there, he said.
The island is about 70 miles off the coast of Nayarit state.

Oakland Diocese names 45 accused of sexual abuse
OAKLAND, Calif. - The Catholic Diocese of Oakland has released the names of 45 priests, deacons and religious brothers who officials say are "credibly accused" of sexually abusing minors.
The San Francisco Chronicle said Monday that Oakland's list goes back to 1962 - when the diocese was founded. None of the men are currently in the ministry. Of the 45 people named, 20 were priests.
Oakland is the latest in a series of dioceses across the country to release names amid a scandal involving pedophile priests and decades of church cover-ups.
Most of the listed abuse dates from the 1960s into the 1980s. Diocese officials say there have been no credible accusations of abuse since 1988, but acknowledge that the list may grow in the coming months.

In Bolivia: A passenger bus crashed head-on with a dump truck in southern Bolivia on Monday, killing at least 24 people and injuring 12 more, police said.
The accident occurred in a dense fog about 135 miles south of the capital, La Paz. Two buses collided on the same highway in January, killing 22 people.

In Britain: British border officials have picked up 34 people thought to be migrants who were trying to cross the English Channel in a small boat. The Home Office said their nationalities were unknown, but they were taken ashore for interviews Monday while three men were arrested for suspected immigration offenses.

Texto completo: Trump has 4 in mind for post at United Nations, sources say
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is considering four people to be his next United Nations ambassador: Goldman Sachs Group partner Dina Powell; the current ambassadors to Canada and Germany, Kelly Craft and Richard Grenell, respectively; and John James, a former Republican Senate candidate from Michigan, according to people familiar with the matter.
The people asked not to be identified because Trump hasn't made a decision. Top White House aides have also discussed nominating Trump's daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump if no front-runner emerges.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert withdrew her nomination to replace Nikki Haley in the job, partly due to issues that arose around a nanny Nauert once employed. The nanny was a legal U.S. immigrant but wasn't authorized to work, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Powell is a veteran of the Trump administration who served as a deputy national security adviser before returning to Goldman Sachs last year. Craft was deeply involved in Trump's renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and is married to Joe Craft, a billionaire Republican fundraiser and executive at coal producer Alliance Resource Partners.
Grenell manages the U.S. relationship with the German government, which has grown tense because of a variety of conflicts, including the president's consideration of tariffs on imported cars.
James fell short in an attempt to unseat Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow last year.

No plan for Smollett to do follow-up police interview
CHICAGO - Attorneys for "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans Monday for him to meet with Chicago detectives for a follow-up interview that police have requested about his reported assault.
Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers. She said in an emailed statement that his lawyers "will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."
Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in "MAGA Country."
Police said Saturday that the investigation had "shifted" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.
Smollett's lawyers said the actor feels "victimized" by reports that he played a role in the assault.

New York City guidelines take aim at hairstyle discrimination
NEW YORK - New York City doesn't want people to have their hairstyles held against them, and it unveiled novel guidelines Monday against hairdo discrimination.
The new legal guidance says the city's existing human rights law protects New Yorkers' right to "maintain natural hair or hairstyles that are closely associated with their racial, ethnic or cultural identities."
The New York Times reported that they are believed to be the first such measure nationwide.
In effect, the guidance enables people to seek fines and other remedies if they've been harassed or punished in workplaces, schools or public spaces because of their hair texture or style. Hair nets, ties and the like can still be required for health and safety reasons.

Roger Stone posts photo of judge with cross-hairs symbol
NEW YORK - Roger Stone criticized the federal judge overseeing his criminal case on Monday, blasting her as a partisan appointee of President Barack Obama and posting a photo of her face featuring what appeared to be a cross-hairs symbol.
The embattled confidant to President Donald Trump posted the picture of Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Instagram but quickly deleted it after the New York Daily News asked him about the apparent rifle scope symbol in the left hand corner.
Stone, who was indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation last month, claimed he "didn't notice the symbol" on the photo that he said he got off the Internet.
Stone deleted the photo and replaced it with one cropping out the cross-hairs.

Mexico to close infamous island penal colony
MEXICO CITY - Mexico will close a famed island penal colony off the country's Pacific coast and convert it into a cultural and environmental education center, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Monday.
The federal prison on the largest of the Islas Marias will release about 200 of its approximately 600 inmates and the rest will be relocated to other prisons.
The prison founded in 1905 on Maria Madre passed through periods of infamous brutality. When Panama closed its Isla Coiba penal colony in 2004, Isla Marias was the last one remaining in the Americas.
He noted that the last riot there occurred in 2003 because it was over capacity. At that time there were 8,000 prisoners there, he said.
The island is about 70 miles off the coast of Nayarit state.

Oakland Diocese names 45 accused of sexual abuse
OAKLAND, Calif. - The Catholic Diocese of Oakland has released the names of 45 priests, deacons and religious brothers who officials say are "credibly accused" of sexually abusing minors.
The San Francisco Chronicle said Monday that Oakland's list goes back to 1962 - when the diocese was founded. None of the men are currently in the ministry. Of the 45 people named, 20 were priests.
Oakland is the latest in a series of dioceses across the country to release names amid a scandal involving pedophile priests and decades of church cover-ups.
Most of the listed abuse dates from the 1960s into the 1980s. Diocese officials say there have been no credible accusations of abuse since 1988, but acknowledge that the list may grow in the coming months.

Texto completo: The producers of the Academy Awards are conceding that despite hopes otherwise, this Sunday's telecast will run more than three hours. Meanwhile, the Motion Picture Academy separately announced that Bette Midler and Queen will perform and recent Grammy winner Kacey Musgraves will present at the ceremony.
"We were hired to deliver a shortened show," said Donna Gigliotti, co-producer with Massapequa Park native Glenn Weiss, in a New York Times story published Sunday.  "How do we do that so you're not seeing award, award, commercial, award, commercial, award? So boring."
Yet after the Academy reversed course on Friday and said four categories consigned to commercial breaks would return to the live show, the organization asked her if the telecast could still be contained with three hours. "The answer was no," Gigliotti said.
She had hoped the Academy's decision to forego a host -- after Kevin Hart resigned following past homophobic tweets and jokes for which he has apologized -- would have presented a way to end the show by 11 p.m., when viewership drops off significantly. She said the show at least would begin presenting awards sooner than usual without the need to allot time to a host's opening monologue or sketch.
Eight people from outside the movie industry are being brought in to lead presentations about certain films, the Times said. Tennis champion Serena Williams will address last year's remake of "A Star Is Born," one of eight films vying for best picture. No other outsiders were named.
Meanwhile, the British band Queen, now fronted by the late Freddie Mercury's stand-in, Adam Lambert, will perform on the show. The biopic of Mercury is a best-picture nominee.
On Saturday, Midler tweeted. "So, (drum roll) Ladies and Gentlemen, I will be chanteusing (that's singing) on the Oscars on Feb 24...the nominated song from 'Mary Poppins [Returns]' ... 'The Place Where Lost Things Go' ...so excited!!" The singer-actress has won Tony, Grammy and Emmy Awards and been nominated twice for an Oscar.
The same day, country singer Kacey Musgraves, who won four Grammy Awards this year, including album of the year, tweeted a link to a news story reporting that she will present an award.
"The 91st Academy Awards" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on

Texto completo: Lee Radziwill
NEW YORK - Lee Radziwill, the stylish jet setter and socialite who found friends, lovers and other adventures worldwide while bonding and competing with her sister Jacqueline Kennedy, has died. She was 85.
Anna Christina Radziwill told The New York Times her mother died Friday of what she described as natural causes. The Associated Press left messages Saturday and Sunday for the family.
The husky-voiced Radziwill shared her older sister's affinity for fashion and globe-trotting, as well as her dark, wide-set eyes and high cheekbones. They were confidantes as young women, and Radziwill was a frequent guest at the White House during President John F. Kennedy's administration. She was with the president when he made a trip to London in 1961, and Kennedy was godfather to Radziwill's daughter, Anna Christina.
The Kennedys and Radziwills spent Christmases together in Palm Beach, Fla., and the sisters traveled to India and Pakistan.
But tensions emerged after Kennedy's assassination, in 1963.
Radziwill had worried that her brother-in-law's ascent would overshadow her and told Gloria Steinem for a McCall's magazine interview that her life during the JFK years was "so limited, so ... jet-set, empty, cold, and not true."
In 1968, Jackie wed the Greek billionaire Aristotle Onassis, whom Lee herself had once thought of marrying, only to have her sister urge her not to. Friends would say Radziwill felt betrayed and never entirely forgave Jackie.
Radziwill's life apart from her sister was eventful enough. She married a prince, Stanislas Radziwill, of Poland, and had two children, Anthony and Anna Christina.
It seemed at times that tragedy followed tragedy. In the aftermath of the death of her beloved nephew, John F. Kennedy Jr., on July 16, 1999, her own son died of cancer less than a month later, on Aug. 10, at age 40. Anthony Radziwill had been the best man at Kennedy's wedding.

WARRIORS' WELTS ATTENDS ALL-STAR WEEKEND IN N.C.

Texto completo: CHARLOTTE, N.C. >> Rick Welts, the Warriors' president/chief operating officer and the NBA's most prominent openly gay executive, attended NBA All-Star weekend after having initial reservations because of North Carolina's anti-LGBTQ law.
USA Today first reported the news.
Welts did not attend Sunday's All-Star game, but he was here for All-Star weekend on Friday and Saturday.
Welts' participation in All-Star weekend here is notable for two reasons.
As a former high-ranking NBA executive, Welts created the concept of NBA All-Star weekend in 1984. That morphed into a star-studded event that grew to include the Slam Dunk Contest and the 3-point shootout.
Second, the NBA had relocated its All-Star Game in 2017 from Charlotte to New Orleans because of a bill that required transgender people to use restrooms, locker rooms or showers in government buildings and schools that matched their biological sex, and not their gender identity. Welts publicly announced in a New York Times article in 2011 that he is gay.
The view of the league office and many others, (is the bill) "discriminated against the LGBTQ community," NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a press conference Saturday. "We then made a decision that it was inconsistent with the values of this league to play the All-Star Game here under those circumstances."
North Carolina has since replaced that law with HB142, which allows transgender people to use a bathroom or other facility that identifies with their gender. But local governments still cannot offer protections for any transgender people.
"For many people, it didn't go far enough, and I'm sympathetic to those who feel that there are still not appropriate protections for the LGBTQ community," he said. "But I also felt from a league standpoint it was important, and as part of our core values, to work with people and ultimately to move forward with the community."
 Honorary All-Stars Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade checked into the game with 58 seconds left in the first quarter.
Nowitzki splashed a 3-pointer from the right wing on his first offensive possession, and drained another from the left wing on the subsequent possession, giving Team Giannis a 53-37 advantage entering the second quarter. He added a third at the 9-minute mark in the second quarter and scored nine points on 3-of-3 shooting in 3:58 in the opening half.
 The 2019 slam dunk contest at the NBA's All-Star weekend involved several props, but it was Hamidou Diallo's decision to abandon one that created the dunk that everyone will remember from Saturday night's competition.
Diallo, a rookie shooting guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder, initially rolled a ball rack onto the court for his second attempt of the first round. He decided that wasn't right, so he asked "the biggest person in the building" to step into the lane instead. What ensued was a remarkable display of athleticism and creativity. After running up and going into a deep crouch, Diallo exploded into the air, leaping over Shaquille O'Neal, the 7-foot-1 Hall of Fame center, clearing the big man's head, and finishing the dunk with his hand plunged deep inside the basket.
The dunk, which received a perfect score of 50 from the judges, managed to be an homage to two of the best dunks of Vince Carter's career. Carter notoriously jumped over the head of Frederic Weis in the middle of a game at the 2000 Olympics and he hung from his elbow after finishing one of his dunks on his way to a win in the 2000 dunk contest.
Diallo went on to beat Dennis Smith Jr. of the New York Knicks in the finals to be crowned the 2019 slam dunk contest champion.
 When NBA Commissioner Adam Silver thinks about parity in professional sports, he sees the NFL as the gold standard. But he can't help but chuckle that the New England Patriots are such a constant presence in the Super Bowl.
For the last four seasons the Warriors and Cavaliers have met in the Finals. That will change this year the Cavaliers without LeBron James are one of the NBA's worst teams. But the Warriors seem poised to head back to the Finals for a fifth straight year.
"If you look at the last, I think, 11 years, we've had seven different teams win championships," Silver said Saturday. "But if you look back to the first 60 years of this league, I think three teams the Lakers, Celtics, and the Bulls won 60 percent of all championships. So, progress."

Texto completo: Actress Mandy Moore is talking more about her marriage to musician Ryan Adams, following a New York Times piece she participated in detailing the singer/songwriter's alleged history of championing aspiring female artists and then manipulating and harassing them.
On Marc Maron’s WTF podcast on Monday afternoon, Moore said their relationship was marred by an “unhealthy dynamic” from the start.
“I was living my life for him. … I had no sense of self,” she told Maron. “I felt like I was drowning. It was so untenable and unsustainable and it was so lonely. I was so sad. I was lonely with him. ”
Moore said she routinely passed on major acting opportunities, fearing how Adams would react of she was away from home too long.
“I would do little jobs. It’s not like I completely stopped working. I would do things here or there, but it became abundantly clear while I was working, things would completely fall apart at home,” she added. “I couldn’t do my job because there was just a constant stream of trying to pay attention to this person who needed me and wouldn’t let me do anything else. ”
"Six months later, I got 'This Is Us. ' "
Moore's interview comes days after musician Phoebe Bridgers went into more detail about her own relationship with Adams.
In the Times piece, the 24-year-old said she and Adams had a whirlwind relationship that ended after he became, as the Times reports, "obsessive and emotionally abusive. "
To the outlet, Adams refuted Bridgers account through his lawyer. He described their relationship as "a brief, consensual fling" and denied her claim he threatened to withhold songs they recorded together.
"It’s been a weird week and I wanted to say a couple things," Bridgers began in an Instagram post shared Saturday, thanking her friends, bands and mother. "They all supported and validated me. They told me that what had happened was (expletive) up and wrong, and that I was right to feel weird about it. I couldn’t have done this without them.
"Ryan had a network too," she continued. "Friends, bands, people he worked with. None of them held him accountable. They told him, by what they said or by what they didn’t, that what he was doing was okay. They validated him. He couldn’t have done this without them. "
Bridgers then made a call for people to point out their friends' out of line behavior.
"Guys, if your friend is acting (expletive) up, call them out. If they’re actually your friend, they’ll listen," she wrote. "That’s the way this all gets better. "
Mandy Moore, Adams' ex-wife who also talked to the Times, praised Bridgers for her post.
"Spot on," the "This Is Us" star commented. "(Heart emoji) you, friend. "
Moore, who was married to Adams from 2009 to 2016, told the Times she empathizes with the women who have accused her ex of exploiting and then stifling female artists' ambitions because she experienced it herself during their marriage.
“Music was a point of control for him,” she told the outlet. “His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time – my entire mid-to-late 20s. "
"What you experience with him – the treatment, the destructive, manic sort of back-and-forth behavior – feels so exclusive,” Moore said. “You feel like there’s no way other people have been treated like this. ”
After the Times story published, Moore posted a message on Instagram about the importance of speaking up.
"Speaking your truth can be painful and triggering but it’s always worth it," she captioned an image of herself used for the Times' story. "My heart is with all women who have suffered any sort of trauma or abuse. You are seen and heard. #sisterhoodforever"
Via Adams' lawyer, he wrote-off Moore's accusations as “completely inconsistent with his view of the relationship,” claiming he applauded her “well-deserved professional success. ”

Texto completo: BY JOSEPH PISANI
The Associated Press
NEW YORK - In early November, word began to leak that Amazon was serious about choosing New York to build a giant new campus. The city was eager to lure the company and its thousands of high-paying tech jobs, offering billions in tax incentives and lighting the Empire State Building in Amazon orange.
Even Governor Andrew Cuomo got in on the action: "I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes," he joked at the time.
Then Amazon made it official: It chose the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens to build a $2.5 billion campus that could house 25,000 workers, in addition to new offices planned for northern Virginia. Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Democrats who have been political adversaries for years, trumpeted the decision as a major coup after edging out more than 230 other proposals.
But what they didn't expect was the protests, the hostile public hearings and the disparaging tweets that would come in the next three months, eventually leading to Amazon's dramatic Valentine's Day breakup with New York.
Immediately after Amazon's
Nov. 12 announcement, criticism started to pour in. The deal included $1.5 billion in special tax breaks and grants for the company, but a closer look at the total package revealed it to be worth at least $2.8 billion. Some of the same politicians who had signed a letter to woo Amazon were now balking at the tax incentives.
"Offering massive corporate welfare from scarce public resources to one of the wealthiest corporations in the world at a time of great need in our state is just wrong," said New York State Sen. Michael Gianaris and New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, Democrats who represent the Long Island City area, in a joint statement.
The next day, CEO Jeff Bezos was on the cover of The New York Post in a cartoon-like illustration, hanging out of a helicopter, holding money bags in each hand, with cash billowing above the skyline. "QUEENS RANSOM," the headline screamed. The New York Times editorial board, meanwhile, called the deal a "bad bargain" for the city: "We won't know for 10 years whether the promised 25,000 jobs will materialize," it said.
Anti-Amazon rallies were planned for the next week. Protesters stormed a New York Amazon bookstore on the day after Thanksgiving and then went to a rally on the steps of a courthouse near the site of the new headquarters in the pouring rain. Some held cardboard boxes with Amazon's smile logo turned upside down.
They had a long list of grievances: the deal was done secretively; Amazon, one of the world's most valuable companies, didn't need nearly
$3 billion in tax incentives; rising rents could push people out of the neighborhood; and the company was opposed to unionization.
The helipad kept coming up, too: Amazon, in its deal with the city, was promised it could build a spot to land a helicopter on or near the new offices.
At the first public hearing in December, which turned into a hostile, three-hour interrogation of two Amazon executives by city lawmakers, the helipad was mentioned more than a dozen times. The image of high-paid executives buzzing by a nearby low-income housing project became a symbol of corporate greed.
Queens residents soon found postcards from Amazon in their mailboxes, trumpeting the benefits of the project. Gianaris sent his own version, calling the company "Scamazon" and urging people to call Bezos and tell him to stay in Seattle.
At a second city council hearing in January, Amazon's vice president for public policy, Brian Huseman, subtly suggested that perhaps the company's decision to come to New York could be reversed.
"We want to invest in a community that wants us," he said.
Then came a sign that Amazon's opponents might actually succeed in derailing the deal: In early February, Gianaris was tapped for a seat on a little-known state panel that often has to approve state funding for big economic development projects. That meant if Amazon's deal went before the board, Gianaris could kill it.
"I'm not looking to negotiate a better deal," Gianaris said at the time. "I am against the deal that has been proposed."
Cuomo had the power to block Gianaris' appointment, but he didn't indicate whether he would take that step.
Meanwhile, Amazon's own doubts about the project started to show. On Feb. 8, The Washington Post reported that the company was having second thoughts about the Queens location.
On Wednesday, Cuomo brokered a meeting with four top Amazon executives and the leaders of three unions critical of the deal. The union leaders walked away with the impression that the parties had an agreed upon framework for further negotiations, said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union.
"We had a good conversation. We talked about next steps. We shook hands," Appelbaum said.
An Amazon representative did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
The final blow landed Thursday, when Amazon announced on a blog post that it was backing out, surprising the mayor, who had spoken to an Amazon executive Monday night and received "no indication" that the company would bail.
Amazon still expected the deal to be approved, according to a source familiar with Amazon's thinking, but that the constant criticism from politicians didn't make sense for the company to grow there.
"I was flabbergasted," De Blasio said. "Why on earth after all of the effort we all put in would you simply walk away?"

McCarrick's rise began as altar boy

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Former cardinal Theodore McCarrick's rise through the Catholic Church hierarchy, during which he established a reputation as a globe-trotting human rights advocate before being brought down by sex abuse scandals, began as an altar boy in New York City.
McCarrick, who recently became the highest-ranking cleric to be defrocked by the Vatican, worked his way up over several decades to the highest circles of church leadership, despite awareness among the hierarchy of his suspect behavior, including sleeping with adult seminarians.
McCarrick's past finally caught up with him last summer, when Pope Francis removed him as a cardinal after a U.S. church investigation determined that an allegation that he had fondled a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible. The church also acknowledged that it had made previously undisclosed financial settlements with adults who accused McCarrick of sexual misconduct decades ago.
On Saturday, the Vatican announced that McCarrick, known within church circles as "Uncle Ted," had been defrocked after officials found him guilty of soliciting sex while hearing confession and of sexual crimes against minors and adults.
The move punctuated a stunning fall from grace for the 88-year-old, who was ordained as a priest in 1958, became a bishop in 1981 and was named Archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, in 1986. In November 2000, he was tapped by Pope John Paul II to lead the Archdiocese of Washington.
"I wish I were a holier man, more prayerful, more trusting in God, wiser and courageous," The New York Times quoted McCarrick as saying upon his appointment. "But here I am, with all my faults and all my needs, and we will work together."
That same month, a New York priest, the Rev. Boniface Ramsay, informed the Vatican in a letter about McCarrick's misconduct with seminarians from Seton Hall University's Immaculate Conception Seminary. Ramsay, who was on the faculty at the seminary, has said he sent the letter at the request of the then-Vatican ambassador because he had heard so many complaints from students.
Nevertheless, just weeks after his formal installation as archbishop, McCarrick was elevated to the rank of cardinal, shortly after President Bill Clinton had presented him with the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights.
The son of a ship captain who died when McCarrick was 3, the disgraced cleric attended Catholic elementary school and Fordham Preparatory School and was ordained after earning bachelor's and master's degrees at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York. He later earned a Ph.D. in sociology from The Catholic University of America in Washington, where he was given his first assignment as assistant chaplain and went on to serve as dean of students and director of development.
McCarrick later served as president of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, personal secretary to Cardinal Terence Cooke and auxiliary bishop of New York.
From 1986 through 2006, during his years as archbishop in Newark and Washington, McCarrick was one of the most influential church leaders in the U.S. McCarrick, who speaks five languages, twice headed the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration and traveled frequently overseas on trips devoted to human rights and foreign policy.
McCarrick was also a major fundraiser for the Catholic Church.
McCarrick participated in the 2005 conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI, presided over the graveside service for U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy at Arlington National Cemetery in 2009, and celebrated Mass with Pope Francis during his 2015 visit to Washington.

Everything you need to know about 'Hamilton' in Cincinnati

Texto completo: It's here. Finally.
More than two years after the Broadway in Cincinnati series announced it would bring "Hamilton: An American Musical" to the Aronoff Center, it opens Feb. 19.
The show was an unlikely hit. Consider that its central character is Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first Secretary of the Treasury. Add to that its hip-hop influence and what some refer to as its "color-conscious casting" – non-white actors appearing in the roles of Revolutionary War-era characters like George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette – and you have a show that, on paper, was curious, at best.
But when it hit the stage, it was mammoth hit, the stuff of Broadway legend.
Audiences were gaga for it. And so were investors. Soon after it opened, The New York Times called it "a billion-dollar show." Within a year after it opened on Broadway, "Hamilton" was returning an estimated $600,000 in weekly profits. In November 2016, it became the first Broadway show to top $3 million in ticket sales for an eight-performance week. That's about the time the producers raised the top ticket price to $849.
TICKETS Here in Cincinnati, the show has been mostly sold out for more than a year. But there is still hope. Here's how:
There are still tickets available online. Nearly 400 as this is being written. They're not cheap, though. An example. As of Tuesday afternoon, there were a few seats left for the evening performance on Feb. 26. They're good ones – in the center section of the Aronoff's orchestra seating. They cost $498.75, plus a $23 service fee. If you had bought them a year ago, they were nearly $300 less. But because of "dynamic pricing," the price has increased as the supply has been reduced. There are cheaper ones for that same performance, as well, as low as $168.75 plus an $18.50 fee.
But there are cheaper tickets out there. Or there will be, at least.
The show's producers have set up a lottery offering $10 tickets for every performance. There are 40 for each show. But you have to register ahead. You can use the official "Hamilton" app or register on a computer.
Find the lottery guidelines here: cincinnati.broadway.com/
hamiltonticketfaq.
NOTE: Be very careful about purchasing tickets from third-party vendors. For one thing, they will almost certainly be much more expensive. And, they may be fraudulent. Read more about that here: cincinnatiarts.org/events/official-
ticket-source.
HEAR "HAMILTON" FOR FREE You don't have to wait for the show to open. You can hear it now – for free.
We're not advocating piracy. But there are plenty of legal ways to hear it without having to pay. Here are a few:
Hoopla – Most public library systems in Greater Cincinnati are affiliated with Hoopla. You can either link to the site through your library's website or you can go directly to Hoopladigital.com. Just have your library card and library password handy.
The Internet Archive – This is a nonprofit digital library. Just go to the website – Archive.org – and search for "Hamilton." And then start listening.
Spotify – Sign up for a free account, launch the Spotify web player and search for "Hamilton."
Soundcloud – Go to the website – soundcloud.com – search for "Hamilton" and click play.
If all you want are the show's lyrics, head over to atlanticrecords.com/HamiltonMusic. There are all sorts of other extras to indulge in while you're there.
LOCAL CONNECTIONS There aren't many local connections to this particular production of "Hamilton." But there are a couple you might want to know about.
First, there is choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler. He's a Cincinnati native who went to Nativity School in Pleasant Ridge and graduated from St. Xavier High School.
He won't be on the stage here, but his Tony Award-winning choreography will be.
You will see College-Conservatory of Music graduate Stephanie Jae Park, though. Local theatergoers may remember her as Cosette in CCM's very fine 2014 production of "Les Misérables." She is a standby for several of the show's principal roles.
WHY ALEXANDER HAMILTON? Why do a musical about this guy? Until the show came along, most of us didn't know much about Alexander Hamilton except that he was the guy pictured on the $10 bill.
In some ways, his is a story made for this particular moment in American history, a time where the word "immigrant" has become an epithet.
Alexander Hamilton was not a native-born American. He was born on the island of Nevis in what was then known as the British West Indies.
Yet from the moment he arrived in New York in his late teens, he scrambled his way up with social and political ladders of what was still a British colony.
But there was still no shortage of resentfulness about him, not the least of which because he was, as Aaron Burr sings at one point, a "bastard, orphan, son of a whore." History is unclear on the last part of that description. But the first part is absolutely correct.
By the time he was killed in a duel with Burr in 1804, he had built a legacy that continues to have an impact on American life and culture. Among his accomplishments, he:
was a representative to the Constitutional Convention
was elected to the Continental Congress
was a signatory of the U.S. Constitution
wrote the majority of "The Federalist Papers"
established the U.S. Mint
credited as the architect of the U.S. capitalist economy
If you go
What: "Hamilton: An American Musical"
When: Feb. 19-March 10
Where: Procter & Gamble Hall, Aronoff Center, 650 Walnut St., Downtown.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It started on a whim: Sam Sifton, the food editor of The New York Times (and my boss), added a paragraph to his cooking newsletter saying that, actually, you really didn't need a recipe to make dinner, offering the outlines of a meal you could pull together that night.
This was back in 2014, when we were preparing to launch NYT Cooking, a new venture for The Times built on our vast archive of recipes, thousands upon thousands of them. At the office, we often refer to recipes as the atoms of NYT Cooking, the stuff from which everything else is made.
But here Sam had introduced something else -- not quite a recipe, but something that carried culinary wisdom and know-how, a promise to our readers that if they went along for the ride, they would flourish in the kitchen.
These no-recipe recipes -- which offer cooking ideas, but no ingredient lists or steps -- invite you to wing it, to play around, to tailor a recipe to your tastes. It's something confident cooks do all the time, and yet cooks of any skill level can learn it. (A grilled cheese sandwich can be a superb no-recipe recipe.)
Readers loved the no-recipe recipes, writing to say that they wanted to be able to collect and save them. The NYT Cooking site didn't yet have that functionality, but eventually -- also on a whim -- we asked one of our editors, Mark Josephson, to grab the no-recipe recipes from each Wednesday newsletter and save them in one spot, just in case. Someday we might do something with them?
Years passed. Then one morning, Sam and I were at our desks spinning out story ideas, and somehow the no-recipe recipes came up. Mark was still saving them every week, in a giant running file. We had them! Should we -- do something with them?
From that point, the idea found its form quickly: We would narrow the very long file down to the strongest ideas and partner with the art directors Fred Bierman and Wayne Kamidoi on a special section of the newspaper, a 44-page, full-color tabloid cookbook: "You Don't Need a Recipe."
In it you'll find quick-broiled pork chops, a chicken dish spiked with chiles de árbol, fettuccine twirled with ricotta and mint and smashed potatoes adorned with bacon and greens.
For print editors accustomed to black-and-white on a weekday, this was nirvana. The Food department's photo editor, Kim Gougenheim, commissioned extraordinary photography from David Malosh and the food stylist Simon Andrews. We worked with the NYT Cooking team to publish the no-recipe recipes online so that they can be searched and saved, and the designer Umi Syam created a fun, browsable online presentation.
Sam writes a lot of newsletters -- several thousand words a month of recipes and prose. And he still writes those weekly no-recipe recipes, of course. Sometimes he zooms off at the end of the workday with the words, spoken not uncheerfully, "I'm going home to cook." Occasionally he seems to only have a vague idea of what that meal will be, and faith that it will be good to eat. On the following Wednesday, you'll find it in your inbox.

Allegations Cloud North Carolina Race Months After Vote

Texto completo: More than three months after an election that might have been tainted by fraud -- and more than six weeks after the new Congress convened without a representative from North Carolina's Ninth Congressional District -- state regulators are scheduled to meet on Monday to consider evidence of possible misconduct.
The hearing, which could prompt the State Board of Elections to order a new vote in the district, may last until Wednesday and could include dozens of witnesses. Congress, which has the constitutional authority to determine its membership, will be watching closely.
Here's a guide to where things stand ahead of Monday's hearing.
There's still an undecided election from the midterms?
The midterms -- at least in the Ninth District, which includes part of Charlotte and a vast, rural swath of southeastern North Carolina -- have not ended, and a House seat that Republicans have held since 1963 is still at stake.
At first, it seemed that the Republicans' grip on the seat would continue: Mark Harris, the Republican nominee, took a 905-vote lead over his Democratic rival, Dan McCready. But state officials refused to certify Mr. Harris as the victor because of concerns about election fraud and, in particular, the conduct of L. McCrae Dowless Jr., a contractor for the Harris campaign.
What kind of fraud might have happened?
The principal concern involves absentee ballot harvesting -- when a ballot is collected and mailed by someone who is not the voter or, in some instances, a close relative -- and how Mr. Dowless and his associates may have relied on the tactic during their work for Mr. Harris. Although ballot harvesting is allowed in some states, it is illegal in North Carolina.
Allegations have also been raised about absentee ballot tampering and that elections officials in Bladen County, where absentee-by-mail statistics helped stir suspicions about fraud, may have aided Mr. Dowless.
Who is L. McCrae Dowless Jr.?
A prolific political operative in Bladen County, Mr. Dowless has long been a go-to contractor for Democratic and Republican candidates, especially in state and local races. He has also run for, and won, elected office himself, and his party loyalties have sometimes shifted. Over almost 15 years, according to state records, Mr. Dowless has gone from being a registered Democrat to unaffiliated to Democrat to unaffiliated to Republican.
He has a criminal record that includes convictions for perjury and insurance fraud, and he previously drew scrutiny, but not prosecution, for his political work. Mr. Harris acknowledged in December that, despite Mr. Dowless's controversial history, he had directed his hiring as a contractor. But Mr. Harris maintained that he "had no reason to think that what he was doing was illegal."
Mr. Dowless declined repeated requests for an interview with The New York Times and, through his lawyer, also refused to meet with state investigators. He could speak this week, though: Both the Harris and McCready campaigns identified him as a possible witness for the evidentiary hearing. He has not been charged with wrongdoing in connection to the 2018 election.
What's the standard to trigger a new election?
North Carolina law gives the elections board the power to order a new vote if it finds that "irregularities or improprieties occurred to such an extent that they taint the results of the entire election and cast doubt on its fairness."
But there is no firm guideline for when a disputed election meets that threshold. The state board has five members -- three Democrats and two Republicans -- and it takes four members to call a new election.
What does Mark Harris think should happen?
His position, like his opponent's, is about what you would expect.
Mr. Harris's campaign, in a brief to the elections board, argued that the state should certify the Republican nominee as the winner and that a new election would not be appropriate.
"Because the voter's intent is key, any alleged ballot harvesting, standing alone, does not weigh in favor of a new election," Mr. Harris's lawyers wrote. "To be sure, absentee-by-mail ballot harvesting is illegal, and it should be referred to prosecutors for appropriate action."
"But illegality in transmission is not necessarily indicative of invalidity of substance," the campaign added. "Without evidence to show that the contents of ballots sufficient in number to change the outcome of the election were tampered with, any illegality in how they were delivered should be immaterial to the Board's decision making."
And what does Dan McCready want to happen?
In its own brief to the elections board, Mr. McCready's campaign called for a new vote and accused Mr. Harris's campaign of hiring Mr. Dowless because of his "proven history of generating a strikingly high, and downright suspicious, share of absentee-by-mail votes."
"Though the full scope of fraudulent activity may never be known, the record makes clear that the results of the entire election are tainted, and its fairness is in doubt," the McCready campaign wrote. "Moreover, the Harris campaign should have known it was benefiting from fraud, and there is strong evidence that they did know and that local election officials aided the scheme."
Will there be criminal charges?
Maybe, but they will not be heard or adjudicated during this week's elections board proceedings. The board can send any findings to prosecutors, some of whom have already been investigating irregularities, for possible charges.
Does the Ninth District have a vote in the House right now?
No. Representative Robert M. Pittenger, who lost a Republican primary to Mr. Harris last May, left power when the new Congress took office in early January, and the Ninth District's seat has been empty ever since. Although no House vote this year has been close enough that a single member's decision would have changed the outcome, the Ninth has been without representation as dozens of matters have gone before the House.
So when will Congress do something about all of this? Can it?
Under the Constitution, the House is "the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members," and Congress could eventually determine that November's balloting was compromised.
A formal refusal by Congress to seat a prospective member from the Ninth District would lead to a new election, but it is unclear whether the House would take such a step if the state elections board certified a winner.

Texto completo: PORTLAND — Portland Stage, 25A Forest Ave., will present the world premiere of “The Half-Light” by Monica Wood from Feb. 26 through March 24.
A chance encounter presents a tantalizing question for a college secretary: Can anyone be trained to see the dead? Her dogged pursuit of an answer leads to a far more earthbound challenge when a colleague is felled by grief. A heartwarming drama about love and purpose that examines the ghosts that live within us all. “The Half-Light” was developed as part of the 2018 Little Festival of the Unexpected at Portland Stage.
Monica Wood is a novelist, memoirist and playwright. Her most recent novel, “The One-in-a-Million Boy,” has been published in 22 languages in 30 countries and won a 2017 Nautilus Award (Gold) and the New England Society Book Award. She is also the author of “When We Were the Kennedys,” a New England bestseller, Oprah magazine summer-reading pick, and winner of the May Sarton Memoir Award and the 2016 Maine Literary Award. Her novel “Any Bitter Thing” was an ABA bestseller and Book Sense Top Ten pick. Her other fiction includes “Ernie’s Ark,” which has been excerpted on NPR’s “Selected Shorts” and selected by several towns and cities as their “One Book, One Community” read; “My Only Story,” a finalist for the Kate Chopin Award; and “Secret Language,” her first novel. Her widely anthologized short stories have won a Pushcart Prize and been featured on public radio.
Wood also writes books for writers and teachers. Her nonfiction has appeared in Oprah, New York Times, Martha Stewart Living, Parade, and many other publications. Her first play, “Papermaker,” debuted at Portland Stage in an extended run, its bestselling play ever.

Where the Subway Limits New Yorkers With Disabilities

Texto completo: The subway is tightly woven into the daily routine of many New Yorkers, but it remains largely inaccessible or dangerous to hundreds of thousands of people throughout the city. The recent death of a mother who fell down a flight of stairs while carrying a stroller has drawn new scrutiny to the transit challenges many riders have to overcome every day.
In the city, there are 550,000 residents who have difficulty walking. Two-thirds of them live far from an accessible subway station, a New York Times analysis has found.
Only about a quarter of the 472 subway stations in the city have elevators -- one of the lowest percentages of any major transit system in the world.
While Manhattan has the most subway stations with elevators, many residents in the rest of New York City live far away from an accessible station. The map shown here estimates where people are underserved by showing areas that are more than 10 minutes away from an accessible station, but the number of New Yorkers who have problems accessing the subway is likely to be much higher.
"Many people with disabilities do not walk distances because they cannot stand for a period of time, are fatigued, have pain when walking," said Susan Dooha, the executive director at the Center for Independence of the Disabled, New York.
Most people with disabilities have to rely on an inefficient bus system or the Access-A-Ride program, a paratransit service run by the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that critics say is unreliable.
"I have had several instances where taking public transportation was near to impossible," said Francisco Paz, who has a mobility disability and commutes from Queens to Staten Island daily for his job at the Center for Independence of the Disabled. "I don't have any accessible train stations near me, and the bus stops are remote and out in the open, exposed to the elements."
Parents with strollers also struggle to navigate the subway, as highlighted by the death of Malaysia Goodson last month. Families with young children live in every corner of the city, including large numbers in neighborhoods like Borough Park in southern Brooklyn, northern Corona in Queens and Claremont Village in the Bronx. Many residents of those neighborhoods are not near stations with elevators.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to install 50 new elevators over the next five years, and Andy Byford, the subway's leader, hired Alex Elegudin to be the authority's first accessibility chief.
Those improvements would still leave a majority of stations inaccessible to those who have difficulty walking. "The reasonable standard is following the Americans with Disabilities Act and N.Y.C. Human Rights Law and having all stations made accessible," Ms. Dooha said.

Texto completo: Adams responds to abuse allegations
Rocker Ryan Adams' immediate response to The New York Times reporting on his allegedly abusive relationships with multiple women was to say he was "taking you down" with a lawsuit - which he quickly deleted and replaced with a more temperate series of tweets.
"I know you got lawyers," he wrote before the piece was published. "But do you have the truth on your side. No. I do. Run your smear piece. But the legal eagles see you. Rats." That tweet quickly was taken down, as the gravity of his position seemed to kick in.
"I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes," he wrote in the first of three new tweets after the Times' story appeared. "To anyone I have ever hurt, I apologize deeply. But the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage. As someone who has always tried to spread joy through my music and my life, hearing that some people believe I caused them pain saddens me greatly," he wrote in the final tweet for the time being.
Adams was responding to a detailed New York Times piece that alleged that Adams' manipulative relationships with women were laid out by seven women and more than a dozen associates in their reporting.

Paul to reprise 'Bad' role: Jesse Pinkman lives to fight another day. Aaron Paul will be back as the rough-around-the-edges second-in-command in the long-rumored "Breaking Bad" sequel, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Details on the project are still scarce, but the movie, written by series creator Vince Gilligan, will reportedly appear first on Netflix, then on AMC.

Glover gets 5 NAACP Image Awards noms: Donald Glover and his alter-ego Childish Gambino were nominated Wednesday for five NAACP Image Awards. Glover is nominated for his acting and directing on "Atlanta." On the music side, Childish Gambino is nominated for top male performer, and his song "This Is America" is nominated for best video and song. Glover won four Grammys on Sunday including record and song of the year. The 50th NAACP Image Awards will be held March 30 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.

'Scrubs' creator promises return: Almost a decade after "Scrubs" left the airwaves, creator Bill Lawrence still expects to go back to Sacred Heart Hospital. The beloved show, which starred Zach Braff and Donald Faison, ran for nine seasons. "When we hit a time when we're all looking for work or we don't get to hang out as much, we will," Lawrence told the New York Daily News. "We'll definitely get there."

Texto completo: Rocker Ryan Adams' immediate response to The New York Times reporting on his allegedly abusive relationships with multiple women was to say he was "taking you down" with a lawsuit - which he quickly deleted and replaced with a more temperate series of tweets.
"I know you got lawyers," he wrote before the piece was published. "But do you have the truth on your side. No. I do. Run your smear piece. But the legal eagles see you. Rats." That tweet quickly was taken down, as the gravity of his position seemed to kick in.
"I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes," he wrote in the first of three new tweets after the Times' story appeared. "To anyone I have ever hurt, I apologize deeply. But the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage. As someone who has always tried to spread joy through my music and my life, hearing that some people believe I caused them pain saddens me greatly," he wrote in the final tweet for the time being.
Adams was responding to a detailed New York Times piece that alleged that Adams' manipulative relationships with women were laid out by seven women and more than a dozen associates in their reporting.

Paul to reprise 'Bad' role: Jesse Pinkman lives to fight another day. Aaron Paul will be back as the rough-around-the-edges second-in-command in the long-rumored "Breaking Bad" sequel, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Details on the project are still scarce, but the movie, written by series creator Vince Gilligan, will reportedly appear first on Netflix, then on AMC.
Glover gets 5 NAACP Image Awards noms: Donald Glover and his alter-ego Childish Gambino were nominated Wednesday for five NAACP Image Awards. Glover is nominated for his acting and directing on "Atlanta." On the music side, Childish Gambino is nominated for top male performer, and his song "This Is America" is nominated for best video and song. Glover won four Grammys on Sunday including record and song of the year. The 50th NAACP Image Awards will be held March 30 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.
'Scrubs' creator promises return: Almost a decade after "Scrubs" left the airwaves, creator Bill Lawrence still expects to go back to Sacred Heart Hospital. The beloved show, which starred Zach Braff and Donald Faison, ran for nine seasons. "When we hit a time when we're all looking for work or we don't get to hang out as much, we will," Lawrence told the New York Daily News. "We'll definitely get there."

Texto completo: For the second presidential cycle in a row, a crowded field of candidates has emerged in the race to claim a major party's nomination. The sheer number of hats in the ring could produce a nominee outside the small coterie most pundits expect to win out.
Dubious? Just think about 2016.
In the last presidential election, most of the Republican candidates were seen as beacons of the "establishment." With Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Rick Perry, John Kasich and Chris Christie all competing to win the hearts and minds of more moderate GOP primary voters, Donald Trump won by collecting support from Republicans with an appetite for a different brand of candidate — and he succeeded. In other words, the crowded field opened the door for an outsider who was (and could still be) largely out of step with many others inside his own party.
This time, the situation is flipped. Democrats are the party with the crowded field. But maybe more important, many Democratic candidates are not focusing on winning over moderate voters. Quite the opposite; they're keyed on winning over the Democratic Party's base voters and others on the far left. If history repeats itself, these candidates will end up slicing that electorate into such small portions that they could open the door for a competitor with a different message and outlook.
No one knows who will emerge as the Democratic nominee, and the widely held presumption that the 2016 race would be yet another contest between someone named Bush and someone named Clinton should give prognosticators pause. But the crowded field among Democratic candidates signals that the unexpected today might seem inevitable tomorrow. Voters eager to see a candidate emerge with a promise of getting Democrats and Republicans to work collaboratively should stay engaged.
Nancy Jacobson is a founder of the nonprofit organization No Labels.
What others are saying Dean Obeidallah, CNN.com: "President Donald Trump is now confronted with a gang of women who are all gunning for him. And if he responds in usual Trump fashion, with his no-holds-barred attacks, he could drive away more female voters than he did in the 2018 midterms. That could potentially not only be devastating for Trump, but also for many Republicans on the 2020 ballot."
Tara McGowan, The Hill: "Trump's campaign has excelled at leveraging digital ad dollars to keep the controversies surrounding the Trump administration from reaching his supporter base online. ... Coupled with Trump's own tweets, thousands of Facebook ads placed by his re-election campaign and dozens of conservative 'media outlets' driving the same narrative, Trump's chosen message blanketed the feeds and phones of voters nationwide."
David Leonhardt, The New York Times: "If I were Trump, I would fear Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Either would be well-positioned to take back blue-collar states Trump needs like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and maybe even Ohio and Iowa. They could also play well in the Sunbelt suburbs of Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. And if I were the other 2020 Democrats, I'd be studying how Klobuchar and Brown have succeeded where so many other Democrats have been failing."

Dr. Leena Peck, orthodontics professor and art collector, dies at 73

Texto completo: “The face is the key feature in the determination of human physical attractiveness," Dr. Leena Peck wrote at the start of a 1995 orthodontics journal article she coauthored with her husband, Dr. Sheldon Peck.
As orthodontists, much of their work enhanced the teeth of their patients. And the smile, they wrote in their journal article, “is a key expression in the social life of all human beings."
Dr. Leena Peck was 73 when she died Jan. 13 in Terhokoti Hospice in Helsinki, Finland, the country where she was born and had first studied dentistry. She had lived with her family in Newton for many years and had resided in the Back Bay since 2014. Her death was due to complications of an ALS-related neurodegenerative condition, her husband said.
Though Dr. Peck's work included treating patients, teaching dental students, and participating in professional organizations, “I think that a single sentence definition of Leena Peck would be that she was the consummate teacher," her husband said.
For more than 20 years, she was a lecturer and then an assistant clinical professor in orthodontics and developmental biology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, where students valued her guidance.
“Her patience and diligence and knowledge-based ability to teach them concepts and methods were without peer," her husband said.
She also was a pioneering woman in the Edward H. Angle Society of Orthodontists, whose members may only join by invitation. In 2003, Dr. Peck was the first woman elected president of a component of the society — Angle East — in the organization's 73-year history, said Dr. David R. Musich, an international past president of the organization.
Selected for membership in 1990, she was the co-recipient three years later of the Edward H. Angle Research Prize for excellence in published orthodontic research. In 2010, the year she retired from Harvard, colleagues in the Angle organization honored her with a Distinguished Service Award.
“Leena had a passion for precision and excellence — important traits for an orthodontist," Musich said. “Her broad, high-achieving educational background in Europe and the US resulted in unique leadership qualities that were immediately evident."
Having trained in the orthodontics disciplines of Europe and the United States, Dr. Peck “was able to blend the concepts and she would apply them to different orthodontic situations that served her really well in terms of practicing, teaching, and research," he added.
That continent-crossing background and attentiveness to detail also played a role in her work with her husband collecting 16th to 18th century Dutch and Flemish Old Master drawings.
“It's been a lot of fun using the skills that were nourished from our orthodontic repertoire of skills," her husband said. “Leena was at the vanguard with her foreign language skills and her sharp eye in picking out these wonderful art objects."
In 2017, the couple donated much of their collection to the Ackland Art Museum at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. The 140 works on paper, among them seven Rembrandt drawings, were valued at $17 million. They augmented the drawings with an $8 million endowment to fund a new curator and future acquisitions.
The “transformational" donation was “certainly the most generous and largest gift the Ackland has ever received; it's just mind-blowing," Katie Ziglar the museum director, told The New York Times that year.
As an orthodontist and an art collector, Dr. Peck had an excellent eye," her husband said. “Her visual discrimination skills were great."
Such talents were valued by dentistry colleagues, students she mentored, and patients alike. Dr. Peck often made a point of being present in the operating room if one of her patients decided to undergo jaw reconstruction surgery.
“In many patients, it's elective. Generally they don't have a life-threatening deformity," said Dr. Leonard B. Kaban, the Walter C. Guralnick distinguished professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine and Massachusetts General Hospital. “She was an orthodontist who really understood the surgical aspects of this and its implications."
Though her visits to the operating room weren't required or compensated, “she really felt for the patients, she felt responsible for them," Kaban said.
Among other matters, Dr. Peck would check the bite of the patient's jaw after surgery to ensure all had gone well.
“It was a great pleasure working with her," Kaban said. “As an orthodontist and a colleague she was very thorough and meticulous and paid excessive attention to details."
The second of four children, Leena Kataja was born in Finland in 1945 and spent most of her childhood in the small village of Kivijarvi. Her parents were Paavo Kataja, who ran a successful sawmill, and Kyllikki Luomala.
She attended the University of Helsinki's dentistry institute, graduating in 1965 with a bachelor's degree and in 1969 with a doctoral in dental science.
At first, she treated children in Zurich as a public health dentist and then was a clinical orthodontics instructor at the University of Helsinki. In the early 1970s, she was an orthodontics fellow at the University of Minnesota, from which she received a master's. Her studies were supported in part by a Fulbright scholarship.
Dr. Peck “was a little shocked" at the barriers women in dentistry faced, and by how men in the program treated female colleagues, her husband said. But “she didn't let that bother her and immediately commanded the respect of her male constituencies on the professional and academic levels and opened doors for other women," he added.
She first met Dr. Sheldon Peck at a 1973 reception in Royal Festival Hall in London for an orthodontics conference. They hit it off and spent much of the evening dancing but didn't become a couple until meeting again, in 1985, at a conference in Boston.
They married six months later, in 1986, and she graduated in 1989 from the Boston University School of Dental Medicine. Both taught at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, where he was a clinical professor of developmental biology.
“She was truly a global person," he said. “She was tremendously embracing of everybody."
Because of her, he added, their two children “are wonderfully fluent in the difficult language of Finish."
A service was held in Helsinki for Dr. Peck, who in addition to her husband leaves their children, Mark of Helsinki and Anya of New York City; and two brothers, Matti Kataja of Tampere, Finland, and Erkki Kataja of Helsinki.
In their 1995 journal article “Selected Aspects of the Art and Science of Facial Esthetics," Dr. Peck and her husband wrote that “almost invariably, when a person senses happiness, pleasure, humor, or greetings, a smile develops."
She could bring about smiles from more than just her orthodontics work. As the couple sought drawings for their collection, he did much of the research verifying an artwork's authenticity, while she passed judgment before they made a purchase. She knew what she liked, and what she didn't.
In some instances, “Leena would look at it, and say, 'Well, I appreciate the evidence you've shown me, but I think it's ugly,' " her husband recalled. “Many times, her sense of aesthetic quality saved us from buying terrible pieces of art, even though they were authentic."

Texto completo: A 400-year-old bonsai tree worth more than $50,000 vanished from a gardener's collection outside Tokyo, one of several valuable plants stolen last month from a fifth-generation bonsai master.
Now the plant's owners have a request for thieves: Please, water it.
That's according to CNN, which spoke to Fuyumi Iimura, wife of bonsai master Seiji Iimura, whose garden sits in Japan's Saitama Prefecture.
"We treated these miniature trees like our children," Fuyumi Iimura told the network, adding: "I want whoever took the bonsais to make sure they are watered. "
The 400-year-old plant, a shimpaku tree, can't make it a week without water, she said.
Seiji Iimura walked into his garden the morning of Jan. 13 before noticing four pots missing among his collection of about 3,000 bonsai trees, according to Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper.
Growing bonsais outdoors is standard, the newspaper reported, and Iimura, 54, kept his farm open to the public so bonsai fans could feel close to the exquisite and awe-inspiring trees.
Now the garden has cameras, though, the New York Times reported, and Iimura plans to soon install a fence. Maybe a siren. Police have had little luck finding the thieves.
On the black market, stolen bonsai can sell for the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars, Asahi Shimbun reported, with Seiji Iimura pricing the 400-year-old bonsai at more than $54,000.
Also stolen, per CNN: Three miniature pine trees known as goyomatsu and three more shimpaku, with the trees together valued at at least $118,000.
The meticulous dedication needed to grow bonsai is said to form a deep and even emotional bond between gardener and plant, the Times reported, with caretakers often describing the trees in ways typically reserved for pets or relatives.
Iimura had cared for the 400-year-old shimpaku for 25 years, according to the newspaper, and hopes global media coverage of the plants' theft will stifle their sale on the black market.

Texto completo: Christine Kay, a longtime New York Times editor who helped shape coverage of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, died last week after a long struggle with cancer. She was 54.
Growing up in a working class community outside Pittsburgh, Kay developed a passion for bringing to life the struggles of people who are often marginalized. As an editor at The New York Times she helped the paper rack up awards, including a Pulitzer Prize that cited "Portraits of Grief." She developed the approach to that series of short profiles of the lives of those who perished on 9/11.
"She was one of the premiere editors at the Times," Deputy Managing Editor Matthew Purdy said. Her blue-collar upbringing "gave her a feel for people whose lives are often overlooked ... [she] dedicated herself to telling those types of stories," Purdy said.
Dan Barry, a New York Times reporter who worked with Kay, said she brought deep understanding to structuring long form stories.
"She could bring to life what otherwise would have been a boring investigative story," Barry said. "She was insistent on flesh and blood and humanity in these stories, otherwise you lose your reader."
Barry said that in a recent story he co-wrote about the life and death of a sex worker in Queens, Kay took the unusual step -- for an editor -- of going there herself.
"She wasn't feeling well, but she was insistent that she come to Flushing to see this world," Barry said.
"She would really become a partner with reporters on the story," Purdy said.
The youngest of five sisters-a brother died in infancy-she grew up in Carnegie, Pennsylvania. At an early age she was writing short fiction, her sister Judy Kovac, of Pittsburgh, said.
"As soon as she could write she started writing stories," Kovac said. "She was a good story teller."
Her father, who owned and operated a gas station and auto mechanic shop, died when she was 15. She finished high school early and graduated from Penn State University, Kovac said. Out of college, she worked first for the Pittsburgh Press, then as an assistant editor at Newsday for five years.
"She was a careful and thoughtful editor," Newsday deputy assistant managing editor Tim Healy said. "If she was assigned to something you knew it would be handled right."
Doug Dutton, Newsday associate managing editor said, "Christine was a smart story editor and clever headline writer ... [and]  also a terrific person who cared about her colleagues and was fun to work with."
Kay joined The Times as a copy editor in 1995 and served later as an editor on investigative and enterprise stories.
"She wanted us to know the injustices that were going on," Kovac said. "Work was her life."
Outside the office, she filled her passport with stamps from India, Morocco, all over Europe and the Caribbean, Kovac said. She also found time for simpler pleasures, relaxing with her poodle Simone in her Manhattan home and baking cakes with her nieces and nephews.
While she battled breast cancer for 12 years, undergoing treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, she remained an optimist, her sister said.
"She was looking for the best in everything, that's how she survived," Kovac said. She participated in drug trials that she believed may have helped develop cancer treatments for others, she said.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address and the Democratic response given by Georgia politician Stacey Abrams on Tuesday had fact checkers on overdrive.
While each speech included some false information, according to reports, we compare the claims Trump and Abrams made concerning employment and the economy.
‘Best in decades’ claim doesn’t add up The president’s speech included claims that contrasted with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, according to The Washington Post.
Trump said, "Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades."
Wages were up 3.1 percent last year, according to one Labor Department measure of employment that doesn’t take inflation into account, the Post said. That figure represents the largest increase since December 2008.
However, according to the Labor Department, pay for all workers, adjusted for inflation, rose 1.3 percent from December 2017 to December 2018, the largest increase since only August 2016, the Post said.
"We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs," Trump said.
This is in contrast to the 4.9 million jobs created, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, because the timelines differ, the Post said. While the BLS data for Trump’s administration began on Jan. 20, 2017, Inauguration Day, the president’s claim reflects numbers going back to Election Day 2016, when former President Barack Obama still had more than two months left on his term, the Post said.
Abrams’ figures contradict labor statistics While giving the Democratic response, Abrams said the Republican tax bill "rigged the system" against the working class.
"Families’ hopes are being crushed by Republican leadership that ignores real life or just doesn’t understand it," said Abrams, who narrowly lost the 2018 race for governor of Georgia.
But the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates nonfarming jobs have increased by nearly 4.9 million since Trump took office and are up 3 million since the tax law began, according to USA Today.
The Republican-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect in December 2017.
Abrams claimed "plants are closing, layoffs are looming, and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living."
USA Today reports manufacturing employment rose by 454,000 jobs under the Trump administration and 277,000 jobs since the tax law.
Abrams said, "wages struggle to keep pace" with the cost of living.
As of December, USA Today said, inflation-adjusted earnings for rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers were up 2.6 percent since Trump became president and 1.4 percent since December 2017.
Although manufacturing companies have closed and there have been layoffs, overall, employment numbers have risen since Trump took office in January 2017, according to USA Today.
Stone arrest not bigger than bin Ladin raid Following the early-morning arrest of longtime Trump associate Roger Stone on Jan. 25, Stone was charged with obstruction, making false statements to investigators and one count of witness tampering, a ccording to the Associated Press.
Within days of the arrest, stories circulating on Facebook claimed Special Council Robert Mueller sent more FBI agents to arrest Stone than the number of military personnel sent to get Osama bin Laden in 2011, AP said.
One Facebook post asked, "Does that tell you how out of control Mueller is(?)" But the 48 members of SEAL Team 6 participating in the highly sophisticated secret military raid on bin Ladin’s Pakistan compound far outnumbered the 12 FBI agents who executed the pre-dawn arrest of Stone at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, AP said.
The mission to apprehend bin Laden involved two specially engineered Black Hawk helicopters, each carrying 23 SEALs and an interpreter, and a tracking dog named Cairo, according to AP.
Stone, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges, said the "over the top" raid at his home was unnecessary because he would have voluntarily surrendered through his lawyer, AP said.
Brady, Belichick kissing photo is fake The New England Patriots, who defeated the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl on Feb. 3, once again were crowned NFL champions and a fake meme of quarterback Tom Brady kissing coach Bill Belichick on the lips once again made the rounds on Facebook.
The image first showed up after the Patriots won the 2015 Super Bowl, according to Snopes.com. Earlier this month it resurfaced as part of a collage that included a real photo of Brady kissing his father during the 2017 Super Bowl celebration and a 2019 screen grab in which Brady is seen embracing team owner Robert Kraft.
The Brady/Belichick photo is a digitally doctored fake created by combining photos of the two men kissing other people, Snopes said.
The image of Brady was taken from a New York Times photo of the quarterback kissing his mother in the aftermath of the 2015 championship win, Snopes said. The Belichick image was taken from a photo of the coach kissing his daughter, also during the 2015 celebration, which ran on the Fox Sports website.
Parts of each photo were cropped, rotated or flipped to create the fake image, Snopes said.

Democratic apology tour a sorry sight

Texto completo: Forgive me, but would anybody mind if we declared a moratorium on Democratic apologies?
I don't doubt many public servants have done things worthy of regret. But it's becoming difficult to keep up with the sorry spectacle.
"From the bottom of my heart, I am deeply, deeply sorry," Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said in a statement Wednesday expressing the "greatest shame" as he acknowledged wearing blackface in college when he went to a party as a rapper.
Five days earlier, Herring had demanded Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) resign for doing much the same. "I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo," Northam said before reversing and claiming he wasn't in the just-found 1984 blackface photo on his medical school yearbook page.
Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, meanwhile, was just accused of a sexual assault in 2004 (which he denies) and of dropping an F-bomb at a meeting about it (which his office confirms). A new apology watch has been declared for the Richmond area.
If it comes, it will collide with a national apology tour now underway by Democratic presidential hopefuls.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) apologized Wednesday for identifying herself as a Native American, expanding her previous apology for taking a DNA test to prove her ancestry. "I am sorry," she told the Washington Post.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) said she "really regretted" some of her previous pro-gun and tough-on-immigration positions.
Former Vice President Joe Biden regrets his "big mistake" of backing tough-on-crime legislation. Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) expressed "regret" over decisions made (by others) when she was a prosecutor.
Not to be outdone, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) produced an apology video, saying she was "deeply sorry" for old remarks about "homosexual extremists."
Apparently, being a Democrat means always having to say you're sorry. Maybe the party could issue a group apology? Oh, sorry - it already did.
"I am sorry," Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said in a blanket apology for taking African-Americans for granted.
This is a sorry situation, because the person who has the most to apologize for shows no regrets. "Under my administration," President Trump said in Tuesday's State of the Union address, "we will never apologize for advancing America's interests."
Nor for anything else!
Asked once about clearing up various falsehoods, such as claiming President Barack Obama tapped his phone, Trump replied, "Why do you say that I have to apologize?" Told that he could boost his legal argument for his travel ban by disavowing his anti-Muslim campaign rhetoric, he replied: "There's no reason to apologize."
On the other hand, he has demanded apologies from, among others, Hillary Clinton, Warren, bearish forecasters, the "fake news" media, CNN, ESPN and the cast of "Hamilton." He has hailed an apology the New York Times didn't offer him. And he expressed jealousy that ABC apologized to Valerie Jarrett for Roseanne Barr's racist remarks but not for "the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC."
Trump's few apologies tend to be ironic: for bringing jobs back too quickly, for calling women beautiful, for the "terrible pain and suffering" Democrats caused Brett Kavanaugh, for insulting the real Pocahontas by calling Warren that name.
For Trump, apologizing is weakness. After years of mocking Obama's "apology tour," Trump boasted at a campaign event a year ago: "Last eight years, we've seen a lot of apologizing. Not any longer. We don't apologize."
His refusal makes sense. Narcissistic types don't often apologize. At the other extreme, profuse apologizing can be a sign of anxiety and sometimes comes from abusive relationships. Democrats lately are tending toward the latter.
The problem with the Democrats' apology binge is in the volume. Genuine contrition is one thing. But if a politician appears to be apologizing for getting caught, or for political gain, that's regrettable.
This leads us back to Virginia. Northam invalidated his apology when he retracted his admission that he was in the photo. Herring's apology could work out better - if he did it to clear his conscience and not because it was going to come out anyway.
If both apologists fail and Fairfax also succumbs, the governorship would go to the House speaker - who, as the Post's Mark Berman pointed out, has the job because a Republican's name was pulled from a bowl to break a tie.
I'm sorry, but this is no way to run a government.

EXCHANGE --- The Intelligent Investor: FDR and the Inequality Fix

Texto completo: Eighty-three years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a new plan for tackling income inequality.
FDR argued companies were intensifying the gap between rich and poor not by showering investors with too much wealth -- but rather by paying them too little.
"The evil has been a growing one," FDR said in a speech on March 3, 1936. "It has now reached disturbing proportions from the standpoint of the inequality it represents and on its serious effect on the federal revenue."
Companies, then generally taxed at a maximum 13.75%, were squirreling away their earnings rather than distributing them to investors, who were taxed at up to 75%.
That created a "serious two-fold inequality," said FDR: Capital piled up, idle and undertaxed, inside corporations. Meanwhile, "stockholders who need the disbursement of dividends" weren't getting the income they were entitled to.
It was almost the polar opposite of today. This past week, Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Bernie Sanders of Vermont decried what they called "the explosion of stock buybacks."
Their issue: Companies are sending back too much, not too little, money to shareholders.
Companies that repurchase their shares have created "an enormous problem" of "income and wealth inequality," the senators wrote in an editorial in The New York Times, enriching "shareholders and executives, not workers." By transferring assets to investors through buybacks and dividends, corporate managers "restrain their capacity to reinvest profits more meaningfully in the company."
The senators plan to sponsor legislation prohibiting companies from buying back stock unless they pay all employees at least $15 an hour and beef up retirement, health-care and other benefits. The senators also warned that they would "seriously consider" similar limits on dividends, too.
In a buyback, a company uses its cash (or borrows money) to repurchase stock from investors, typically increasing the stock price. During the third quarter of 2018, S&P 500 companies spent $203.8 billion buying back shares, a record for any calendar quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Over the 12 months ending Sept. 30, S&P 500 companies spent a record $720.4 billion on repurchases, up 39% over the same period one year earlier.
If companies cut back on buybacks, Sen. Schumer said on the Senate floor on Feb. 4, they would free up cash for training workers, offering better benefits and investing in new equipment. Those, he said, are "the kinds of things we always thought American corporations would do and now they do scantily when compared to how much they do in terms of buybacks."
At the heart of the recent criticism is the belief that companies can best sustain innovation and reduce inequality by retaining most of their capital rather than paying it out to investors.
To be sure, as I've often pointed out, such payouts can be problematic. Companies tend to buy their shares back most eagerly at the worst possible times. Also, by counteracting the dilution from new shares issued to managers exercising stock options, buybacks can placate investors who might otherwise toss out overpaid and underperforming bosses.
Overall, however, buybacks (and dividends) return excess capital to investors who are free to spend or reinvest it wherever it is most needed.
By requiring companies to hang onto their capital instead of paying it out, Congress might -- perhaps -- encourage them to invest more in workers and communities.
But the law most likely to govern here is the Law of Unintended Consequences.
The history of investment by corporate managers with oodles of cash on their hands isn't encouraging. Hugh Liedtke, the late chief executive of Pennzoil, reportedly liked to quip that he believed in "the bladder theory": Companies should pay out as much cash as possible, so managers couldn't piss all the money away.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, giant oil companies, flush with dollars after the boom in oil prices, binged on buying department stores and developing electric typewriters. (Montgomery Ward stores and Qyx typewriters didn't turn out to be gushers.)
In the late 1990s, most technology startups refused to pay dividends, instead plowing all their cash back into the business. Employees got free massages, dentists on call, mobile gyms, stock options and other great benefits -- until many of the companies went bust, leaving workers and investors alike in the lurch.
Today, some of the companies that have bought back the greatest proportion of their shares -- Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., for example -- also score highest on rankings of how they treat employees.
Complex problems seldom have simple solutions, as even FDR discovered.
After the stock-market crash, dividends had fallen 55% between 1929 and 1933. The investment analyst Benjamin Graham estimated that in 1934 fewer than one-third of New York Stock Exchange companies had repurchased shares.
"The grotesque result," Graham wrote, was that "the typical stockholder is weighed down by financial problems while the corporation wallows in cash."
That, and FDR's calls to free up corporate cash, prompted Congress to enact an undistributed profits tax, penalizing companies for not maximizing their payouts to shareholders.
The undistributed profits tax did prod companies into raising dividends by approximately 25%, but it also led to so much corporate tax avoidance that Congress unwound it in 1938.

AJC SEPIA BLACK HISTORY MONTH: Don Shirley: The obscure concert pianist was a musical genius

Texto completo: If the 2018 flick "Green Book" was your first reference to the concert pianist Don Shirley, you're likely not alone.The Golden Globe award-winning, five-time Oscar-nominated movie, starring Mahershala Ali, documented one of his tours of the South in the 1960s with his white bodyguard and driver "Tony Lip" Vallelonga.
Filmmakers said the project was based on a true story. However, Shirley's family called it a "symphony of lies," criticizing its inaccuracies about the musician's character. So what was he really all about?
Born Donald Walbridge Shirley on Jan. 29, 1927, in Pensacola, Florida, to Jamaican immigrants, the artist gravitated to music at an early age. He learned the piano at 2 and picked up the organ at 3, playing the latter at his local church where his father served as an Episcopal minister.
By the time the prodigy was 9, he was traveling to the Soviet Union to study theory at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music. And at 18, he made his concert debut with the Boston Pops Orchestra, playing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat.
A few years later, he was dissuaded from pursuing classical music, because he was told America wouldn't accepted a black pianist. But Shirley persisted. He developed his own unique genre by fusing blues, spirituals, show tunes and popular music into his compositions.
"I introduced the contrapuntal aspect of music into popular music, and this is something that no jazz musician could do or ever thought of doing," he once told The New York Times.
Throughout his nearly seven-decade career, he composed 25 albums, three symphonies, two piano concertos, a cello concerto, three string quartets and a one-act opera.
Playing exclusively on a Steinway, the cultured musician performed with renowned organizations and artists, including Duke Ellington, the Symphony of the Air Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony, theChicagoSymphony and the Cleveland Orchestra. He also often collaborated with bassist Ken Fricker and cellist Juri Taht as the Don Shirley Trio. Their self-titled 1961 album produced the Billboard top 40 hit "Water Boy," which maintained its spot on the list for 14 weeks.
Whenhewasn'tperforming at prestigious venues, such as Milan's La Scala Opera House and New York's Metropolitan Opera House, he resided in the artists' colony of Carnegie Studios above Carnegie Hall. The extravagant apartment, which he lived in for more than 50 years, featured floor-to-ceiling windows, a crystal chandelier, shelves of books and stunning gifts he received while traveling the world.
Shirley, who earned two honorary degrees and spoke eight languages, was also active in the civil rights movement. The composer, who often had to go through the back door of nightclubs and use closets for dressing rooms at his own shows, befriended activists, including Nina Simone and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.He was presentforthemarchinSelma in 1965, too.
His career dwindled in the early 1970s after he developed tendinitis in his right hand, but he continued to perform occasionally through the 2000s and dropped his very last album, titled "Home With Don Shirley," in 2001.
On April 6, 2013, Shirley died from complications of heart disease at his home above Carnegie Hall.
In The New York Times article, he explained he wanted to approach the black experience through music "with a sense of dignity." He said, "That's all I have ever tried to do."

Texto completo: The Biographers International Organization announced Thursday that Santa Fe writer James McGrath Morris has been named the winner of the 10th annual BIO Award, which goes to authors who have made a major contribution to the art and craft of the form.
Previous award winners include Pulitzer Prize winners Robert Caro, Stacy Schiff and Ron Chernow.
"For me to see my idea take root and then be invited to the 10th annual conference in this manner is very special," said Morris, who helped co-found the organization in 2010. "There is nothing more rewarding than being honored by one's peers."
Morris will receive the honor May 18 at the 2019 BIO Conference at City University of New York. He will deliver the keynote address.
Morris' work includes a biography on civil rights reporter Ethel Payne (Eye on the Struggle: Ethel Payne, the First Lady of the Black Press), a New York Times best-seller that the paper called an "important and often absorbing new book."
He also wrote The Rose Man of Sing Sing: A True Tale of Life, Murder, and Redemption in the Age of Yellow Journalism, Pulitzer: A Life in Politics, Print and Power and, most recently, The Ambulance Drivers: Hemingway, Dos Passos, and a Friendship Made and Lost in War.
Morris is working on a biography of the late Tony Hillerman, author of mysteries set in the Navajo Nation.
"I'm the least well-known biographer to get this prize," he said. "My name being added to this list of such distinguished writers is certainly career enhancing. Readers won't necessarily notice but editors do."

D.C. Memo: A nation’s eyes turn to Minneapolis

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to the D.C. Memo, once again coming to you not-from-D.C. This week, we’re writing from what is about to become, of course, the true center of the political universe: Minneapolis, where Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sunday will announce … “something” — something that requires “hot cocoa, cookies, warming houses and live entertainment,” according to the notice her people sent the media this week. All of which means Klobuchar is totally running for president of the USA! That, or she’s taking over the organizing for Holidazzle. We’re going to be excited either way.
Even so, before we get to Klobuchella 2020, there’s a few other essential things to know from this week, though sadly none involve hot cocoa or warming houses. So let’s get to it:
Three big things (Non-Kloby division)

1. Leaky blinders: For the Trump administration, the week started out not with a bang, but with the hiss of a massive leak: On Sunday, Axios’ Jonathan Swan published a story examining the president’s private schedule since the 2018 midterms. Among other things, the documents revealed, “Trump has spent around 60 percent of his scheduled time over the past 3 months in unstructured ‘Executive Time,’” according to Axios. And yet, the leak was less important for what it revealed about Trump — we already knew the president spends a lot of time on “unstructured” activities like phone calls, tweeting and watching TV, after all — than for for what it said about the people who work for him. Indeed, as many a talking head has pointed out, the only reason to do this is to try and embarrass Trump; to stick it to the boss in a manner so aggressively passive-aggressive that it would be a shock if the leaker didn’t have some connection to Minnesota.
2. A series of inaugurate events: Things didn’t get much better from there for the Trump folks. On Monday, the New York Times reported that federal prosecutors have ordered the president’s inaugural committee to turn over documents, like lots and lots of them:
The subpoena seeks documents related to all of the committee’s donors and guests; any benefits handed out, including tickets and photo opportunities with the president; federal disclosure filings; vendors; contracts; and more, one of the people said.
The new requests expand an investigation prosecutors opened late last year amid a flurry of scrutiny of the inaugural committee. And they showed that the investigations surrounding Mr. Trump, once centered on potential ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential election, have spread far beyond the special counsel’s office to include virtually all aspects of his adult life: his business, his campaign, his inauguration and his presidency.
In the subpoena, investigators also showed interest in whether any foreigners illegally donated to the committee, as well as whether committee staff members knew that such donations were illegal, asking for documents laying out legal requirements for donations. Federal law prohibits foreign contributions to federal campaigns, political action committees and inaugural funds.
It sounds more than a tad ludicrous to say some Trump activities have actually been under-covered by the media. And yet: As the Times piece hints at, the inauguration just might fit that bill, if only because of there remains a bunch of really basic questions that have yet to be answered about the whole thing. As ProPublica noted in story it reported with WNYC in December: “Trump’s 2017 inauguration committee, which was chaired by his friend the businessman Tom Barrack, raised nearly $107 million from donors including the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and AT&T. The January 2017 festivities cost almost twice President Obama’s 2009 inauguration, previously the most expensive. … How the inaugural committee managed to spend all the money it raised remains a mystery, nearly two years after the event.”
3. The man with the draggin’ SOTU: There is a convincing argument out there that the State of the Union address is, well, pretty pointless, though even those who think that don’t usually go as far in their assessment as conservative commentator Kevin Williamson did a few years ago, when he somewhat famously called it “a hideous, dispiriting, ugly, monotonous, un-American, un-republican, anti-democratic, dreary, backward, monarchical, retch-inducing, depressing, shameful, crypto-imperial display of official self-aggrandizement and piteous toadying.” Other than that, though, he loves it!
Anyway, it isn’t going anywhere, and on Tuesday night, Trump got his second shot at bringing his unique mojo to the speech. And reviews were… Ok, we guess. The Washington Post called it “dissonant” and “discordant,” while the Times said it “toggled between conciliation and confrontation,” and Politico called it “Zig zagging,” though — Politico being Politico — that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. At least it was long; it clocked in at the third-longest SOTU ever.
Mostly, though, it was a chance for a lot of media outlets to do what they love to do with events that are made for TV: takeaways. So if you’ve already forgotten what was in the speech, here’s our takeaway on what you were supposed to have taken away from the speech:
USA Today’s 6 takeaways: “Bipartisanship”; “Border wall, government shutdown”; “‘Ridiculous investigations’”; “Infrastructure proposal”; “Lowering the cost of prescription drugs”; “Law to ban late-term abortions”
The Washington Post’s 5 takeaways: “A discordant call for unity”; “A call for a wall, but no demand”; “A double-down on withdrawal from Afghanistan and Syria”; “Areas for compromise?”; “The women’s white-out — and a bipartisan celebration”
The New York Times’ 6 takeaways: “No national emergency. Yet”; “Mr. Trump suggested that investigations into his conduct posed a threat to national security”; “He attempted to unite divided Republicans”; “He defended his record on women’s issues”; “As President Trump veered into immigration, partisan tension soared”; “The women in white took their bows.”
The Guardian’s 6 takeaways: “Trump pitches bipartisanship while pushing his own agenda”: “Trump pitches bipartisanship while pushing his own agenda”; “On immigration, a dark tone and scare tactics prevail”; “Trump celebrates women in moment rife with irony”; Trump’s foreign policy doctrine: no more ‘endless wars’; “Trump denounces socialism in 2020 election preview”
The Decision: Klobuchar takin’ her talents to the 2020 race?
After months of talking, teasing and deliberating, Sen. Amy Klobuchar ’s campaign sent a notice to the media earlier this week that she would be making a “major” announcement on Sunday. Notably, the words “president,” “presidential” and “2020” did not appear in the statement, though it did mention that she will make this mysterious announcement “in Minnesota, where she built a strong grassroots organization and garnered over 60 percent of the vote — winning all eight congressional districts and 42 counties that voted for Trump in 2016 — in her reelection bid in 2018, and led a state ticket that experienced historic victories: winning the Governor’s office, every statewide constitutional office, took back control of the Minnesota State House for the first time since 2014 and elected five women to represent Minnesota in Congress.”
The assumption, of course, is that the Senator Next Door will be officially throwing her hat in the ring to be the President next door — even Walter Mondale couldn’t help but speculate about it — and the announcement set of a wave of national analysis on her popularity, her potential appeal to voters, and the odds of her prevailing in what is already a very crowded field. “Aside from ideology, it’s her disposition that most separates her from the field of high-wattage, inspirational voices that are populating the presidential field,” wrote The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin. “If one thinks that the country is ready for a sober, calm and self-contained figure, someone in control of her emotions and in command of her facts, Klobuchar might be the right candidate. Her biggest problem might arise if former vice president Joe Biden, cast in the role of Democratic centrist, enters the race.”
But there’s a big difference between being a maybe-sorta candidate and being an actual candidate, which became apparent almost immediately after Klobuchar’s announcement of her announcement. Wednesday afternoon, HuffPost published a story about how Klobuchar treats staff, including the charge that, “At least three people have withdrawn from consideration to lead Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s nascent 2020 presidential campaign — and done so in part because of the Minnesota Democrat’s history of mistreating her staff.”
In response, Klobuchar’s office pointed HuffPost to other ex-staffers who raved about her: “‘I’ve heard people say she’s tough to work for and I sometimes cringe when I hear it because I rarely hear that said about male bosses in Congress despite the fact that half of Congress is tough to work for,’ said Tristan Brown, a former legislative aide who called Klobuchar ‘probably the most brilliant, hardworking person I’ve had the privilege to work for,’” HuffPo reported.
And, not for nothing, but HuffPo also wrote that ex-staffers, “question whether former co-workers who thought she was abusive were falling for sexist stereotypes about female leaders with high standards.”
A fair question. But this not the first time that the issue has been raised, and — fairly or not — it’s probably not going to be the last. Back in November, in an otherwise positive piece on the senator, the Times noted: “On Capitol Hill, Ms. Klobuchar’s reputation is not all sweetness and light; she is said to be brutal to work for. A survey of senators by the website LegiStorm found that from 2001 to 2016, her office had the highest turnover, which earned her a prominent mention in a Politico article headlined “The ‘Worst Bosses’ in Congress?” (By 2017, two colleagues — John Kennedy of Louisiana and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland — had surpassed her.) She acknowledged that she is demanding: “I have high expectations.”
The week in takes
* Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich: Trump’s State of the Union changed the course of history

Your weekend longread
A lot has been written about Foxconn’s deal with the State of Wisconsin to build a massive plant in the southeast part of the state. But nobody has dug as deep as Bloomberg Businessweek writer Austin Carr, who talked to dozens of people involved with the project for this story, “ Inside Wisconsin’s Disastrous $4.5 Billion Deal With Foxconn ,” a piece that makes it abundantly clear that the project will never, ever live up to the hype that initially greeted it:
Interviews with 49 people familiar with Foxconn’s Wisconsin project, including more than a dozen current and former employees close to its efforts there, show how hollow the boosters’ assurances have been all along. While Foxconn for months declined requests to interview executives, insiders describe a chaotic environment with ever-changing goals far different from what Trump and others promised. Walker and the White House declined to comment for this story, although a Trump administration official says the White House would be “disappointed” by any reduced investment. The only consistency, many of these people say, lay in how obvious it was that Wisconsin struck a weak deal. Under the terms Walker negotiated, each job at the Mount Pleasant factory is projected to cost the state at least $219,000 in tax breaks and other incentives. The good or extra-bad news, depending on your perspective, is that there probably won’t be 13,000 of them.
That’s all for this week. Thanks for sticking around. Until next week, feel free to send tips, suggestions, and sound advice to: feedback@minnpost.com.

Texto completo: California’s housing crisis was bad enough last year, when Gov. Gavin Newsom – then a mere candidate – called for building 350,000 new units every year for the next decade.
The crunch is worse this year, with some of those who lost their homes to last fall’s disastrous wildfires now added to the tens of thousands already homeless and living on streets around the state and hundreds of thousands more who are housed, but overcrowded beyond the limits of many local codes.
This scene last year led San Francisco’s Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener to push a proposed law allowing builders to override local zoning ordinances and place high-rise apartment buildings with a plenitude of “affordable” units near light rail stations or heavily used bus routes.
This proposal didn’t last long in the Legislature last year, shot down by a coalition of local governments, homeowner groups and lack of enthusiasm by former Gov. Jerry Brown, an advocate of local government controls since his years as mayor of Oakland.
But there is more pressure now to override local controls on development, and Wiener is back with a slightly redone version of his building plan, which would reverse a century of California urban sprawl by concentrating development in areas long believed to be built out.
Wiener has touted the changes he’s made to his proposal for the last couple of months, stressing ways the newer version panders to the desires of left-wing “progressives” dissatisfied with the previous version.
Now known as SB 50, the measure would let cities delay building in areas where longstanding apartment tenants might be at risk of eviction to make way for newly-mandated high rises. If a tenant has been in a building more than seven years, for example, that building couldn’t be demolished to make way for a new, far taller one.
This is meant to appease tenant groups that dominate politics in cities like Santa Monica, San Francisco and other currently dense places.
But the essence of Wiener’s original plan remains: It allows new buildings of six to eight stories in all areas within half a mile of any light-rail station or within one-quarter mile of a frequently used bus route. Preferences of local voters, city or county governments and nearby homeowners or apartment dwellers wouldn’t matter.
As Wiener says, such development could probably never occur unless the state mandated it. Few local officials could survive politically if they okayed high-rises overlooking the yards of thousands of single-family homes or caused the teardowns of expensive condominiums.
But Wiener claims many elected officials tell him they want dense development, but can’t publicly admit it. He told the New York Times that “City councils, mayors, county supervisors have (told) me ‘We can’t say this, but we need help. We need to be able to tell our constituents ‘We have to approve this project because the state requires it.’”
But just as the state’s high-speed rail project has seen years of delay and opposition over attempts to take land by eminent domain, forced new development could also run into legal buzz saws. Especially new development with virtually no new parking spaces required.
For example, Wiener’s plan is founded on the notion that denser housing won’t worsen gridlocked traffic because new residents will ride nearby trains and buses. Figures from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in Southern California suggest that’s pie in the sky.
The bus and light rail agency reported last year that bus ridership shrank in the region by 15 percent in 2017 from levels of five years earlier, while rail ridership was up 4 million – less than the drop in bus ridership. Translation: there’s been some switching from buses to trains, but little net increase in mass transit riders despite creation of several new lines costing billions of dollars.
So the logic behind Wiener’s plan remains false and would worsen existing gridlock in cities he wants to densify. It ignores many thousands of homeowners who invested their life savings in residences Wiener’s plan could radically downgrade.
The bottom line: Some other solution must be sought, because it accomplishes little to begin solving one serious problem while making other problems far worse.

Texto completo: California’s housing crisis was bad enough last year, when Gov. Gavin Newsom – then a mere candidate – called for building 350,000 new units every year for the next decade.
The crunch is worse this year, with some of those who lost their homes to last fall’s disastrous wildfires now added to the tens of thousands already homeless and living on streets around the state and hundreds of thousands more who are housed, but overcrowded beyond the limits of many local codes.
This scene last year led San Francisco’s Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener to push a proposed law allowing builders to override local zoning ordinances and place high-rise apartment buildings with a plenitude of “affordable” units near light rail stations or heavily used bus routes.
This proposal didn’t last long in the Legislature last year, shot down by a coalition of local governments, homeowner groups and lack of enthusiasm by former Gov. Jerry Brown, an advocate of local government controls since his years as mayor of Oakland.
But there is more pressure now to override local controls on development, and Wiener is back with a slightly redone version of his building plan, which would reverse a century of California urban sprawl by concentrating development in areas long believed to be built out.
Wiener has touted the changes he’s made to his proposal for the last couple of months, stressing ways the newer version panders to the desires of left-wing “progressives” dissatisfied with the previous version.
Now known as SB 50, the measure would let cities delay building in areas where longstanding apartment tenants might be at risk of eviction to make way for newly-mandated high rises. If a tenant has been in a building more than seven years, for example, that building couldn’t be demolished to make way for a new, far taller one.
This is meant to appease tenant groups that dominate politics in cities like Santa Monica, San Francisco and other currently dense places.
But the essence of Wiener’s original plan remains: It allows new buildings of six to eight stories in all areas within half a mile of any light-rail station or within one-quarter mile of a frequently used bus route. Preferences of local voters, city or county governments and nearby homeowners or apartment dwellers wouldn’t matter.
As Wiener says, such development could probably never occur unless the state mandated it. Few local officials could survive politically if they okayed high-rises overlooking the yards of thousands of single-family homes or caused the teardowns of expensive condominiums.
But Wiener claims many elected officials tell him they want dense development, but can’t publicly admit it. He told the New York Times that “City councils, mayors, county supervisors have (told) me ‘We can’t say this, but we need help. We need to be able to tell our constituents ‘We have to approve this project because the state requires it.’”
But just as the state’s high-speed rail project has seen years of delay and opposition over attempts to take land by eminent domain, forced new development could also run into legal buzz saws. Especially new development with virtually no new parking spaces required.
For example, Wiener’s plan is founded on the notion that denser housing won’t worsen gridlocked traffic because new residents will ride nearby trains and buses. Figures from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in Southern California suggest that’s pie in the sky.
The bus and light rail agency reported last year that bus ridership shrank in the region by 15 percent in 2017 from levels of five years earlier, while rail ridership was up 4 million – less than the drop in bus ridership. Translation: there’s been some switching from buses to trains, but little net increase in mass transit riders despite creation of several new lines costing billions of dollars.
So the logic behind Wiener’s plan remains false and would worsen existing gridlock in cities he wants to densify. It ignores many thousands of homeowners who invested their life savings in residences Wiener’s plan could radically downgrade.
The bottom line: Some other solution must be sought, because it accomplishes little to begin solving one serious problem while making other problems far worse.

23andMe's Growth Slows; In an interview, CEO Anne Wojcicki says consumers likely concerned about how privacy can collide with social-media, law-enforcement

23andMe Inc.'s sales growth was hit by privacy concerns last year, its chief executive said Thursday, at the same time touting the company's drug development pipeline that she hopes will power its next phase.
"The market definitely slowed last year," said 23andMe co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki, speaking at The Wall Street Journal's Tech Health conference in San Francisco. "My hypothesis is that you have some of the effect from Facebook, people concerned about privacy, you had Golden State killer and so people pause."
23andMe's direct-to-consumer sales increased about 5% in 2018 from 2017, according to credit-card data analyzed by research firm Second Measure. The firm estimates sales growth but not overall revenue. Such growth would be tepid for the highly valued consumer genetics-testing company. Its valuation was last set at $2.4 billion in a 2018 funding round, according to Lagniappe Labs, publisher of the Prime Unicorn Index.
Ms. Wojcicki said the sales estimate was "slightly off," adding that the company's sales grew more.
After this story was published, a 23andMe spokeswoman said that the 5% figure was significantly off but declined to provide a specific figure as the privately held company doesn't release sales data.
Facebook faced controversy over the past year regarding its privacy practices. Investigators announced they solved the decades-old Golden State serial murder and rape case in California using relatives' DNA in a public database. There has been a recent push among privacy experts for greater transparency by testing companies over who gets access to their data.
In recent months, law-enforcement agencies and genealogists have used relatives' DNA and family trees to solve other cold cases. Databases are already large enough that 60% of white Americans can be identified through relatives' DNA and online family trees, according to a study published last year. This week, the president of Family Tree DNA, a large DNA testing company, issued an apology to customers for not informing them in a timely way that it is allowing law-enforcement agencies to submit DNA samples from crime scenes for testing and search for genetic matches in the database.
"The companies need to find ways now to attract people who are not power users but are a little interested in genetic testing or not interested at all," says David Mittelman, former chief scientific officer at Family Tree DNA, who co-wrote a paper about the growth in testing last year in Genome Biology. Dr. Mittelman is also CEO of a DNA sequencing company.
For its next act, 23andMethe company is hoping to use the data it gathers from consumers to develop new drugs. Ms. Wojcicki said the company has developed 13 compounds it hopes will one day become drugs. Two of the compounds she said are in "late stage" testing in animals.
23andMe also signed a $300 million agreement last year giving the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline rights to use genetic data for drug discovery.
In the interview Ms. Wojcicki also hit back at criticism of her company's genetic tests, leveled by the New York Times in an editorial last week. The editorial called the company's tests more "parlor trick than medicine" and said consumers would be better off getting more definitive clinical genetic workups in consultation with a doctor. Ms. Wojcicki said many patients who could benefit from such workups don't qualify for insurance reimbursement for them. She said her company's tests can give them useful information and potentially help them qualify for a more extensive test.
Ms. Wojcicki said the company has no immediate plans to go public in the near future. "I think it sounds awful," she said of transitioning to public markets. "When we have earnings that are like Google and go up 20% every quarter" it would be a better time, she said. "You want to be public when you're super stable and growing."

Cosby moved to 'general population' at Pa. prison

Texto completo: Bill Cosby has been moved to "general population" at his state prison in Pennsylvania and is being treated the same as all inmates, a prison official told the New York Daily News on Thursday.
The move was made Jan. 28 after Cosby spent his first few months in "administrative segregation" at the maximum-security SCI Phoenix facility outside Philadelphia, said Amy Worden, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.
"From what I understand from prison officials, the transition has been smooth and he's happy to be out socializing with folks," she said.
She said Cosby -- like other famous inmates including rapper Meek Mill and disgraced coach Jerry Sandusky -- was "given the chance to acclimate" before staff determined he was ready to move into general population.
Now Cosby is in a single-person cell next to other inmates, must be present for daily counts and eats his meals in the dining hall associated with his particular unit, she said.
He also has access to the day room, the yard, the libraries and settings for religious activities, she said.
Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt disputed the claims in a statement to The News following a story in The New York Times that first reported the move.
"I spent time with Mr. Cosby Thursday and Friday of last week, we knew he was going to be moved to a Veteran's facility on the campus (of SCI Phoenix). He made it clear that he's not in general population but has contact with a trustee that guides him around," Wyatt said.
"He does not eat in the area with other residents; he does not have a cellmate; and he does not exercise with other residents," Wyatt said. "Mr. Cosby is not in general population because that would be detrimental to his safety and security, due to his blindness."
Wyatt then criticized prison officials for releasing information about Cosby's move, despite that such information is public record.
"It's not a matter of debate," Worden told The News when asked to respond to Wyatt's statement. "He misunderstands what general population is. You're either in it or not."
She said Cosby is most certainly classified as general population.
She declined to say if he's being housed in a facility serving veterans but said such a facility exists on the campus and serves inmates classified as general population.
"He's in a specialized unit, but I'm not going to say which one," she said.
Worden said such units include the "honor" unit and units for inmates with special needs.
Beyond their specialized housing assignments, these inmates are "otherwise indistinguishable," she said, with the same routines.
She said Wyatt's claim that Cosby has a "trusty" guiding him around is misleading.
" 'Trusty' is not even a word we use. We don't have trusties; they're inmate assistants who help the disabled," Worden said.
"In his case, it's public knowledge he's visually impaired, so they would help guide him around," she said. "From what I understand from prison staff, he is going to the dining room," she said.
Cosby, 81, was convicted last April on three counts of aggravated indecent assault.
A jury found him guilty of giving former Temple University staffer Andrea Constand a mystery medication and sexually assaulting her while she was incapacitated at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in 2004.
The comedian claimed the encounter was consensual, but the judge allowed several of the more than 60 women now accusing Cosby of sexual assault to testify as so-called prior bad act witnesses.
Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison at a hearing in September.

"It's not a matter of debate," Worden told The News when asked to respond to Wyatt's statement. "He misunderstands what general population is. You're either in it or not."
She said Cosby is most certainly classified as general population.
She declined to say if he's being housed in a facility serving veterans but said such a facility exists on the campus and serves inmates classified as general population.
"He's in a specialized unit, but I'm not going to say which one," she said.
Worden said such units include the "honor" unit and units for inmates with special needs.
Beyond their specialized housing assignments, these inmates are "otherwise indistinguishable," she said, with the same routines.
She said Wyatt's claim that Cosby has a "trusty" guiding him around is misleading.
" 'Trusty' is not even a word we use. We don't have trusties; they're inmate assistants who help the disabled," Worden said.
"In his case, it's public knowledge he's visually impaired, so they would help guide him around," she said. "From what I understand from prison staff, he is going to the dining room," she said.
Cosby, 81, was convicted last April on three counts of aggravated indecent assault.
A jury found him guilty of giving former Temple University staffer Andrea Constand a mystery medication and sexually assaulting her while she was incapacitated at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in 2004.
The comedian claimed the encounter was consensual, but the judge allowed several of the more than 60 women now accusing Cosby of sexual assault to testify as so-called prior bad act witnesses.
Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison at a hearing in September.

Texto completo: The Met's Roof Garden Commission is a rite of summer for New Yorkers and a world stage for artists lucky enough to be chosen. This year's fortunate selection is the Berlin-based artist Alicja Kwade, who will be presenting two abstract sculptures dominated by large metal frames that she described as "a kind of planetary system."
The installation, "ParaPivot," will be on view from April 16 through Oct. 27, the artist's first institutional solo exhibition in New York.
"It's a big honor for an artist," Ms. Kwade said in a telephone interview. "New York still stands for one of the highest levels human beings can reach."
Born in Poland in 1979, Ms. Kwade explores concepts of space, time, science and philosophy through sculpture, video and photography.
Max Hollein, the Met's director, said in a statement that the rooftop setting "presents a compelling site for Kwade, whose works offer an expansive view of the history of art and science."

Her sculpture for the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017, "WeltenLinie (One in a Time)," featured rocks, a tree trunk and chairs surrounded by mirrors. (The New York Times described it as cinematic.) In Central Park in 2015, she created "Against the Run," a 16-foot-tall version of the classic New York City street clock that simultaneously ran backward and forward, while still keeping time, a commission by the Public Art Fund.

Texto completo: Of all the millions of people who have spit into a plastic vial and sent their DNA off to have it analyzed, writer Dani Shapiro might be the most prepared for what happened next.
The core of Shapiro’s work — this bestselling author has written 10 books — has always concerned family issues, those tangled emotional webs we weave around each other and the secrets we keep.
“It has been a huge part of what formed me as a writer — I had an obsession with searching and digging, trying to understand,” Shapiro says, noting that half of her books are memoirs about deep, personal exploration. “I idly wondered why (I kept writing memoirs) but those were the books that continued to present themselves to me as necessary. And that comes very much out of not knowing something and writing in order to try to know.”
Part of what she didn’t know was why, with her fair hair and blue eyes, she barely resembled her parents, both Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe — an otherness remarked upon by people throughout her life.
All is revealed when the results of an Ancestry.com test that she took “on a whim” come back: She is not her beloved father’s biological daughter after all, but the product of artificial insemination her parents turned to when they could not conceive. Why that happened and what meaning Shapiro makes of it is the subject of her riveting new memoir, “Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love.”
“This discovery poured gasoline over everything I thought I knew and threw a match on it,” she says. “Now I see the whole picture.”
Since its release in January, the book has quickly risen to the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction and has already been optioned by Hollywood, a clear indication that both her writing and the topic of family secrets is speaking to the hearts of millions.
“I certainly wanted it to resonate with people who had been through similar experiences or discovered there were family secrets —everybody seems to have them,” said Shapiro in a phone interview while she was on the road for her national book tour that lands in Southern California for several appearances this week.
“Adoptees, people who discover they were donor conceived, or have half siblings — there are so many of those kinds of secrets tumbling out of the closet right now,” she observes.
More like an avalanche.
She notes that in 2018 alone 7 million Ancestry.com kits were purchased — and that doesn’t take into account what might be sold for other commercial DNA services like 23andMe. (DNA kits were the No. 1 holiday gift last year, too.) Shapiro discovered while researching “Inheritance” that out of the 7 million kits, 14 percent revealed what’s known in that industry as ”NPE,” Not Parent Expected: “That’s a huge number of people. Many of them, like me, were just recreational DNA testing.”
The ease and accessibility of these DNA tests herald a historical shift, she believes. “I think this is a moment in our culture when secrets and the impossibility of secrets is reaching a deafening roar,” Shapiro observes. “Paternity, ethnicity — these were secrets people could keep since the beginning of time, and did. And now that is over. I think in a few decades the idea that there ever were these secrets is going to seem like the most ridiculous thing you’d ever heard.”
Yet the exploration she undertakes in this book is even more universal: At the center is the question: How do heredity and history combine to make us who we are?
Says Shapiro: “I was also very aware that I did not only want people that could directly relate to the material to be readers of this book, because I felt I had learned so much in this really sort of harsh and complicated, and ultimately liberating, journey. I learned so much about identity, and family, and what makes a father a father, and about nature and nurture.”
Anyone who knows Shapiro’s work understands that she was close to her father, who died in an accident when she was 23, and distant from her abusive mother. These are themes that have run throughout her work. Reconciling her experience with her biological makeup was the “emotionally challenging” part of her journey to write this book.
“One of the things I had to contend with was the deep suspicion that I was part of my father’s sadness. The man that I tried so hard to make happy. But I don’t think that diminished in any way the love he had for me,” she says. “The irony is my biological parent is the one I felt a deep disconnection from, while my father, who was not my biological parent, was the one to whom I was connected. I think that my mother looked at me for all of our shared life together and found it very challenging because I was her secret. I was a reminder of their infertility; I was not my father’s child and on some very deep animal level, she knew it.”
There’s a moment in “Inheritance” where a friend tells her, “Everyone feels other,” and that she had been the explorer to come back to teach us all something about what that means. “I very much took that to heart,” she says.

A Lost Branch Of Humanity

Texto completo: During the past decade, the Denisova Cave in Siberia has yielded some of the most fascinating fossils ever found. To the naked eye, they are not much to look at - a few teeth, bits of bone.
But the fossils contain DNA dating back tens of thousands of years. That genetic material shows that Denisovans were a distinct branch of human evolution, a lost lineage.
At some point in the distant past, the Denisovans disappeared - but not before interbreeding with modern humans. Today, people in places like East Asia and New Guinea still carry fragments of Denisovan DNA.
One of the biggest obstacles to understanding the Denisovans is their age. Standard methods for dating these fossils have left scientists perplexed.
“Everyone said, ‘These Denisovans, we have no idea how old they are,’” said Katerina Douka, an archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany.
During the past six years, Douka and other experts have been creating a sort of history of the Denisova Cave. They have dated 103 layers of sediment on the cave floor, as well as 50 items found in them, including bones, pieces of charcoal and tools.
The scientists unveiled this chronology in a pair of papers published last week That timeline shows that humans occupied the cave for perhaps as long as 300,000 years. And it raises some intriguing hints that Denisovans may have been capable of sophisticated thought, on par with modern humans.
In an accompanying commentary, Robin Dennell of the University of Exeter in England wrote that Douka and her colleagues have created “a rigorous and compelling timeline.”
Denisova Cave sits about 30 yards above the Anuy River. The cave has a large main chamber with a high ceiling; from there, passageways lead to smaller chambers. Over the past few hundred thousand years, sediment has slowly built up on the cave floor.
In the 1970s, Russian scientists began digging into that sediment, finding fossils of animals like hyenas and bears, fragments of humanlike bones and thousands of stone tools, as well as bracelets, beads and other ornaments.
In 2010, researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology announced they had found DNA in teeth and bones from the cave. In addition to Denisovan DNA, they found a few bone fragments that contained Neanderthal DNA.
By comparing the mutations in this DNA, the scientists got a better sense of how Denisovans and Neanderthals fit into the human family tree.
As it turned out, modern humans share a common ancestor with Denisovans and Neanderthals that lived roughly 600,000 years ago. Later - approximately 400,000 years ago - the Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages split.
Ever since the digging began, Russian researchers have carefully mapped the sedimentary layers in which they found bones and tools. They tried to estimate the ages of the layers, but “the dates were all over the place,” Douka said.
She and her colleagues at the University of Oxford are experts on determining the age of carbon. Researchers from the University of Wollongong in Australia tried an alternate method called optical dating.
The researchers combined results from the two methods to assemble a single chronology of the cave. The findings are largely in agreement: “It’s definitely a unified story,” said Zenobia Jacobs, an archaeologist at the University of Wollongong.
The earliest signs of human life in the cave - simple stone tools - are more than 287,000 years old. The tools alone cannot tell us if those first people were Denisovans or Neanderthals.
But they are not the style known to be made by Neanderthals, suggesting Denisovans may have been the creators.
It’s not until about 200,000 years ago that the oldest Denisovan DNA comes to light. The researchers estimated it to be between 217,000 and 185,000 years old. A Neanderthal DNA sample comes from a layer that formed between 205,000 and 172,000 years ago.
In August, researchers reported a bone fragment from a girl whose mother was a Neanderthal and father was a Denisovan. In the new study, researchers estimate that this hybrid child lived between 79,100 and 118,100 years ago.
The researchers found no Neanderthal remains in more recent layers of the cave floor - only Denisovan. A Denisovan tooth dates back to between 55,300 and 84,100 years ago; a Denisovan chip of bone is 51,600 to 76,200 years old.
Paradoxically, the most recent parts of the cave have yielded some of its biggest mysteries.
Starting about 45,000 years ago, new kinds of artifacts begin showing up in the cave floor. They include pointed pieces of bone, as well as ornaments like stone bracelets and beads. One possibility is that these new tools were made by newly arrived modern humans.
Modern humans evolved in Africa and then expanded out to other continents. They may have made it to what is now Siberia: One human fossil discovered there dates to about 45,000 years ago.
But Michael Shunkov, co-author of the new studies and director of Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography at the Russian Academy of Sciences, disagrees with that interpretation.
The sophisticated tools in the Denisova Cave show “no clear indications for outside influences,” he said in an email. Instead, Shunkov believes that the Denisovans who occupied the cave for perhaps 250,000 years developed this technology on their own.

Texto completo: Responding to critics who say her new book contains plagiarized material, former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson acknowledged Thursday that the “language is too close in some cases" and changes will be made.
Abramson had initially rebutted the accusations involving “Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," tweeting that she “endeavored to accurately and properly give attribution to the hundreds of sources that were part of my research." Abramson and her publisher, Simon & Schuster, did promise to review the passages in question.
Yesterday's reversal was only the latest in what has been a rocky launch for Abramson's examination of disruption in the news industry over the past decade. Last month, current and former Vice journalists got their hands on a galley and said it contained multiple inaccuracies. Some of those concerns were addressed in the final version of the book, which arrived in stores this week.
On Thursday afternoon, Abramson, now a senior lecturer at Harvard, issued a statement saying: “I was up all night going through my book because I take these claims of plagiarism so seriously. . . . I tried above all to accurately and properly give attribution to the many hundreds of sources that were part of my research. My book has 70 pages of footnotes, and nearly 100 source citations in the Vice chapters alone. . . . The notes don't match up with the right pages in a few cases, and this was unintentional and will be promptly corrected. The language is too close in some cases and should have been cited as quotations in the text. This, too, will be fixed. I wouldn't want even a misplaced comma so I will promptly fix these footnotes and quotations as I have corrected other material that Vice contested."
The plagiarism allegations were leveled on Twitter Wednesday by Vice News's Michael Moynihan, who compared sections from Abramson's book with passages from other publications, including Ryerson Review of Journalism, The New Yorker, Time Out, and Columbia Journalism Review. Writer Ian Frisch, the former editor of Relapse Magazine, also tweeted that Abramson's book included, without proper attribution, material from a 2014 profile he wrote about Vice's Thomas Morton.
One of the passages cited by Moynihan is from a 2005 story in Ryerson Review of Journalism about Vice Media cofounder Gavin Miles: “In August 2003, McInnes wrote a column in The American Conservative, a magazine run by Pat Buchanan. In the magazine, he called young people a bunch of knee-jerk liberals (a phrase McInnes and his cronies use often) who'll believe anyone with dark skin over anyone with light skin. He laments the liberal views of most of the people who pick up his magazine, saying they're 'brainwashed by communist propaganda.' "
On page 50 of her book, Abramson writes: “He wrote a column in The American Conservative, a magazine run by Pat Buchanan, calling young people a bunch of knee-jerk liberals (a phrase McInnes and his ilk often used) who would believe anyone with dark skin over anyone with light skin. He lamented the liberal views of his magazine's readers, saying they were 'brainwashed by communist propaganda.' "
During an appearance Wednesday on Fox News, Abramson didn't respond to individual claims, saying “All I can tell you is I certainly didn't plagiarize in my book, and there's 70 pages of footnotes showing where I got the information."
But some in the publishing industry said footnotes are sometimes not enough.
“The real problem," says literary agent and lawyer John Taylor “Ike" Williams, a founder of Kneerim & Williams, “is that if you're quoting or very closely summarizing someone's work and don't put it in quotes to show it's not your work, or identify the creator of the work on the page it appears, all the footnotes or endnotes in the world won't protect you from charges of plagiarism even if your use of others' work is too insubstantial to amount to copyright infringement."
In her statement Thursday, Abramson, who'll be at Harvard Book Store Feb. 19, said she stands by the substance of her book, which looks at the various paths taken by legacy media organizations The New York Times and The Washington Post and digital newcomers Vice News and BuzzFeed.
“All of the ideas in the book are original, all the opinions are mine," she said. “The passages in question involve facts that should have been perfectly cited in my footnotes and weren't."

Texto completo: Filmmaker Woody Allen sued Amazon Studios, claiming breach of contract for refusing to distribute his most recent movie, "A Rainy Day in New York," and terminating a four-picture production and distribution deal without cause.
In a suit filed Thursday in federal court in the Southern District of New York seeking more than $68 million in damages, Mr. Allen said Amazon backed out of his deal last June after an old accusation that the director and actor had molested his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, in 1992 resurfaced as the #MeToo movement was gathering steam.
"Amazon has tried to excuse its action by referencing a 25-year-old baseless allegation against Mr. Allen, but that allegation was already well-known to Amazon (and the public) before Amazon entered into four separate deals with Mr. Allen—and in any event, it does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract," the suit said.
In recent years, Ms. Farrow has become more vocal about her accusation against Mr. Allen and in a 2014 New York Times piece criticized those who have worked with him.
Since her column and a 2018 television interview with Ms. Farrow on "CBS This Morning" detailing the allegation, some actors and actresses have publicly expressed remorse about appearing in Mr. Allen's movies.
Mr. Allen has continued to deny the accusation by Ms. Farrow and her mother, Mia Farrow, who was his longtime partner. Mr. Allen was investigated by the Connecticut State Attorney but wasn't charged.
Mr. Allen's suit alleges that cracks in his relationship with Amazon started to appear in late 2017 after Roy Price resigned as president of Amazon Studios in the wake of harassment allegations made against him by a producer on an Amazon show. Mr. Price was also under fire for his business ties to movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault. Both Messrs. Price and Weinstein have disputed those allegations.
In the suit, Mr. Allen said Amazon executives reached out to his representatives in December 2017 "and discussed the negative publicity and reputation harm Amazon Studios had received because of allegations" made against Mr. Price and its association with Mr. Weinstein. An agreement was reached to push the release of "A Rainy Day in New York" to 2019 from 2018.
However, last June, Amazon Studios Associate General Counsel Ajay Patel emailed Mr. Allen's representatives a termination notice. Amazon, the suit said, didn't provide any "legal or factual basis" for the termination.
"I don't know whether you'd call this hubris or just shortsightedness on Amazon's part—but this is clearly not an acceptable way to behave in the business world," said Mr. Allen's attorney, John Quinn of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.
Pressed by Mr. Allen's camp as to why the deal was terminated, Amazon's Mr. Patel said it had become "untenable" because of "supervening events, including renewed allegations against Mr. Allen, his own controversial comments, and the increasing refusal of top talent to work with or be associated with him in any way, all of which have frustrated the purpose of the agreement," according to the suit.
Amazon, the suit said, didn't respond to Mr. Allen's request to explain what it was referring to by "renewed allegations," "controversial comments" and "top talent."
An Amazon Studios spokeswoman declined to comment. Amazon Studios is a unit of Amazon.com Inc.
A winner of multiple Oscars, Mr. Allen has been in professional limbo since Amazon ended his deal, and he is looking for a new distributor of his films.
The relationship between Amazon Studios and Mr. Allen dates back to 2014 when he reached a deal with the retail giant's then-fledgling streaming service to distribute the limited series "Crisis in Six Scenes."
In 2016, Amazon made its first movie deal with Mr. Allen and his production company Gravier Productions, a distribution partnership for his movie "Cafe Society." That was followed by another distribution deal for his film "Wonder Wheel."
In August 2017, Amazon signed a multi-picture agreement with Mr. Allen, and Mr. Price said at the time that the auteur was "one of the most dynamic and compelling filmmakers of our time."
Under the terms of the deal outlined in the suit, Amazon agreed to pay Mr. Allen's Gravier Productions a minimum guarantee of $9 million a movie as well as distribute them in major-market theaters in the U.S. for 90 days and a minimum of 500 screens.
Amazon also said it would pay Gravier a minimum guarantee equal to the gross budget of each of Mr. Allen's films between $25 million and $27.5 million.

Texto completo: Kristaps Porzingis provided a list of four desired destinations when he requested a trade in a shotgun meeting, but the Knicks had already quietly negotiated a deal after shopping the Latvian for a month.
These details were revealed Tuesday by the New York Times, which portrayed both Porzingis and the Knicks as ready to move on from one another long before he was officially traded to the Mavericks.
According to the story, the Knicks became aware of Porzingis' discontent at the beginning of January - right around the time the Daily News reported his re-signing was not guaranteed because of a desire to play for a winner.
After failing to pry Donovan Mitchell out of Utah, De'Aaron Fox out of Sacramento and Anthony Davis out of New Orleans, the Knicks settled for cap space and two first-round picks from the Mavericks for Porzingis. According to the NY Times, the Knicks could've pulled the trigger on the trade Wednesday evening but first wanted to hear from Porzingis in their planned sitdown Thursday.
The meeting was a mere formality. A source told the News it lasted between two and three minutes. The Knicks wanted to pull the trigger, got the sentiment they expected from Porzingis and quickly the circumstances were leaked to the media. Within an hour of the meeting going public, news circulated that Porzingis was traded to the Mavericks.
The Knicks' front office, according to a source, did not believe in Porzingis as the franchise star. It had valid reasons too: The 23-year-old is coming off ACL surgery, struggled to stay on the court previously because of other injuries and faded in the second half of seasons.
But instead of using those concerns to justify the trade, the Knicks wanted to send the message their hands were tied by Porzingis' malcontent and his puppeteer brother. It's an easier sell to a fanbase that idolized Porzingis, especially after years of the Knicks pumping him up as the savior of New York.
This comes from the same team that employed Carmelo Anthony's brand manager, allowed Anthony's agency - CAA - to influence moves, employed Amar'e Stoudemire's security guard and gave JR Smith's brother a contract because he was JR Smith's brother. Whether or not Porzingis deserved superstar treatment is debatable, but it was hypocritical for the Knicks to accuse him and his brother, Janis, of being too demanding.
Since Porzingis will be a restricted free agent this summer, the Knicks could've matched any offer.
If Porzingis still declined to sign with the Knicks, he would've had to play next season on a drastically reduced salary to become an unrestricted free agent in 2020. The Knicks had an opportunity to sign Porzingis to a five-year deal before the season but declined to offer it.

Questions &#xa0;of cost and quality of care

Texto completo: Merger? Acquisition? Affiliation? Combination? It doesn’t matter so much what Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health and GraniteOne Health choose to call their recently announced intention to join forces. Of more interest is whether their proposal is driven by patient care or market share.
The CEOs of D-H health system, which includes its flagship academic medical center in Lebanon and a network of smaller hospitals, and Manchester-based GraniteOne, which includes Catholic Medical Center and two community hospitals, say their proposed “combination” would result in cost savings, increased access to capital for infrastructure investments, and improved access to care, and in particular to specialty services. (Not to mention fulfilling D-H’s long-cherished desire to increase its presence in populous southern New Hampshire.)
It will be a challenge for the two systems to demonstrate conclusively the potential benefits of this consolidation in terms of cost and quality of care. A number of studies have found no such link. For example, a recent New York Times analysis of hospital consolidation in 25 metropolitan areas from 2010 through 2013 found that in many cases, prices for consumers increased as competition waned, driving up health care costs. A 2016 article in Harvard Business Review concluded, based on years of research by one of its authors, that “provider consolidation typically raises prices, with no measurable impact” on quality of care.
So we wonder why the D-H and GraniteOne partnership would be an exception and what models they looked to in formulating their plans. In particular, are they willing to commit to lower costs, improved quality of patient care and increased access to services throughout their combined system, which would be vast by New Hampshire standards? (Their combined annual operating budgets total $2.6 billion.) Will patient outcomes improve while prices go down? Will there be shorter waiting times for appointments? Will patients continue to enjoy access to all the services they now utilize? Will pricing become transparent? What metrics will be established to measure how well the new system is performing in meeting these and other commitments?
Regrettably, consumers themselves typically have little meaningful voice in determining whether such combinations would benefit them. That role is assigned to state and federal regulators, and the proposed new venture — to be called Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health GraniteOne — must still pass muster with them.
But there is ample reason to question whether the state is in good position to scrutinize an affiliation of this size, scope and sophistication. The Legislature allowed the Certificate of Need process, which provided detailed oversight of mergers, affiliations and large construction projects involving hospitals and other health care facilities to lapse in 2016. In most cases, this leaves the Charitable Trusts Unit within the Attorney General’s Office as the sole evaluator of proposed mergers. That’s because the vast majority of New Hampshire hospitals are nonprofits, such as Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Catholic Medical Center. And as the Concord Monitor reported last month, it’s far from clear that the Charitable Trusts Unit has the authority to access all the information it might need to ensure that patients, and the state as a whole, would benefit. Lucy Hodder, a University of New Hampshire law professor who specializes in health policy, told the Monitor that New Hampshire need look no further than Vermont and Massachusetts to find far more robust state oversight of health care mergers and acquisitions.
Or “combination,” as the two health systems prefer to call it. Ironically, there was a time in America — during the Progressive Era, from the late 1890s to the 1920s — when “combination” was a red flag for trust-busters. In fact, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, still in force, outlaws “every contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade.”
On the other hand, if D-H and GraniteOne can demonstrate that their proposed combination would unlock better and cheaper health care in New Hampshire, that would be a good outcome for patients and the state as a whole.

TRUMP CALLS FOR UNITY, SECURITY 'WE MUST REJECT THE POLITICS OF REVENGE, RESISTANCE AND RETRIBUTION'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump stressed unity and optimism to a divided Congress in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, making a plea for bipartisanship in pointing out that the country hopes that "we will govern not as two parties, but as one nation."
"We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good," Mr. Trump said.
He added, "Together we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, and forge new solutions to unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make."
Later in his speech, in vowing to fight anti-Semitism wherever it is found, Mr. Trump introduced two of his invited guests from Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh police Officer Timothy Matson, who was shot while confronting a gunman who killed 11 at the Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, and Judah Samet, a Holocaust survivor who arrived for services as the gunman opened fire.
Each was greeted with extended applause in the House chamber, but Mr. Samet got an extra treat. When Mr. Trump mentioned that it was Mr. Samet's 81st birthday, lawmakers and guests began singing "Happy Birthday."
"They wouldn't do that for me, Judah," Mr. Trump said at the conclusion of the song.
The early part of Mr. Trump's speech was notable for who was behind him: newly anointed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a frequent Democratic foe who forced him to reschedule the speech from Jan. 23 when the shutdown was still ongoing.
Early on, Mr. Trump mentioned the importance of working to defend American jobs, revitalize the nation's infrastructure, reduce the price of health care and "create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure."
Mr. Trump, who is at the mid-point of his first term, looked both ahead toward an optimistic vision and behind at accomplishments, which he ticked off one after the other. He touted an "unprecedented economic boom," the likes of which "has rarely been seen before."
"The fact is, we are just getting started," Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump made a forceful pitch for the border wall that has become one of the most divisive issues in Congress, with Democrats refusing to pay for it and the president nixing a budget deal without funding for it.
"In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall -- but the proper wall never got built," Mr. Trump said. "I'll get it built."
Mr. Trump said both parties must come together to confront the "crisis" at the southern border - a dim picture he painted of lethal drugs crossing the border and killing Americans and "countless Americans" murdered by illegal immigrants every year.
The solution, he said, is for Congress to pass a proposal sent by the administration that would include a physical barrier on the border as well as more law enforcement and drug detection at ports of entry.
"The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border," Mr. Trump said. "Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business."
Inside the chamber, divisions were visible, with most Democratic women in the House wearing white as a coordinated symbol of their fight for reproductive rights, equal pay and more affordable health care.
When Mr. Trump talked of the border wall, Republicans stood and applauded enthusiastically, Democrats sat, many with their arms folded.
But even the women in white found something to applaud, when the president said, "No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year." As they cheered, the president ad-libbed, ""Don't sit down yet," and continued by noting that exactly 100 years after women got the right to vote, there are more women serving in Congress than ever before. The women rose again, pumped their fists, high-fived and broke out in a chant of "USA," which Republicans joined them in.
The president talked much of his commitment to reverse "decades of calamitous trade policies," a topic that has varied support in both parties.
Mr. Trump said he is working on a new trade deal with China that "must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs" - and touted recently imposed tariffs on Chinese goods.
Having stumped for new trade policies that would give him broad authority to raise tariffs to "reciprocal levels" on imports wherever he sees unfair treatment of U.S. exports, he urged Congress to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act.
U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, has supported Mr. Trump's approach, though he said he wants tariffs and quotas to be applied strategically.
"A lot of us that have watched the suffering that took place in manufacturing and the steel industry have sympathy for the fact that the trade laws, as they're currently written, have worked to our disadvantage," Mr. Doyle said. "If we can make that fairer and have China and others play by the same rules that we play by, yeah, I think there's support in our neck of the woods for that. It's an area where we can find common ground on."
Mr. Trump said he is focused on passing an infrastructure bill, which he called a "necessity," and raised the idea of requiring drug and insurance companies and hospitals to disclose prices of prescription drugs to bring costs down.
The president also talked of fighting childhood cancer with help from $500 million over the next 10 years, which he'll ask Congress for in the budget.
On national security, he praised his administration's decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia because they "repeatedly violated its terms."
"Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't -- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far," Mr. Trump said.
In his first address in a House chamber under Democratic control, Mr. Trump's talk of bridge-building and reaching across the aisle is sure to leave some Republicans optimistic and some Democrats skeptical.
Members of both parties in Pennsylvania's congressional delegation responded rapidly.
"The president says he's focused on national security, but his policies over the past two years embolden our adversaries, undermine our relationships with allies, and make America less safe," Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Montgomery, tweeted.
Republicans like U.S. Rep. John Joyce, R-Blair, are encouraged by the course Mr. Trump set.
"He made it clear to all Americans that we are moving full speed ahead on a path to prosperity," said Mr. Joyce, who credited tax cuts and aggressive trade policies for strengthening the economy and reducing unemployment.
Guy Reschenthaler, a Republican congressman from Peters, called Mr. Trump's vision "inspiring," and urged his colleagues to cast aside partisan politics to "work across the aisle on common sense, bipartisan solutions to reform our broken immigration system."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON —
Urging Congress to “reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution,” President Donald Trump urged Congress to approve his nominees, spend the money for his much-touted wall along the U.S.–Mexico border and stop investigating him.
Arguing that his administration is responsible for “an economic miracle,” he argued that “the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations.”
“If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,” he said as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to suppress a laugh behind him.
Trump was hoping for unity
In a speech billed as aimed at unifying the country during one of its most politically divided moments in recent history, Trump urged Washington to turn a corner and heal the divisions that literally brought large parts of the government to a halt during the first month of this year.
He urged the nation to “break decades of political stalemate, bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.”
“Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream,” he said, adding “We must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them.”
Yet for all his talk of unity, Trump plunged into the divisive issues of abortion rights and immigration, while suggesting that some Democrats are issuing “new calls to adopt socialism in our country.”
Trump goes after left wing of the Democratic Party
Although no Democratic presidential candidate has adopted a Socialist platform, Trump declared to loud applause from Republican lawmakers that “America was founded on liberty and independence and not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”
He delivered his address at a time when his poll numbers are sagging and those of Pelosi, D-Calif., are rising. Voters clearly held Trump and the Republicans responsible for a partial shutdown of the federal government in December and January — the longest such shutdown in history.

Focus on the economy
Despite the polarized nature of Washington, the night had its moments of levity. When Trump pointed out that “no one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women,” both sides of the chamber, including dozens of the newly elected Democratic women who helped win the House majority last fall, stood up and cheered enthusiastically.
“You weren’t supposed to do that,” Trump ad-libbed wryly.
But he decided to embrace the applause, telling the Democratic women, mostly dressed in white in honor of women’s suffrage, “don’t sit yet, you’re going to like this,” before pointing out that “exactly one century after the Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.” The crowd erupted into chants of “U.S.A! U.S.A!”

Trump, who has made it clear in comments and tweets throughout his presidency that he does not believe he gets enough credit for the strong economy, once again defended his two-year-old presidency, saying “our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on Earth by far, and America is again winning each and every day.”
But despite those achievements and the strong economy, Trump’s approval ratings have sagged, in large part because of his chaotic governing style.
Immigration remains sticking point
Trump has infuriated Democrats with his demands for a $5.7 billion barrier along hundreds of miles of the U.S.–Mexico border — a demand that provoked the 35-day government shutdown.
He devoted a significant portion of his address to immigration, with Trump declaring “no issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.”
“The lawless state of our Southern border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans,” he said. “We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.”
He also waded into abortion rights, calling on Congress to approve a ban on late-term abortions. In sharp language, he denounced the New York legislature for passing a bill he claimed “would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth.”
Trump is meeting with North Korean leader
Trump also claimed that had he “not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.”
He announced that at the end of this month during a trip to Vietnam he would meet for the second time North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Un in an effort to persuade North Korea to end its nuclear weapons’ program.

Ashley Evans: Local woman going to SOTU
Local woman get’s a front-row seat
Among those watching from the galleries was Ashley Evans, a Kettering native who just passed one year in recovery from an opioid addiction. Evans, who now lives in an apartment in Columbus, was among the 11 guests of Mrs. Trump, who watched the speech seated next to the first lady.
Evans had a whirlwind day even before Trump began speaking. Just before 6 p.m. Tuesday she met Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen in the vice president’s office in the Executive Office Building next to the White House.
“He thanked me for coming and I told him that I was honored to be there and excited to be here,” Evans said Tuesday. “His wife said something along the lines that she was very proud of me and I am a shining star.”

Texto completo: Two years ago, when President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress for the first time, Rep. Nancy Pelosi's Democrats in the House chamber acted as if they were part of a "resistance" against some sort of "authoritarian" dictator. They refused to applaud even for lines that were objectionable to no one outside of ISIS. Two years later our political process and our liberties are alive and well and Democrats ought to extend the normal courtesies to our duly-elected President.
An authoritarian demands obedience from an entire society. Recent events show that Mr. Trump isn't even enforcing it among his own employees. Recently this column noted that some media observers are finally giving up on the Trump "authoritarian" thesis:
Almost two years into the Trump presidency even left-leaning pundits are starting to acknowledge that reports of the demise of our republic were greatly exaggerated...
As for the once-popular media theory that Mr. Trump represented a unique and grave threat to constitutional governance, columnist Doyle McManus writes in the Los Angeles Times that "the specter of an autocratic president running roughshod over democratic institutions has ebbed."
To be sure, it's a conclusion that many members of the press corps still want to avoid reaching. Mr. McManus's colleagues on the Times editorial board recently railed against what they called Mr. Trump's "disturbingly authoritarian view of the presidency." But a few recent events have made it harder to cling to this position.
Yet another former Trump aide wrote yet another book critical of the White House. And it's not just former employees who feel free to criticize. Shannon Vavra of the website Axios recently ran a story called "All the times Trump's intelligence officials contradicted him."
Sometimes they all contradict him at once. Last week the New York Times noted :
A new American intelligence assessment of global threats has concluded that North Korea is unlikely to give up its nuclear stockpiles and that Iran is not, for now, taking steps necessary to make a bomb, directly contradicting the rationale of two of President Trump's foreign policy initiatives.
Those conclusions are part of an annual "Worldwide Threat Assessment" released on Tuesday that also stressed the growing cyberthreat from Russia and China, which it said were now "more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s."
The 42-page threat report found that American trade policies and "unilateralism" — central themes of Mr. Trump's "America First" approach — have strained traditional alliances and prompted foreign partners to seek new relationships.
Mr. Trump responded, not as authoritarians do by having his intel chiefs shot or exiled to Siberia, but by calling them "naive" and tweeting his dissenting view.
And now comes this news from the Associated Press:
The Senate voted Monday to oppose the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan, breaking with President Donald Trump as he calls for a military drawdown in those countries.
Senators voted 70-26 for the amendment sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The measure says the Islamic State group and al-Qaida militants still pose a serious threat to the United States, and it warns that "a precipitous withdrawal" of U.S. forces from those countries could "allow terrorists to regroup, destabilize critical regions and create vacuums that could be filled by Iran or Russia."
Trump abruptly tweeted plans for a U.S. pullout from Syria in December, arguing that the Islamic State group had been defeated even though his intelligence chiefs have said it remains a threat. Trump also ordered the military to develop plans to remove up to half of the 14,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
It seems that Mr. Trump intends to stop waging war even though many of his country's legislators and even some of his own staff think he should continue. What kind of authoritarian does that?

Texto completo: NEW YORK — C. Y. Lee, whose novel "The Flower Drum Song" became a best seller and the basis for a popular stage musical and Oscar-nominated film despite mixed critical reactions and concerns about stereotypes, has died at age 102.
Lee's son, Jay Lee, told The Associated Press that his father died Nov. 8 in Los Angeles. The family decided at the time not to make his death public.
"The Flower Drum Song," a story of generational conflict set in San Francisco's Chinatown, came out in 1957, and quickly became a popular read. The New York Times' Idwal Jones praised Lee's "objective eye," but also faulted the book for its absence of "deeper notes" and its affinity for "slang and sex" and "popular taste. " (The author would later acknowledge he wanted to reach a large audience).
Lee's debut novel attracted the attention of screenwriter Joseph Fields and composers Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Their musical adaptation, originally directed by Gene Kelly, ran on Broadway from 1958-60 and was revived in 2002, with a book by "M. Butterfly" playwright David Henry Hwang. A 1961 film version, among the first major Hollywood productions to feature an Asian cast, received five Academy Award nominations despite being called by The New Yorker an "elaborate fraud" and a showcase for crude stereotypes.
Lee has since been praised as among the first Asian novelists to break through commercially in the U. S. and Hwang is among those who thought the book underrated. "Flower Drum Song" was out of print at the time Hwang worked on the Broadway revival and he had to track it down from a Seattle book seller.
"I thought, 'Oh, it's such a shame this author and this book have been lost, particularly the bittersweet tone of the novel,'" Hwang told the AP in 2001.
"C. Y. 's book is complicated in terms of texture about what it means to be an American — the things you gain and the things you lose — but it ultimately affirms the value of this social experience. "
A native of China who emigrated to the U. S. during World War II, Chin Yang Lee wrote several other novels, including "China Saga" and "Gate of Rage," based on pro-democracy protests in 1989 centered on Tiananmen Square.
He spent more than a year writing "Flower Drum Song," and at the time was renting a small apartment above a Filipino nightclub in San Francisco. He was employed at the time by a Chinese-language newspaper, for which he wrote stories for elderly readers. For his novel, he drew upon his observations about the difference between older immigrants and their more assimilated children.
"In Chinatown, I knew everything that was going on," he told the AP in 2002. "Out of that I created characters, using everybody including my own family and my friends, plus a lot of invention from the air. "
Lee struggled to find a publisher. After more than a dozen rejections, he was warned by his agent that he might have to "think of another profession. "
"But then the novel landed at the sick bed of an 80-year-old gentleman, who was a reader for a highbrow publishing house (Farrar, Straus)," Lee told the AP. "He was quite ill, but he read it. He didn't have the energy to write a two- or three-page critique. He wrote only two words — 'Read this' — and died.
"Without those two words, the novel would have never been published. "

Texto completo: A U. S. professor is deeming the classic 1964 film "Mary Poppins" racist, accusing Julie Andrews of "blacking up" her face with soot while dancing with chimney sweeps.
In a New York Times op-ed called "'Mary Poppins,' and a Nanny’s Shameful Flirting With Blackface," Professor Daniel Pollack-Pelzner slammed the iconic dance scene where Poppins joins Dick Van Dyke's Bert on a rooftop for the song "Step In Time. "
"When the magical nanny … accompanies her young charges, Michael and Jane Banks, up their chimney, her face gets covered in soot, but instead of wiping it off, she gamely powders her nose and cheeks even blacker," Pollack-Pelzner wrote.
Related: Julie Andrews and Emily Blunt were both new moms making 'Mary Poppins'
The Linfield College literature professor linked the scene to racism in P. L. Travers' novels, which he claims "associate chimney sweeps’ blackened faces with racial caricatures. "
Pollack-Pelzner also took aim at naval officer Admiral Boom, who ordered his cannons fired at the "cheeky devils" on the roof after mistaking the dark figures of the chimney sweeps for "Hottentots," a racial slur.
"These aren’t really black Africans; they’re grinning white dancers in blackface," he wrote. "It’s a parody of black menace; it’s even posted on a white nationalist website as evidence of the film’s racial hierarchy. "
‘Mary Poppins Returns’: Everything we know about the musical sequel
Pollack-Pelzner's observations didn't sit well with many fans of the classic family film.
@Sherri_Garver questioned: "Ummm Seriously? #MaryPoppins is now in the Cross hair? THEY WERE CHIMNEY SWEEPERS!!! NOT "BLACK FACE IMPERSONATORS. "
"Mary Poppins wasn’t flirting with black face! It was soot in their faces from being a chimney!" user @Jencon1978 added. "Stopped spreading racism claims on non racist things like this!"
@AmandaEliasch said it's the, "end of the world when Hollywood thinks Mary Poppins is racist. "
And user @coldxman said, "People are searching for racism like it's oil. … If it were a literal commodity, however, it's value would be through the roof at this moment in history. "
The Emily Blunt-led 2018 sequel "Mary Poppins Returns" is currently nominated for several Academy Awards, including best costume design, production design and original score, as well as best original song for "The Place Where Lost Things Go. "

Record Stock Buybacks Draw Fire From Democratic Presidential Hopefuls; Wall Street is divided over the impact buybacks have on the broader U.S. economy

Texto completo: At least five declared or likely Democratic presidential candidates want to restrict how much stock U.S. companies can buy back from shareholders, raising the chance a common tool used by public companies and relied on by investors could become an election issue.
The campaign against buybacks by liberal Democrats—including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats—comes as the nation's largest companies have repurchased shares at a record pace that analysts attribute in part to the tax law passed by Congress in 2017.
Democrats argue that buybacks enrich executives and shareholders at the expense of workers and long-term economic growth. Investors generally oppose legislation that would restrict corporate investing decisions, but Wall Street is divided over the impact buybacks have on the broader U.S. economy.
In a buyback, a company uses its cash to repurchase existing shares, reducing its share count and as a result typically increasing the stock price.
The practice has drawn criticism from those who contend buybacks amount to financial engineering to boost share prices and executive bonuses; others say the practice shortchanges the economy by directing back into the stock market funds that could have gone directly to workers. Proponents of share buybacks argue that they can unlock unused cash for investing elsewhere.
The latest salvo came in a Sunday op-ed in the New York Times by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Mr. Sanders of Vermont. The two plan to propose legislation that would force public companies to provide higher wages and more robust benefits for workers as a condition for launching buyback plans.
"The goal is to curtail the overreliance on buybacks while also incentivizing the productive investment of corporate capital," Messrs. Schumer and Sanders wrote.
The plan is unlikely to become law soon, with Republicans opposed to restricting buybacks in control of the Senate and White House.
Some studies show that research, development and other capital expenditures are unaffected at companies that offer buybacks. An August study by MSCI Inc. , the world's largest index provider, "did not find evidence that companies might be diverting resources to buybacks instead of reinvesting in their companies."
"Buybacks do create value," said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive of Adams Funds. "It may not be the value everyone wants, but it does create value for shareholders."
Firms that buy back their own stock have tended to outperform the broader stock market, according to Goldman Sachs. So far this year, Goldman's so-called buyback basket—including significant repurchases by Apple Inc., Boeing Co. and Best Buy Co.—has risen 9.2% through Jan. 28, compared with a 6.4% gain for the S&P 500.
U.S. corporate buyback spending is projected to hit a record $940 billion for 2019, exceeding the $770 billion spent in 2018 and the previous high of $588 billion in 2015, according to Goldman Sachs. Qualcomm Inc., for instance, spent $21.2 billion on share repurchases in the third quarter, more than any other S&P 500 company, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The jump has given Democrats an opening to argue that repurchases are largely benefiting corporate executives and large shareholders rather than workers and the broader economy.
Democrats have also called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to change its rules governing how company executives can benefit from repurchasing programs. Last June, 20 Democratic senators and one independent wrote to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton asking the commission to consider whether company insiders should be able to sell their personal shares in the immediate aftermath of a buyback announcement. The signatories included declared or likely presidential candidates Sens. Cory Booker, Sherrod Brown, Warren and Gillibrand.
House Democrats also plan to use their new majority to scrutinize stock buybacks, according to a House Democratic aide.
A spokesperson for Mr. Clayton declined to comment. In December testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Clayton said companies should be responsible for determining whether they had appropriate compensation guidelines.
"If the motivation is driven by a compensation scheme, I think that's something compensation committees ought to be looking at," Mr. Clayton said.
A new SEC chairman under a Democratic president could overhaul rules for how corporate insiders use buybacks, even if legislation fails.
SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson, the sole Democrat on the SEC, has proposed removing legal protections companies enjoy when pursuing buybacks. He also would require firms to explain to investors why an executive's cashing out is in the company's long-term interests.
"I am deeply concerned whether these rules protect investors, workers, and communities from the torrent of corporate trading dominating today's markets," Mr. Jackson said.
Many investors say they welcome repurchases, as long as companies make the decision as part of a long-term capital-allocation plan.
"Share buybacks are a positive for the market, especially when it's done opportunistically and at good prices," said Tony Scherrer, director of research and co-portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management.

Texto completo: Michael told reporters that an emergency-room physician said several times there was no sign of alcohol in Gerald's system. But more than that,
Michael just wants people to remember his son as he was: bold, caring and full of conviction.
The real, deep grief over his oldest son's passing will set in any day now, but sifting through his dorm room on the University of Iowa campus Friday, Michael Belz said that emotion was pushed aside by the tasks at hand.
Michael and his son's girlfriend waded through Gerald Belz's belongings, searching for items to put in his casket.
The possessions are all that remain of the young man many are quick to describe as compassionate, fiercely driven and tough. The two found the blue cap Gerald wore constantly, but searched for the rosary he kept tucked safely away.
Before Gerald's death, Michael had planned to give the battery in his son's truck a jump on Friday. Instead, he and Gerald's girlfriend searched the vehicle for the missing rosary that afternoon.
Gerald Belz, who would have been 19 next week, was found unresponsive by a police officer outside a campus hall just before 3 a.m. Wednesday, around the time wind chill in Iowa City reached 51 degrees below zero. Belz was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
That morning, Michael Belz received a call notifying him of his oldest son's death.
"Disbelief," Michael said. "I was yelling in the hallway. I think that's what woke my son up, my younger son."
In the wake Gerald's death, Michael was also looking for answers as to why his son was outside at that hour instead of in his dorm room.
"We're kind of looking around to see if we can find any clues that the investigators have overlooked," he said. "Things that might seem out of place or out of the ordinary. It's been a while since I've been down here, so I really didn't know what his room looked like."
Police are attributing his death to exposure to the weather and have said they do not suspect foul play. UI police, as well as Michael Belz, have declined to say anything about the investigation's findings.
Belz is one of at least eight people in the Midwest believed to have died from exposure to cold as the Arctic's polar vortex expanded deep into the United States. But his father wanted Gerald to be remembered for his kind heart, not for the last moments of his life.
In grief and shock, Michael called a local television station just hours after police notified him of his son's death. He wanted to put an end to comments made on the station's Facebook page, where people posted that Gerald was probably intoxicated. In the following two days, he's been filmed three times and fielded questions from The New York Times.
"I'm not that great at public speaking," he told the Iowa City Press-Citizen. "I never wanted to be famous. And this is not the way I would have wanted to be famous if I did."
Michael told reporters that an emergency-room physician said several times there was no sign of alcohol in Gerald's system. But more than that, Michael just wants people to remember his son as he was: bold, caring and full of conviction.
"In many things, he was very mature for his age," he said. "He had a lot of compassion for others. He would put out a quiet, tough image, even for such a small guy that he was."
Gerald is survived by his parents and his younger brother, Andrew. Michael describes his family as "up-and-down" in the aftermath of Gerald's passing. Andrew was initially gung-ho about pulling together photos for Gerald's funeral, but has since become reserved while scanning old pictures.
Several people — more than Michael says he could have expected — have called him or posted online to share memories of Gerald and how the young man affected their lives.
"There's been a lot of memories that have been filed away and not thought of in many years," he said. "Then somebody says something, and it's, 'Oh yeah, I remember that; I remember this.'"
He received one such call as he combed through Gerald's dorm room. Brian White, his son's former football coach and teacher at Kennedy High School in Cedar Rapids, called to reiterate how great Gerald was.
Off the field, classmates describe him as genuine; the type of person who seemed to cast aside assumptions and try to get to know people. Gerald excelled in the classroom, earning enough college credits in high school to be classified as a sophomore during his first year at UI.
But in large part because of his small size, he wasn't a star player on the football field for the Cougars.
His former coaches and teammates said Gerald was one of the hardest working players on the team. In interviews, they said he took his support role seriously, never complaining. He seemed to always smile, even after being knocked down on the scout team in practice.
Gerald typically played in games once the Cougars had a comfortable lead. One such instance lingered in Michael's mind Friday. He kept coming back to the pride he felt when his son nearly blocked a punt.
"If he'd just taken a slightly different angle, he would have gotten it," he said. "That probably would have been his defining moment in his high school football career. I didn't know he had it in him. I knew he was not a great football player, but he put in the effort ... he did the work, and he was getting the results."
Gerald seemed to find a niche after football season wrapped up his senior year at Kennedy. He joined a new rugby team after Michael said coaches recommended him because he was small and quick. When he enrolled at UI, Gerald joined the Cedar Rapids Headhunters, an adult rugby team.
Michael also recalls the pride he and his wife, Sherine, felt when they dropped Gerald off at college. He said it felt like their oldest was headed off to follow his dreams at the school he'd been eyeing for years.
"I think Iowa was the only college on his radar," he said. "I suggested (he) take a look at Iowa State. Take a look at UNI. He wanted to be a doctor, and he wanted to go to the University of Iowa."
Specifically, Gerald wanted to be a either a cardiologist or neurosurgeon. Michael thinks he was driven by seeing doctors struggle to diagnose family members with medical issues.
"He wanted to make a difference," Michael said. "He wanted to be the one ... to be able to help other individuals in similar circumstances."
Gerald seemed full of potential. With his passing, though, Michael says he's learning his son has already had a much larger positive impact on those around him than he could have imagined.
"I wish that people know him as a compassionate person," he said. "No matter what comes out in the investigation ... we don't want this to be a defining moment in his life. He was a friend to many more than I was ever aware of."
Michael told reporters that an emergency-room physician said several times there was no sign of alcohol in Gerald's system. But more than that,
Michael just wants people to remember his son as he was: bold, caring and full of conviction.
Michael Belz speaks during an interview on Friday in Iowa City, Iowa.

Gerald Belz died on Jan. 30 after exposure to extreme weather on the University of Iowa campus. His fellow teammates remember him as quiet, but fiercely encouraging.

Yet little attention has been devoted to the literary dimensions of the text, or to appreciation of its status as a great work of religious literature. Fishbane is an associate professor at The Jewish Theological Seminary. 203-432-0843.

Texto completo: HARK
By Sam Lipsyte
Simon & Schuster, 304 pp., $27
Rejected by 35 publishers, “Home Land," Sam Lipsyte's second novel, revealed the writer as the reigning king of riff. Told in a series of chipper and increasingly demented missives to an alumni newsletter from a ne'er-do-well known as Teabag, the 2004 novel stands as a poisonously uproarious monument to the disappointments and soul-chafing alienation of early adulthood. It presented a tauter, deadlier distillation of the jagged and oftentimes brilliant voice Lipsyte had introduced in his earlier novel and stories, one now being compared, favorably, to that of Phillip Roth.
Five years later, Lipsyte came out with “The Ask," an even tighter, more commercially successful novel about yet another failure, this one a nonprofit administrator forced to bow before an immeasurably wealthy tech bro. In its wake, The New York Times hailed Lipsyte as a generational avatar whose book had “announced the onset of the Generation X midlife crisis." Somewhere along the way, he became chairman of the writing department at Columbia University and a regular in the fiction pages of The New Yorker. Our foremost chronicler of failures had achieved every marker of worldly success.
Enter his latest novel, the long-awaited “Hark." It takes on what seems like a can't-miss target: the moneyed mindfulness movement nudged along by the emergent spirituality of the tech sphere's professional-managerial class — think TED Talks and Burning Man and Soul Cycle. This subject has proven irresistible for Gen-X avatars across all media; witness the 2015 reprise of David Cross and Bob Odenkirk's classic '90s sketch comedy program “Mr. Show with Bob and David," which featured a feeble bit about a guru quite obviously modeled on a real-life guru named David “Shingy" Shing, a denim-clad Aussie with receding Sonic the Hedgehog hair and clear glasses who holds the unfathomable job title of “digital prophet" at Verizon Media Group.
Lipsyte's guru is the titular Hark Morner, a failed comic who has written a wildly popular book on Mental Archery, a method of focus he is invited to present in boardrooms and at corporate retreats. It blends mindfulness and visualizations around archery.
Mental Archery, although it affects people deeply, has no deeper meaning, something its principal practitioner frequently reminds his ever-larger audiences. “I don't have a message," Hark says. “There is no core philosophy, no Vedic truth, no Confucian wisdom, no grand Western synthesis, no radical breakthrough in the grand human endeavor."
This lack of focus (pun intended) proves troubling to the reader — how can she engage with a text whose central figure has such little substance? The lack of message also proves troubling to Hark's acolytes, from whose points of view we get the narrative. More or less.
Frank “Fraz" Penzig, our requisite Gen-X failure, mithering through late middle age, gets the most column inches. His marriage is failing; his teaching career is in the toilet; and he doesn't feel at home in a newly sincere world. “Irony is bad," a student of Fraz's explains in an early scene one wishes were funnier.
Rounding out Hark's crew are a pair of attractive, sophisticated, two-dimensional women in their early 30s named Kate and Teal. Teal has been to prison for embezzlement, and super-rich Kate bankrolls Hark. Meanwhile, as America engages in a land war with Europe — the conclusion of a series of unfortunate events kicked off by a terrible president — the trio will find themselves caught up in a farce of global proportions.
Ultimately, this is a book about the dangerous rise of sincerity. Or of earnestness. Or the limitations of Gen-X cynicism. Or the merits of Gen-X cynicism. Or the futility of man's search for meaning. Or something.
The biggest problem with “Hark" is not that it lacks the antic energy of Lipsyte's past efforts, but that Lipsyte, in broadening his scope to include matters both societal and domestic, often loses the thread. Even his riffs are rambling. Where is the reader left in all this? Exactly.

Texto completo: Something is missing here, and it's not just all the people, though their absence is unmistakable from a deserted Fifth Avenue, a vacant New York Stock Exchange and along the West Side Highway, which is empty of all but a few ominous figures in uniform.
In these New York Times photographs, taken during mandatory civil defense drills in the fervid early years of the Cold War, you can almost hear the absence of sound. All the rumbling, honking, chattering, clattering noise of everyday life has suddenly paused as the city goes into hiding -- leaving the click-click-click of a traffic signal or the flutter of a pigeon at Penn Station audible now, in eerie relief.
But even in the photos that show New Yorkers scrambling for cover in the streets or peering up from the shelter of a subway station, the terror that they're running from is missing, like King Kong erased from the frame. It's the threat of atomic annihilation, nebulous and unseen.
It's tempting to imagine this period of American history as one of perpetual anxiety, clenched fear and misplaced faith in the government, with people readily believing that ducking beneath a desk would save them from a hydrogen bomb.
But that may be a misreading of the era.
"These pictures are always interesting to me, because they always suggest a kind of unanimity or a cultural consensus around this fear, and when I was researching my book, I found deep ambivalence," said Laura McEnaney, a professor at Whittier College and the author of "Civil Defense Begins at Home: Militarization Meets Everyday Life in the 1950s."
Indeed, in November 1951 The Times noted the "the apathy and indifference" of New Yorkers toward civil defense drills -- although the streets were dutifully vacated two minutes after the blaring of air-raid sirens and remained so until the all-clear sounded eight minutes later.
By 1955, the federal government was coordinating drills nationwide, simulating a 61-city simultaneous Soviet strike -- "designed to attack the lethargy that has clouded the Civil Defense problem both in Congress and the country at large," The Times noted.
In trying to "historicize" all that "ambient emotion in the 1950s" -- in other words, to meaningfully gauge how anxious, skeptical or indifferent Americans were at a particular moment in time -- Ms. McEnaney mined government archives, news clippings and other sources that indicated federal officials were trying to figure out the same thing back then, coming at it like social scientists, military strategists and Madison Avenue admen all at once; even they couldn't be sure.
"Their project was to convince Americans to be afraid enough that they would take action, but not so afraid that they would be paralyzed," Ms. McEnaney said. "They spent a great deal of time trying to puzzle over creating a national mood of receptiveness." And though they might have been reluctant to admit failure, "they saw many signs that what they were trying to sell wasn't being purchased by many Americans."
Such drills and films fell under the auspices of a national civil defense arm -- first the Federal Civil Defense Administration (1951-58), then a flurry of short-lived successors -- though much of the on-the-ground preparations and funding came at the state and local levels.
And the frequency with which the D.C. agency had its name changed, got shuttled among Cabinet departments and came up short in congressional funding requests underscores civil defense's status as "the unwanted stepchild of the national-security state," said David F. Krugler, author of "This Is Only a Test: How Washington D.C. Prepared for Nuclear War."
"It became important only during crises, and that's why we see a parallel in our own time," said Mr. Krugler, a University of Wisconsin-Platteville historian.
Those crisis moments included the surprise test of a nuclear weapon by the Soviets in August 1949, the start of the Korean War nearly a year later, and the failed Vienna summit between Kennedy and Khrushchev in 1961, after which the Soviets began erecting the Berlin Wall and constructing missile sites in Cuba, which triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis.
But even at the height of those tensions, only 5 percent of Americans reported to Gallup that they had built a basement shelter or made other home improvements with an eye to surviving nuclear war.
Americans eventually wearied of even the drills, with multiple scholars seeing 1959 as a tipping point. That year, a pair of young mothers who spontaneously refused to seek shelter -- including 23-year-old Janice Smith, pictured in The Times with her two toddlers, "sick and tired of being forced underground like a desert rat" -- helped expand the protest ranks from scattered old-left activists to throngs of clean-cut college students and young mothers.
The next year, protesters swarmed City Hall, singing "We Shall Overcome" and "We Shall Not Be Moved," ignoring the sirens and the appeals of volunteer wardens and police. Among them was none other than Norman Mailer, who before the event said he would sign autographs and get arrested. It's unclear whether he did the former, but he failed to do the latter.
"Politics is like sex," Mailer said, according to "Bracing for Armageddon: Why Civil Defense Never Worked," by the late Rutgers professor and peace activist Dee Garrison. "You have to go all the way."
Losing control of the narrative, officials soon retired the drills.

Fake News From Virginia

Texto completo: Under current law in Virginia, third-trimester abortions are permitted when a woman's physician and two other doctors certify that continuing a pregnancy would result in a mother's death, or "substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman." This week Kathy Tran, a Democrat in Virginia's House of Delegates, testified in favor of a bill that would end the requirement for two extra doctors to sign off on such abortions, and strike the words "substantially and irremediably" from the existing law. Similar legislation has been introduced in past years. Despite what you might have heard, at no point did Tran try to legalize infanticide.
When Tran appeared before a statehouse subcommittee, the Republican majority leader, Todd Gilbert, presented her with an outré hypothetical. Could a woman about to go into labor request an abortion if her doctor certified that she needed one for mental health reasons? Tran said that the decision would be between a woman and her doctor, but, evidently taken aback by the question, eventually allowed that it would be permitted under her bill.
Tran handled the moment poorly. She might have pointed out that legislation is not generally written with an eye to prohibiting ridiculous and unprecedented scenarios. It is inconceivable that a doctor would certify a need for an abortion while a woman is in labor; some doctors won't even let a woman turn down a C-section if they think a baby's health is at risk. But Tran's impolitic answer to a ludicrous question gave abortion opponents grist for an explosion of self-righteous outrage.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
Things only escalated on Wednesday, when Gov. Ralph Northam was asked about the uproar during an appearance on a radio show. Northam, a pediatric neurologist by training, spoke about what actually happens when a woman goes into labor with a fetus that has severe deformities and may not be viable. The infant, he said, would be delivered and kept comfortable, and the family would decide about resuscitation.
Northam appeared to be pointing out the absurdity of Gilbert's hypothetical, since even in grave circumstances, no one gets an abortion on the delivery table. But as a clip of the interview went viral, conservatives, including the Republican senator Marco Rubio, began accusing Northam of supporting the murder of newborns. It was the right-wing version of an online outrage mob, warping the governor's innocuous comments into a callous declaration of evil.
Some seemed almost gleeful at the prospect of seizing the moral high ground denied them over two years of rationalizing a depraved administration. "You people keep saying to look at Trump getting elected to see how Hitler could be possible," tweeted the conservative pundit Erick Erickson. "I'm thinking look at the sudden embrace of infanticide to see how Nazism could be possible."
In some ways the issue of Tran's bill is moot, since it was never going to pass in Virginia's Republican-controlled legislature, and certainly has no chance now. But the debate over late-term abortion has been rekindled. For Donald Trump, who tweeted about the procedure on Thursday, it's a culture war issue he can exploit. Others on the right are genuinely sickened by what they imagine liberals want to allow, even if they also appear to be enjoying the chance to once again scold the left for its purported immorality.
"Under the bill's actual text, virtually any claim of impairment would suffice to meet the act's requirements," wrote National Review's David French. "Anxiety? Depression? The conventional physical challenges of postpartum recovery? Any of those things could justify taking the life of a fully formed, completely viable, living infant."
French appears to be worried that women will seek, and doctors will perform, late-term abortions for trivial reasons. But there's contempt for women embedded in the idea that, absent legal prohibition, someone on the verge of giving birth might instead terminate her pregnancy to avoid the brutalities of labor.
"No matter what the law were, in real life, these things don't happen," said Frances Kissling, president of the Center for Health, Ethics and Social Policy and the former head of Catholics for a Free Choice. "I am not saying that there would not be one woman out of 20 million who decided at the 33rd week of pregnancy that she needed an abortion, and I would suggest that she probably does have mental health problems. However, this woman is not going to find anyone who will do this."
Kissling is well known in the pro-choice movement for thinking deeply about the ethical gray areas surrounding abortion. As she points out, there are only about a dozen doctors in the country who perform third-trimester abortions at all, and she's spoken to several of them, asking specific questions about patients they've turned down. "What I have learned is that all of them have limits and have declined to do abortions in certain circumstances for certain reasons," she said. (The murderous abortionist Kermit Gosnell, serving a life sentence in prison, is an exception, but he was operating outside the law.)
A person who is ambivalent about abortion might wonder why, if the situations put forward by Gilbert and French are so unthinkable, pro-choice people would object to laws making them illegal. But the law is a blunt instrument for making judgments about extreme and unusual contingencies.
Having extra doctors sign off on each late abortion safeguards against (mythical) cavalier terminations, but it means that women in anguished, urgent situations need to jump through extra hoops. Abortion opponents treat mental health exemptions as easily exploited loopholes, but one instance in which they're invoked is when a woman learns that her fetus has little chance of surviving outside the womb, and can't face the prospect of going through labor only to watch her baby die.
This is not to say that there aren't third-trimester abortions that many people would find morally objectionable. Abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy are quite rare -- such procedures make up just over 1 percent of all terminations, according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures -- and there's little solid data about the reasons women have them. Thus much of the debate relies on anecdote.
There are many tragic stories of women forced to abort desperately wanted pregnancies because of harrowing medical emergencies, but also more complicated cases of, for example, young girls who hid their pregnancies for months, or whose abortions were delayed by restrictive laws in their states. "Our talking point is, most of these procedures are on women who discover abnormalities late in the pregnancy," Kissling said. "We don't know if that is true."
Conservatives might see vindication in this admission, but it leaves us with the question of whether we want to use the law to make fine-grained moral distinctions, particularly in the absence of good information about the life-or-death choices we're regulating. "This is so complicated, that we can set this guideline, but then we have to leave it to medicine, to the doctor and the woman, to figure this out," argued Kissling. There's certainly no reason to trust the people who elected Trump to make profound ethical decisions for us.

When a poet shows he is jealous

Texto completo: Everyone loves poetry. In theory. Not that anyone actually wants their child to end up a poet.
In that sense, we — ever since I was an undergrad, I confess to occasionally publishing poems in little magazines with, as Calvin Trillin used to say, circulations in the high two figures — are like guitar players. Fine with parents if Junior wants to pluck a little. Just God forbid he should try to take it on the road.
But we continue to exalt poetry. To treat it as the best manmade thing in the world. As I wrote in “Poetry in Orbit,” a poem published in Gulf Stream Literary Magazine — a prose poem, as we dub it in the trade: “The coolest job is astronaut, right? Well, astronaut-poet. Every child’s dream. ‘Cause no one calls it astronautics in motion when someone has a fluid tennis swing. They call it poetry. In motion. As opposed to on the page no one reads. But poetry, still. Someone has to do the job.”
In recent decades, poetry has been called upon not just to be the best stuff ever but to take on its ancient task of bucking up a nation in times of despair. Good luck with that one, fellow poets. I’m not up to the task.
But one prominent poet, much-published in non-little magazines and a writing professor at the University of Florida, is up to the task of doing hatchet jobs on poets who are not very good ones, and that’s fine, a necessary tonic for the vast majority of poetry criticism, which often amounts to what’s known in the literary dodge as “logrolling”: writing only good reviews of peers who one runs into often at the hotel bars at our annual drinking conferences.
So The New York Times’ editors knew what they were about when they assigned William Logan to review last month “THE FLAME: Poems, Notebooks, Lyrics, Drawings,” a posthumous collection by the late songwriter, and, yes, poet Leonard Cohen.
Leonard Cohen was not a very good poet. But he was a great songwriter, and lyricist, and singer, who lived an extraordinary life.
Few — none, that I know of — great songwriters are also great poets. Bob Dylan is not even a good poet, nor is Joni Mitchell, nor … Ira Gershwin. But I don’t begrudge at all Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. That was for his words as sung, not as read. Just don’t bother to read his scribblings as such. Open any little mag if you want to read a good, even great, poem.
What Logan and many other Cohen-despising poet/critics are is jealous. Cohen, who started out as a poet, actually did very well at it, commercially. When his “Collected Poems, 1956-1968” came out, it sold 20,000 copies in just the summer of 1968, when it was published. Most poets don’t sell that many books in a lifetime. It was on my mother’s bookshelf. I remember one good line: something that was “as empty as the drawer where I used to keep my opium.” The poems were written when he was between 15 and 20. He got smart; saw that there was no real career in poetry as such — all poets have to teach, or, like Wallace Stevens, sell insurance, to keep body and soul together. He picked up a guitar instead, and that worked out fabulously.
But in his hatchet job, Logan pretends Cohen wasn’t any good at all: “He wasn’t much of a singer, either; but the gravelly renderings of his lyrics gradually attracted a mass audience that seemed more like a cult. … At any moment of the day, ‘Suzanne’ is probably playing in an elevator somewhere.” Unlike Logan’s poems. But not a good singer? That’s like saying Neil Young is not a “good” singer, or Dylan, for that matter. A generation left Broadway show tunes behind, for good reason. They covered “Hallelujah” to the point where it was overplayed. Because it is a really great song.

Texto completo: Since the 1990s, recognizing the value of preserving our midcentury modern architectural heritage by city officials and the public has been a slow, often painful process.
Over the years, successful battles were waged to save such iconic structures as the Tramway Gas Station (now the Palm Springs Visitors Center), Albert Frey's Fire Station No. 1, E. Stewart Williams' Sante Fe Federal Savings building (now the Architecture and Design Center), Robinson's Department Store, and portions of the Palm Springs Airport façade.
Of course, there have been losses: Williams' Potter Clinic, the Biltmore Hotel, Neutra's Maslon House in Rancho Mirage, Frey and Chambers' Palm Springs Shopping Center, and the Spa Hotel and Bathhouse. And near misses: Town & Country Center (ongoing), and Hugh Kaptur's Tahquitz Plaza the most recent.
During these years attitudes gradually changed through the efforts of many entities and individuals. There were celebratory articles in the early 2000s (particularly Vanity Fair and The New York Times), several documentaries and numerous books published on Desert Modernism, Palm Springs Art Museum symposiums, home tours, and the opening of the influential Architecture and Design Center.
Not to be overlooked are the hundreds of property owners whose substantial investments in revitalizing countless modern homes, hotels, and businesses have helped revitalize the midcentury ambiance of Palm Springs and much of the Coachella Valley.
Politically, the gradual election of supportive City Council members reversed ingrained attitudes that development and preservation were incompatible.
Perhaps the most influential champion of Palm Springs' modern heritage has been Modernism Week, which debuted in 2006 and attracted 125,000 people to the desert last year.
Of course, local preservation organizations have played a key part in this effort.
Founded in 1999, the Palm Springs Modern Committee (PS ModCom) celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. Our mission has been to promote Desert Modern architecture.
This year, as part of Modernism Week, the Palm Springs Modern Committee presents a stunning full-scale, furnished replica of architect Paul Rudolph's iconic 1952 Walker Guest House. The cottage was designed by Rudolph specifically for a beachside property on Sanibel Island, Florida.
The Sarasota Architectural Foundation brilliantly executed a replica that, at great cost and effort, was relocated and reconstructed by PS ModCom to Palm Springs. It now sits in Grit Development's "Art Pit" and is open to the public through Modernism Week.
On Feb. 17, a symposium at the Annenberg Theater will take you on a journey through Rudolph's life.
The past 20 years has proven that the preservation and celebration of our most important architectural treasures has been the foundation for Palm Springs' economic and cultural renaissance.

Texto completo: Deutsche Bank AG rebuffed a request from the Trump Organization in March 2016 to increase a loan for the Trump National Doral, a Florida golf resort, because of concerns about expanding the bank's relationship with then-candidate Donald Trump or his company, according to people familiar with the matter.
The German bank, a longtime lender to Mr. Trump, also raised questions internally about whether it had enough information about the ultimate use of the funding, one of the people said.
The Trump Organization was seeking the funding in part to benefit the Trump Turnberry golf property in Scotland, the people said.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the loan request, first reported in the New York Times.
A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization disputed that the Turnberry property needed outside financing but didn't respond to a question about whether the company asked Deutsche Bank for a loan in the spring of 2016. "This story is absolutely false. We bought Trump Turnberry without any financing and put tens of millions of dollars of our own money into the renovation which began in 2014. At no time was any money needed to finance the purchase or the refurbishment of Trump Turnberry," she said.
Deutsche Bank's risk committee and senior management turned the request down, the people said, concerned about increasing the bank's exposure to Mr. Trump or his affiliates at that time. The request was rebuffed by a U.S. committee within the bank that vets deals for reputational risks and related matters, the people said.
The funding request was escalated to a global committee but again turned down, they said.
One of the concerns discussed was whether the financing could possibly be funneled elsewhere out of the bank's control, such as to benefit Mr. Trump's campaign for the U.S. presidency.
Democratic lawmakers, including the heads of the House Intelligence Committee and House Financial Services Committee, have said they plan to investigate Deutsche Bank's ties to Mr. Trump. "We are going to be looking at the issue of possible money laundering by the Trump Organization, and Deutsche Bank is one obvious place to start," Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), who chairs the intelligence committee, told the New Yorker in December.
Deutsche Bank's relationship with Mr. Trump goes back decades. Since 1998, the bank has led or participated in loans of at least $2.5 billion to companies affiliated with Mr. Trump, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The financing helped Mr. Trump build or purchase some of his highest-profile projects, including in Washington, New York, Chicago and Florida.
A financial disclosure that Mr. Trump filed in 2016, when he was running for president, showed that four of the 16 loans to his companies that he reported came from Deutsche Bank. A significant portion of that debt came from two 2012 mortgages—one valued at more than $50 million and the other at between $5 million and $25 million—for the Trump National Doral.
In March 2016, Mr. Trump was on his way to the Republican presidential nomination, which he would effectively clinch two months later.
At that point, Mr. Trump was also largely self-funding his primary campaign. By the end of March, he had loaned his campaign about $36 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. He would later forgive $50 million in personal loans he made to his campaign, according to FEC records.

REVIEW --- My Family's Iranian Revolution --- The return of the Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979 brought joy at first, then despair and dislocation

Texto completo: When I was a boy, my birthday was the subject of a long-running joke in our family. I was born in Tehran on Feb. 1, 1985 -- exactly six years to the day that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from his Parisian exile to herald the new Islamic Republic of Iran. One of our relatives, a gregarious retired police colonel, would often ask me at our family get-togethers: "When were you born, Sohrab?"
"February first," I would say, playing along.
"Pfft-pfft," he replied, holding his nose. "You brought the imam with you."
I bore the disagreeable scent of Khomeini. The punch line didn't need explaining because the sentiment was so widely shared in our urbane milieu. Having supported the 1979 revolution, my family had come to bitterly regret it. The collapse of 2,500 years of monarchy didn't win popular rule for Iran's middle classes, and it made life far more miserable than it had been under the last shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the king of kings.
Yet revolt my family had. Nationalism and anti-Western grievance had lighted the spark for my maternal grandfather -- Baba Nasser, as we called him. Various imperial powers had long treated Iran as a plaything. Baba Nasser's suspicion of foreigners wasn't entirely irrational, but it had hardened into a paranoid history of the world, one in which Iranians had invented all that was worthwhile, only to have their ideas and resources pillaged by the West. For this otherwise mild-mannered civil servant, 1979 was about restoring Iran's lost honor after millennia of humiliations at the hands of outsiders, going back to Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia.
For liberal and left-wing Iranians of my parents' generation, 1979 held other promises. The Pahlavis had forged a modern nation-state out of the shambolic remains of the ancient Persian Empire. Yet rapid development left Iran's boomers feeling more restive, and contact with the West only heightened their sense of inadequacy. They read hotheaded French philosophers and concluded that the answer to their dissatisfactions lay in making revolution -- in razing traditional hierarchies and erecting an entirely new order.
Neither old-school nationalists like Baba Nasser nor the secular-minded leftists had a clear picture of what should come after the fall. Not so with Khomeini's followers among the conservative merchants of the bazaar and the pious, provincial multitudes.
The city-dwelling share of Iran's population in 1978 had risen to nearly 50%, according to data from the country's central bank, from 31% two decades earlier -- a dramatic change caused in part by industrialization and in part by the shah's misbegotten land reforms. Physically and spiritually dislocated, squeezed into unfamiliar quarters, the internal migrants from the village were scandalized by what they saw in the city.
The shah, with his penchant for high-end escorts, was out of tune with his people. Hot pants and bikinis; raunchy Hollywood comedies and raunchier domestic knockoffs; a tolerated red-light district in Tehran, known as the Citadel; legalized casinos, half of them owned by the monarch himself -- all this was far too much for a society steeped in Shiite Islam.
Against these debauched and dizzying trends, Khomeini promised community, re-enchantment, continuity with a wholesome past. On contraband cassette tapes circulated underground, he spoke of Islamic justice -- but, crucially, within the framework of a republic. "Dictatorship," he said, "is the greatest sin in Islam." Such talk closed the sale with the leftists and the nationalists.
"We will lose all we have." "You don't know what you're toying with." "Talk of an 'Islamic republic' is nonsense." So warned the counterrevolutionaries among our relatives, the old police colonel among them. Some were connected to the ancien regime; others simply had greater foresight. But Khomeini's secular fellow travelers wouldn't pay heed. The tide of mass enthusiasm swept aside all doubt. So febrile was the atmosphere that, not long before Khomeini's return from exile, word spread nationwide that his visage had been seen on the surface of the moon.
For a while after that fateful Feb. 1, various Islamist and non-Islamist movements openly contested the new republic. On the streets, mustachioed leftists mixed it up with bearded Islamists; in university classrooms, Marx and Hegel tussled with the Prophet Muhammad and the Shiite saints. Some tried to blend the two sets of teachings.
The secularists were confident they would sideline Khomeini. They had the technocratic expertise and the foreign degrees. Their Marxist dialectic held that history moves along a predetermined path toward the classless society, not backward to the superstition and feudalism of Islam. The left expected Khomeini to "soon go to the holy city of Qum, at a remove from the daily exercise of power," wrote Princeton's Richard Falk in a New York Times op-ed.
In fact, Khomeini had his mind set on total power. By the end of its first decade, the Islamic Republic had dismantled labor unions, banned opposition, shuttered newspapers and summarily executed thousands, including many of its erstwhile leftist allies. The new Iran was a land of conspiracies and denunciations, utopian fantasies and pervasive dysfunction, where each day began and ended with the litany of names of the newly executed, barked out on state radio by men with foghorn voices. Drinking, dancing and most other forms of fun were proscribed.
Baba Nasser, who died in 2016, never could admit that the revolution had been a blunder. Instead, he shrank into his hobbies, mainly transcribing ancient Persian manuscripts on astronomy and mathematics into modern type -- to prove, once and for all, that Iranians had originated all the pivotal insights that the Western usurpers claimed for themselves.
My parents and their friends sought escape in Western movies and music, in strong drink and underground parties, in smoky debates about Woody Allen and Frank Gehry. Eventually, most left and joined the world-wide diaspora, with no plans to return home. The old colonel, meanwhile, still lives in Tehran, and he still insists that the Islamic Republic's downfall is imminent.
I have heard such predictions ever since those boyhood years. But the Islamic Republic turns 40 this month, having survived a grinding eight-year war with Iraq, prolonged international isolation, massive student protests in 1999 and the 2009 Green Movement, as well as the winter uprising of 2017. It is now fighting wars on several fronts, from the Arabian Peninsula to Mesopotamia and the Levant. Yet it persists.
The opposition also persists. These days, the protests are more geographically widespread and increasingly involve the working class and lower strata: schoolteachers and truck drivers and sugar-factory hands, who can't afford to buy a dozen eggs while the sons and daughters of the ruling class drive Lamborghinis and sport Louboutin shoes. On state television, intellectuals openly debate whether the revolution has exhausted its energies.
Even more alarming for the regime must be the nationalistic slogans and evocations of the Pahlavi era, now fondly recalled for its prosperity and the dignity with which monarchic Iran bestrode the world stage. Liberal "rights talk" has far less currency. That tells me something profound about the hunger for order and continuity in the Iranian soul -- the same longing that toppled the shah and brought the ayatollahs to power. It is why I am certain that Iran won't become a liberal democracy in my lifetime.
No, if the scent of the imam ever departs for good, it will be because some other scent displaces it, perhaps violently. Some other imam, some other general, some other king of kings.

Resumen: It is said that the test of true fandom comes not with victory but with defeat. Saints fans have met their latest trial with the relentless spirit of survival that has buoyed New Orleans after countless floods and hurricanes.

Texto completo: New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton hid at his house, watching Netflix and eating ice cream.
Apparently an actual saint, quarterback Drew Brees shook off the NFC Championship loss 12 days ago, noting “I refuse to let this hold us down.”
In a much-shared post on Instagram, he advised Saints fans to “keep your chin up, hold your head high, puff your chest out because WE are the Who Dat Nation and WE will always persevere.”
That sentiment echoed the relentless spirit of survival that pervades every crooked corner of the city. For 300 years, New Orleans has stood strong, despite its low elevation and swampy isolation. It has endured embittered battles over slavery, river floods, yellow fever, and hurricanes. In 2005 hurricane Katrina – which killed 1,800 Louisianans and flooded 80 percent of the city – raised questions about the city’s viability. Instead, it rose up, staggering at times under stubborn poverty and a high rate of gun crimes.
That defiant endurance stems from a deeply rooted sense of pride in this place and the people who call it home – especially the Saints. So when fans saw the championship slip from their grasp, the entire city seemed to howl in unison. People ran into the streets to commiserate and deliver the news to shopkeepers working without televisions, their black and gold beads glinting in the sun.
For season ticket holder Joanne Palumbo, an egregious missed pass-interference call that ended the Saints’ Super Bowl bid has larger resonance in a city defined, at least in some ways, by natural disaster and human tragedy.
“It was a mistake that turned into an injustice,” says Ms. Palumbo.
Palumbo and everybody else knows this is just a football game. Yet the Saints’ victory in the 2010 Super Bowl, coming just five years after Katrina, forged a powerful bond between the black-and-gold squad and a sometimes violent city where police statistics suggest crime falls when the Saints are playing.
Into that tableau Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman charged heedlessly.
In the Zapruder-like replay, Robey-Coleman can be seen clearly committing pass interference against Saints wide receiver Tommylee Lewis with a helmet-to-helmet hit. Robey-Coleman couldn’t believe his luck. He can be seen looking around for the flag after the hit.
The Saints kicked a field goal, but were forced to cede control of the clock – and ultimately the game, in overtime – to the Rams.
A congressman threatened hearings. A federal judge in New Orleans – somehow – managed to fit in a hearing Monday to hear the plaintive cries of righteous fans. (The fans’ pleas were denied Thursday.)
Invoking the national mood, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni noted that “maybe the post-truth era has found its post-truth sport.”
Gov. John Bel Edwards wrote to the league that New Orleans has “overcome setbacks much bigger than a bad call in a football game.” But, he warned, “We will not forget it.”
Fans, meanwhile, remain in a fugue. “No one has ever been in this situation before,” says Julie Nevius, co-owner of J&J’s Sports Lounge in the city’s Bywater neighborhood.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell took the brunt of the heat. He broke his silence Wednesday, agreeing that “it is a play that should be called,” but noted that the rule book says games should not be overturned because of routine officiating errors. Besides, Mr. Goodell noted, a lot of people have been complaining about too many flags thrown – a fair barb.
Still, New Orleanians like to have the last word. Super Bowl players and attendees arriving in Atlanta for Sunday’s big game will be greeted by billboards around the airport reading “Saints got robbed” and “NFL bleaux it.”
Steam blown, fans like Palumbo are almost ready to move on.
Her mansion has been used myriad times as a movie and TV show set, including one drama that filmed mortal crimes in nearly every room, “including the bathtub.”
But today, a giant Saints banner hangs across her colonnades along with Mardi Gras baubles. “I’m losing sleep, but I also know full well that it’s just a game,” she says, almost believing it.
At J&J’s, Ms. Nevius points to various screens: When the Super Bowl airs this Sunday, the big screen will show the 2010 Super Bowl. Another big screen will show the Puppy Bowl. But despite the boycott mood, she admits that one smaller screen in the corner will be tuned to the game in Atlanta.
Since the Jan. 20 debacle, New Orleanians have raised tens of thousands of dollars to quickly plan and organize the Boycott Bowl, which should be in full swing on Sunday: bands, a parade, and second-line trumpets.
That is, after all, how they mourn in this city of martyred saints.
“It’s New Orleans,” says Nevius. “We make a party out of whatever.”

For this otherwise mild-mannered civil servant, 1979 was about restoring Iran's lost honor after millennia of humiliations at the hands of outsiders, going back to Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia.
For liberal and left-wing Iranians of my parents' generation, 1979 held other promises. The Pahlavis had forged a modern nation-state out of the shambolic remains of the ancient Persian Empire. Yet rapid development left Iran's boomers feeling more restive, and contact with the West only heightened their sense of inadequacy. They read hotheaded French philosophers and concluded that the answer to their dissatisfactions lay in making revolution—in razing traditional hierarchies and erecting an entirely new order.
Neither old-school nationalists like Baba Nasser nor the secular-minded leftists had a clear picture of what should come after the fall. Not so with Khomeini's followers among the conservative merchants of the bazaar and the pious, provincial multitudes.
The city-dwelling share of Iran's population in 1978 had risen to nearly 50%, according to data from the country's central bank, from 31% two decades earlier—a dramatic change caused in part by industrialization and in part by the shah's misbegotten land reforms. Physically and spiritually dislocated, squeezed into unfamiliar quarters, the internal migrants from the village were scandalized by what they saw in the city.
The shah, with his penchant for high-end escorts, was out of tune with his people. Hot pants and bikinis; raunchy Hollywood comedies and raunchier domestic knockoffs; a tolerated red-light district in Tehran, known as the Citadel; legalized casinos, half of them owned by the monarch himself—all this was far too much for a society steeped in Shiite Islam.
Against these debauched and dizzying trends, Khomeini promised community, re-enchantment, continuity with a wholesome past. On contraband cassette tapes circulated underground, he spoke of Islamic justice—but, crucially, within the framework of a republic. "Dictatorship," he said, "is the greatest sin in Islam." Such talk closed the sale with the leftists and the nationalists.
"We will lose all we have." "You don't know what you're toying with." "Talk of an 'Islamic republic' is nonsense." So warned the counterrevolutionaries among our relatives, the old police colonel among them. Some were connected to the ancien régime; others simply had greater foresight. But Khomeini's secular fellow travelers wouldn't pay heed. The tide of mass enthusiasm swept aside all doubt. So febrile was the atmosphere that, not long before Khomeini's return from exile, word spread nationwide that his visage had been seen on the surface of the moon.
For a while after that fateful Feb. 1, various Islamist and non-Islamist movements openly contested the new republic. On the streets, mustachioed leftists mixed it up with bearded Islamists; in university classrooms, Marx and Hegel tussled with the Prophet Muhammad and the Shiite saints. Some tried to blend the two sets of teachings.
The secularists were confident they would sideline Khomeini. They had the technocratic expertise and the foreign degrees. Their Marxist dialectic held that history moves along a predetermined path toward the classless society, not backward to the superstition and feudalism of Islam. The left expected Khomeini to "soon go to the holy city of Qum, at a remove from the daily exercise of power," wrote Princeton's Richard Falk in a New York Times op-ed.
In fact, Khomeini had his mind set on total power. By the end of its first decade, the Islamic Republic had dismantled labor unions, banned opposition, shuttered newspapers and summarily executed thousands, including many of its erstwhile leftist allies. The new Iran was a land of conspiracies and denunciations, utopian fantasies and pervasive dysfunction, where each day began and ended with the litany of names of the newly executed, barked out on state radio by men with foghorn voices. Drinking, dancing and most other forms of fun were proscribed.
Baba Nasser, who died in 2016, never could admit that the revolution had been a blunder. Instead, he shrank into his hobbies, mainly transcribing ancient Persian manuscripts on astronomy and mathematics into modern type—to prove, once and for all, that Iranians had originated all the pivotal insights that the Western usurpers claimed for themselves.
My parents and their friends sought escape in Western movies and music, in strong drink and underground parties, in smoky debates about Woody Allen and Frank Gehry. Eventually, most left and joined the world-wide diaspora, with no plans to return home. The old colonel, meanwhile, still lives in Tehran, and he still insists that the Islamic Republic's downfall is imminent.
I have heard such predictions ever since those boyhood years. But the Islamic Republic turns 40 this month, having survived a grinding eight-year war with Iraq, prolonged international isolation, massive student protests in 1999 and the 2009 Green Movement, as well as the winter uprising of 2017. It is now fighting wars on several fronts, from the Arabian Peninsula to Mesopotamia and the Levant. Yet it persists.
The opposition also persists. These days, the protests are more geographically widespread and increasingly involve the working class and lower strata: schoolteachers and truck drivers and sugar-factory hands, who can't afford to buy a dozen eggs while the sons and daughters of the ruling class drive Lamborghinis and sport Louboutin shoes. On state television, intellectuals openly debate whether the revolution has exhausted its energies.
Even more alarming for the regime must be the nationalistic slogans and evocations of the Pahlavi era, now fondly recalled for its prosperity and the dignity with which monarchic Iran bestrode the world stage. Liberal "rights talk" has far less currency. That tells me something profound about the hunger for order and continuity in the Iranian soul—the same longing that toppled the shah and brought the ayatollahs to power. It is why I am certain that Iran won't become a liberal democracy in my lifetime.
No, if the scent of the imam ever departs for good, it will be because some other scent displaces it, perhaps violently. Some other imam, some other general, some other king of kings.

Texto completo: CNN's "Town Hall" on Monday night, featuring fast-rising Sen. Kamala Harris, was moderately helpful in assessing the California freshman's presidential candidacy, but far more useful in evaluating what television must do in the critically important 2020 race.
Host Jake Tapper promised that this would be the first of many such made-for-CNN events.
Indeed, with a crowded field of Democratic contenders, many of whom are new to the national scene, an hour of prime-time can go a long way toward educating voters.
Or not. CNN chose the campus of Drake University in Des Moines as the setting for its program because, as Tapper explained, "The all-important Iowa caucuses are just over one year away." That's a distinction that might work for Iowans but which, at this stage, is lost on voters in 49 other states.
The audience was described by Tapper as "people who tell us they plan to caucus with the Democrats next year and members of the Drake University community."
Translation: A friendly crowd capable of fairly soft, straight-from-the-playbook questions, such as: "What would you plan to do to make America safer (for minorities)?" And, "What is the first thing you would do as president of the United States?"
Even the toughest question, about Harris' record as a prosecutor, was presented without teeth.
Moreover, although Tapper made a token effort to follow up, he did not challenge Harris as many critics have in recent weeks.
Writing in The New York Times, law professor Lara Bazelon noted that, "Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state's attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent."
For her part, Harris was engaging, even charismatic, but her answers often went too long, and Tapper never once interrupted.
Without any meaningful pushback, Harris was left to glide along with boilerplate answers.
Perhaps CNN would argue that such introductory gatherings are intended to give candidates a forum to lay out their positions without the rigors of an actual debate – or even the stress of a Sunday talk show. Maybe the format is designed to make it more likely that candidates will accept the invitation, knowing that they will receive only predictable questions.
Previous, non-election town halls, such as one featuring Rep. Nancy Pelosi, had more meat on the bone and provided a much more valuable service to viewers.
Frankly, the entire town hall format is too gimmicky. Since audience questions are carefully screened by producers ahead of time, and their order predetermined, what's the point? The forum would be far more useful if multiple hosts questioned the guest – with perhaps a fairly brief audience segment at the end.
It's a long, some would say excruciating trek to Election Day 2020. Many people believe it's far too early to pay close attention to an over-crowded field slugging it out in an overly long campaign.
Then again, the stakes couldn't be higher. CNN is in a unique position – without the clear conservative bias of Fox, or the overt liberal leaning of MSNBC – to inform viewers about the candidates and issues.
Viewers seem to agree, with nearly 2 million watching the CNN program, the most ever for a single-candidate event of this kind.
Kamala Harris will undoubtedly grow as the campaign moves forward. CNN must as well.

Najarian is coach's go-to guy

Texto completo: ATLANTA — He is Tom Hagen in “The Godfather." He is Doug Stamper on “House of Cards."
He is Berj Najarian, consigliere to Bill Belichick. He is The Man To See if you want to see Bill.
“You're never going to get to Bill unless you go through Berj," said Scott Zolak, a Patriot insider for three decades. “Berj is the guy who dictates who Bill talks to."
“Everybody knows Berj runs the show down there," added Troy Brown, a three-time Super Bowl winner with Belichick. “You had to go to Berj for everything. You'd walk in the front door and the first guy you'd see is Berj. He was in charge the whole time I was there."
Najarian is one of the most powerful figures on the Boston sports landscape, yet most fans have never heard of him. There isn't much to find about him on the Internet. Najarian makes no sound and leaves no footprints.
He is a behind-the-scenes guy who does not want anyone in the Patriots family to think he is seeking attention. Seven years ago, in a moment of weakness, he gave the New York Times a one-paragraph, snooze-filled statement regarding his duties (“helping uphold the standard of excellence set by the Kraft family" blah-blah), but he has no intention of being so reckless again.
When I asked to interview him for this story, it went like this.
Me: “Can I talk to you for five minutes for a story on you?"
Berj: “You'll have to ask Bill."
Me: “I can't ask Bill without going through you first."
Berj: “We'll get back to you."
I heard from Berj later that night. He said he'd rather not break his Ripkenesque streak of not giving quotes to the media.
Najarian's official title in the Patriots media guide is “Director of Football/Head Coach Administration."
Working from a Gillette Stadium office adjoined to Belichick's, Najarian handles the logistics of Belichick's workday. He decides who sits where on the team plane. He selects the music for practice. He doles out speaking gigs to assistant coaches if the Patriots are approached by corporations. He prioritizes.
He combs through all media coverage of the Patriots (an overwhelming tonnage of digital, ink, and radio/TV noise) and decides what Bill needs to see and hear. He seeks out reporters who he believes have been unfair to his boss or the Patriot Way. I can't prove it, but I believe he has a Nixonian enemies list.
Any time you see Belichick standing at a podium at any news conference, you can see Berj off to the side, deep in the background, monitoring the proceedings while checking his Smartphone.
“His ability to absorb everything around him, with eyes in the back of his head, is the most impressive thing," said Zolak. “He takes the information and puts it through the strainer: what the coach should and should not see. Berj has a real good ear for that."
After Wednesday's media session at the Super Bowl, I cornered Belichick for a few words about his ubiquitous wingman.
“What does Berj do for you?" I started.
“We could probably talk about that for a week," said the coach. “He does a lot. There's football, non-football. Scheduling. Just a lot of things I need to be aware of and logistical things that need to be taken care of. Some things we talk about and some things he just knows what he needs to do.
“Berj gets along with people great. He has great relationships with almost everybody. I think everybody likes him and he's good to work with. He's smart. He's very dedicated and team-oriented and unselfish. He'll do what's best for the team and he'll work with anybody and is able to be productive with them.
“Sometimes there's a conflict in how things need to go, and he does a good job in compromising and finding a middle ground where everybody can feel they have a workable situation."
Bob Kraft has called Najarian “one of our hidden weapons."
Hidden.
It is the Patriot Way.
Paranoia and secrecy strike deep in the heart of Foxborough. Assistant coaches are rarely made available. Ernie Adams (Bill's replay-challenge whisperer) speaks to no one. Players are told what to say, and all outsiders are processed through “Security Command."
In this spirit, Najarian is a perfect fit for Fort Foxborough.
Najarian, 49, grew up on Long Island, played baseball at Manhasset (high school home of running back Jim Brown), then played a year of baseball at Boston University before graduating with a liberal arts degree in 1991. He worked in the PR office of the New York Knicks during their NBA Finals season of 1993-94, then moved over to the New York Jets in 1995.
Young Najarian attached himself to Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, and beat reporters learned that if you wanted to get Keyshawn, you had to go through Berj.
In 1997, when Belichick came to the Jets with Bill Parcells (who was famous for not allowing his assistants to talk to the media), Najarian hitched his wagon to the grumpy defensive coordinator. They worked out on treadmills, side by side, and according to Ian O'Connor's bestselling book “Belichick," “They talked about ways Little Bill could better deal with the media while working around Big Bill's restrictions."
When Belichick got the Patriots job, the Hoodie did not want to repeat the media mistakes he made as head coach in Cleveland. He wanted his own guy. He brought Najarian with him to Foxborough.
“I knew him because of the PR connection with the Jets," said Belichick. “We would play other teams and he would get PR material from them. It was a little different then. I would ask him to keep an eye out for articles relevant to our next game, like, 'what are they saying about this guy's knee?' or things like that. That's how we got started.
“I needed somebody to do the non-football stuff. Somebody who was not a coach. As a head coach, you deal with a lot of non-football things that relate to the job. Berj and I talked about different options and he said, 'Why don't I just do that?' And I said, 'Well, let's see how it goes.' "
Belichick bringing his own guy to Foxborough created an awkward situation in the Patriots PR office. Ever-capable Patriots PR director Stacey James, a Kraft favorite, had been on the job in New England for seven years when Belichick was named coach. Kraft solved the issue by allowing Belichick to hire Najarian as part of the “football staff."
James and Najarian have delicately worked around one another for almost 20 years. But if you call Patriots PR looking for the coach, the PR director will send you to Najarian.
Najarian is a rabid sports fan who attended the NFC Championship game that sent Belichick to his first Super Bowl with the Giants. He was at Shea Stadium the night the Mets beat the Red Sox in Game 7 of the 1986 World Series. He treasures a Ken Griffey Jr. baseball he caught during Home Run Derby when the All-Star Game came to Fenway Park in 1999.
Najarian was teased early in his Patriot career when Drew Bledsoe and friends sent a dozen roses to his stadium office on National Secretaries Day. More than a decade later, when the Patriots visited the White House, a bold Najarian had enough confidence to wear an Armenian flag pin (which Belichick also wore) and challenge Barack Obama for not using the word “genocide" when describing the mass murder of 1.5 million Armenians early in the 20th century.
Berj and Regina Najarian are raising two children in a Wellesley home that has a considerable link to Patriot history. Through sheer coincidence, Bill Belichick's trusted associate bought a house that was once owned by Patriots founder Billy Sullivan.
“Berj's house is the same house where my dad got the call from Lamar Hunt telling him that he had the final franchise in the American Football League," said Patrick Sullivan, a former general manager of the Patriots.
So there. The guardian at the Belichick gate goes to sleep every night in the house where the Patriots were born.
I wanted to ask Bill about all of this, but time is tight during Super Bowl week, and my private Q-and-A with the coach did not stretch long into the afternoon.
Before I got a fourth question out, Berj emerged from behind a curtain, motioned toward Belichick, pointed at his watch, and said, “We've got to go."

Texto completo: Oliver's poems have resounded, inexplicably, in my depths, at different ages and times in my life: the very definition of "struck a chord."
Poetry is for everyone. This is something I've tried to convince naysayers — students, family, friends, strangers — for as long as I can remember. After all, poetry is music and memory. It's an acknowledgment of the beauty and conundrum that is life on this planet. It speaks with a shared voice, one we understand no matter who we are or where we come from. Poetry — when it's done well — can be the vernacular of humanity.
The Oxford English Dictionary (my personal favorite) defines "vernacular" as "the native language or dialect of a particular country or district; the informal, colloquial, or distinctive speech of a people or community." Also: "a native or indigenous language; a mother tongue."
Think of vernacular as the different ways we say the same things, depending on what region of the country, or state, we're from. Some of us say "dinner" to indicate the evening meal. But many of us, my family included, say "supper."
If we need to get somewhere but don't have a car, some might say, "Can you give me a lift?" or, "Can I catch a ride?"
Years ago I heard my dad — who grew up in Columbia, South Carolina, in the 1950s — say, "Can you carry me to the store?" A child with an active imagination, I couldn't help but picture one of his friends giving my dad a piggy-back ride up the road.
But good poetry — the truth-telling, heartbreaking kind — speaks a universal language, one we all understand. That's what I mean when I say it's the vernacular of humanity.
Just as not every athlete can hit a three-pointer in a basketball game, not every poet can write in a way that touches everyone. However, Mary Oliver could.
Oliver was an American poet who passed away on Jan. 17. I'm not going tell you too much about her, because writers more capable than I have eulogized Oliver on social media, in newspapers, and beyond. Still, you should know she was born in 1935, won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, and in 2007 "The New York Times" called her "far and away, this country's best-selling poet." Which means people loved Oliver's poetry so much they paid money for it.
I didn't read Oliver's work until college. As with all proper book recommendations, I read it because a friend told me to. Leaving the library late one night, a fellow English major named Michael and I were picking through a box of giveaway books by the exit. Michael had known me all of six weeks, but he'd listened to me talk in class about my love for the great outdoors.
He picked up Oliver's 1986 collection, "Dream Work," and said, "Katie, trust me. This one's for you."
He was right. Oliver's poems have resounded, inexplicably, in my depths, at different ages and times in my life: the very definition of "struck a chord."
Because of her so-called simple language — or because, as Ruth Franklin of "The New Yorker" says, Oliver chose to write about topics like nature, beauty and God — the literary establishment at times characterized Oliver's poems as lowbrow.
But, for me, Oliver had an uncanny ability to toss aside ego, to be big-hearted, emotional and curious. She's the kind of writer I still long to be.
Consider these lines from "Wild Geese," which shows up in textbooks everywhere. Some people say it's a poem that saved their lives.
"You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
...
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting—
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things."
Now that Oliver has, as says the poet John Magee, "slipped the surly bonds of earth," I can't help but think of her poem "When Death Comes." This one means more with age: I feel its truth in my bones.
"When it's over, I want to say all my life
I was a bride married to amazement.
I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.
When it's over, I don't want to wonder
if I have made of my life something particular, and
real.
I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened,
or full of argument.
I don't want to end up simply having visited this world."
I can't choose a favorite poem of Oliver's. Please, look her up. Check out her books from the library. Read her before you go to bed, early in the morning before the house is awake, standing beside the coffee maker in the break room at work, while waiting in the carpool pick-up line. Read her as a devotional.
As for me, I keep a line of Mary Oliver's as my email signature, so I see it daily. So I continue to ask myself this question:
"Tell me, what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?"

Texto completo: 'Ike's Mystery Man'
By Peter Shinkle, Steerforth, 401 pages, $29.95

In 1957, The New York Times published a profile of President Dwight Eisenhower's first assistant for national security affairs, a position that would eventually become known as national security adviser. "No man in the Government, with the possible exception of the President, knows so many of the nation's strategic secrets," the Times declared of Robert "Bobby" Cutler. The paper then employed a mess of contradictions to describe this Massachusetts Republican. "A proper Bostonian" who is also a "Rabelaisian with a salty vocabulary," "an earnest Episcopalian" and "a man who can move so quickly from ribaldry to piety and back to ribaldry again," "a 'slave driver' who can force his staff to work as hard as he works himself" but also "a charming and generous friend," Cutler was "a bachelor's bachelor ... who has had a lifelong love affair" not with any person but with his hometown, Boston.
To add another paradox, barely hinted at by the Times: Cutler was a gay man who sat atop the national security bureaucracy at a time when people like him were being purged from government service.
This we know thanks to a new biography, "Ike's Mystery Man: The Secret Lives of Robert Cutler." Written by Cutler's great-nephew, Peter Shinkle, it is based largely upon a set of secret diaries that Cutler wrote during his time in the Eisenhower administration and that he never intended anyone, except the (human) object of his affection, to see. While the interests of America's historical record -- long bereft of gay history, which is often elusive by nature -- may be served by revealing the intimate details of Cutler's interior life, whether he merits a full-length biography is another matter.
Born into a Boston Brahmin family, Cutler was a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School. After working as a lawyer, banker and political fixer, he got to know Eisenhower personally as an aide on his 1952 national whistle-stop campaign train tour. As much as Cutler's bloodline made him a natural fit for the WASP aristocracy leading the new Eisenhower administration, his sexual orientation threatened his privileged position.
Shortly after swearing the oath of office, Eisenhower began weeding "subversives" out of the federal government. Elected amid the Red Scare, Ike had won the presidency partly because of a sense that the long-reigning Democrats were soft on communism, which in the public mind had become linked with homosexuality. A whisper campaign, abetted by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, tarred the recently divorced Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, as a homosexual; Sen. Everett Dirksen, R-Ill., associated Stevenson with "the lavender lads of the State Department." Ike's campaign slogan, "Let's Clean House," alluded not only to corruption but sedition and sexual impropriety.
On Inauguration Day, Attorney General Herbert Brownell submitted a draft executive order to the new president mandating security background checks for all new federal employees. The following day, Cutler suggested a more sweeping policy, one that had been proposed by a government commission during the previous Truman administration but never implemented. Under the proposed regulations, sexual perversion" should be a factor in determining whether an employee posed a security risk, alongside the more conventional menace of communist sympathies. While "sexual perversion" was undefined, its intended target was obvious: homosexuals.
As a result of Executive Order 10450, signed by the president on April 27, 1953, thousands of patriotic gay men and women lost their jobs in what later became known as the "Lavender Scare," far more than would ever fall victim to the Red Scare. Shinkle's contribution to history is his revelation that a gay man played an important bureaucratic role in this tragedy by advocating a policy that lowered the threshold for dismissal from disloyalty to homosexuality.
There are not many more such previously undisclosed moments in this book, however, much of which treads familiar Cold War history. Cutler emerges as a bystander to far more significant figures like Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, CIA Director Allen Dulles and Hoover.
Following a leave of absence Cutler took during the "politically sensitive" period around the 1956 re-election campaign, which may have been prompted by rumormongering about his sexuality, Hoover wrote the returning administration official a letter. "Dear Bobbie," the FBI director -- himself a bachelor dogged by gay rumors -- began, conspicuously using the feminine form. Cutler, no less catty in his reply, used letterhead from the bank at which he was working, embellished with the image of a Puritan and the motto, "Worthy of Your Trust."
"Ike's Mystery Man" becomes a genuinely engrossing read in its final third, when Cutler develops a romantic interest in a National Security Council staffer half his age. Thus begins, by his own description, "the greatest adventure of my life," an adventure that is by turns pathetic and illuminating. Pathetic, as the romance is unrequited yet strung along by the younger man, who at most admits to platonic love for Cutler. Illuminating, because it resembles the experiences of countless men and women who, forced for so long to mask their true selves, appeared to the world as mysteries.

Texto completo: Morton Sobell, ardent communist operative convicted with Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in the sensational 1951 atomic bomb spy trial, died Dec. 26 in Manhattan. He had steadfastly denied guilt for decades, then abruptly acknowledged complicity in 2008.
His death, at 101, was confirmed by his son, Mark Sobell, who did not cite a specific cause.
Mr. Sobell, who was spared the death penalty imposed on the Rosenbergs, served almost 18 years of a 30-year sentence in federal prison for his role in the Soviet espionage case that gripped the nation. The Rosenbergs were executed in 1953 amid the Cold War anti-communist fervor.
A fourth conspirator, David Greenglass, who was Ethel Rosenberg's brother, pleaded guilty in exchange for testifying against the Rosenbergs, essentially sealing their deaths. Greenglass served a 10-year prison term and was released in 1960. He died July 1, 2014, at 92.
In his dramatic turnaround confession in September 2008, Mr. Sobell, then 91, admitted in a New York Times interview that he had indeed stolen classified military documents for the Soviet Union near the end of World War II and afterward.
And in a March 2011 Weekly Standard article, he additionally admitted to photocopying hundreds of pages of secret U.S. Air Force documents with Julius Rosenberg and two other men in 1948.
But, he contended, the information involved only artillery and radar devices, not the more critical atomic bomb data that the Rosenbergs were charged with scheming to disclose. This distinction was a factor in prosecutors' decision not to seek the death penalty against Mr. Sobell.
"This was defensive," he said. "There's a big difference between giving that and stuff that could be used to attack our country."
He also supported earlier claims by researchers that Ethel Rosenberg's role in the spy ring was greatly exaggerated and Greenglass's secret notes and sketches on development of the atomic bomb in Los Alamos, N.M., during the war were crude and of little help to the Soviets.
"What he gave them was junk," Mr. Sobell said.
In a separate interview with the Times in 2001, Greenglass acknowledged that he had magnified Ethel Rosenberg's activities. He said he falsely asserted at the 1951 espionage conspiracy trial that she had typed handwritten notes from Greenglass for Julius Rosenberg to pass on to Soviet couriers - key testimony that helped lead to her conviction and death sentence.
Mr. Sobell agreed she was only peripherally involved, although she knew what her husband was doing. "What was she guilty of?" he said in his 2008 Times interview. "Of being Julius's wife."
Mr. Sobell's admissions of complicity were a shock to the public. But years earlier, spy case researchers digging into declassified U.S. and Soviet documents had largely agreed the Rosenberg ring members were guilty, though the value of the information was questionable and exaggerated by the government.
"The debate is closed. It's all over," Cold War historian Ronald Radosh told The Washington Post in 1997. "Julius Rosenberg was a spy for the Soviet Union, [but] it is clear that the Rosenbergs did not give the Soviets the 'secret' of the bomb, and they should not have been executed."
Morton Sobell was born April 11, 1917, in New York City, the son of Russian immigrants Louis Sobel and the former Rose Pasternack. He graduated from City College of New York in 1938 with a degree in electrical engineering.
He joined the Soviet-aligned Communist Party USA amid the ferment of Depression-era radicalism then rife on many American campuses. Julius Rosenberg was among his classmates and fellow Marxist activists.
In 1939, Mr. Sobell moved to Washington and worked as a civilian at the Navy Bureau of Ordnance as World War II began. He later took a job with the aircraft and marine engineering division of General Electric in Schenectady, N.Y., where prosecutors said he began relaying secret military-related data to Julius Rosenberg.
Like many other specialists assigned to classified work in civilian industry, he was exempt from the Army draft and saw no military duty.
In 1945, he married Helen Levitov Gurewitz. Five years later, as the FBI was closing in on the Rosenbergs in New York, the couple fled to Mexico City with their young son, Mark, and Helen's daughter, Sydney, by a previous marriage. Using several aliases - Marvin Salt and Morris Sand among them - Mr. Sobell sought passage to Europe, without luck.
When FBI agents learned his whereabouts in August 1950, they notified Mexican authorities, who grabbed him and his family and drove them to the Mexican border at Laredo, Tex., handing them off to waiting U.S. agents.
After his conviction in New York in 1951, both Helen Sobell and Mr. Sobell's mother, Rose, devoted much of their time lobbying to reverse his conviction and raising money for appeals.
Helen Sobell led picket lines and exhorted support at rallies in the United States and abroad, contending that her husband and the Rosenbergs were railroaded by a government caught up in the Red Scare hysteria of the day.
Rose Sobell gathered more than 8,000 signatures on a petition imploring President Lyndon B. Johnson to pardon her son, to no avail. Philosopher Bertrand Russell and painter Pablo Picasso campaigned for the cause.
Morton and Helen Sobell divorced in 1980. She died in 2002 at 84. Survivors include his son, Mark Sobell of New York; a stepdaughter, Sydney Gurewitz Clemens of San Francisco; and three grandsons.
In January 1969, at age 51, Mr. Sobell was paroled after 17 years and nine months in federal prison, five years of it spent in maximum security Alcatraz prison in San Francisco Bay.
He returned to New York City, let his hair grow long and spent time catching up on technological advances in engineering, his profession. He worked in medical electronics.
But he also continued traveling the farther shores of American politics, proclaiming his innocence, booking extensive speaking tours and visiting communist-friendly nations, including Cuba, Vietnam and East Germany.
In 1974, he published an unrepentant account of his prison years, a 525-page tome titled "On Doing Time," in which he inveighed against the legal "frameup" against him and his fellow spy defendants.
But it was more than that.
"I saw our case as an integral part of the Establishment's national policy," he wrote. "Any political trial is used to implement national policy."
Yet his admission of guilt in the 2011 Weekly Standard interview leaves a man limned with irony - the loyal ideologue who for decades had falsely denied his guilt, only to admit his complicity 20 years after the object of his loyalty had collapsed.
As he told the magazine, "I did it for the Soviet Union."

Texto completo: A 22-year-old mother died at a New York City subway station after falling down the stairs while holding a baby stroller, and lawmakers are urging transit officials to do more to improve accessibility.
On Monday night, Malaysia Goodson was found dead on the platform at the 7th Avenue/53rd Street station, reports WABC.
The station where Goodson was found did not have an elevator, and two escalators only going up, reports The New York Post.
Goodson's 1-year-old daughter was found conscious at the scene and wasn't hurt, reports NBC New York. Police aren't sure whether Goodson carried or pushed the stroller down the stairs, but said it was in her hands with the girl tucked inside, said the report.
According to The New York Times, a medical examiner is still determining whether the fall caused Goodson's death or she suffered from a medical condition.
In a statement to the Times, the Metropolitan Transit Authority called the incident a "heartbreaking tragedy" and said it's working with police.
Meanwhile, city lawmakers are criticizing the subway system for not making stations accessible enough. "This is a heartbreaking tragedy that never should have happened," said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in a post on Twitter. "The subway system is not accessible for everyone and that’s an environment the MTA should not allow. "
Only about a quarter of New York City’s 472 subway stations have elevators, and the elevators that do exist are often out of service.
New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said the city must do more to help families and the disabled. "The lack of accessibility in our subways is literally killing people," said Johnson in a post on Twitter. "I am heartbroken by this tragedy, and am keeping this family in my thoughts. "

How a Billionaire Spends His Money Is His Own Business; Progressives are more interested in scapegoating the wealthy than they are in relieving poverty.

Texto completo: What's with the New York Times and its Ken Griffin fetish?
Inside of a week, the Chicago hedge-fund manager who recently dropped $238 million on a 24,000-square-foot New York City penthouse has been featured in no fewer than three news articles. The purchase set the record for most expensive home sale in the U.S., so it's certainly newsworthy. But does it warrant a 1,700-word front-page article? And a second thousand-word story the following day? That depends on if you share the editors' progressive agenda.
The Gray Lady informs us that Mr. Griffin is worth around $10 billion, collects expensive art, and owns other pricey properties in the U.S. and abroad. A generous philanthropist, he's given away nearly three times as much money as he spent on his new residence. But the paper also wants us to know that he "has declined to join other billionaires in a pact to donate a majority of their wealth to charity" and that "critics" consider him "especially tone deaf" for "spending so freely at a moment when populist movements are gaining momentum around the globe." For good measure, we're told that the penthouse has been constructed on the site of a former rent-stabilized building. Apparently, the reader is expected to blame New York's affordable-housing troubles on Mr. Griffin and his ilk, not idiotic rent-control regulations that discourage developers from building middle-income apartments.
Suddenly, we're not reading real-estate porn anymore. The Times has shoehorned Mr. Griffin into yet another rant about stingy billionaires, income inequality and the supposed need for tax increases to expand the welfare state. A separate article even compares him unfavorably with a previous generation's ultrarich, "who had a prevailing sense that too much was distasteful." Examples include Brooke Astor, who "lived, until her death, in an apartment on Park Avenue that was not in excess of 5,000 square feet," and David and Peggy Rockefeller, who raised six kids in an Upper East Side townhouse that measured a mere 10,000 square feet. Actually, Astor died at 105 in one of her other residences, an 11,000-square-foot manor set on almost 65 acres in suburban Westchester County. And the Rockefeller estate, which is located nearby and occupies 3,500 acres of land, makes the Astor home look modest by comparison. Locals joke that "it's what God would have built, if he had the money."
How Ken Griffin and other wealthy people spend money is their business. But the left's determination to confiscate more of those dollars to redistribute to people they deem worthier concerns everyone. In a free-market system, society's most productive members tend to facilitate upward mobility for all of us, not just for themselves. And not only through their philanthropy.
Oil refining made the Rockefellers rich, but in the process, they made oil products much cheaper and thus more widely available to the poor. Prior to Standard Oil, whale oil and candles were a luxury that only the wealthy could afford. The rest had to go to bed early to save money, explains Burton Folsom, a professor of history at Hillsdale College. "By the 1870s, with the drop in the price of kerosene, middle- and working-class people all over the nation could afford the one cent an hour that it cost to light their homes at night. Working and reading became after-dark activities new to most Americans."
Rockefeller got rich and America got more productive. Henry Ford did something similar in auto manufacturing, as did Sam Walton of Walmart fame with respect to big-box discount stores. Bill Gates has done more for humanity creating his computer-software fortune than he will ever do giving it away through his foundation. Wealth creation plays a far bigger role than philanthropy or government transfer programs in improving our standard of living, something that those forever trying to "stick it to the rich" either don't understand or choose to ignore out of political expedience.
Convinced that more affluent members of our society have succeeded at the expense of the poor, progressives are insisting that Democrats make income inequality a campaign theme in 2020. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio says "there's plenty of money in the world" but "it's just in the wrong hands." New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supports a 70% top-marginal tax income tax rate and says "a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don't have access to public health is wrong." Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wants a 2% "wealth tax" on people with assets above $50 million.
History provides no evidence that Ken Griffin's wealth is somehow responsible for poverty in the Deep South, or that wealth-transfer schemes help the poor. We'll find out soon enough whether the Democrats' class-warfare rhetoric can convince voters otherwise.

Texto completo: Crawfest will return to Betty Virginia Park for its third year on March 22-March 23 in Shreveport.
The free admission will feature crawfish boiled onsite by Shane's Acadiana of Shreveport available for sale, along with food from other local vendors, including a whole hog roast by Southern Fork and beignets and crawfish sacks by Marilynn's Place.
Other concessions such as snow cones, ice cream, and beer from Great Raft Brewing, will be also available for purchase.
Live music will take place throughout the event from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday and 11 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Saturday. Local artists will have their works on display, a kid's
carnival area will be setup, and a VIP viewing area will be available. Proceeds from the event are reserved for improvements to the park.
This year's live music lineup features a variety of rock, funk, brass, blues, R&B, and Americana bands from North Louisiana, New Orleans, and Austin. New to this year's event will be sets by local DJ's, who will spin music during set breaks, providing uninterrupted music throughout the day.
Friday night will feature music from Dirtfoot – the local outfit who brands their music as "a dose of gypsy punk country grumble boogie." Friday's headliner is Dumpstaphunk, described by The New York Times as "the best funk band from New Orleans right now."
Founded by Aaron Neville's son, Ivan, and Art Neville's son, Ian, the band has wowed crowds at Bonnaroo, Voodoo Experience, Hangout Festival, and multiple appearances at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.
Saturday's live music starts with Bayou Gypsy, a popular Shreveport rock and funk cover band fronted by singer/pianist James Pendley and guitarist Danny Wilder, and a performance by the 100-member Grambling State University Tiger Marching Band. The world-famous marching band has played in Super Bowls, Rose Bowl parades, and presidential inaugurations. Tipsey, a local R&B and soul powerhouse and 2018
Louisiana Music Prize winner, will play Saturday afternoon. Following Tipsey will be Ouro Boar, a Louisiana Afrobeat band comprised of a dozen local musicians. Saturday's headliner, The Band of Heathens, will conclude the weekend's festivities. Based in
Austin, Texas, The Band of Heathens are an Americana and Southern Rock stalwart, leading the charts and captivating audiences around the world for well over a decade.
"We are thrilled to have the opportunity to throw a fun, free, family friendly event in Shreveport's historic Betty Virginia Park," said event organizer Matt Snyder. "We believe that having amazing events in the heart of our city fosters unity, promotes growth, and solidifies Shreveport's cultural identity. We look forward to growing last year's estimated crowd of 10,000 attendees. By growing to two days and assembling this year's remarkable roster of musicians, Crawfest is now a regional festival which can legitimately compete with similar events from New Orleans, Austin, Little Rock, and Nashville. Bring your family and come enjoy great local music, food, drinks, and art in the park."

Texto completo: Lions linebacker Trevor Bates remains in a New York area hospital undergoing a mental health evaluation more than 48 hours after he allegedly punched a police officer.
Jeff Jankovich, Bates' agent, released a statement on Monday saying Bates' actions after he was arrested for not paying a cab fare are "not at all consistent with the man and friend" those close to him know him to be.
"Following his incident in New York on Saturday, our client Trevor Bates was taken to an area hospital where he remains as he undergoes testing and a mental health evaluation," the statement read. "I have spoken with members of Trevor's family and others close to him, all of whom have expressed deep concern that his behavior this weekend is not at all consistent with the man and friend we know him to be.
"Since entering the NFL in 2016, Trevor has demonstrated a genuine passion for serving his community in various charitable and outreach capacities. He understands the powerful platform that comes with being a professional athlete, and his actions this weekend are in no way a reflection of who he is as a person."
Bates, 25, was arrested around 3 a.m. Saturday after he declined to pay a $32 cab fare, according to the New York Times.
According to the Twitter account Blue Lives Matter — which represents retired New York police officers — Bates punched an officer while being booked, opening a wound on the officer's face that required three stitches.
The Sergeants Benevolent Association, which claims to be made up of more than 13,000 active and retired NYPD sergeants, posted a message on Twitter in response to Bates' arrest that drew ire from observers.
"Trevor Bates acted beyond that of a wild animal," the statement posted on Twitter read. "He refused to be fingerprinted, showed disdain for the officers & decided to punch a Sgt in the face. Fighting with officers he was tasered & ripped the taser prongs from his body. He's dog crap and the NFL condones criminals."
Jankovich, in his statement, expressed concern for the officer Bates' allegedly struck.
"We take this situation very seriously and express concern for Sergeant O'Brien and the members of the New York City Police Department," the statement read. "At this time our priority is to ensure that Trevor receives the help he needs and that the privacy of the parties involved be respected until more information becomes available."
Bates appeared in nine games, mostly on special teams, and made three tackles for the Lions last season. A week before his arrest, he hosted a bowling event for children with incarcerated parents through the local organization, Pure Heart Foundation.
Lions general manager Bob Quinn said Saturday in a statement released by the team that the organization was in the process of gathering information about the incident.

LOUIS C.K. REMAINS OUTRAGEOUS AT IMPROV

Texto completo: After a good half-hour of daring us to laugh at some of life's most uncomfortable subjects, Louis C.K. turned to us with a question.
No, thankfully, not that.
"Did you think I was gonna be Jeff Dunham?" he said. "This is the only show I do. . I'm mentally ill."
In case you haven't heard, between the weird sexual habits and the Parkland school shooting jokes, the Louis C.K. brand is fairly toxic at the moment. It's iffy whether he should even walk down the street right now, but he was clearly among friends Friday night in Homestead.
The disgraced comedian is on his "Here I Come, Ready or Not" tour, coming a little over a year after allegations of sexual misconduct with multiple women - that he fully admitted to - torpedoed a hugely successful career in comedy, movies and television in the heat of the #MeToo movement.
This isn't the full-fledged comeback tour. If it were, he'd be selling out one of the Downtown theaters, if they chose to have him. C.K., whose two-night Pittsburgh Improv stand was announced on Monday and sold out by Tuesday, is testing out new material, the best of which will become his possible redemption special.
To keep the jokes under lock, phones had be placed in Yondr pouches and ticket-buyers were warned upon purchase that his material "may not be copied, translated, transmitted, displayed, distributed, or reproduced verbatim, in whole or in part, in any form, media or technology now known or later developed," which would appear to rule out time travelers.
C.K. took the stage in a gray T-shirt and didn't bother with niceties, saying that he went for a run - probably better than a slow walk, right? - in what seemed like a less than desirable (using a more PG-rated term) part of town before realizing the whole city was like that. It's January in Pittsburgh. It ain't Bermuda.
But, he admitted, with some false modesty, "I'm not a crowd pleaser."
He spent only a minute or two on his sticky situation.
"So how was YOUR year?" he said. "Bet none of you had 400 [expletive] days in a row."
There's no telling what will make the cut, but among the topics that could turn up in that special are: Do "retarded" people really care what you call them? Can't people with one leg just be miserable instead of trying to win the Olympics or get a sports drink commercial? Would he stop eating ice cream if it meant there would be no more orphans?
Along the way, there were punchlines involving 9/11, Auschwitz and domestic abuse.
In typical Louis C.K. style, it was a mix of squirmy offensive stuff about race and sex and death and your mom along with enough middle-age pathos to make him lovably, or tolerably, human.
He's probably not the person to look to for advice, but he did pass some along. Should you have the kind of unusual urges that he did, ask the other person if it's OK. Then ask, "Are you sure?" Then just don't do it.
What Pittsburghers had to say
While many of the fans in line for C.K. on Thursday night chose not go on record about their decision to buy a ticket for the comedian, John Traficante, a Point Park University theater student, was eager to talk and excited about his first chance to see him live.
"I feel like I have an idea of who he is, from watching this stand-up, watching his shows, and I'm able to see past the allegations, I guess," he said. "Everybody's trying to associate Louie with this alt-right movement, and I don't buy that. Louie's always been really honest, and that's the comedy I like. I don't want any upfront falsehood. Louie has always been just pure honesty - him, Woody Allen, that's why I like those people."
Asked if his return to the stage was premature, he said, "This is stand-up comedy. This is not a corporate job. How soon is too soon?"
A pair of Pittsburgh's women of comedy disagree.
"Not only am I grossed out that the Improv would book a known sexual predator," said Gab Bonesso, "but his most recent humor takes aim at victims of school shootings and because he had backlash from 'working out' that type of material, The Pittsburgh Improv is banning all recording of his performance. Which says to me ... there is WORSE material coming from him and I am so depressed that his shows sold out because people want to hear his warped views."
Cassi Bruno marked his appearance at the Improv this weekend with a Facebook post listing all the other comedy shows that people could see this weekend, including four at the Arcade Comedy Theater.
"What I wish was acknowledged, that doesn't get talked about," she said, "is the fact that these comics have effectively damaged the careers of women. A PR apology and a small vacation doesn't erase the fact that multiple women have missed opportunities for the sake of their well-being."
Commenting on the people who bought the tickets, Ms. Bruno said, "I think people get very attached to artists for various reasons, and whenever stories about assault come out about these guys who have hurt people, their fans jump to defense without thinking, almost as if it's a personal attack. I don't understand that. You can allow yourself to acknowledge that you enjoyed an artist's work without continuing to give them money. I think you have to acknowledge that you are allowing guys like this to continue to work at the cost of the humanity of others. C.K., for example, he's had multiple comedy specials, television shows. ... I think he'll be OK. I don't think he needs these shows at this point."

Main Street: Reporter Trolls Christian Schools

Texto completo: Remember the Ronald Reagan aphorism about the nine most terrifying words in the English language? They were: "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."
Now we have a new contender. The nine words come from the first sentence of a tweet by Dan Levin last Thursday: "I'm a New York Times reporter writing about #exposechristianschools."
He continued: "Are you in your 20s or younger who went to a Christian school? I'd like to hear about your experience and its impact on your life."
#ExposeChristianSchools is a hashtag created by Chris Stroop, a self-described "exvangelical," in response to news that Karen Pence, the vice president's wife, is returning to her old job teaching art at a Christian school in Virginia. Mr. Stroop invited his "fellow Christian school grads" to share their stories about "how traumatizing those bastions of bigotry are."
Give Mr. Levin points for timing. His tweet comes mere months after Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Jesuit high school was held up as little more than a training ground for male predators. Now it's Covington Catholic's turn. A group of Kentucky high-schoolers in Washington for the March for Life found themselves demonized after a filmed encounter with a Native American activist went viral.
As it turned out, almost everything first reported about the Covington boys was false. Not only was the Native American not a Vietnam veteran as he'd claimed, he was also the one who confronted them, not vice versa. Still the incident comports nicely with the assumptions about hate behind the new hashtag.
And irony of ironies, the Twitter fires set off by Mrs. Pence and the Covington Catholic incident continue to rage in the midst of what is now Catholic Schools Week.
For Mr. Levin's part, after his tweet was taken as a signal that he was trolling for grievances to fill out an attack piece, he issued a follow-up. A hit job was the furthest thing from his mind, he insisted. He was interested in all experiences -- "including positive stories."
David Harsanyi, a senior editor for The Federalist who says he's an atheist and supports same-sex marriage, was skeptical. It would, he said, take a "saint-like leap of faith" to believe Mr. Levin's claim he had been aiming for balance. "Anyone who's ever worked as a journalist," Mr. Harsanyi wrote in the New York Post, "can tell you that 'exposing' someone does not typically -- or perhaps ever -- entail the pursuit of positive stories."
Whatever Mr. Levin's intention, he has provoked an outpouring from people attesting to the wonderful difference Christian schools have made in their lives. Nor is it only conservatives who speak this way. Here's Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2013, offering her version of #ExposeChristianSchools when she learned her own parochial school, Blessed Sacrament in the Bronx, was shutting down.
"You know how important those eight years were?" Justice Sotomayor said in an interview with the New York Times. "It's symbolic of what it means for all our families, like my mother, who were dirt poor. She watched what happened to my cousins in public school and worried if we went there, we might not get out. So she scrimped and saved. It was a road of opportunity for kids with no other alternative."
One of the lesser known things about Catholic schools is that they boast a 99% high-school graduation rate -- with 86% going to a four-year college, nearly twice the 44% rate of public schools. Particularly in the inner cities, these schools are a lifeline, not least for the tens of thousands of non-Catholic children of color who without that education might be condemned to lives lived at the margins of the American Dream.
Among the features that set Christian schools apart is the command to see the face of Christ in each child. Human nature being what it is, reality often falls short. But it remains a beautiful expectation, a reminder that the children before you are to be not only taught but loved.
Loving them means teaching them the truth. Even the most difficult and unpopular parts of Christian teaching -- e.g., limiting sexual union to a man and a woman within marriage -- aren't meant to condemn or frustrate. They are meant to instill in young people the truth and dignity about sexuality and the human person, to help them lead healthy and happy lives.
People are free to reject these teachings. It's also fair for those who don't accept them to point out that American law and dominant culture no longer reflect this understanding of the human person. What isn't fair or reasonable is the extraordinary argument we've heard so often these past few weeks, that teaching the Christian tradition is itself hateful and un-Christian.
Though Christians believe in miracles, few have the strength of faith to expect the Times would ever allow them space to air unfiltered their witness to the splendor of Christian schools. But the Twitter feed of one New York Times reporter is now doing just that. And for this there are only two words for Mr. Levin: Thank you.

Two leading candidates in the 2021 race for mayor of New York City are already beginning their ground game.
Corey Johnson, the speaker of the New York City Council, and Scott M. Stringer, the city's comptroller, will soon begin hosting fund-raising house parties, seeking to plant a stake in what is certain to be a prolonged race for City Hall.
Neither Mr. Johnson nor Mr. Stringer have formally declared their candidacies, but the small, intimate gatherings were designed with the city's new campaign finance rules -- which increase the power of small donations -- in mind.
Mr. Johnson said that a year ago he had no plans to undertake an underdog run for mayor in 2021.
"I love this city. I love New York," Mr. Johnson said in an interview with The New York Times.
"I don't want to be public advocate. I don't want to be comptroller. And this is potentially about a run for mayor," he said. "You have to be prepared and that's why I'm preparing."
Mr. Johnson, 36, vowed to go further than any candidate ever to run for mayor in restricting the sorts of money that fuels his campaign. He said he would not take donations of more than $250 -- meaning he would need at least 7,286 contributors to reach the maximum spending limit. He also said that he would not take money from corporate political action committees or from anyone who worked for a lobbying or real estate development company. (During his 20s, Mr. Johnson once worked at a real estate firm.)
"I think this is the future of the Democratic Party," he said. "I think a lot of anxiety in New York City about gentrification and over development and people don't like any appearance of influence based off of contributions. This is a way to totally eliminate that."
He said his first house party would likely take place in March.
Mr. Stringer, 58, is in his final term as comptroller. Without yet declaring his candidacy, he spoke in broad terms about a 2021 campaign that would engage New Yorkers "in living rooms throughout the city to have the kinds of conversations that we need to have about the future of New York City."
He said in an interview that the house parties -- what he called "thought-raisers" -- would focus on issues, and that he would "ask at the end of the night that people throw a couple of dollars into the tin." Mr. Stringer's campaign said an email invitation sent Friday, which also asked for volunteers to host the gatherings, had reached 85,000 people.
"These thought-raisers are not just going to fund our 2021 race," Mr. Stringer said. "It's going to elevate the conversation that we should be having in this city."
The 2021 race does have a formally declared candidate -- the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr. -- and others have been more or less campaigning behind the scenes, including the Brooklyn borough president, Eric L. Adams.
The expected large field to replace Mayor Bill de Blasio, who must step down because of term limits, will likely include the winner of next month's special election for New York City public advocate. With the primary election more than two years away, others will also have plenty of time to jump in.
The wide-open contest bears certain similarities to the 2013 race, in which Mr. de Blasio, then the public advocate, survived a freewheeling contest punctuated by heavy spending by horse carriage opponents and the second implosion of the former congressman Anthony Weiner.
As his first major push in a second term, Mr. de Blasio spearheaded changes to the City Charter that lowered maximum contributions to $2,000 from $5,100, but increased the power of small-dollar donations, which are now matched 8-to-1 for the first $250 given to a campaign by a resident of New York City.
Candidates in 2021 can run under the new system, or stay in the old one. They have until July to decide, though Mr. Johnson and Mr. Stringer said they have already decided on the new one.
A spokesman for Mr. Adams and a spokeswoman for Mr. Diaz said their candidates were still evaluating the new rules.
Mr. Diaz, Mr. Adams and Mr. Stringer all have significantly more campaign cash in their accounts than Mr. Johnson, who did not raise money during the last fund-raising period.
"With the great matching system we have in New York City you can actually raise money from small donors," Mr. Johnson said. "It's going to take a lot of work, but it's still doable."

A woman was trapped for three days in the elevator of a Manhattan townhouse, where she worked, while the house's owners spent a weekend away, officials said.
The woman, Marites Fortaliza, 53, of Queens, was rescued Monday morning only after a person attempting to deliver something to the building contacted the home's owners. The owners sent a family member, who saw that Ms. Fortaliza was trapped inside the broken lift and called 911, police and fire department officials said.
After she was rescued Monday, Ms. Fortaliza appeared to be in good condition but was taken to a hospital for treatment, James Long, a Fire Department spokesman, said. She had been alone in the elevator since Friday evening, he added.
Firefighters reported to the home at 48 East 65th Street, a five-story building on the Upper East Side, just after 10 a.m. Monday, Mr. Long said. The firefighters forced open the doors of the elevator, which was stuck between the house's second and third floors.
Hugo Martinez, 50, who works next door, said Ms. Fortaliza appeared conscious and calm when firefighters removed her from the building on a stretcher.
The homeowners, Warren and Harriet Stephens, said in a statement released Monday that Ms. Fortaliza has worked for them for 18 years. They also said a member of their family accompanied Ms. Fortaliza to the hospital, where she was "doing well."
The elevator had most recently been inspected in July and no violations were filed, according to city records.
The city Department of Buildings said it was investigating the incident, though an inspector, Devon Simmons, who knocked on the front door Monday was not let into the building.
Mr. Simmons said he would need to do tests to determine what led to the elevator's malfunction. Until he was given access to the building, he said, the homeowners would be flagged with a violation. The Department of Buildings issued one later that day, a spokeswoman said.
Mr. Simmons did not know whether the elevator had a phone or emergency button in it. According to the Department of Buildings, buildings that do not have people continuously monitoring them are required to have buttons or phones in their elevators that can signal a service capable of taking action in an emergency.
"The cause of this unfortunate incident is being investigated," the Stephens family said in its statement, "and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that something like this never happens again."
After Mr. Simmons's visit, a mechanic for Schindler Elevator, an elevator manufacturer, walked out of the townhouse and said his company was working to determine the source of the problem.
The Stephenses purchased their townhouse, near Madison Avenue and down the block from the fine-dining stalwart Daniel, in 1999. The couple spent nearly $8 million on the home, The New York Times reported later that year. The elevator was installed before they purchased the house, which was built in 1920, property records show.
Mr. Stephens, a billionaire investor originally from Arkansas, is the chairman and chief executive of the investment firm Stephens Inc., which is based in Little Rock, Ark., but also has an office in New York. In 2018, Forbes, which ranked him 302nd on its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, estimated his net worth at $2.7 billion.
In 1999, The Times described him as "understated," and said he and his wife "zealously guarded" their family's privacy.
The incident was not the first time in recent memory that someone in New York City had been trapped in an elevator for an extended period. In 2005, a deliveryman for a Chinese restaurant was stuck in an elevator in the Bronx for roughly 81 hours.
In 1999, a man who was returning to his desk from a cigarette break was stuck in an elevator in a Midtown office building for 40 hours. He was freed after a building employee saw him on a security camera. The New Yorker later published video showing how he spent the time.

Reporter Trolls Christian Schools; A writer gets more than he bargains for when he seeks an exposé on Twitter.

Texto completo: Remember the Ronald Reagan aphorism about the nine most terrifying words in the English language? They were: "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."
Now we have a new contender. The nine words come from the first sentence of a tweet by Dan Levin last Thursday: "I'm a New York Times reporter writing about #exposechristianschools."
He continued: "Are you in your 20s or younger who went to a Christian school? I'd like to hear about your experience and its impact on your life."
#ExposeChristianSchools is a hashtag created by Chris Stroop, a self-described "exvangelical," in response to news that Karen Pence, the vice president's wife, is returning to her old job teaching art at a Christian school in Virginia. Mr. Stroop invited his "fellow Christian school grads" to share their stories about "how traumatizing those bastions of bigotry are."
Give Mr. Levin points for timing. His tweet comes mere months after Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Jesuit high school was held up as little more than a training ground for male predators. Now it's Covington Catholic's turn. A group of Kentucky high-schoolers in Washington for the March for Life found themselves demonized after a filmed encounter with a Native American activist went viral.
As it turned out, almost everything first reported about the Covington boys was false. Not only was the Native American not a Vietnam veteran as he'd claimed, he was also the one who confronted them, not vice versa. Still the incident comports nicely with the assumptions about hate behind the new hashtag.
And irony of ironies, the Twitter fires set off by Mrs. Pence and the Covington Catholic incident continue to rage in the midst of what is now Catholic Schools Week.
For Mr. Levin's part, after his tweet was taken as a signal that he was trolling for grievances to fill out an attack piece, he issued a follow-up. A hit job was the furthest thing from his mind, he insisted. He was interested in all experiences--"including positive stories."
David Harsanyi, a senior editor for The Federalist who says he's an atheist and supports same-sex marriage, was skeptical. It would, he said, take a "saint-like leap of faith" to believe Mr. Levin's claim he had been aiming for balance. "Anyone who's ever worked as a journalist," Mr. Harsanyi wrote in the New York Post, "can tell you that 'exposing' someone does not typically--or perhaps ever--entail the pursuit of positive stories."
Whatever Mr. Levin's intention, he has provoked an outpouring from people attesting to the wonderful difference Christian schools have made in their lives. Nor is it only conservatives who speak this way. Here's Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2013, offering her version of #ExposeChristianSchools when she learned her own parochial school, Blessed Sacrament in the Bronx, was shutting down.
"You know how important those eight years were?" Justice Sotomayor said in an interview with the New York Times. "It's symbolic of what it means for all our families, like my mother, who were dirt poor. She watched what happened to my cousins in public school and worried if we went there, we might not get out. So she scrimped and saved. It was a road of opportunity for kids with no other alternative."
One of the lesser known things about Catholic schools is that they boast a 99% high-school graduation rate--with 86% going to a four-year college, nearly twice the 44% rate of public schools. Particularly in the inner cities, these schools are a lifeline, not least for the tens of thousands of non-Catholic children of color who without that education might be condemned to lives lived at the margins of the American Dream.
Among the features that set Christian schools apart is the command to see the face of Christ in each child. Human nature being what it is, reality often falls short. But it remains a beautiful expectation, a reminder that the children before you are to be not only taught but loved.
Loving them means teaching them the truth. Even the most difficult and unpopular parts of Christian teaching--e.g., limiting sexual union to a man and a woman within marriage--aren't meant to condemn or frustrate. They are meant to instill in young people the truth and dignity about sexuality and the human person, to help them lead healthy and happy lives.
People are free to reject these teachings. It's also fair for those who don't accept them to point out that American law and dominant culture no longer reflect this understanding of the human person. What isn't fair or reasonable is the extraordinary argument we've heard so often these past few weeks, that teaching the Christian tradition is itself hateful and un-Christian.
Though Christians believe in miracles, few have the strength of faith to expect the Times would ever allow them space to air unfiltered their witness to the splendor of Christian schools. But the Twitter feed of one New York Times reporter is now doing just that. And for this there are only two words for Mr. Levin: Thank you.

Anthony Davis requests a trade from New Orleans, giving the Lakers an opportunity

Texto completo: For the last month and a half, no one has been discussed more as the Lakers’ mythical second superstar as much as Anthony Davis.
As of Monday morning, that pipe dream seems a little closer to reality.
ESPN reported that the 6-foot-10, five-time All Star has officially requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans, where he’s spent the first seven seasons of his career. While the Pelicans would be able to offer Davis a supermax contract extension this summer with an estimated value of $240 million, Davis’ agent, Rich Paul, has said that he won’t sign an extension, preferring instead to compete for a championship.
With the 22-28 Pelicans now dealing with an unhappy superstar, the expectation is that the Lakers will attempt to muscle into the bidding before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. While ESPN reported that New Orleans does not want to deal Davis before the summer – when more suitors such as the Boston Celtics will be available – now is the Lakers’ best chance to land one of the best two-way players in the NBA.
Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who had sworn in front of Los Angeles media a month ago that New Orleans would not trade Davis, adopted a less rigid posture as he addressed reporters after practice on Monday morning.
“Obviously it’s in the open and everyone knows,” Gentry said. “For us, it’s business as usual.”
Davis has been named to the All-NBA first team three of the last four years. Averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocked shots this season, Davis will turn 26 in March. The dream of pairing a superstar entering his prime with LeBron James, who is still producing prime-level numbers, is an enticing one for the Lakers, who desire a return to the NBA’s biggest stage for the first time since 2010.
It was an earth-shaking announcement in New Orleans, where the Pelicans released an official statement confirming the report while saying they would make any given trade on their own timeline.
“Relative to specific talks of a trade, we will do this on our terms and our timeline,” the statement read. “One that makes the most sense for our team and it will not be dictated by those outside of our organization. We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction.”
Mention of tampering seems to carry a specific edge toward the Lakers: The organization has been fined twice for tampering under the Magic Johnson-led front office. The New York Times reported Monday afternoon that the NBA was investigating tampering concerns regarding Davis, though not specifc to any one team.
But that hasn’t stopped the speculation that Davis will one day be a Laker.
Some of the most hotly discussed trade assets the Lakers have are their own promising young players: Kyle Kuzma (19.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg); Lonzo Ball (9.9 ppg, 5.4 apg); and Brandon Ingram (16.6 ppg, 4.9 rpg). Kuzma is 23, while Ball and Ingram are 21. All are still on their rookie deals with the Lakers.
Other potential trade assets include 23-year-old guard Josh Hart (8.9 ppg, 4.1 rpg) and 21-year-old center Ivica Zubac (8.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg), who has been on the rise in recent weeks. The Lakers also control their first-round draft picks for the foreseeable future.
If the Lakers were to make a trade, they’d likely also have to include one of their higher-salary players to come close enough on Davis’ $25.4 million salary. Aside from James, some of the highest-paid Lakers included Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ($12 million, but with power to veto a trade) and Rajon Rondo ($9 million).
James has welcomed the idea of playing with Davis, a possibility he called “amazing” back in December. Paul also serves as James’ agent.
The implications of a trade for Davis also reached the Lakers’ practice Friday, but they appeared just as stoic. Ingram said trading for Davis would be “good for the Lakers, or whatever team that gets him,” but maintained that players have been shutting out the persistent trade rumors that the roster could be totally upheaved.
“It feels that (speculation is) on the outside of what’s in this gym,” he said at the team’s training facility. “I think you look on social networks and look on everything else, you have all these stories of this player, this player, this player. But no one in this room, or the players, or the coaches, or the general manager doesn’t say a word about it. … We only listen to the important people in this building.”
It’s worth noting that even though the Lakers’ core players are young, they’ve done plenty of cycles through the rumor mill near the trade deadline. Ball, Kuzma and Ingram were also widely discussed over the summer as possible assets in a deal with the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard, who later was traded to the Toronto Raptors.
Coach Luke Walton said he thinks his young players have shown a stronger ability to stay above the fray this January, even as trade rumors swirl more and more. He observed that Monday’s practice, which included James, was a focused session.
“There seems to be more comfort this time around than last year when all this was happening,” Walton said. “It’s just like anything in this league: their skill set, their bodies physically. The mental part of going through these types of things gets a little better every year it goes on. You go from being young to a vet and before you know it you don’t even think about this stuff.”
It’s unclear how much, if at all, Davis will play for the Pelicans before any deal is done. Teammate Jrue Holiday said he had no hard feelings toward Davis, whom he called “a professional.”
“Whatever decision he makes, I can’t be upset with him,” Holiday said. “I know this is a business, but he’s doing what’s best for him.”

Texto completo: Pressure has been building on colleges to stop chasing the same small subset of privileged, highly test-prepped applicants and start admitting needier kids. But new research suggests that the particular form this pressure has taken — including popular rankings based on Pell enrollment — has been at least partly backfiring.


In fact, at some of the schools most celebrated for providing opportunities for poor students, admissions and financial aid offices appear to be worsening their neglect of the low- and middle-income kids we want them to help.


For decades, U.S. News & World Report rankings distorted schools’ decisions about which students to admit and how to allocate their scarce aid dollars (often throwing them at richer kids with higher test scores).


Then, a second generation of rankings came along, one intended to measure how hard schools were working to enroll high-potential, low-income students who could benefit most from a college degree.


Publications such as the New York Times and Washington Monthly published their own rankings, emphasizing admission and outcomes for Pell Grant-eligible students. U.S. News & World Report eventually introduced its own “social mobility” measure, also pegged to Pell-eligible students. And, in 2017, a team of top-tier economists produced a college report card based on intergenerational mobility. Using tax data, they calculated which schools launched the most low-income students into higher income percentiles than their parents.


State and federal policymakers (including a bipartisan group of U.S. senators) have also pursued legislation that would link schools’ funding to these or similar measures.


Thanks to this public scrutiny, the share of Pell-eligible students has indeed been rising at a number of top schools. Which, in isolation, is a good thing.


But these well-intended new rankings have also produced some unintended consequences. In particular, colleges appear to be gaming the Pell-based benchmarks to which they know the media and policymakers are paying attention.


Stanford University professor Caroline Hoxby and University of Virginia professor Sarah Turner have found that the schools that have made the most progress in increasing their numbers of Pell-eligible students appear to be doing so partly at the expense of other low-income students — specifically, those whose families make just a few too many dollars to qualify for Pell grants.


Members of that latter group — virtually indistinguishable from their counterparts barely on the other side of that arbitrary federal Pell threshold — get substantially less generous school-awarded financial aid. Their representation on these campuses has also fallen over the past few years as that for the Pell-eligible kids has risen.


Meanwhile, rich students remain very much overrepresented.


“We’ve seen this hollowing out of the middle- and lower-middle income kids, who aren’t interesting to anybody anymore,” Hoxby said.


Popular “economic opportunity” measures can cause other distortions, too — especially if tied to public funding.


For instance, public flagships in states whose populations are relatively low-income would be rewarded for enrolling large numbers of poor kids, even though poor, academically qualified kids are still underrepresented on their campuses. The reverse is true for schools in states that are relatively affluent yet still manage to enroll a disproportionately high share of poor students.


Intergenerational mobility rankings can also penalize schools in states where there’s a lot of income equality.


By national standards, for instance, Wisconsin has few people who are either very poor or very rich. As a result, the University of Wisconsin looks bad on national income mobility rankings, even though it enrolls a lot of students from the lower end of the state’s own income distribution.


It’s easy to nitpick other people’s metrics, of course. Coming up with a better alternative is harder.


In an article for the scholarly journal Education Next, Hoxby and Turner propose the following: Look at the pool of students from which a college could plausibly draw, based on its academic mission and location. Then measure how well the “relevant pool’s” income distribution is actually represented on campus.


For flagship public schools, this is relatively straightforward. For other schools, such as selective private institutions that draw applicants from around the country it’s more difficult but not impossible. Especially if schools are transparent about what their mission is and what their standards are supposed to be.


The goal is not to produce a sexy new ranking; in fact, Hoxby and Turner explicitly say their aim is not to rank all universities, since different schools have different missions. Rather, the goal is to give educators, and policymakers, better tools to hold schools accountable — to the public, and to themselves.

Texto completo: For the last month and a half, no one has been discussed more as the Lakers’ mythical second superstar as much as Anthony Davis.
As of Monday morning, that pipe dream seems a little closer to reality.
ESPN reported that the 6-foot-10, five-time All Star has officially requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans, where he’s spent the first seven seasons of his career. While the Pelicans would be able to offer Davis a supermax contract extension this summer with an estimated value of $240 million, Davis’ agent, Rich Paul, has said that he won’t sign an extension, preferring instead to compete for a championship.
With the 22-28 Pelicans now dealing with an unhappy superstar, the expectation is that the Lakers will attempt to muscle into the bidding before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. While ESPN reported that New Orleans does not want to deal Davis before the summer – when more suitors such as the Boston Celtics will be available – now is the Lakers’ best chance to land one of the best two-way players in the NBA.
Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who had sworn in front of Los Angeles media a month ago that New Orleans would not trade Davis, adopted a less rigid posture as he addressed reporters after practice on Monday morning.
“Obviously it’s in the open and everyone knows,” Gentry said. “For us, it’s business as usual.”
Davis has been named to the All-NBA first team three of the last four years. Averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocked shots this season, Davis will turn 26 in March. The dream of pairing a superstar entering his prime with LeBron James, who is still producing prime-level numbers, is an enticing one for the Lakers, who desire a return to the NBA’s biggest stage for the first time since 2010.
It was an earth-shaking announcement in New Orleans, where the Pelicans released an official statement confirming the report while saying they would make any given trade on their own timeline.
“Relative to specific talks of a trade, we will do this on our terms and our timeline,” the statement read. “One that makes the most sense for our team and it will not be dictated by those outside of our organization. We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction.”
Mention of tampering seems to carry a specific edge toward the Lakers: The organization has been fined twice for tampering under the Magic Johnson-led front office. The New York Times reported Monday afternoon that the NBA was investigating tampering concerns regarding Davis, though not specifc to any one team.
But that hasn’t stopped the speculation that Davis will one day be a Laker.
Some of the most hotly discussed trade assets the Lakers have are their own promising young players: Kyle Kuzma (19.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg); Lonzo Ball (9.9 ppg, 5.4 apg); and Brandon Ingram (16.6 ppg, 4.9 rpg). Kuzma is 23, while Ball and Ingram are 21. All are still on their rookie deals with the Lakers.
Other potential trade assets include 23-year-old guard Josh Hart (8.9 ppg, 4.1 rpg) and 21-year-old center Ivica Zubac (8.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg), who has been on the rise in recent weeks. The Lakers also control their first-round draft picks for the foreseeable future.
If the Lakers were to make a trade, they’d likely also have to include one of their higher-salary players to come close enough on Davis’ $25.4 million salary. Aside from James, some of the highest-paid Lakers included Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ($12 million, but with power to veto a trade) and Rajon Rondo ($9 million).
James has welcomed the idea of playing with Davis, a possibility he called “amazing” back in December. Paul also serves as James’ agent.
The implications of a trade for Davis also reached the Lakers’ practice Friday, but they appeared just as stoic. Ingram said trading for Davis would be “good for the Lakers, or whatever team that gets him,” but maintained that players have been shutting out the persistent trade rumors that the roster could be totally upheaved.
“It feels that (speculation is) on the outside of what’s in this gym,” he said at the team’s training facility. “I think you look on social networks and look on everything else, you have all these stories of this player, this player, this player. But no one in this room, or the players, or the coaches, or the general manager doesn’t say a word about it. … We only listen to the important people in this building.”
It’s worth noting that even though the Lakers’ core players are young, they’ve done plenty of cycles through the rumor mill near the trade deadline. Ball, Kuzma and Ingram were also widely discussed over the summer as possible assets in a deal with the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard, who later was traded to the Toronto Raptors.
Coach Luke Walton said he thinks his young players have shown a stronger ability to stay above the fray this January, even as trade rumors swirl more and more. He observed that Monday’s practice, which included James, was a focused session.
“There seems to be more comfort this time around than last year when all this was happening,” Walton said. “It’s just like anything in this league: their skill set, their bodies physically. The mental part of going through these types of things gets a little better every year it goes on. You go from being young to a vet and before you know it you don’t even think about this stuff.”
It’s unclear how much, if at all, Davis will play for the Pelicans before any deal is done. Teammate Jrue Holiday said he had no hard feelings toward Davis, whom he called “a professional.”
“Whatever decision he makes, I can’t be upset with him,” Holiday said. “I know this is a business, but he’s doing what’s best for him.”

Chris Butler and Science of Identity Foundation criticize media, decline interviews

Texto completo: When the Honolulu Star-Advertiser began reporting on a story about Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and the Science of Identity Foundation, a religious organization founded by a local spiritual leader named Chris Butler, the organization began aggressively arguing that the newspaper was using religion as a “political weapon” and was fomenting religious bigotry.
The Science of Identity Foundation has been of interest to the Star-Advertiser, in part, because its adherents have had a history of entering politics and the newspaper is exploring what influence Butler may have on their political views — in particular views relating to LGBT issues.
Political analysts have also argued that, fair or not, the Science of Identity Foundation could prove a political liability for Gabbard as she embarks on a campaign for president. People who say they are former adherents of the Science of Identity Foundation have made a litany of allegations against the organization that have at times been picked up by the press. The organization has vehemently denied those allegations.
The Star-Advertiser sought to explore those issues further.
In response, Butler and the Science of Identity Foundation hired a Beverly Hills, Calif., attorney who threatened to sue the newspaper. Their primary focus was on ensuring the Star-Advertiser didn’t publish allegations from people who say they were former practitioners of the religion, including two who told the newspaper they grew up listening to Butler’s lectures.
The “false allegations” under consideration by the newspaper “paint our clients as charlatans and hypocrites,” said attorney Anthony Glassman, in a letter to the Star-Advertiser. He said that if published it “will severely damage SIF’s and Mr. Butler’s well-­deserved reputation in their community, as religious, spiritual and moral guides (and Ms. Butler’s reputation as a yoga instructor.)”
The firm, Glassman Media Group, also warned the Star-­Advertiser that if it publishes “false and defamatory allegations that are eventually published in Ireland,” then SIF planned to also file a lawsuit there that would be litigated by Paul Tweed, a high-profile media attorney known for suing news organizations on behalf of celebrity clients. It’s not clear why the story would be of interest in Ireland, but The New York Times explained in a story last year that Tweed has “made his name suing news organizations like CNN, Forbes and The National Enquirer on behalf of Hollywood movie stars, winning high-profile cases for celebrities like Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake by hopscotching among Belfast, London and Dublin to take advantage of their favorable defamation or privacy laws.”
The Star-Advertiser asked SIF questions about the claims from people who say they were followers of Butler, much of which has been published elsewhere.
Jeannie Bishop, president of the Science of Identity Foundation, and Butler declined interview requests for the Star-­Advertiser story. But amid the reporting the Science of Identity Foundation last week purchased a 30-day ad on the Star-Advertiser’s website that suggests Butler would be speaking soon. The ad reads: “Uncensored: Exclusive Interview with Chris Butler” and “Read Now.” A link in the ad leads to a website that doesn’t have an interview with Chris Butler, but promises it’s “coming soon.”
Gabbard also didn’t respond to an interview request for the Star-Advertiser story or a detailed description of areas the story was exploring that listed questions for the congresswoman. The Star-Advertiser asked to speak with Gabbard about religious bigotry, a topic she has been outspoken about in the past, and whether she thought that could play a role in her presidential bid.
The newspaper also hoped to learn more about her religious upbringing, including two years that she spent in the Philippines as a teenager at a school reportedly run by followers of Butler. (The Honolulu Advertiser had reported in the 1980s that Butler had set up a nonprofit educational arm and that it was leasing spaces for schools in the Philippines. However, Bishop told the Star-Advertiser last week that “SIF and Chris Butler did not and do not own the schools in the Philippines and have never been affiliated with them.”)
While Gabbard didn’t respond to the Star-Advertiser’s inquiries, or even acknowledge them, the Science of Identity Foundation did jump in to advocate on her behalf.
Bishop sent a letter to the Star-Advertiser, signed by three dozen people from multiple states and diverse backgrounds, that criticized the newspaper’s past reporting on Butler and the foundation, as well as recent stories published by The New Yorker and The Intercept.
The letter said the Star-Advertiser “has a decades long history of slandering Chris Butler, his students and the Science of Identity Foundation, a spiritual organization in the Hindu Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition.”
“It has sought to discredit and vilify Chris Butler, SIF and its adherents for political purposes by otherizing and casting doubt about the ‘Americanness’ of their spiritual beliefs and practices, giving voice to anonymous sources to promote false and defamatory information, and citing biased and questionable sources which echo their animosity towards this religious community.
“The Star Advertiser is now broadening its target to the broader Hindu American community. A reporter, in her questions to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu American to be elected to the US Congress, and now first Hindu American to run for president, has made clear once again, that the intent of the next Star Advertiser story is not to provide accurate information, but to validate yet another anti-Hindu narrative.”
The letter also took aim at stories published in The New Yorker and The Intercept, referring to them as “disreputable sources.” They accused The New Yorker of publishing a profile of Gabbard that portrayed her religion in a “salacious and bigoted manner.”
Bishop also said in a separate email to the Star-Advertiser that The New Yorker article had “many inaccuracies, but it has outright lies and misrepresentations, as well as quotes used out of context in order to change the meanings of Chris Butler’s words. This is not a he said she said situation because we have an actual recording of the interview. And the sections in the article pertaining to Chris Butler are full of damaging inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and falsehoods — using his quotes out of context to change the meaning, obviously for malicious purpose.”
SIF did not cite any specific inaccuracies in the story published by The New Yorker. A spokeswoman for The New Yorker said by email that: “This piece was carefully reported and thoroughly fact-checked, and we stand by it.”
The Star-Advertiser contacted a dozen people who signed the letter. Many didn’t respond to emails or phone messages. But those whom the Star-Advertiser did speak with said they weren’t familiar with the past reporting by the Star-Advertiser or other news organizations cited in the letter. But they were told the newspaper was seeking to portray Gabbard’s religion in a negative light.
“The concern that I understood was that you were going to draw attention to her religious affiliation and kind of like spoof that as a ‘that is not a good person to pick for president of the United States,’” said local attorney Jack Schweigert, one of the letter signers. “That was basically it.”
He said he had been told there was going to be something disparaging written about Gabbard.
Gurudev Allin, also a local attorney, said he had similar concerns.
“My concern is that I don’t want to see Tulsi’s faith marched out there and used as a basis to criticize her,” he said. Allin, who said he is Hare Krishna but not a member of the Science of Identity Foundation, said that as a member of a religious minority, it’s something about which he is particularly sensitive .
The Star-Advertiser story seeks to explore the intersection of religion in politics, a topic Gabbard herself has not shied away from as a politician in raising questions about what she has referred to as “radical Islamic extremism” and its role in political and military conflicts in the Middle East.

Texto completo: Rep. King applauded at first Iowa event since House rebuke
PRIMGHAR, Iowa - Constituents applauded Republican Rep. Steve King on Saturday at the Iowa congressman's first public event since being rebuked by his House colleagues over racist comments he had made to a newspaper earlier this month.
King told the roughly 75 people who showed up for the first of 39 planned town hall meetings in his sprawling district that he doesn't adhere to a white supremacist ideology and he repeated his assertion that he's not racist.
The nine-term House member caused an uproar after he was quoted in a New York Times story saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King claimed his comments were taken out of context, but the House voted 424-1 to rebuke him, with King himself voting in favor of the resolution, and Republican leaders denied him any committee assignments.
Addressing what he called "the elephant in the room" in his opening remarks at Saturday's event, King expressed frustration that his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy in The New York Times interview led to even his fellow Republicans disowning him.
"It is stunning and astonishing to me that four words in a New York Times quote can outweigh 20-some years of public service, 20-some years of giving you my word every day," King said.

Trudeau fires envoy to China over U.S. extradition remarks
TORONTO - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired Canada's ambassador to China after the envoy said it would be "great" if the U.S. dropped its extradition request for a Chinese tech executive arrested in Canada. Trudeau said Saturday he had asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation Friday night.
McCallum made the remark Friday to the Toronto Star. That came a day after he issued a statement saying he misspoke about the case earlier and regretted saying Meng Wanzhou has a strong case against extradition.
The arrest of the daughter of the founder of Huawei Technologies Ltd. at Vancouver's airport Dec. 1 damaged relations between China and Canada. The U.S. wants her extradited to face charges that she committed fraud by misleading banks about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.

U.S. envoy points to 'significant progress' in talks with Taliban
KABUL, Afghanistan - The U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan said Saturday that "significant progress" was made during lengthy talks with the Taliban in Qatar and that he was traveling to Afghanistan for more discussions aimed at ending the country's 17-year war.
Zalmay Khalilzad said on Twitter that he wants to build on six days of meetings in Doha.
Taliban officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they have reached an understanding on the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops and that Afghan soil will not be used for attacks or threats against other countries.
There was also no indication that the Taliban would agree to a cease-fireor when the Taliban would hold direct talks with the Afghan government, something they have continued to reject.

Manhunt underway for suspect in 5 related killings in Louisiana
NEW ORLEANS - Authorities in Louisiana say separate but related shootings Saturday in two parishes have left five people dead, and they're searching for a 21-year-old man they say is "armed and dangerous."
Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre said Dakota Theriot is the "prime suspect" in the deaths of Keith and Elizabeth Theriot of Gonzales, his parents.
The sheriff said three other shooting deaths occurred Saturday in neighboring Livingston Parish, about 70 miles west of New Orleans.
"We feel that they are related," Webre said.
Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard identified the victims as Billy Ernest, 43, Summer Ernest, 20, and Tanner Ernest, 17. Two children fled. A neighbor said Theriot was the older daughter's boyfriend.

Merkel calls on each citizen to fight anti-Semitism
BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on every citizen to help fight anti-Semitism ahead of International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Merkel said Saturday in her weekly podcast: "Today we are seeing a very different kind of anti-Semitism: there's the hatred of Jews by our local people, but also by Muslim migrants."
In recent years, Germany has seen a rising number of attacks against Jews that led the government to appoint a commissioner against anti-Semitism. It's also funding the creation of a national registration office for anti-Semitic hate crimes.
On Sunday, Germany and other countries will mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day - 75 years after the Soviet army liberated the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland. Some 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.

Death toll rises to 40 in collapse at Brazil mine
BRUMADINHO, Brazil - The death toll from the collapse of a dam holding back mine waste in southeastern Brazil rose to 40 Saturday as searchers in helicopters and rescuers laboring in deep mud uncovered more bodies. More than 200 people were still missing and authorities expected the death toll to rise.
Romeu Zema, the governor of the state of Minas Gerais, warned that those responsible "would be punished."
Daily Folha de S.Paulo reported Saturday that the dam's mining complex, owned and operated by Brazilian mining company Vale, was issued an expedited license to expand in December due to "decreased risk."
Preservation groups in the area say the approval was unlawful.

Texto completo: PRIMGHAR, Iowa - Constituents applauded Republican Rep. Steve King on Saturday at the Iowa congressman's first public event since being rebuked by his House colleagues over racist comments he had made to a newspaper earlier this month.
King told the roughly 75 people who showed up for the first of 39 planned town hall meetings in his sprawling district that he doesn't adhere to a white supremacist ideology and he repeated his assertion that he's not racist.
The nine-term House member caused an uproar after he was quoted in a New York Times story saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King claimed his comments were taken out of context, but the House voted 424-1 to rebuke him, with King himself voting in favor of the resolution, and Republican leaders denied him any committee assignments.
Addressing what he called "the elephant in the room" in his opening remarks at Saturday's event, King expressed frustration that his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy in The New York Times interview led to even his fellow Republicans disowning him.
"It is stunning and astonishing to me that four words in a New York Times quote can outweigh 20-some years of public service, 20-some years of giving you my word every day," King said.
Trudeau fires envoy to China over U.S. extradition remarks
TORONTO - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired Canada's ambassador to China after the envoy said it would be "great" if the U.S. dropped its extradition request for a Chinese tech executive arrested in Canada. Trudeau said Saturday he had asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation Friday night.
McCallum made the remark Friday to the Toronto Star. That came a day after he issued a statement saying he misspoke about the case earlier and regretted saying Meng Wanzhou has a strong case against extradition.
The arrest of the daughter of the founder of Huawei Technologies Ltd. at Vancouver's airport Dec. 1 damaged relations between China and Canada. The U.S. wants her extradited to face charges that she committed fraud by misleading banks about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.
U.S. envoy points to 'significant progress' in talks with Taliban
KABUL, Afghanistan - The U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan said Saturday that "significant progress" was made during lengthy talks with the Taliban in Qatar and that he was traveling to Afghanistan for more discussions aimed at ending the country's 17-year war.
Zalmay Khalilzad said on Twitter that he wants to build on six days of meetings in Doha.
Taliban officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they have reached an understanding on the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops and that Afghan soil will not be used for attacks or threats against other countries.
There was also no indication that the Taliban would agree to a cease-fireor when the Taliban would hold direct talks with the Afghan government, something they have continued to reject.
Manhunt underway for suspect in 5 related killings in Louisiana
NEW ORLEANS - Authorities in Louisiana say separate but related shootings Saturday in two parishes have left five people dead, and they're searching for a 21-year-old man they say is "armed and dangerous."
Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre said Dakota Theriot is the "prime suspect" in the deaths of Keith and Elizabeth Theriot of Gonzales, his parents.
The sheriff said three other shooting deaths occurred Saturday in neighboring Livingston Parish, about 70 miles west of New Orleans.
"We feel that they are related," Webre said.
Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard identified the victims as Billy Ernest, 43, Summer Ernest, 20, and Tanner Ernest, 17. Two children fled. A neighbor said Theriot was the older daughter's boyfriend.
Merkel calls on each citizen to fight anti-Semitism
BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on every citizen to help fight anti-Semitism ahead of International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Merkel said Saturday in her weekly podcast: "Today we are seeing a very different kind of anti-Semitism: there's the hatred of Jews by our local people, but also by Muslim migrants."
In recent years, Germany has seen a rising number of attacks against Jews that led the government to appoint a commissioner against anti-Semitism. It's also funding the creation of a national registration office for anti-Semitic hate crimes.
On Sunday, Germany and other countries will mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day - 75 years after the Soviet army liberated the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland. Some 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
Death toll rises to 40
in collapse at Brazil mine
BRUMADINHO, Brazil - The death toll from the collapse of a dam holding back mine waste in southeastern Brazil rose to 40 Saturday as searchers in helicopters and rescuers laboring in deep mud uncovered more bodies. More than 200 people were still missing and authorities expected the death toll to rise.
Romeu Zema, the governor of the state of Minas Gerais, warned that those responsible "would be punished."
Daily Folha de S.Paulo reported Saturday that the dam's mining complex, owned and operated by Brazilian mining company Vale, was issued an expedited license to expand in December due to "decreased risk."
Preservation groups in the area say the approval was unlawful.
In addition to the 40 bodies recovered, 23 people were hospitalized.
In Mexico: The death toll from a pipeline explosion last week in Tlahuelilpan, a town in central Mexico, has risen to 114, while 33 people remain hospitalized. Hundreds of people were in the vicinity of an illegal pipeline tap that spewed gasoline in the town Jan. 18 when the liquid caught fire and exploded into a fireball.

Texto completo: The creators of "Hamlet 360" describe the project as the rare instance where an entire play has been adapted to take advantage of the immersive possibilities of virtual reality.
But plenty of other theater artists -- from the experimental to the commercial -- have been making use of new technologies. Sometimes their work is seen, or heard, on a traditional stage; in other cases the boundaries between stage and screen are blurred. Here are several recent examples.
Don't put away your phone
The Builders Association, which has incorporated cutting-edge technology into its work for decades, encouraged cellphone use for its 2015 augmented-reality-aided production, "Elements of Oz." After downloading an app, audience members could watch the action onstage, along with nifty extras: Point the phone at Dorothy's house, for example, and images of a tornado appeared onscreen.
Smartphones played a key supporting role in James Graham's "Privacy," at the Public Theater, too, demonstrating -- sometimes uncomfortably -- how much could be gleaned about a randomly gathered group of theater fans by the devices they carried in their pockets.
Digital wizardry in 'The Tempest'
Working with Intel and a motion-capture company founded by Andy Serkis (Gollum from "Lord of the Rings" trilogy), the Royal Shakespeare Company featured an unusually shape-shifting Ariel in its 2017 production of "The Tempest."
Mark Quartley, the actor playing Ariel, appeared both onstage and, at moments when his character referred to magic, as a digitally created avatar, filmed live and projected onto screens moving over fellow actors.
More 'Object' lessons
Sensorium, the company that oversaw the technical direction on "Hamlet 360," also helped to develop "objects in mirror AR closer than they appear," an extension of Geoff Sobelle's acclaimed one-man show "The Object Lesson."
Presented at New York Theater Workshop and at the Tribeca Film Festival, the piece gave viewers the chance to wander through sections of Mr. Sobelle's clutter-filled set and, using smartphone technology, watch and learn more about what was inside the many boxes and drawers -- further fleshing out, visually and aurally, what Ben Brantley in The New York Times called the "connective poetry in the seeming randomness of what we hoard."
Musical videos in surround
[Video: 'Circle of Life' in 360º | THE LION KING on Broadway Watch on YouTube.]
Musicals like "The Lion King," "Hamilton" and "School of Rock" have made videos that allow viewers to experience what it's like onstage during a big number. You can circle your way through "Circle of Life," or, in the case of "School of Rock," use a mouse to explore a classroom where the school-age musicians headbang under the "guidance" of their teacher.
Playing with sound
"No production on Broadway has ever thrown the doors of perception open as widely as 'The Encounter,"' Ben Brantley wrote of the 2016 show, courtesy of the London-based Complicite, which piped binaural sound through headsets to capture the journey of a Western explorer lost in the Amazon rain forest.

'Earl is not my name'

Texto completo: For the rapper and producer known professionally as Earl Sweatshirt, self-awareness was once burdensome. You could feel the weight of his conscience in his music as he wrestled with the massive expectations that have followed him his entire career. A product of rap's blog era and a child of the Internet, he came into fame young and fast, his enigmatic persona only adding to his outsized legend since he was 16.
But now, at 24, the Los Angeles native has been liberated.
His latest album, "Some Rap Songs," widens the gulf between Earl Sweatshirt and the man born Thebe Kgositsile. Now, more than ever, the former feels like an adolescent username the latter has left behind: "Earl is not my name, the world is my domain," he declares on the off-kilter track, "Veins."
Each of his major-label albums has grown shorter in duration and more obscure in nature. "Some Rap Songs" is his most abstract project to date: brief, at under 25 minutes across 15 songs, reflective and amorphous in composition. He unspools the lyricism he became famous for, yielding more free-form expression. The more comfortable he's grown with himself, the more ambitious - and mature - his music has become.
"There's always going to be a perception of who that guy is that's not necessarily accurate," says New York Magazine music critic Craig Jenkins, who interviewed the rapper last fall. The question is whether fans will accept who Thebe Kgositsile has become, rather than who Earl Sweatshirt is supposed to be.
He was crowned a lyrical genius for his precocious "Earl" mix tape in 2010, when he was just a teen. The same year, the grotesque skate-video-inspired music video (think bloody teeth, ripped-off fingernails and a "milkshake" with unspeakable ingredients) for the project's title track, made him a viral star. By 2011, his mother, concerned about how fame was compounding his adolescent misbehavior, sent him to a Samoan program for at-risk boys at the pinnacle of his now-dissolved Odd Future faction's popularity.
The sprawling collective embodied youthful insolence and notably trolled their way into prominence, admonishing popular blogs for not playing their music and exhibiting disdain for authority. They were hip-hop's annoying yet hilarious younger siblings, and Earl Sweatshirt was the most fascinating of the group. His absence created a mystique, making him a symbol of youth in revolt before his 18th birthday.
His fan base included those energized by Odd Future's needling subversion and hip-hop purists entranced by his elaborate rhyme schemes. The burden of navigating celebrity he didn't ask for during his formative years proved a difficult balance, as expressed in Sweatshirt's 2013 debut album, "Doris," and 2015's "I Don't Like S---, I Don't Go Outside."
On "Mantra," from the latter album, Sweatshirt paints an anxiety-riddled picture of a public figure who belongs to his fans: "Who you can't get mad at when they want a pound or pic/'Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick/And they the reason that the paper in your trousers' thick."
"I ain't been outside in a minute, I've been livin' what I wrote," he declares on "Grief."
He also had to shoulder the weight of his parents' prominence. His mother is the UCLA law professor Cheryl Harris; his father is the South African poet laureate and activist Keoropaste Kgositsile, who died last January. The rapper's contentious relationship with his parents has been a constant theme in his music. His father left the family when he was a child, and his parents' accomplishments - particularly his father's - cast a shadow: "And when them expectations raising 'cause daddy was a poet, right?" the rapper says on "Burgundy."
In a 2013 interview with the New York Times Magazine, he bristled at the relationship between poetry and rap, calling the notion that the former could be the latter "so familiar that it's annoying." "I've heard that so much, growing up in a house with poetry," he said of the association between the two.
But through "Some Rap Songs," he embraces the connection to his past and its role in his identity. "Red Water" repeats the same stanza ("I know I'm a king, stock on my shoulder I was sinkin'/I ain't know that I could leave . . .") for the entirety of the song - poetry on loop. "Mama said she used to see my father in me; said I was not offended," he says, on the radiant "Azucar."
"Playing Possum" pairs audio of his father reciting his poem "Anguish Longer Than Sorrow" with a 2014 keynote speech from his mother, creating not just an homage, but what feels like a conversation between his parents.
"His father was a famous poet, so that had to come out of him," says producer and rapper Adé Hakim, who co-produced Sweatshirt's fluttering "Nowhere2go" with fellow sLUms member Darryl Johnson. "You can hear it in the way he glides over the beats. It's like spoken word. It's just innate. It's in his heritage. It's who he is."
Jenkins says Sweatshirt is leaning into the role ancestry plays in his music. He called "Some Rap Songs" a synthesis of Sweatshirt's influences, from his parents, to jazz, to the "real serious, offbeat, weirdo hip-hop" of MF Doom, Jay Dilla and Madlib, to name a few.
"Some Rap Songs" was Sweatshirt's final album on Columbia Records, according to a recent Pitchfork profile. Hakim, who says Sweatshirt realized his influence on the sLUms collective and took them under his wing, adds that the rapper's future music might not even be released under that stage name.
After experiencing growing pains under a microscope, Thebe Kgositsile has found freedom from Earl Sweatshirt. In a news release about the album, he acknowledged the evolution: "In order for my growth to be complete, the work has to reflect it." The process involved accepting the connection between his forebears, himself and the artists he's inspired.
"He's a link between generations," Jenkins says, of "Some Rap Songs." "And he knows it, too."

'Rent' goes live in fresh production

Texto completo: WEEKEND'S MUST-SEE: "Rent" live, 8 p.m. Sunday, Fox.
Jonathan Larson was frank about it. "I'm the future of the American musical," he told a friend. That seemed like a long shot. He ran the post-show cabaret at the Augusta Barn Theatre, near Battle Creek. He held a waiter job in New York for nine years. He wrote a modern "La Boheme" for seven years.
Then his prediction came true. Shortly after his death (at 35, of an aneurysm) in 1996, his musical opened. "'Rent' ... shimmers with hope for the future of the American musical," the New York Times wrote. Here's a fresh production, done live with Jordan Fisher, Vanessa Hudgens, Mario and more.
WEEKEND'S MUST-SEE II: "Three Identical Strangers," 9 and 11 p.m. Sunday, CNN, barring breaking news.
On his first day at an obscure college, Bobby Shafran kept being greeted like an old friend. It took a while to figure it out: Eddie Galland – the twin he never knew about – had been there a year earlier. But they weren't just twins; their story attracted David Kellman, re-uniting triplets separated at birth.
This compelling documentary starts with three 19-year-olds embracing life. Enjoy that while it lasts; coming up are serious issues – science ethics, parenting, nature vs. nurture – in a far-ranging film.
WEEKEND'S ALTERNATIVE: "Planet Earth: Dynasties," 9 p.m. today, BBC America, AMC, IFC and Sundance; also, 12:25 a.m., BBC America.
Being the alpha male is a mixed blessing. For David – an alpha chimp in Senegal – that means he can, if he wishes, be the only one to mate with the females. It also means the other males want to kill him.
We meet him three years into his reign, which is a relatively long time for chimps. Beautifully filmed and narrated, this episode (the second of five) is alternately depressing and uplifting.
BOTH DAYS:
Movie marathon. At 8 p.m. Sunday, the Screen Actors Guild has its awards, including a lifetime one for Alan Alda. First, Turner Classic Movies has a marathon, concluding at 6 p.m. Sunday with Alda in Neil Simon's witty "California Suite" (1978).

Texto completo: The Oscar nominees for best picture have been announced, and everyone is playing catch-up. For many, that means finally making an effort to see all the nominees. But after a few solid months of nonstop chatter, even moviegoers who are all caught up on viewing may still want to catch up on what's being said.
If you're looking for a rundown on the gossip, the politics and the critical response surrounding the eight contenders, we've compiled some of the best reviews, interviews and other fun stuff.

'Green Book'
"'Green Book" Review: A Road Trip Through a Land of Racial Clichés' [The New York Times]
The director Peter Farrelly's treatment of the real-life concert tour undertaken by the piano virtuoso Dr. Don Shirley and his hired muscle, Frank Vallelonga, rang false for the Times critic A.O. Scott. "There is virtually no milestone in this tale of interracial male friendship that you won't see coming from a long way off," he writes, "including scenes that seem too corny or misguided for any movie in its right mind to contemplate. 'Siri, please tell me they're not going there.' Oh, but they are."
'The Truth About "Green Book"' [Vanity Fair]
K. Austin Collins fact-checks the film's depiction of the friendship between Frank and Dr. Shirley and finds that all may not be on the straight and narrow. "'Green Book' purports to be about racial reconciliation, a popular sentiment among people who want everyone, holding hands, to take responsibility for ending white supremacy -- not just its beneficiaries," he writes. "It's a troubling, tedious idea, but a very common one -- rooted, I think, in a desire to be forgiven. A desire for a leveled playing field, wiped clean of guilt."
'How "Green Book" Became This Year's Polarizing Awards Contender' [The Washington Post]
Sonia Rao compiles some of the conflicting critical takes on Farrelly's film and finds that his approach to feel-good reconciliation has made his work into an unlikely lightning rod of controversy. "The movie, a buddy comedy of sorts, has racked up accolades," she writes, "but 'Green Book' has also received its fair share of backlash, largely from critics who find fault with how it handles racial conflict."

Black Panther
'Review: "Black Panther" Shakes Up the Marvel Universe' [The New York Times]
In her rave review of "Black Panther," the Times critic Manohla Dargis gives thanks for a sorely needed dose of originality and distinction in the increasingly crowded superhero genre. "A jolt of a movie, 'Black Panther' creates wonder with great flair and feeling partly through something Hollywood rarely dreams of anymore: myth," she writes. "Most big studio fantasies take you out for a joy ride only to hit the same exhausted story and franchise-expanding beats. Not this one."
[What were the snubs? What were the surprises? Read our roundup here.]
'Why "Black Panther" Is a Defining Moment for Black America' [The New York Times]
Carvell Wallace shares an intimate perspective on the preciousness of fandom in the black community, particularly in his hometown, Oakland. "Beyond the question of what the movie will bring to African-Americans," he writes, "sits what might be a more important question: What will black people bring to 'Black Panther'? The film arrives as a corporate product, but we are using it for our own purposes, posting with unbridled ardor about what we're going to wear to the opening night, announcing the depths of the squads we'll be rolling with, declaring that Feb. 16, 2018, will be 'the Blackest Day in History."'
'Wakanda for Oscar?' [The New York Times]
The Times's in-house academy prognosticator Kyle Buchanan considers the odds that superhero cinema will finally break into the awards circuit, with a special focus on the director Ryan Coogler's female collaborators. "Coogler likes to surround himself with accomplished women, and the crew of 'Black Panther' is unusual among blockbusters for its large number of female department heads," he notes. "They include the director of photography Rachel Morrison and production designer Hannah Beachler, who both worked on Coogler's first feature, "Fruitvale Station," as well as Ruth E. Carter, the veteran costume designer responsible for Wakanda's striking looks."

"'Black Panther" Brings Hope, Hype, and Pride' [The New York Times]
'A Star Is Born'
'Review: "A Star Is Born" Brings Gorgeous Heartbreak' [The New York Times]
In her Critic's Pick review, Manohla Dargis praises the classicism and modernism of a Hollywood fable continuously refreshing itself: "Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema," she writes. "That it's also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better." She also singles out Lady Gaga's performance as the ingénue Ally, describing her as "touchingly vulnerable."
[Many of the major nominees are already streaming. Here's where to find them.]
'How the New "A Star Is Born" Complicates an Old View of Womanhood' [The New York Times]
Aisha Harris, an editor at The Times, examines the gender dynamics of Bradley Cooper's film and how they challenge hidebound archetypes about great men and the women who make sacrifices on their behalf. "On the surface, it feels antiquated, this persistent suggestion that only in her husband's death can Ally become the star she is meant to be," Harris writes. "Yet the more I consider how Cooper depicts the ebbs and flows of their relationship, the more I find this latest version intriguing in the way it complicates an already complicated narrative."
'Is "A Star Is Born" Campy, or Have We Forgotten How to Feel?' [The New York Times]
The Times's Kyle Buchanan ponders just how seriously audiences are supposed to take the towering emotions and multi-hankie pathos of this tale of showbiz tragedy: "Is the movie itself a new camp classic, now that it can be viewed in full? I keep seeing reactions that treat 'A Star Is Born' that way, or that dismiss it as 'schmaltzy,' and I have to confess that I'm surprised."

'Roma'
"'Roma" Review: Alfonso Cuarón's Masterpiece of Memory' [The New York Times]
Manohla Dargis made this domestic epic a Critic's Pick, saving special praise for the heartfelt, audacious direction from Alfonso Cuarón. "Cuarón served as the director of photography for 'Roma,' and his work here is astonishing," she writes. "He shot the movie in black-and-white, large-format digital, creating images that have extraordinary clarity, detail and tonality, with entire rainbows of gray, black and white."
'Mexico City as the Director of "Roma" Remembers It (and Hears It)' [The New York Times]
The Times correspondent Kirk Semple joins Cuarón on a one-of-a-kind tour through Mexico's capital as he shares his memories of the home that provided the setting for "Roma." "There is a minor but crucial character in the film 'Roma' who isn't listed in the credits and appears onscreen only for a fleeting moment," Semple writes. "He's mostly heard, not seen. Yet he makes a deep emotional mark on the movie. He's a sweet-potato vendor, a longstanding figure in Mexico City's populous community of itinerant street salesmen."
'Yalitza Aparicio of "Roma" and the Politics of Stardom in Mexico' [The New York Times]
The rise of the film's lead, Aparicio Yalitza, a nonprofessional actress, has become a story as compelling as anything onscreen in 'Roma.' The writer Laura Tillman visits the newly minted star in her native Mexico to discuss how her public profile has changed how we think about class: "In Mexico, 'Roma' is more than a personal project by a famous director. It has started a national conversation about inequality, the treatment of domestic workers and who is welcome on the red carpet in a country where Indigenous women are rarely seen in magazines, much less at Hollywood awards shows."

'BlacKkKlansman'
'Spike Lee's "BlacKkKlansman" Journeys Into White America's Heart of Darkness' [The New York Times]
In his review of Spike Lee's latest, A.O. Scott writes, "'BlacKkKlansman' is a furious, funny, blunt and brilliant confrontation with the truth. It's an alarm clock ringing in the midst of a historical nightmare, and also a symphony, the rare piece of political popular art that works in all three dimensions." He also celebrates Lee's enduring streak of subversion: "Is it better to work inside the system, to push against it from the outside or to smash it to pieces? This is an old, unresolvable debate, a tension that has partly defined Mr. Lee's own career."
'Spike Lee Takes on the Klan' [The New York Times]
The writer Salamishah Tillet conducts interviews with Spike Lee, John David Washington, Topher Grace and one of the film's producers (originally slated to be its director) Jordan Peele, among others, about the production. "I knew if I couldn't direct this, I couldn't think of anybody better than Spike for this project," Peele said. "It just falls right into his unique tone, which is always different. Sometimes comedic, sometimes harrowing, usually socially relevant and political."
'How Black Detective Ron Stallworth Infiltrated the Colorado Klan' [The Washington Post]
DeNeen L. Brown seeks out the real-life Ron Stallworth to hear firsthand the story of how he infiltrated a local chapter of the KKK as a black man: "[The local Klan organizer] asked, Stallworth said, 'why I wanted to join 'The Organization,' as they called it.' Stallworth, who was born in Chicago and grew up in El Paso, thought about all the times in his life he'd been called the N-word. He thought about the most vile, hate-filled response he could give to impress a Klan member."

'Bohemian Rhapsody'
"'Bohemian Rhapsody" Review: Another One Bites the Dust' [The New York Times]
A.O. Scott's review laments the sanding-off of Freddie Mercury's edge, leaving an anodyne take on a controversial life. "'Bohemian Rhapsody,' the movie about Queen, lasts more than two hours, not a very long time by modern feature standards, even though it feels interminable," he writes. "A baroque blend of gibberish, mysticism and melodrama, the film seems engineered to be as unmemorable as possible, with the exception of the prosthetic teeth worn by the lead actor, Rami Malek, who plays Freddie Mercury, Queen's lead singer."
'Queen, Ally, and the Alchemy of Musical Stardom on the Big Screen' [The New York Times]
Watching a clip of the real-life Mercury on a train platform's entertainment system clarifies the shortcomings of Bryan Singer's film for the critic Wesley Morris. "Mercury does all his Mercurial moves -- the side gallop, the chug-a-lug, the duck strut, the steed swipe, the rewind, the vroom-vroom, the Wimbledon Final frozen pirouette, the one where he kind of dries his tushy with the microphone stand in a full march," Morris remembers. "And he does them while belting out this uppercut of a song (with some shockingly forceful assistance from the drummer Roger Taylor). Commuters, tourists, kids: We looked up at this thing, mesmerized, in jeopardy of missing a train."
'The Man Behind Freddie Mercury's Teeth in "Bohemian Rhapsody"' [The New York Times]
The Times editor Mekado Murphy gains some behind-the-scenes insight on the film by speaking with the technical wizards who created the teeth for Rami Malek, who played Mercury. "If you thought Rami Malek's teeth were big in 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' consider this: They could have been even bigger," he writes. "The giant prosthetic choppers the actor wore to help bring Freddie Mercury to life were made in different sizes, including a set that were the actual size of Mercury's teeth, but they were a little too large for Malek's face."
'When Queen Took "Bohemian Rhapsody" to Live Aid' [The New York Times]
"'Bohemian Rhapsody" Sing-Along Versions Coming to Theaters' [The New York Times]
'Rami Malek Hits Back at "Bohemian Rhapsody" Critics' [Indiewire]
The Favourite
"'The Favourite" Review: Scheming for Power in a Kinky Palace Triangle' [The New York Times]
A.O. Scott's review applauds the director Yorgos Lanthimos's flair for exposing the grotesquerie of royal personalities, and in doing so, finding the worst in all of us. "The best -- and also the most troubling -- thing about 'The Favourite' is its rigorously bleak assessment of human motivations and behavior," Scott rules. "The palace is a petri dish aswarm with familiar pathogens of egoism, cruelty and greed. A sentimental soul might wish for a glimpse of something else, but at the same time it's hard to say that anything is missing from this tableau, which is also a devastating, flattering and strangely faithful mirror."
'Yorgos Lanthimos's Polarizing Visions' [The New York Times]
The writer Alexandra Kleeman digs deep into Lanthimos's mind on the eve of his biggest American success yet, and she finds an artist with a particular method and a particular way of thinking. "Lanthimos detests the word 'deadpan,' which appears in almost every review of his work. 'What does it even mean?' he asked me. 'Anytime people see an emotion that is not extremely emotional, they call it deadpan.' He sounded a bit affronted as he said this. 'Most acting is very melodramatic,' he added. 'It's not what you see in people."'

"'The Favourite" Is a Deliciously Wicked Tale of Sex, Women and Power Plays' [Vox]
Vice
"'Vice" Review: Dick Cheney and the Negative Great Man Theory of History' [The New York Times]
A.O. Scott comments on Adam McKay's harsh but layered portraiture of the former vice president Dick Cheney in his review of the buzz-baiting biopic "Vice." "It will break no news and spoil nobody's fun to note that McKay is not a fan of his protagonist," he reasons. "His argument is essentially that much of what critics of the current president fear most -- the erosion of democratic norms; the manufacture of 'alternative facts'; the rise of an authoritarian executive branch -- already came to pass when George W. Bush was in office."
'Why the Director of "Anchorman" Decided to Take On Dick Cheney' [The New York Times]
In his profile of McKay, the writer Jonah Weiner finds the erudite side of a director who rose to fame on the antics of man-children. He writes: "What is unambiguous, by the end, is McKay's conviction that the American right, in its post-Reagan consolidation of power, has set our country and our planet on a path to ruin -- and that no single figure illustrates this better than Cheney."

Texto completo: The Grand Bohemian Gallery in Biltmore Village welcomes the returns of its Heart & Soul exhibition Feb. 1-2. The annual event features Toronto-based glass jewelry artist Amber Higgins, paired with other artists. This year, Grand Bohemian Galleries debut internationally acclaimed pop artist Britto as part of Heart & Soul.
Brazilian-born Romero Britto will be showing select works in Asheville beginning Feb. 1. The artist's use of vibrant, bold and colorful patterns reflects his optimistic view of the world around him. Catapulted to prominence in Miami when Absolute Vodka used his art on a massive ad campaign also featuring the art of Keith Haring, Andy Warhol and Ed Ruscha in 1989, Britto has continued to create a visual language of hope and happiness all its own that has inspired countless fans.
Self-taught at an early age, Britto painted on scraps of paper or cardboard or any medium he could find before coming into his own and traveling to Paris, where he was introduced to the works of Matisse and Picasso. His appreciation of these masters influenced him to create an iconic style that The New York Times described as exuding "warmth, optimism and love."
Britto's work has been exhibited in galleries and museums in more than 100 countries, including the Salo de la Société Nationale des Beaux Arts exhibition at the Carrousel du Louvre in 2008 and 2010. He has created public art installations for the 02 Dome in Berlin and New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. He worked with Cirque Du Soleil at Super Bowl XLI and has been credited with the largest monumental sculpture in London's Hyde Park.
Britto served as an official artist for the 2010 World Cup and was ambassador to the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil and an honorary torch bearer for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.
Three Birtto originals will be showing at the Grand Bohemian Gallery Asheville, along with new works from glass jewelry artist Higgins.
Higgins will be on hand for the Heart & Soul Exhibition and Trunk Show Reception, which is free and open to the public on two consecutive evenings, from 5-8 p.m. Feb. 1 and 2. To learn more, call 828-398-5555.

Chad 'Ochocinco' Johnson claims he saw FBI arrest his 'neighbor' Roger Stone

Texto completo: CNN reporters apparently weren't the only ones in the neighborhood when the FBI arrived at Roger Stone's Florida home early Friday morning and arrested him on charges of making false statements and witness tampering, among other allegations.
Former New England Patriots wide receiver Chad “Ochocinco" Johnson claimed Friday on Twitter that he saw federal officials take Stone — a longtime associate of President Donald Trump — into custody before his workout.
“FBI arrested my neighbor Roger before my morning jog," Johnson tweeted. “I've only seen [expletive] like that in movies, crazy to start to my Friday."
It's unclear how far away, exactly, Johnson lives from Stone.
According to the New York Times, Stone was taken into custody before dawn at his Fort Lauderdale home Friday, marking the latest indictment as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Johnson, who for a time famously changed his last name to “Ochocinco" while playing in the NFL — so that it matched his jersey number, 85 — shared his insights around 8:30 a.m., a few hours after Stone's arrest was captured by CNN.
Johnson's time in New England was short-lived. He was released by the Patriots in 2012 after one season, 15 catches, and $5.75 million dollars, the Globe reported at the time. He later signed with the Miami Dolphins, but was let go after being arrested on domestic violence charges.
Following Johnson's tweet Friday, which was shared more than 14,000 times, people started making jokes online about how Stone is allegedly his neighbor.
“I'm way more interested in the relationship between @ochocinco and Roger Stone than anything else in this arrest/investigation," one person wrote. “Do they hang out? Are they boys? Does Roger call him Chad or Ochocinco? I need answers!!"

Texto completo: In the hours after the special counsel’s office disputed BuzzFeed’s "the president told me to lie” story about the Russia investigation, journalists reacted in Twitter’s public square and elsewhere.
The New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow tweeted that he declined to run with parts of the narrative based on his source disputing that Donald Trump gave such orders to lawyer Michael Cohen.
On MSNBC, Yahoo News’ Michael Isikoff described the “red flags in the BuzzFeed story from the get-go. ” The New York Times wrote that a person ”familiar with Mr. Cohen’s testimony” said Cohen did not state he was pressured to lie to Congress.
And media reporter Paul Farhi of the Washington Post wrote that BuzzFeed’s “apparently mistaken story . . . is the highest profile misstep yet for a news organization during a period of heightened and intense scrutiny of the press. ”
The final test of the story’s validity must await Robert Mueller’s report. Is the special counsel implying that to his knowledge Trump did not suborn perjury, or is he saying instead that the evidence corroborating that crime is not as BuzzFeed states?
Read more commentary:
BuzzFeed's failed Donald Trump exposé deepened the Trump-media crisis
Trump's not being defamed. If he was, he wouldn't need to change the libel laws.
Trump pursued a deal in Russia and hid it from voters
If it’s the latter, then we are seeing a reprise of a Washington Post story by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in October 1972. The famed Watergate reporting duo wrote that Nixon aide Hugh Sloan’s grand jury testimony had linked Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman to a slush fund.
In fact, Sloan had told this to the prosecutor but was not asked about it before the grand jury. Despite the key point of the story being correct, Bernstein has called the error “a very serious mistake” showing that precision matters.
Cohen report reveals deeper journalism truth
However BuzzFeed’s reporting turns out, we should not miss a deeper truth.
As is being made plain once again, journalism is a self-policing profession. BuzzFeed is being challenged by multiple news organizations that do not view their job as defending the president — or their media brethren.
The episode shows that “the media” are not a monolith, but rather a wide range of outlets, most of which regard accuracy and credibility as core values.
When so many peers care deeply about whether BuzzFeed got it right, it shows how they expect and value accurate reporting. While some people shrug off the lies-of-the-day from our politicians, when journalists make missteps their peers let them know about it, and the rest of us benefit.
Just as their colleagues took to the internet, print and the airways to challenge BuzzFeed, so too did the long knives come out following errors, for example, by ABC in reporting about Trump’s instructions to Michael Flynn, by CNN in reporting on a Russian investment firm and Trump, and by the Associated Press in reporting about former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe when he was a gubernatorial candidate.
Journalism is self-policing band of professionals
With the emergence of fact-checking sites such as the Washington Post’s Fact Checker, we know that Trump has made more than 8,000 false or misleading claims during his presidency. We also know that journalists have a record of admitting mistakes, writing corrections and even reporting on their own organization’s misdeeds.
Someday we will learn how much to castigate or praise BuzzFeed, and perhaps its reporting will become this generation’s H. R. Haldeman story. And perhaps, someday — all of us, regardless of political views — we will recognize that digital and electronic media include institutions and individuals that do not prize untempered truth.
In the meantime, let’s not lose sight of what journalism has created: a self-policing band of professionals who speak up when one of their own falls short of standards of accuracy and thoroughness. Other professions would do well to take note.

Texto completo: The man who thinks Babe Ruth was a zero will be wearing zero for the Yankees.
Adam Ottavino made pinstriped history Thursday before ever taking the field when he was officially granted that number, the first Yankee ever to wear it.
The former Rockies reliever has worn zero in Colorado since 2013, and told the Denver Post that he had been wearing it since high school. The Brooklyn-born Ottavino attended Berkeley Carroll in Park Slope.
"When I was younger, it was like having my name on the back of my jersey (O for Ottavino) when we didn't have our names on the back," Ottavino said back then.
Though no Yankee has ever had zero on the back of his jersey, every other single digit number has been retired, the number eight twice by Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey. Tradition, of course, is dear to the Yankees (think of their rigid hair policies), so it's mildly surprising Ottavino will break precedent this way. But Brian Cashman said in the past that he never had an issue with giving out the number.
"Always liked Al Oliver," he said in 2017, according to the New York Times.
Oliver was the most widely recognizable player to wear zero, and only 14 players have donned it, according to MLB.com. The majority of those 14 only wore it for two seasons or fewer, too. Former Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez wore it in 1996 and 1997, as did utility player Omar Quintanilla, who spent a forgettable season-and-a-half in Flushing.
When Ottavino first chose the number with Colorado, he was expecting to take some heat for it.
"Nobody will want zero," Ottavino said, according to the Denver Post. "I am sure I will get heckled more on the road. I'm not worried about it."

Biden, an undecided warrior on the brink

Texto completo: As he ponders a third presidential run, Joe Biden is wrapping himself in familiar imagery, casting himself as an optimist who likes working with Republicans, an experienced and stabilizing force in a rocky political period.
But the open question, asked even by longtime Biden supporters and advisers, is whether there is a market in 2020 for the Biden brand.
The Democratic Party over the past two years has become increasingly partisan and sharp-edged. It has been fueled by a visceral hatred of Trump. And in its sharp shift, it has turned toward things that Biden, the 76-year-old lifetime pol, most certainly is not: fresh faces, minorities, and women.
His strategy of casting himself as the bridge from one generation to the next, and as the one who can win over pragmatic Democrats as well as disaffected Republicans , would test the limits of Democratic primary voters who have encouraged the most diverse crop of candidates in history.
During a speech on Thursday before the United States Conference of Mayors, the former vice president displayed some of his strengths. He was the man who either knows everyone or makes it seem like he does ("Mayor, how ya doin' man - how things down in Kentucky?" he said at one point, before calling out Boston Mayor Marty Walsh for being Irish and Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown for installing charging stations for electric vehicles).
But his weaknesses were also evident. His opening lines referred to Adlai Stevenson, who died 54 years ago. He seemed at times to not have control over the volume of his own voice, and he meandered so much that at one point, he stopped himself to say, "Now I'm beginning to sound like the wonk I hate." He did not mention Trump by name.
He made light of a New York Times story about how he went to Michigan just before the November election and, during a $200,000 paid speech, praised Rep. Fred Upton in remarks that were used to help the Republican incumbent win a tight reelection campaign.
"I read in the New York Times today that one of my problems is, if I were to run for president, is that I like Republicans," he said. Then he crossed himself, adding, "Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."
"It's like we've divided the country into pieces," he added. "How can we be one America if we continue down this road? I don't care what your party affiliation is."
Biden is one of the few candidates whose decision could shape the field, at least minimally, and alter the calculus of other prospective presidential candidates. But unlike most any other potential presidential aspirant, he has a lengthy legacy to consider that could be greatly impacted by a presidential campaign.
His past campaigns, in 1988 and in 2008, were dismal failures, and there is some concern among allies that some of his flaws as a candidate would emerge againwere he to run, including his propensity for gaffes. ("No one ever doubts that I mean what I say," he said Thursday. "The problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean.")
Biden has done little spadework in the early primary states. If he waits much longer, some advisers worry, he could risk losing potential staffers to other candidates who are much further along.
He has never been a prolific fundraiser and has not developed fresh email lists of supporters as some of the other candidates have.
"He's in one of those deep, dark moments where he's pondering the imponderable," said one close adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preserve their relationship. "Everybody's guessing, other than the fact that they know he's trying to make a decision."
His self-imposed deadlines have slipped, becoming a running joke among those who are following him closely. Biden has told some that he plans to run, but even those people don't fully believe it. He is keeping most of his counsel close to a small group that includes his family and a handful of advisers.
Biden allies and former advisers have been circulating a 441-word document that outlines the rationale for his campaign. It emphasizes his ability to connect with working-class voters, a target audience for a portion of the party that believes the pathway to the presidency will be winning back moderates in the industrial Midwest.
"He has been a warrior for the middle class for his entire life - he speaks directly to working class people, not down to them," the document says.
His allies also emphasize Biden's steady hand.
"At a time when faith in institutions in this country is at an all-time low and every day's headlines bring new crisis and chaos, Americans are looking for a trusted leader - someone who has their backs," the document says. "Someone who provides a sense of unity for a country that is desperate for a sense of stability."
Attempting to answer to the liberal energy in the party, they also point to his stance on gay rights, his climate-change legislation in the Senate, and his support for unions. The talking points do not mention issues such as crime and protections for women, areas where he could be vulnerable in a Democratic primary.
Biden allies concede that other candidates have caught the attention of primary voters. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has gotten off to a quick start, while there is heavy interest in Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is formally launching her campaign this weekend. Former congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas still attracts outsize attention and could harness the same network of Obama activists Biden would tap.
Biden allies point toward the 2004 primary, where voters flirted with several new candidates but ultimately landed on the more workmanlike John F. Kerry.
"I think he's got two things that make him a very appreciable candidate," said New Hampshire state Sen. Lou D'Allesandro (D). "People like him, and people trust him. The question will be, do people want a new face. I can't answer that one because I don't know."

Biden on liking Republicans: ‘Bless me, Father, for I have sinned’

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday veered from his message about fighting climate change to lament a time when Republicans and Democrats could work together.

“I get in trouble,” Biden said at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. “I read in the New York Times today that one of my problems is if I were ever to run for president is I like Republicans. OK, well bless me, Father, for I have sinned,” he said as he made the sign of the cross.

A New York Times report Wednesday said Biden was paid $200,000 from the Economic Club of Southwestern Michigan to address a Republican-leaning audience three weeks before the 2018 elections. In the speech, Biden praised Republican Rep. Fred Upton, in a close race against his Democratic challenger. Biden’s comments were used in Republican advertising and Upton won his race by four-and-a-half percentage points.

On Thursday, Biden asked how lawmakers could get anything done if they’re not reaching across the aisle.

“This is a pretty dysfunctional town,” he said. “It’s like we’ve divided the country into pieces. How can we be one America if we continue down this road? I don’t care what your party affiliation is.”

Biden focused most of his remarks urging mayors to continue fighting climate change and investing in renewable energy, at times raising his voice in frustration over the Trump administration’s rollback of Obama administration policies.

“The administration’s walked away, but there’s no reason we can’t pull us back on the path. There’s unanimity in my party. That vast majority of Republicans agree, and they support the goals as well. They’ve got more of a political problem — I’m not being a wise guy — they’ve got more of a problem with an administration.”

President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, making the U.S. one of only two other countries — Syria and Nicaragua — who have not agreed to the accord. After the withdrawal, dozens of mayors around the U.S. signed their own climate accord vowing to continue to cut the nation’s greenhouse emissions.

“This position cannot be sustained,” Biden told the mayors. “But you are the key to keeping it from sliding back from what it was before.”

BALDWIN ORDERED TO ANGER MANAGEMENT

Texto completo: No doubt there are a number of people who will say "It's about time" to news that famously hot-headed actor Alec Baldwin was ordered to take anger management classes as a result of his altercation in November over a New York City parking spot.
Baldwin, 60, was in a New York City courtroom Wednesday morning where he pleaded guilty to a second-degree violation of harassment, The New York Times and other outlets reported.
In addition to being ordered to take anger management classes, Baldwin also was directed to pay a small fine. Other charges of attempted assault and harassment were dropped, reports said.
The altercation occurred outside Baldwin's East Village apartment on Nov. 2. Page Six reported at the time that someone was holding a parking space open for Baldwin, so that he could load his wife, Hilaria, and their four young children into a car to head to the Hamptons for the weekend.
But then building construction owner Wojciech Cieszkowski swooped in to take it. Following his arrest, Baldwin denied assaulting Cieszkowski, tweeting, "Normally, I would not comment on something as egregiously misstated as today's story. However, the assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false. I wanted to go on the record stating as much."
But the actor has been involved in several high-profile altercations in the streets of Manhattan over the years, and people on Twitter shared images of the incident with Cieszkowski, in which Baldwin appeared to be the aggressor.
In a column, New York Post writer Andrea Peyser asked, "How come Alec Baldwin always gets away with it?" "Alec has been running roughshod over ordinary people for years," Peyser wrote. "But in each case, he is never punished, and his lunatic anger is never halted. He's gotten away with it so long, regular rules of behavior simply do not apply."
Baldwin was previously ordered to attend anger therapy sessions following his 2002 divorce from Kim Basinger. The divorce sparked a bitter custody battle over their daughter, Ireland.

Texto completo: No doubt there are a number of people who will say "It's about time" to news that famously hot-headed actor Alec Baldwin was ordered to take anger management classes as a result of his altercation in November over a New York City parking spot.
Baldwin, 60, was in a New York City courtroom Wednesday morning where he pleaded guilty to a second-degree violation of harassment, The New York Times and other outlets reported.
In addition to being ordered to take anger management classes, Baldwin also was directed to pay a small fine. Other charges of attempted assault and harassment were dropped, reports said.
The altercation occurred outside Baldwin's East Village apartment on Nov. 2. Page Six reported at the time that someone was holding a parking space open for Baldwin, so that he could load his wife, Hilaria, and their four young children into a car to head to the Hamptons for the weekend.
But then building construction owner Wojciech Cieszkowski swooped in to take it. Following his arrest, Baldwin denied assaulting Cieszkowski, tweeting, "Normally, I would not comment on something as egregiously misstated as today's story. However, the assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false. I wanted to go on the record stating as much."
But the actor has been involved in several high-profile altercations in the streets of Manhattan over the years, and people on Twitter shared images of the incident with Cieszkowski, in which Baldwin appeared to be the aggressor.
In a column, New York Post writer Andrea Peyser asked, "How come Alec Baldwin always gets away with it?" "Alec has been running roughshod over ordinary people for years," Peyser wrote. "But in each case, he is never punished, and his lunatic anger is never halted. He's gotten away with it so long, regular rules of behavior simply do not apply."
Baldwin was previously ordered to attend anger therapy sessions following his 2002 divorce from Kim Basinger. The divorce sparked a bitter custody battle over their daughter, Ireland.

Texto completo: California Sen. Kamala Harris promises to "fight for the people" if she's elected president. She hopes to catch fire with Democratic liberals.
The word "fight" was mentioned four times in her brief prepared announcement of candidacy Monday. "The American people need someone who is going to fight for them," she proclaimed.
But her rhetoric doesn't match the record.

Liberals -- or progressives, whatever you want to call them -- may be disappointed if they look closely at Harris' tenure as state attorney general. She wasn't exactly a firebrand crusader for progressive causes when the slogging got tough.
Harris' most striking failure to lead was her refusal to take a stand on two separate ballot measures to repeal California's broken, expensive death penalty that exists in name only.
California hasn't executed anyone since 2006, and only 13 in the last 40 years. As of last month, there were 741 convicted murderers stacked up on San Quentin's death row. The primary cause of death for California's condemned killers is old age.
So whatever anyone believes about the morality of capital punishment, California's system of nonexistent executions is a huge waste of tax money for the special treatment of first-degree murderers.
In 2012 and 2016, there were initiatives on the ballot to repeal capital punishment and move everyone off death row to the general prison population for life without the possibility of parole.
Harris declined to take a position on either. The first proposal failed narrowly by 4 percentage points, the second by 6.4.
In 2016, there was a contrasting initiative sponsored by law enforcement groups to expedite the death penalty. Harris stayed neutral on that proposal, too. It passed by 2.2 points.
Harris had a nice-sounding rationale for remaining on the sidelines: The attorney general has the ministerial duty of writing the official title and summary for ballot propositions.
If she were to take sides on a measure, the argument goes, it could taint her title and summary in voters' minds. Moreover, it might provide grounds for a lawsuit contending that the author of the measure's description was biased.
Nonsense. If the title and summary are biased -- and they increasingly seem to be that way -- they're likely to be challenged in court, regardless of the attorney general's political position. Unfortunately, Harris' successor, Democratic Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, also is remaining neutral on ballot measures. As did Harris' predecessor, Jerry Brown.
But prior to Brown, all the attorneys general took positions on propositions and wrote fairly straight-shooting descriptions of them.
After all, an attorney general is elected by the people to not only be the state's chief law enforcement officer, but to point the way on law enforcement and lead.
A governor -- or president -- doesn't always remain neutral on legislation, claiming he shouldn't show bias because he may eventually have to sign or veto a measure. Sometimes he embraces a bill and fights for it.
Clearly, Harris' motive in not fighting for the death penalty repeal was that she wanted to avoid making political enemies. California voters always have been torn about capital punishment.
But more than that, an attorney general relies on a good relationship with law enforcement. And most police chiefs and sheriffs support the death penalty. Harris was politically ambitious.
Gov. Jerry Brown didn't support the repeal measures either, though a fight to abolish capital punishment was what first got him into politics when his father was governor in 1960.
As lieutenant governor, Gov. Gavin Newsom supported both death penalty repeals.
"It frustrates me no end," Newsom told me in 2015, referring to those politicians who didn't utter a peep. "I get the politics, but...."
Brown, when asked last month why he didn't endorse the ballot measures, told the Sacramento Press Club that "the essence of leadership is knowing when to hold and when to fold, when to move forward and when to stay still."
What the termed-out governor didn't say was that in 2012 his "soak the rich" tax increase was on the ballot, and in 2016, he was pushing a proposition to overhaul criminal sentencing by reducing prison time and allowing earlier parole for inmates who behaved. He calculated that thrusting himself into the death penalty fight might jeopardize those efforts.
Harris talks about the need for criminal justice reform, but she didn't support Brown's sentencing rollback, Proposition 57, which voters approved. She took no stand. Same thing in 2014 with Proposition 47, which reduced several felonies to misdemeanors. It also passed.
Come on! An attorney general should speak up on important law-and-order proposals.
As San Francisco district attorney -- in the most liberal city of the most liberal state in the nation -- Harris implied that abolishing capital punishment was one of her most fervent causes. Running for office, she promised to never seek the death penalty. And she didn't, even when a gang member gunned down a cop. She considered the death penalty unjust and immoral.
Lara Bazelon, a law professor and former director of the Loyola Law School Project for the Innocent, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece last week: "Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state's attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent."
It's not fighting when you stay silent.

Texto completo: The A's list of candidates for their 2019 starting rotation just added a new member.
In need of arms with just a few weeks before spring training, the A's claimed right-hander Parker Bridwell off waivers from the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday. Much like they did with Trevor Cahill and Brett Anderson last year, the A's are taking a flyer on a pitcher coming off a poor season with hopes of capturing some value with a bounce-back year. In Bridwell's case, his 2018 was one to forget as he posted a 17.55 ERA over five games, missing most of the year after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow.
Bridwell, 27, was emerging as a promising fixture in the Angels' rotation after a 2017 season that saw him go 10-3 with a 3.64 ERA over 20 starts.
VETERAN CABRERA SIGNS WITH RANGERS » The Texas Rangers reached a one-year deal with veteran infielder Asdrubal Cabrera. The deal is for $3.5 million, according to the ESPN report. The two-time All Star is expected to play third base, replacing the retired Rangers great Adrian Beltre.
NBA
BULLS EXPECT TO MAKE ANTHONY A FREE AGENT » The Chicago Bulls officially acquired veteran forward Carmelo Anthony. Chicago sent the draft rights of Serbian forward Tadija Dragicevic to the Houston Rockets for Anthony, the draft rights to guard Jon Diebler and cash considerations.
Anthony isn't expected to play for the Bulls. According to a report by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, citing league sources, the Bulls will waive the 10-time All-Star, allowing him to become a free agent if he clears waivers.
NFL
CHIEFS FIRE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR » The Kansas City Chiefs fired defensive coordinator Bob Sutton, two days after the team's loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game.
The Chiefs allowed 524 yards and 36 first downs and was on the field for 94 plays during the 37-31 overtime loss to the Patriots.
LEAGUE INVESTIGATING LASER AIMED AT BRADY » The NFL is "looking into" a report by a Kansas City television station that a laser pointer was aimed at Patriots quarterback Tom Brady during Sunday's game. KMBC shot video that showed a green dot flickering around Brady's shoulder and face. ESPN reported an NFL spokesman confirmed the incident was being investigated.
DALLAS TEAMMATES IN PRO BOWL » Cowboys teammates Dak Prescott and Amari Cooper were named to the NFC Pro Bowl roster, replacing New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and wide receiver Michael Thomas.
COLLEGE BASKETBALL
EX-ARIZONA ASSISTANT PLEADS GUILTY » Former Arizona assistant coach Emanuel "Book" Richardson pleaded guilty in federal court to a federal funds bribery charge, the second coach to do so in the wake of the college basketball recruiting scandal.
In Manhattan federal court, Richardson admitted to taking $20,000 in bribes from Christian Dawkins in efforts to entice a recruit, five-star guard Jahvon Quinerly, to Arizona. He was also accused of efforts to steer Arizona basketball players into signing with Dawkins for representation in exchange for the $20,000 to entice recruits. Under an agreement with federal prosecutors, Richardson faces 18-24 months in prison when he's sentenced on April 24.
SOCCER
USWNT REBOUNDS, BLANKS SPAIN » A stronger U.S. Women's National Team bounced back from a rare defeat to top Spain 1-0 on a goal by Christen Press in the 54th minute of an international friendly at Estadio José Rico Perez in Alicante, Spain. Press, who entered at the start of the second half, scored her 47th international goal for the world's top-ranked team. The U.S. had its 28-match (25-0-3) unbeaten streak end in a 3-1 loss at France on Saturday.
BAY AREA PRODUCTS ON USMNT TRAINING ROSTER » Nick Lima (Cal, San Jose Earthquakes), Corey Baird (Stanford, Real Salt Lake) and Sebastian Lletget (South San Francisco, LA Galaxy) were selected by coach Gregg Berhalter for the final 23-player travel roster that will prepare to face regional foes Panama and Costa Rica in the team's opening matches of 2019.
The USMNT hosts Panama on Jan. 27 in Glendale, Arizona, and closes its annual January Camp with a match against Costa Rica on Feb. 2 at San Jose's Avaya Stadium.
VETERAN GOALIE HOWARD TO RETIRE » Tim Howard, longtime U.S. men's national team star goalie and keeper for the Colorado Rapids, announced on social media that the 2019 season will be his last in Major League Soccer. Howard, who turns 40 in March, is the nation's leader in international appearances (104) and wins (55) among goalkeepers and is second in shutouts (35).
EPL PLAYER SALA FEARED DEAD AFTER PLANE DISAPPEARS » As officials called the chance of finding survivors "slim," the search was suspended Tuesday for a small airplane that disappeared over the English Channel on Monday night and was carrying an Argentine soccer player to Wales to join his new Premier League club.
The French civil aviation authority confirmed that Emiliano Sala, 28, was one of two people aboard the plane en route from Nantes to Cardiff when it disappeared from radar, hours after he had said farewell to his teammates on the Nantes team. Strong winds and rough seas had forced British and French authorities to suspend their search of an area known for shipwrecks and strong currents overnight. "So far over 1,000 square miles have been searched by a total of five aircraft and two lifeboats," police on the island of Guernsey told The Associated Press.

Upward Mobility: Teachers Unions Don't Really Strike for 'the Kids'

Texto completo: When the United Auto Workers walk off the job, no one pretends that they are acting in the interests of car buyers. Everyone knows union members want better wages, benefits, working conditions and job protections, and going on strike is an effective way to exert pressure on employers.
The calculation is no different when teachers strike. Unions like the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers and their thousands of state and local affiliates exist for the same reason as the UAW: to advance the interests of dues-paying members. Yet striking public school teachers and their union representatives insist they are acting on behalf of the children. We're expected to believe that the priorities of education workers are perfectly aligned with those of students.
The Los Angeles teachers strike ended Tuesday after six days, and casual observers could be forgiven for thinking that the walkout was all about the kids. Union picketers carried signs that read, "On Strike for Our Students" and "Fund Our Schools/ Give L.A. Students the schools they deserve." A high-school teacher wrote in the Journal last week that he was striking for the sake of his charges: "As a teacher, my loyalty is to my students. We're fighting this battle for them, and they will be the victors." In a paid advertisement in Sunday's New York Times, AFT President Randi Weingarten used similar language. "Everything teachers are demanding would strengthen public schools," she wrote. The strike is about "ensuring that all public schools have the conditions they need for student success." Yeah, right.
Before the Los Angeles strike began, local officials took steps to keep schools open by hiring substitute instructors and aides. The striking teachers did everything they could to sabotage those efforts, like taking textbooks and supplies home to ensure that they weren't used during the strike. That's an odd way of looking out for the interests of your students.
Ms. Weingarten's reference to "all public schools" is misleading. She really means all public schools that employ union members. Public charter schools, which are mostly nonunionized and growing rapidly in the city, don't count in her estimation. Charters now enroll about 20% of public school students in Los Angeles, up from 12% seven years ago, and curbing the expansion of schools that don't employ their members has long been a major priority of teachers unions. The Los Angeles Times reports that only 42% of the district's students can read at grade level, and math proficiency is an even lower 32%. Families are fleeing union-run schools, so labor leaders are trying to block the exits. Whether students benefit from more school choice is not something that concerns teachers unions. They care whether their members benefit.
Los Angeles teachers were following a path blazed last year by educators who demonstrated in places like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia, Colorado and Washington state. They demanded bigger budgets, higher salaries, smaller class sizes and less standardized testing. Put another way, they want more pay for less work and accountability. Gee, who doesn't?
For teachers, reducing the size of each class means fewer children to mind and assignments to grade. For unions, it means more jobs for dues-paying teachers and ultimately more money in AFT and NEA coffers to spend lobbying politicians and policy makers to keep schools organized in a way that benefits their members first and foremost.
The union has won some concessions on pay and class size, but whether the deal will improve test scores, graduation rates or college readiness is an afterthought for labor leaders. And we have every reason to believe it won't. The U.S. spends more than twice as much on education -- per student and after inflation -- as it did in 1970 and more than three times as much as in 1960. School expenditures in high-poverty districts are typically well above the national average.
Yet standardized test results show little improvement, and large racial gaps persist. We've long known that class size matters much less than teacher quality. Charter schools with larger classes have outperformed traditional public schools with smaller classes. And in countries such as Japan and South Korea, which regularly outperform the U.S. on international tests, average class sizes are larger than here.
Teachers unions are unions first, not reformers or student advocates. Their real agenda -- their only agenda -- is to protect their members by any means possible. No matter what those picket signs said, the unions weren't helping students. They were using them.

Texto completo: A national intelligence strategy released Tuesday warns that growing isolationism and efforts to weaken Western alliances pose long-term threats to U.S. security and are exacerbating challenges for American intelligence agencies.
The 36-page analysis marks the latest sign of discord between the nation's spy services and President Trump. The intelligence community has repeatedly clashed with Trump in the past over the president's pronouncements when they've conflicted with the agencies' conclusions.
The National Intelligence Strategy, which is intended to guide officials for the next four years, does not name Trump or directly criticize his "America first" policies or priorities.

But it warns that U.S. adversaries are seeking to take advantage of "the weakening of the post-WWII international order and dominance of Western democratic ideals, increasingly isolationist tendencies in the West, and shifts in the global economy."
Trump isn't solely responsible for those geopolitical and security shifts, but he has championed at least some of those disruptive trends.
He has clashed with traditional U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, showered praise on autocratic leaders in Russia and North Korea, downgraded human rights as a U.S. concern, and questioned the value of the NATO military alliance and other international institutions and accords.
The new strategy cautioned that Russia is one of several foreign powers poised to take advantage of the international instability.
"Russian efforts to increase its influence and authority are likely to continue and may conflict with U.S. goals and priorities in multiple regions," the strategy said.
Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, in a speech to employees at a sprawling national security office complex in McLean, Va., said U.S. intelligence agencies must remain focused on "seeking the truth."
"And then when we find that truth, speaking the truth," he said.
Trump has publicly doubted or dismissed intelligence officials' findings, most notably their conclusion that Moscow meddled in the 2016 presidential campaign in an effort to boost his candidacy.
He has also persistently sought a closer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite warnings that many of Putin's goals don't align with U.S. interests.
Senior officials at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, emphasized that their agencies were tasked with collecting information, not setting policy.
One official said isolationism and populism were not unique to the Trump administration. Similar movements have taken root in parts of Europe and Latin America in recent years. "It's just the operating environment," the official said.
The officials said intelligence agencies would strive to be more transparent in coming years. They said pulling back the curtain -- if only a little, since much of their work is classified -- will increase the public's faith in agencies that have been buffeted by controversy and political drama.
"It feels like we need to add our voice to a dialogue that's going to happen anyway," one of the officials said.
Some of the dialogue is led by the president and his allies, who have been sharply critical of the intelligence community.
Shortly before taking office, Trump compared U.S. intelligence officials to Nazis and blamed them for the public release of a still-unproven dossier of allegations involving his alleged ties to Russia. The file of raw intelligence was prepared by a former British intelligence officer working on behalf of Hillary Clinton's campaign.
"Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to 'leak' into the public.... Are we living in Nazi Germany?" Trump tweeted at the time.
The relationship did not improve when Trump visited CIA headquarters the day after his inauguration.
Standing in front of the agency's memorial wall, where stars commemorate dozens of officers and operatives who died in the line of duty, Trump bragged about his appearances on the cover of Time magazine and insisted that the media had deliberately undercounted the crowd at his swearing-in.
Although Trump chose Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana, as his director of national intelligence, the two have occasionally seemed out of step.
In July, Trump publicly sided with Putin at a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, when he was asked about U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Kremlin-backed operatives had stolen and leaked Democratic emails and spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign.
"He just said it's not Russia," Trump said. "I will say this, I don't see any reason why it would be."
In an unusual pushback, Coats publicly disputed the president.
"We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security," he said at the time.
Days later, Coats was onstage at a national security gathering in Aspen, Colo., when he learned that the White House had invited Putin to Washington -- a visit that still has not occurred.
"Say that again. Did I hear you?" he said, clearly caught by surprise. "OK. That's going to be special."
Doubts about Coats' relationship with Trump reached the point at which he felt compelled to deny that he or his number two, Sue Gordon, wrote an anonymous op-ed in the New York Times in September that was harshly critical of Trump.
Coats called the speculation "patently false." He added, "From the beginning of our tenure, we have insisted that the entire [intelligence community] remain focused on our mission to provide the president and policymakers with the best intelligence possible."

Texto completo: The fallout continues from that Covington Catholic video, Trump's transgender military ban gets the go-ahead and Tom Brady looks a little . . . green. It’s Ashley Shaffer, your guide to The Short List, bringing you the most interesting news of the day.
But first: Remember the #FijiWaterGirl from the Golden Globes? The infamous photo bomber is still serving water and looks, this time on the set of "The Bold and the Beautiful. "
The fallout from the Covington encounter
The Native American elder seen face-to-face with Covington Catholic High School students in a now-viral video says he's willing to meet with the teens after the footage sparked a national debate over the weekend. Nathan Phillips says the encounter could become a teachable moment on respect for diverse cultures. Longer footage of the encounter emerged Sunday, showing a group of Black Hebrew Israelites harassing the students before Phillips intervened, raising questions about who initiated the Friday dust-up at the Indigenous Peoples March in Washington, D. C. Threats followed to the students and the school itself, prompting classes to be cancelled on Tuesday amid safety concerns.
Trump backed the all-boys school, saying the teens were 'treated unfairly’ in the media.
Nicholas Sandmann, the student grinning inches from Phillips in the video, will be on NBC's "Today" show Wednesday.
A vigil for peace and against racism unfolded at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Covington Tuesday.
Supreme Court OKs Trump's transgender military ban — for now
The Supreme Court will allow President Donald Trump's partial ban on transgender people serving in the military to take effect while court challenges continue. The high court Tuesday cleared away lower court actions that blocked the controversial policy from being implemented for nearly a year. But justices refused to hear the case before the Trump administration fights through federal appeals courts, leaving questions surrounding the action unresolved for now. The Pentagon reiterated Tuesday that the policy is not a complete ban and that transgender troops will continue to be treated with respect and dignity.
Wakanda at the Oscars
Academy Award nominations are out, and they will, they will, rock you. The first superhero movie to really deserve an Oscar nod for best picture got one. (We see you, ‘Black Panther. ’) Among those also fighting for best picture: the Queen biopic "Bohemian Rhapsody" and “A Star is Born. ” Alfonso Cuaron's drama about the life of a Mexican maid, "Roma," landed 10 nominations, along with Yorgos Lanthimos' 18th-century farce "The Favourite. " Just like no movie isn't complete without a little drama, the interwebs are heated over this year’s biggest snubs including Bradley Cooper, "Crazy Rich Asians" and Emily Blunt. The Oscars air Feb. 24.
Day 32: Yes, the government is still partially shut down
The Senate will vote Thursday on bills to fund the government, the first sign of movement in weeks toward ending the longest government shutdown in history.
Real quick
Anne Hathaway is putting the bottle down: She's done with booze for the next 18 years, she said.
Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif. ) announced she'll run for president in 2020.
Did someone target Patriots quarterback Tom Brady with a green laser pointer?
A senator's divorce papers point to 'an extremely painful journey'
Years before her divorce, Sen. Joni Ernst was assaulted by her husband after she confronted him about his relationship with their daughter's babysitter, she wrote in court filings. Ernst, a Republican who represents Iowa in the U. S. Senate, said that during her 26-year marriage with Gail Ernst, she was the victim of verbal and mental abuse and a physical assault. “This has been an extremely painful journey,” she wrote. Their divorce was finalized this month.
Strike over? L. A. teachers reach an agreement
L. A. teachers reached an agreement that could end their six-day teachers' union strike. The tentative deal, announced Tuesday, came after a 21-hour bargaining session between the United Teachers Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Unified School District. The agreement includes higher salaries, lower class sizes and more nurses and counselors at schools, said Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the union. Teachers in the nation's second-largest school district are scheduled to vote on the agreement late Tuesday and could return to work Wednesday.
'I shouldn’t have said tapes'
Whoopsie, Rudy: Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, made headlines for recalling the president said talks about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow were "going on from the day I announced to the day I won," according to The New York Times. "I did not say that," Giuliani told The New Yorker Monday, claiming the Times "made it up. " Except Trump said the same thing a month ago to the New York Daily News. Giuliani also decried a recent Buzzfeed report as false, claiming he has "been through all the tapes. " Wait, what tapes? "I shouldn’t have said tapes," Giuliani told the New Yorker. Oh, Rudy.

Texto completo: Twice a week, Memphis Elementary School second-graders Madison Evans, Lilian Brandi, Peyton Provost and Eden Wonsey walk down to their school library.
They read and check out books, but there's also a 3-D printer, art materials and a lot of other stuff not always found in a traditional library.
On Friday, they worked together to build a platform strong enough to support a book. Using craft sticks, gumdrops, marshmallows and other materials, they developed a design.
"I like to do the crafts," said Brandi, 7. "You can do interesting ones, scary ones, anything you like."
Over the past two years, the school has transformed its traditional library into a media center. It still houses and lends out books, but now incorporates more options for STEM activities.
"When you come and read a book, you can immediately apply your knowledge by making things," said Meran Khon, Memphis Elementary School media specialist. "You learn by trying and failing.
Nearby, Ryan Budnick, Tucker Gascoyne and Hunter Smith worked on the same project as Brandi and her friends. Ryan said he likes the hands-on activities that come with going to the library.
"We get to go on computers, check out books," Ryan said. "Usually I make inventions out of stuff Mrs. Khon has in here.
"I made a little robot."
Tucker also likes to build.
"I like to make LEGO houses with the LEGO table," he said.
Khon won a St. Clair County RESA Classroom 4 the Future grant during the 2016-17 school year, which was used to purchase flexible furniture. That provided the base for the revamped library, which has been added onto through donations and other grants since.
The library also contained a computer lab, which has seen its desktop computers replaced with laptops — which freed up more floor space.
Now the school is showing off the work its done in hopes of winning prizes to keep building. The library has been entered into the Follett Challenge, with the school creating a short video outlining the new library's amenities and educational outlook.
If enough people vote, the school could receive prizes worth $8,000 through the People's Choice category. Video voting begins Monday. There is also one $60,000 prize for the overall winner, which would also receive a celebration featuring New York Times bestselling author Kwame Alexander. Two semi-finalists may win $30,000 worth of prizes.
"We would love to add more up-to-date, relevant literature based on topics and subjects the kids are interested in, along with any relevant technology to help ignite their reading interests and STEM skills," Khon said.
The semifinalists and the People's Choice awards will be announced on Feb. 27. The 2019 Grand-Prize will be announced on April 24.

Larsen: Is this Gregg Popovich’s last season? If it is, we should acknowledge and celebrate the iconic Spurs coach

Texto completo: Gregg Popovich has always been wary of the spotlight.
He’s famously difficult during interviews, of course. Everyone knows about his quick quips that allow him to escape national TV in-game questioning, but he’s the same way at all of his media availabilities. He’s decided those pre-game sessions aren’t allowed to be recorded on video — unlike every other team’s coach. And ask him the wrong question, he’ll decline to answer.
Last year, for example, Jazz TV sideline reporter Kristen Kenney asked Popovich pre-game what he thought about Donovan Mitchell’s rookie campaign, in the heights of nationwide Mitchell Mania.
“I don’t talk about players on other teams but my own,” Popovich said. “I learned that from Jerry Sloan.”
After a quick surprised silence, I followed up with a question of my own: “What else did you learn from Jerry?”
Admittedly, it was a somewhat snarky snapback, but I was legitimately curious. The man has said that, back nearly 25 years ago when the Spurs were rebuilding at Popovich’s direction, the model they used was that of the small-market team from Utah that had found all of that success.
But Popovich just stared at me, saying nothing, creating an awkward silence in the room. Someone else eventually asked another question.
Last week, another reporter at a different game asked Popovich another question he didn’t like: Will you coach the Spurs next season? His response, according to the New York Times: “I don’t know the answer.”
There doesn’t seem to be anyone in the league who knows that Popovich will retire, but there is fear that this is his last year. This is the final year of a five-year contract he signed after the Spurs won a championship in 2014. His wife, Erin, died last April, a tragic loss for the Spurs' community.
And he does have upcoming coaching responsibilities outside of the NBA. He’ll be on the bench, in charge of the USA Basketball team in the summers of 2019 and 2020, the former for the FIBA World Cup, the latter for the Summer Olympics in Japan. There’s a short turnaround after the World Cup before training camp, and the thought is that Popovich might want to spend the 2019-20 season focusing on his USA Basketball duties rather than leading the Spurs. And as Adrian Wojnarowski put it for ESPN, “Few in his orbit expect Popovich to coach the Spurs beyond the 2020 Summer Olympics.”
“He’ll coach as long as he wants to coach,” Spurs president R.C. Buford told the Times.
That’s the thing about Popovich: he’s always been a bit inscrutable. Yes, there’s are the occasional glaring silences with the media. But there are just as many times when he’s hilarious or insightful. When asked about the number of wins he’d accrued in his career, he’s joked, “It’s the most important thing in my life,” Popovich said. “My grandchildren can take a hike. What I might do when I retire, what kind of wine I’m going to drink — all those things pale in comparison when I think about how many wins I have.”
And no other coach has given personal soliloquies on national issues quite like Pop, whether that be Donald Trump, gun control, race, and others.
There’s a demonstrable sense of verve to Popovich, too. He bought an Oregon winery in 2007, and has a personal collection of over 3,000 bottles in his wine cellar. After a playoff series full of “Hack-a-Shaq," he had his players intentionally foul Shaq again in the first seconds of their regular season matchup, just for the laughs.
He’s a man of many layers.
We haven’t even begun to discuss his coaching resume. Popovich passed Sloan for third all-time on the NBA’s win list a week ago, is the holder of three NBA Coach of the Year trophies and a holder of five NBA trophies, next to only one loss in the NBA Finals. Among long-time coaches, only Phil Jackson has a better win percentage, and as much talent as Popovich has had, it pales to many of the teams Jackson had the opportunity to coach.
And this season, he’s doing it again, somehow, someway. The Spurs are in sixth in the very tough West, without their starting point guard, with Bryn Forbes and Derrick White starting most of their games. After losing Kawhi Leonard, the Spurs have adapted and kept playing at a high level. And their offense is still inventive, still fun to watch, even with midrange artists DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge taking most of the shots. He’s incredible.
Whether this is Pop’s last season or not, let’s make sure to take the time to appreciate what he’s done for the sport, what he’s accomplished in his career, and how he’s stayed true to himself throughout as one of the most interesting personalities in the game.
For the best, after the spotlight comes the curtain call.

W&amp;M grad to give talk

Texto completo: There's a telling way to get at the divergent circumstances and privileges accorded people in the past: compare the lives of three children of a single powerful man. A William and Mary grad used this approach in "Jefferson's Daughters: Three Sisters, White and Black, in a Young America" (Ballantine, 2018), and she'll give a talk about her findings Jan. 27 at the Slover Library in Norfolk.
Catherine Kerrison, now a history professor at Villanova, used books, diaries, letters and other historical records to piece together the lives of Thomas Jefferson's three daughters. Two were white and free: Martha and Maria, his daughters with his wife, Martha Wayles Jefferson. One was black and enslaved: Harriet, his daughter with Sally Hemings, his slave and consort. The lives of two barely made a dent in the historical record.
A reviewer for Newsday called the book "a striking portrait of how women in Jefferson's era lived, bravely and resourcefully," and noted that its portrayal of Jefferson himself is "not ... flattering."
Kerrison's talk is the second in a three-part series of the Catherine Lee Brinkley Memorial Lecture Series. Reception and book signing; admittance is free. 4 p.m. 235 E. Plume St., downtown. 757-664-7323.
(The third talk will be Robert D. Putnam, about his 2015 book, "Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis," 5:30 p.m. April 4. The first was Michael Twitty, a culinary historian and food writer who wrote "The Cooking Gene: A Journey Through African American Culinary History in the Old South," 2018.)

*Bob Harshbarger, 71, a part-time resident of Williamsburg, has published "It's Been a Pretty Good Ride," a memoir of success despite polio, through RoseDog Books.
*Remica Bingham-Risher, an ODU staff member and alum, wrote a poem that was published Dec. 9 in The New York Times Magazine. The piece, "We See 'The Lion King' on Broadway, I Enter the Pride," explores children's reactions to her efforts. It was chosen by Rita Dove, who wrote in her introduction, "In the blended family - that alliance of old hurt and new love - heightened vigilance is required; in the search for common ground, the next step could land in quicksand or meadow. ... Read this richly layered poem and enjoy the glow."
*Time to demolish another romantic notion about writing. This from Publishers Weekly: "In what the Authors Guild is calling the 'largest survey of U.S. professional writers ever conducted,' the organization reports the median income published American authors received for all writing-related activity in 2017 was $6,080 in 2017, down from $10,500 in the guild's 2009 survey." Their median income for work specifically related to books fell 21 percent, to $3,100, in 2017 from $3,900 in 2013. It fell about 50 percent from the 2009 median book earnings of $6,250. The guild conducted the survey with 14 other groups; it includes data from more than 5,000 published book authors.
*The Armed Services Arts Partnership is setting up its six-week class in nonfiction storytelling, for veterans, active-duty military, members of military families, and caregivers.

*Indie booksellers were peeved to find that Dav Pilkey's latest Dog Man book, "Brawl of the Wild," was available at a BJ's Wholesale Club store in Framingham, Mass., on Dec. 23 - a day before the official release date. The Book Oasis posted a photo on social media. Other booksellers reacted, says Publishers Weekly; they "said it confirmed their widely held suspicion that large retailers violate strict-on-sale dates because publishers do not hold them to the same standards for breaking the terms of their sales contracts." Scholastic defended its efforts.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo seemingly rescued New York City from the L train shutdown on Jan. 3 by offering a last-minute solution. But two weeks later, no one knows what exactly is going to happen to the subway line.
Critics have pilloried the new repair plan over safety concerns. It is not clear how long the solution would last or when construction would begin. It might still need approval from federal and local officials.
Even one basic question has not been resolved: Is the shutdown really off?
The city's transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, asked subway officials on Tuesday what would happen if the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board votes no on changes to the L train contract.
"What would that mean -- that the L train shutdown isn't averted?" Ms. Trottenberg said at a special meeting of the board, which oversees the subway.
"You vote whichever way you like," the authority's acting chairman, Fernando Ferrer, responded.
The old plan -- calling for a 15-month shutdown of the L train tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn -- was widely loathed. But at least there was some certainty. For the 250,000 riders who rely on the tunnel every day, there had already been months of preparing for life without the line. Now they are facing transportation purgatory.
The new plan calls for making critical repairs on nights and weekends, when workers would close one tube at a time and trains would run about every about 20 minutes. It has raised a flurry of questions and created uncertainty over what riders can expect in the coming months. The shutdown was scheduled to begin on April 27. With many details left to sort out, it seems unlikely that Mr. Cuomo's plan would start by then.
A new wrinkle emerged on Thursday night: an M.T.A. official said transit leaders believe the board would not need to approve a revised contract for the L train work unless the total cost of the project increased. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
The upheaval has cast the transit agency in a negative light, prompting doubts about the competence and independence of the sprawling state-run agency, which is trying to pull the subway out of crisis. Mr. Cuomo appears to exert near-total control over the agency, and some doubt whether his latest deus ex machina was in fact the right move.
The authority's leaders support Mr. Cuomo's plan and say they are moving forward with it. The agency released a statement on Thursday night reiterating that a full shutdown "will not be necessary" but failing to address whether the board could vote down the new approach. It will take several weeks to decide on a "final construction schedule" for the partial shutdown, the statement said. "As soon as we have more definitive information, we will provide it to our customers and the public," the statement said.
Lawrence S. Schwartz, a board member and ally of Mr. Cuomo, said he was confident the agency would have clearer answers soon. He praised the new approach for alleviating pain for L train riders.
"Between now and April 27, all of the questions regarding health and safety issues, which are obviously relevant to both workers and the public, will be answered," he said at the meeting.
Still, elected leaders sent Mr. Cuomo a letter this week asking for an independent analysis of his plan. At the board meeting, Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, seemed exasperated over the many unanswered questions.
"This is better than 'Law & Order,' which we all watch on a daily basis, in terms of intrigue," she said.
The L train tunnel, which was inundated by floodwaters during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, needs major repairs. Experts have raised concerns about the presence of silica dust, a hazardous mineral that is released when concrete is demolished and can cause lung cancer. They are also concerned that if construction is confined to weekends, it would be difficult to restore train service by the Monday morning rush.
"Riders want to know if the tunnel is closing, but they also want to know if the tunnel stays open, will it be safe and will service start again reliably every morning?" said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.
The announcement of the L train shutdown in 2016 hurt real estate prices in Williamsburg, a popular Brooklyn neighborhood that depends on the line. Now landlords and residents are waiting to see what happens next.
"If the shutdown is truly off, there will be landlords who are anxious to make up for deals they cut in 2018 and 2017," said Grant Long, a senior economist for StreetEasy, a real estate listings website.
Renters saved nearly $27 million in North Brooklyn because of lower prices leading up to the shutdown, according to an analysis by Mr. Long. If Mr. Cuomo's plan does not move forward and the shutdown is back on, the neighborhood might be even less attractive because of the negative publicity and the "whiplash of emotions" over the line, he said.
"It could make things even worse than they were before," Mr. Long said.
Subway leaders say their goal is to begin work in late April. The board, which usually goes along with recommendations from M.T.A. leadership, plans to hire an independent consultant to review the safety of the new plan. Officials at the Federal Transit Administration are also expected to weigh in, but the agency has been affected by the partial shutdown of the federal government.
Mr. Ferrer, at a news conference on Jan. 3, said construction for the new plan could take 15 to 20 months. Veronique Hakim, the agency's managing director, was less certain -- she said on Tuesday that her staff was working to confirm that timetable.
The new approach would hang the tunnel's cables from the wall, instead of encasing them in a structure known as a bench wall. Workers would secure parts of the bench wall with a substance known as fiber reinforced polymer that could last 40 years. If the bench walls were rebuilt, as the original plan called for, they could last more than 80 years.
The M.T.A. examined a similar idea for the L train in 2014 -- to hang cables from the tunnel wall -- but officials decided against it because of safety concerns. Engineers feared that bolting cables to the wall could damage the tunnel lining or cause leaks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.
Subway leaders say the new approach is different because it relies on racks, instead of affixing cables directly to the tunnel wall, which would result in a 60 percent reduction in the number of bolts needed to hang the cables.
A spokeswoman for the governor, Dani Lever, said on Thursday that Mr. Cuomo did not know that the transit agency had previously considered hanging cables on the wall as part of the L train project. But she insisted that the new plan was different and better than the previous proposal.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has taken a firm hand over the authority, including setting priorities in its capital plan and pushing officials to open a new subway line in Manhattan, the Second Avenue subway, on time. Even so, he has argued in recent days that he needs more control over the agency.
Ms. Lever said the governor names only six members to the board and other elected officials can veto capital projects. "If that is control," she said, "Nancy Pelosi is president."
But Mr. Raskin, of the Riders Alliance, said Mr. Cuomo already had great sway over the system.
"The governor's L train maneuver," Mr. Raskin said, "has one clear political ramification -- to make clear the governor's already in charge of the M.T.A."

Pete Hamill is worrying about his deadline.
"I have so little time, and I've got to finish this goddamn book," he says, wearing sweats and sunken into a sofa in his cluttered apartment. He has moved back to Brooklyn now, in Prospect Heights, about 23 blocks from the tenement where he grew up. His book is about what he calls "the circle home back to the old country."
It is a memoir of sorts and not his first among the 20 volumes he's published, from novels about New York City to the extended essay "Why Sinatra Matters," a biography of Diego Rivera and "A Drinking Life," an account of the years before he stopped drinking on New Year's Day 1973. This plus innumerable columns for the New York Daily News and the New York Post, both tabloid papers where he also served as editor.
He is 83 years old, his walker close by, his wife, journalist Fukiko Aoki, sitting near. Among the things making a claim on his time is a new HBO documentary, coming out on Jan. 28, called "Breslin and Hamill: Deadline Artists," about a now-gone generation embodied by him and Jimmy Breslin, who died in 2017 at age 88. Mr. Hamill will have to miss the official premiere of the film, which is scheduled on one of the three days each week he goes to Methodist Hospital for dialysis treatments, which make him feel "slightly punch-drunk." It's the same hospital he was born in.
And there's the damn book, from a guy who used to write three columns a week, columns built on shoe-leather street reporting, not just bloviating. "There's only a certain number of hours I can put in. It's hard to explain because I feel fully alive, but sometimes I have problems because there are things I must deal with." He is matter-of-fact about his health. "Right now I have to wear a butt pad, cause I no longer have a butt," he says, leaning forward. "But the reason for that is, I worked my ass off!"
When he isn't writing or seeing doctors, he's still a news junkie, reading the New York Times, the Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Daily News ("a shell of its former self") and the New York Post, which first hired him as a newspaperman after he had worked in the shipyards, served in the Navy and lived in Mexico trying to be an artist. Like many of a certain age, he and Ms. Aoki watch the CBS News at 6:30 p.m. more than cable news. He reads online but stays away from social media. "I don't have time" he says. "If it was edible or something I might try it." He says Fox News upsets his stomach.
Hamill and Breslin, despite their blue-collar cred, were both unreconstructed liberals. And they were stars, especially the irascible and larger-than-life Breslin. Mr. Hamill was more diplomatic, moving easily between Park Avenue and Canarsie. He dated Jackie Kennedy and Linda Ronstadt and had a long-running relationship with Shirley MacLaine. He was friends with Robert Kennedy: Both he and Breslin were at RFK's side when he was killed. Mr. Hamill says he now regrets his friendship with Bobby, not as a personal matter but because it was a "professional mistake" to grow close to a politician.

Mr. Hamill knows the documentary will evoke nostalgia for a vanishing era of newsgathering, and he's alternately sad and accepting about it. PHOTO: Mackenzie Stroh for The Wall Street Journal
He has a lifetime of stories filled with big names. He recalls being at a studio watching a recording session of Bob Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks," for which Mr. Hamill wrote the album notes (and later won a Grammy). Mick Jagger was there, too, and after one song took Dylan aside and whispered something in his ear. "What did he tell you?" Mr. Hamill asked after the Rolling Stone had left. "The lyrics are great, but the music sucks," said Dylan, who later re-recorded the track. Mr. Hamill tells this story in appreciation of the many editors who candidly set him straight.
Mr. Hamill says he likes the new documentary but wishes there had been more mention of Ms. Aoki's role in his life for more than 30 years and more about his books. He takes his literary writing seriously because he left high school after two years and is largely self-educated, his only degrees honorary. He credits a lifelong appetite for voracious reading. Mr. Breslin also wrote books, including fiction. Both he and Mr. Breslin "in the novels were doing what former journalists like Ernest Hemingway, Stephen Crane and Mark Twain had all done. They knew they had certain stories that they couldn't verify but were great stories, and true. That's one of the reasons that compelled me to give up drinking, was that I wanted to find out about how large my talent was."
In a 1971 collection of Mr. Hamill's articles called "Irrational Ravings" (as Spiro Agnew dubbed his writings at the time), he included a piece for New York magazine, "The Revolt of the White Lower Middle Class." It was about hard-hat construction workers with flag decals as the Vietnam War raged, hippies abounded and the country was angrily divided by race and class. Asked the obvious question about today, he says he understands the resentment. "I come from the white working class, but I was fortunate," he says. "I had parents that thought things would be better tomorrow or the day after tomorrow and the way out of poverty was through the library. My mother got me a library card when I was five. I couldn't read yet, and there were mothers like that all over New York."
Mr. Hamill knows the documentary will evoke nostalgia for a vanishing era of newsgathering, and he's alternately sad and accepting about it. The journalism students he's worked with at New York University give him hope. "It's not always about the money. It's doing what you could do with the world without adding to its lousiness," he explains.
His first great editor, Paul Sann, told him: If you want it to be true, it probably isn't. "I want it to be true," he says, "that long after I'm gone there's some kid in a room who would read something I wrote and say, 'I could do that, and I could do it better.' I hope this will be as free a country as I've lived in 30 or 40 years from now, and that youngsters who are not yet born will get some innocent man out of jail, and put some crook in...." He stops, chokes up, then recovers. "Sorry," he says. Then he's fine.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has certainly surrounded himself with plenty of incompetent and ethically challenged people. But in William Barr, he has nominated someone with a track record of integrity and experience to be the next attorney general.
Such a person is badly needed at the Justice Department. Not only has Trump repeatedly debased law enforcement, his actions also have left many Americans thinking the unthinkable — that the president not only benefited from Russia's interference in the 2016 election but also is somehow beholden to its government. No less than the FBI has entertained this thought. The New York Times reported that the FBI started a counterintelligence inquiry in 2017 into whether Trump was — gulp! — acting as an agent of the Russian government.
The outcome of that inquiry is unknown, and Trump denied that he ever worked on Russia's behalf. But he has given Americans plenty of reason for suspicion, including his odd obsequiousness toward Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, his confiscation of notes and records from his meetings with Putin, his real estate dealings with Russians, and his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, leaving a vacuum for Russia and others to fill.
It is into this troubling context that Barr now drops as Trump's pick to become the nation's top law enforcement official and overseer of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia inquiry. This would be Barr's second stint as attorney general, a position he ably held during the administration of President George H.W. Bush. At the very least, Barr would represent a huge upgrade over acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who is wholly ill-suited for the job.
Barr states in prepared testimony for his Senate confirmation hearing that Mueller should be given a chance to finish his report, and that the report should be made public. This is a good start but is not sufficient. Mueller might plan further legal actions such as subpoenas, indictments and plea agreements. Barr needs to pledge that he would not interfere with those. He also needs to make abundantly clear that he would not fire Mueller.
Beyond these things, Barr needs to explain recent statements and writings defending the firing of former FBI Director James Comey and criticizing Mueller on the grounds that members of the special counsel's team made political contributions to Hillary Clinton.
While some Democrats have urged that his nomination be withdrawn, this is too extreme. Barr has done nothing to disqualify himself and deserves a chance to make his case.
An attorney general can be hired and fired by the president, but ultimately he or she serves the Constitution and the rule of law.

Texto completo: It was a question that jumped out at me as I read the itinerary for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's trip to Iowa in October 2014.
Why on earth would Christie, who was laying the groundwork for a 2016 presidential campaign as an establishment candidate, headline a fundraiser for Republican Rep. Steve King, an unapologetic extremist who had a knack of grabbing national headlines with his incendiary taunts of minority groups?
It didn't seem like the company that a careful political operative like Christie would keep. After all, Christie's disciplined courtship of Hispanic voters a year earlier contributed to his reelection landslide.
It was a question that gnawed at me enough to take a 41/2-hour ride from Des Moines with another New Jersey reporter to the rural Hole in the Wall hunting lodge in the northwestern corner of the state near the South Dakota border.
As the two politicians stepped onto the porch, I asked Christie if he was concerned that all his hard work cultivating Hispanic support back home might be jeopardized by his supporting King. A year earlier, King made headlines with his demeaning depiction of Mexican teens who developed "calves the size of cantaloupes" from hauling heavy loads of marijuana into the country.
King, dressed in boots and camouflage hunting gear, sharply interrupted my questioning by asking me if I had proof or a tape of his comments. I didn't have them with me, but they had been widely reported. King's tactic succeeded in putting me momentarily on my heels. Christie, meanwhile, refused to put any distance between himself and King.
"No, he's a friend. I don't back away from that for an inch, nor should I, nor has he given me any reason to," Christie replied. "I will be a supporter of Steve King for as long as he continues to be in public life."
Christie apparently had a dramatic change of heart Wednesday, joining a growing national chorus of condemnation over King's most recent inflammatory remarks in The New York Times, in which he said: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
The House overwhelmingly passed a resolution Tuesday condemning King's remarks, a symbolic but rare reprimand. House Republicans also stripped him of his committee assignments, which will leave him little room to wield power in Congress.
Republicans from across the ideological divide — ranging from moderates like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney to New Jersey's conservative state Sen. Joe Pennacchio, R-Morris — have condemned King's remarks this past week. The drumbeat calling on King to resign has intensified, but Christie didn't go that far.
The public outrage from Christie and the rest of the GOP is hypocrisy. King's white nationalist tendencies and race-baiting remarks had been well-documented long before that New York Times interview and certainly known to Christie that day at the hunting lodge.
The GOP was willing to look the other way as long as King was useful. Christie was not the only Republican contender who sought his blessing in the 2016 Iowa caucus. Even Iowa's U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley described him as an "ally" during his reelection race last year.
So why the sudden about-face?
For one thing, the shellacking that Republicans endured in the 2018 midterms has stirred panic in the GOP ranks. Women and moderates in vote-rich suburbs abandoned the party in droves, revolted by President Donald Trump's embrace of white nationalism and harsh, anti-immigrant rhetoric. Even King, who had racked up hefty victory margins since entering Congress in 2003, squeaked by with a 3-point victory over his Democratic challenger last year.
Republicans fear that Trump's brand will permanently become the party's brand. Yet many are in a bind: While they know Trump is the problem, few are willing to publicly confront him. They fear that Trump will retaliate in a nasty Twitter storm, and set his hard-core loyalists against them in a primary.
As a result, King serves as a convenient stand-in, somebody for worried Republicans to criticize without fear of antagonizing Trump — who, by the way, has refused to defend King even though King's early advocacy of a wall on the southern border with Mexico served as an inspiration to Trump.
"This has nothing to do with Steven King," said Larry Sabato, the University of Virginia political scientist, referring to the GOP outrage. "They are using King as a vehicle to send a message to Donald Trump."
Christie's relationship with King was fueled by political expediency and loyalty.
The alliance with King began in June 2009, when Christie, a candidate for governor, came under scrutiny for awarding lucrative contracts to private lawyers to oversee court settlements during his seven-year stint as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey.
Some of the work had gone to politically connected allies, including a deal worth as much as $52 million to former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, Christie's onetime boss at the Justice Department. A House committee investigating these so-called monitor contracts summoned Christie to testify.
King ran interference for Christie when the hearing got testy. He took aim at U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Tennessee who was grilling Christie. "Mr. Christie is part of the future leadership in this country, and hopefully this [hearing] will enhance his ability to contribute to American society," King said at one point.
That day on the porch in 2014, Christie repaid the favor, minimizing remarks and describing King as someone like himself, who sometimes gets in trouble for saying controversial things.
"I'm sure there are things I've said over time that Steve hasn't agreed with, and there's things that he's said that I may not agree with the way he said, or the way I said it," Christie said. "One of the things Steve and I share is an absolute commitment to speaking our mind."
Christie is no longer running for public office, but it's clear that he wants to maintain a role as a well-compensated party elder, dispensing wisdom on cable TV and in speeches before Republican audiences. So, perhaps, it was time for him discard his relationship with King.
Christie did not return a call seeking comment. He does have a tell-all book coming out this month. It will be interesting to see if he devotes any discussion to his relationship with his outspoken — and now former — friend from Iowa.

Mayoral Aide Quit
After Accusations
A former aide to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio resigned from his role last year after he was accused of sexual harassment, then moved quickly to a public-relations firm with ties to the mayor, the city said.
Kevin O'Brien was hired as a deputy chief of staff to the mayor in January 2016 and was later promoted to a role as senior adviser.
Two people made sexual-harassment complaints against him in February 2018, according to a city Law Department document obtained through a Freedom of Information Law request.
An investigation by the Law Department substantiated the accusers' accounts, the document says.
Mr. O'Brien, 36 years old, said in a statement Thursday that he drank too much at an after-work event and acted inappropriately.
"There's no excuse for what I've done -- I'm embarrassed and ashamed," he said.
The mayor's office revealed the circumstances surrounding Mr. O'Brien's departure Thursday after they were reported by the New York Times.

BLACK LIVES MATTER
Emails Show NYPD
Surveilled Protesters
The New York Police Department gained information from undercover sources embedded in the Black Lives Matter protests that swept through the city in 2015, according to nearly 700 NYPD emails made public Thursday.
The 697 emails, which were obtained by M.J. Williams Law firm through a public-records request, show officers talking about gaining intelligence from sources in the demonstrations and tracking the routes of protesters. The messages also show that the NYPD retained photographs and social-media information of demonstrations. Some officers sent emails in which they referred to the protesters as "idiots" and "ninjas."
The release of the emails was first reported by the website The Appeal.
Commissioner James O'Neill said Thursday on WNYC the NYPD didn't violate the constitution while patrolling the protests.

NEW JERSEY
Deal Would Raise
Minimum Wage
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Democratic legislative leaders reached an agreement Thursday on legislation that would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
The proposal, which is expected to pass the Legislature, would increase the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 for most workers. Seasonal workers and small-business employees would reach $15 in 2026. Farmworkers would earn at least $12.50 an hour by 2024 and have the possibility of having it raised to $15 by 2027.
"We are taking a historic step to provide more than one million New Jersey workers a stronger foothold in the middle class," Mr. Murphy said. He said it was good for businesses and the economy.
The governor, Senate President Steve Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, all Democrats, reached the deal after months of negotiation.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A global New York-based law firm has agreed to pay $4.6 million to settle a Justice Department investigation into whether its work for a Russia-aligned Ukrainian government violated lobbying laws.
The investigation stems from work that the firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, did with Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman. The case overlaps with the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
As part of the settlement, the law firm agreed to register retroactively as a foreign agent for Ukraine in addition to paying the government $4.6 million, representing the money it earned from its work in Ukraine.
The settlement between the firm and the Justice Department, which was made public on Thursday, is the latest indication that Mr. Mueller's inquiry and related investigations are fundamentally challenging the lucrative but shadowy foreign-lobbying industry that has thrived in Washington.
For decades, lobbyists and lawyers have collected millions of dollars to burnish the images of sometimes unsavory foreign interests in Congress and the news media, often skirting requirements that they disclose the work under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
The Justice Department, which is charged with enforcing the 80-year-old act, had largely turned a blind eye until Mr. Mueller began charging Mr. Trump's associates, including Mr. Manafort, who had built a lucrative business advising Russia-aligned politicians and wealthy business executives in Ukraine.
In this case, Mr. Manafort had arranged for a team of lawyers from Skadden Arps to conduct an analysis in 2012 that he intended to use to allay international concerns about the anti-democratic practices of the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine.
Mr. Yanukovych, a major client of Mr. Manafort and an ally of the Kremlin, had been accused of political motives in the prosecuting and jailing of one of his leading political rivals, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, on charges of abusing her position as prime minister in negotiating a natural gas deal with Russia.
Skadden Arps was hired to conduct a purportedly independent analysis of her prosecution and trial, and to advise the Yanukovych government on a potential future prosecution. The firm was paid more than $4.6 million, partly through the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice and partly through offshore accounts controlled by Mr. Manafort.
A Skadden Arps team led by Gregory B. Craig, a former White House counsel for President Barack Obama, produced a report concluding that, while the trial violated some of Ms. Tymoshenko's rights, her conviction was supported by the evidence presented at trial. And the report found no evidence that the prosecution was politically motivated.
Mr. Craig, who maintained deep connections to Washington's Democratic establishment and its press corps, worked to shape the public relations strategy for the release of the report, according to a Justice Department filing released with the settlement.
The filing, which identifies Mr. Craig as "Partner 1" but does not name him, indicates that he arranged for a journalist to receive a copy of the report, then discussed the report with that journalist. The journalist, who is not named in the filing, is David E. Sanger of The New York Times, which published an article in December 2012 about the report quoting Mr. Craig.
Mr. Craig and Skadden Arps should have disclosed that activity under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, known as FARA, which covers both lobbying and public relations on behalf of foreign political interests, the Justice Department said. But Mr. Craig misled both his colleagues at Skadden Arps and officials in the Justice Department's FARA unit about his interactions with the news media, leading the Justice Department to conclude that the firm was not obligated to register under the act, the settlement filing said.
The settlement "puts law firms on notice that they can't hide behind their identity as lawyers. If they are doing lobbying work on behalf of foreign countries, they need to register under FARA," said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics. "It also shows that the government will not tolerate false statements by lawyers."
Skadden Arps said in a statement that it had "learned much from this incident" and was "taking steps to prevent anything similar from happening again."
Mr. Craig's lawyer declined to comment.
The investigation that led to the settlement with Skadden Arps was handled by the Justice Department's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, which includes the FARA unit. But federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, to which Mr. Mueller's team referred illegal lobbying cases, asked witnesses about Mr. Craig's involvement in Mr. Manafort's work as recently as last month, according to people familiar with the case.
Among the lobbying being investigated by the New York prosecutors is the involvement of two other firms that worked on the rollout of the Tymoshenko report. One is Mercury Public Affairs, whose lead partner on the account was Vin Weber, a former Republican member of Congress. The other is the Podesta Group, led by Tony Podesta, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser whose business collapsed in 2017 under the glare of Mr. Mueller's scrutiny and attacks from the right.
The firms initially did not register their work under FARA either, though they registered retroactively as investigators began examining their work.
Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury, pointed out that his firm based its initial decision to forgo FARA filing on advice from Skadden Arps, and he said "we were surprised to learn about their separate communications with the FARA unit and the facts surrounding those discussions."
In the settlement agreement, the Justice Department specifies that it has not made any "promise or representation" about "any civil or criminal liability" related to the unregistered lobbying by Skadden Arps's "current or former partners, agents, employees, attorneys" or people who worked with them.
Mr. Craig left Skadden Arps last year as the investigation of his work with Mr. Manafort escalated.
The 70-year-old firm has been roiled by the scrutiny from its dealings with Mr. Manafort, whose daughter went to work as an associate at Skadden Arps around the time the Tymoshenko report was released.
In 2017, as the Justice Department continued investigating the Ukraine work, Skadden Arps refunded $567,000 to the Ukrainian government, suggesting in a statement that it returned the cash because the money had been placed "in escrow for future work" that never took place.
A lawyer who worked on the report for Skadden, Alex van der Zwaan, pleaded guilty last year to lying to the special counsel about his communications with one of Mr. Manafort's associates.
And renewed scrutiny on the report, which an Obama State Department official panned as "incomplete" the day after its release and was subsequently called a "whitewash" by experts, has led to criticism of the firm's willingness to rent its reputation to unsavory clients.
In an interview last month, Ms. Tymoshenko, who is a leading candidate for the Ukrainian presidency, accused Skadden Arps of carrying water for the Yanukovych government.
"It's a pity that such a well-known company like Skadden even considered to take this case to deliver," she said. "This is a dirty, dirty, dirty contract."

Jack Bogle: A painful thorn in Boston's side

Texto completo: Jack Bogle was an investment industry legend. In Boston, he was also a legendary pain in the butt.
Bogle, who died Wednesday at the age of 89, founded Vanguard Group in 1975and proceeded — slowly at first, then like a juggernaut in the past two decades — to undermine the very premise upon which much of Boston's fund industry was built: that professional stock-pickers are worth the fees they charge investors for managing their money in mutual funds.
At Vanguard, which is headquartered in a small town about 30 miles west of Philadelphia, Bogle created the first fund tied to a stock index for individual investors. Opened in 1976, the Vanguard Index Trust (now the Vanguard 500 Index Fund) was designed to match as closely as possible the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 index, a benchmark for the biggest US stocks.
The goal was simple but anathema to most of the investment world: Instead of paying fat fees to high-priced managers to research and select stocks, Vanguard customers were offered low-cost funds that mirror various baskets for stocks (and later bonds).
“He gave the industry a new way of thinking that was considered complete heresy at the time," said John Casey, former chairman of Casey Quirk, a management consulting firm that caters to the asset management industry. Most people at fund companies “were dismissive of anything that didn't particularly add value. But he was focused on building a business that had never been built before," he said.
There would be no picking of winners and losers at Vanguard. The investor in its passively managed funds would ride the market up (mainly) and down (sometimes precipitously). And there would be no star managers like Peter Lynch at Fidelity Investments or Bill Miller at Legg Mason to attract investors. But that was fine by Bogle because he believed that no matter how smart, no manager could beat the market consistently over a long period of time.
“My ideas are very simple," he told The New York Times in 2012. “In investing, you get what you don't pay for. Costs matter. So intelligent investors will use low-cost index funds to build a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, and they will stay the course. And they won't be foolish enough to think that they can consistently outsmart the market."
Active fund managers in Boston and the rest of the industry scoffed at Vanguard as it rolled out index fund after index fund and (now numbering 190 in the United States and another 220 overseas). In part, they sincerely believed that they could deliver better results than following the market. But they also recognized that Bogle's relentless focus on lowering the costs of running funds — which allowed him to charge smaller fees — had enormous implications for the profits active management made possible.
Vanguard got off to a slow start, with mostly sophisticated investors buying into the power of lower fees to bolster returns. But over time, mainstream investors warmed to the idea of index funds and their close cousins, index-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially after the bear markets of 2000-2002 and 2008-2009, when many active managers lost more than market averages.
While some managers were charging asset management fees of 2 percent or more even when they lagged their benchmarks, Vanguard was cutting its fees, taking them down by almost two-thirds over the past two decades to an average of 0.11 percent.
That triggered a price war that has eaten into profits at active and passive fund managers alike. Boston-based Fidelity eventually got into index funds and ETFs, after holding out a long time under then-chairman Ned Johnson, and is seeing good inflows. In August the company even launched two no-fee funds.
But Vanguard's unique structure gives it an edge on fees: It is owned by its fund investors (much like policy holders own mutual insurance companies), not private shareholders.
“Jack was always a tough competitor of ours and kept us on our toes, and for that I am grateful," Abby Johnson, chairman of Fidelity, said in a statement to the Globe, echoing a view shared by other local firms.
“While his focus on index investing helped build significant adoption of passively managed strategies in the industry, I believe his views challenged active managers to be better at what they do," Andy Arnott, CEO of John Hancock Investments, said in a statement. “He will have a lasting impact on the way investors build portfolios for years to come."
Competition was good for Vanguard, too. It is the second-largest fund manager in the world, with about $5 trillion under management. Fidelity has about $2.7 trillion, while New York-based BlackRock, a big proponent of indexing, tops the list with $6.3 trillion.
There are still more assets in actively run funds in ($10.4 trillion) than in passive funds ($6.58 trillion), according to US data from industry tracker Morningstar. But the momentum is clearly with indexers: Last year, passive funds brought in a net $458 billion compared with net outflows of $303.4 billion at active funds.
Nevertheless, some fund companies remain true believers in the merits of active investing. Putnam Investments in Boston is one of them.
“For active managers to justify their being, they have to add a premium to the benchmark," said Bob Reynolds, Putnam's chief executive, who notes that the percentage of active managers outperforming their benchmarks has increased to 45 percent last year. “That's still not high enough. . . . but I think you are starting to see a change there. It's very cyclical."
Reynolds, who was vice chairman at Fidelity before jumping to Putnam, says his firm — which only sells active funds — had net inflows last year.
Still, he has nothing but the highest respect for Bogle.
“He's on Mount Rushmore," he said. “And I'd add Ned Johnson right there next to him or ahead of him for all the innovations he brought to the market. They are the fathers of the fund industry."
Yes, Boston was once king of the fund game. Now we have to share the crown.

Texto completo: The fox has taken charge of the hen house, and things will not be business as usual. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has said as much.

Waters outlined her agenda as the new chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, blaming Wall Street for its greed and warning that it won’t go unpunished.

“The crisis was a result of Wall Street running amok,” Waters said at a speech hosted by the Center for American Progress Action Fund. “Large Wall Street banks are not subject to anybody and do great damage to our economy.”

Waters is one to talk. Just like the banks, she knows a bit about dodging oversight. As financial institutions were collapsing one by one in 2008, Waters was making money moves. The California Democrat helped arrange a meeting between the Treasury Department and top executives at a Massachusetts bank called OneUnited. What was so special about this one little lending institution? Her husband was a shareholder.

Using her post on the House Financial Committee, the one she now leads, Waters leveraged a call with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson personally, asking him to meet with minority-owned banks.

Treasury followed up, but only one bank bothered to show: OneUnited. This didn’t go unnoticed by ethics officials or by the New York Times. That paper would later report that Waters and her husband would have lost as much as $350,000 personally if the bank had folded. It didn’t. The Federal Reserve came through and OneUnited received $12 million in bailout funds.

The House Ethics Committee launched an investigation because that kind of money can’t just go missing without some sort of consequence. Waters insisted she was just looking out for minority-owned banks. Never mind that it was just one minority-owned bank in particular that benefited: the one she had a stake in.

The Ethics Committee ended up slapping Waters on the wrist for the unrelated offense of making her own grandson her chief of staff. She got off easy otherwise. Then, as now, when she stirs up mobs or floats conspiracy theories, Waters knows how to get away with it. Lack of oversight indeed.

Give AG pick a chance to makehiscase

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has certainly surrounded himself with plenty of incompetent and ethically challenged people. But in William Barr, he has nominated someone with a track record of integrity and experience to be the next attorney general.
Such a person is badly needed at the Justice Department. Not only has Trump repeatedly debased law enforcement, his actions also have left many Americans thinking the unthinkable — that the president not only benefited from Russia's interference in the 2016 election but also is somehow beholden to a foreign adversary.
No less than the FBI has entertained this thought. The New York Times reported Friday that the FBI started a counterintelligence inquiry in 2017 into whether Trump was — gulp! — acting as an agent of the Russian government.
The outcome of that inquiry is unknown, and Trump denied on Monday that he ever worked on Russia's behalf. But he has given Americans plenty of reason for suspicion, including his odd obsequiousness toward Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, his confiscation of notes and records from his meetings with Putin, his real estate dealings with Russians, and his abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, leaving a vacuum for Russia and others to fill.
It is into this troubling context that Barr now drops as Trump's pick to become the nation's top law enforcement official and overseer of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia inquiry. This would be Barr's second stint as AG, a position he ably held during the administration of President George H.W. Bush.
At the very least, Barr would represent a huge upgrade over acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who is wholly ill-suited for the job.
At the Senate confirmation hearings, Barr's first imperative must be an unequivocal defense of Mueller, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former FBI director whom Trump has attacked incessantly.
Barr states in prepared testimony that Mueller should be given a chance to finish his report, and that the report should be made public. Barr also needs to pledge that he would not interfere with further legal actions such as subpoenas and indictments.
While some Democrats have urged that Barr's nomination be withdrawn, this is too extreme. He has done nothing to disqualify himself and deserves a chance to make his case.
Attorneys general can be hired and fired by the president, but ultimately they serve the Constitution and the rule of law. At this fraught time in history, senators shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough.

King's punishment may hurt farmers

Texto completo: "He's become so toxic, he couldn't go out and advocate for any particular ag issue."
Tim Hagle
University of Iowa
political science professor
U.S. Rep. Steve King's removal from the House Agriculture Committee over racist comments eliminates a voice for Iowa farmers at the worst possible time, state leaders say.
"Iowa, a leading ag state, no longer has a representative on a committee that's critically important to them" and that's causing "a lot of concern," said Kirk Leeds, CEO of the Iowa Soybean Association.
This is the first time in 120 years that an Iowan hasn't been a member of the influential House committee.
Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig called losing a seat on the House ag committee disappointing.
Comments like King's "are offensive and are not representative of Iowa or the 4th district," said Naig, who grew up on his family's farm near Cylinder in King's northwest Iowa district.
King's removal comes as Iowa farmers are grappling with several tough issues: fifth year of low corn and soybean prices that's torpedoing profits; ongoing trade wars that have reduced exports and resulted in federal trade bailout payments; and implementation of a new farm bill, among other concerns, Leeds said.
"It's a terrible time to not be at the table," said Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union board.
King, a Republican, is under fire for his remarks in the New York Times last week questioning how white supremacy and white nationalism became offensive terms. On Monday, Republican leaders removed King from his committee assignments.
On Tuesday, House members passed an resolution rebuking King's comments. The Kiron lawmaker voted in favor of the resolution, which passed 424-1.
"I regret that we are in this place," King said, adding that he rejects such ideologies. "I agree with every word that you have put in this. It's an honest and a direct resolution put together to address a subject that has been too long before the public dialogue in this country."
King said his comments to the New York Times did not come across as he intended.
Republican and Democratic leaders called for his resignation Tuesday. U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, an Iowa Democrat, said King should resign for the "good of the people of Iowa."
With King's loss of committee assignments, "he is no longer able to effectively serve the people of Iowa," Loebsack said in a statement. "It's past time for him to be held accountable for his actions."
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said it "will be a lot harder" for King to represent Iowa without committees seats.
Grassley, a Republican, said King will have to do what he does when he has a concern but doesn't have a seat on the committee discussing the issue. "I'll go talk with individuals on the committee and impress upon them the things I think need to be done," Grassley said in a call with reporters.
In addition to agriculture, King sat on small business and judiciary committees.
He also was on subcommittees overseeing foreign agriculture and livestock; nutrition; agriculture, energy and trade; contracting and workforce; and immigration and border security.
King was chairman of the subcommittee on constitution and civil justice. He's been on the ag committee since he was first elected to Congress in 2003.
Opponents have criticized King for not getting more legislation passed. But he's been a strong advocate on ethanol and biodiesel, and reducing regulations for farmers, among other issues, said Leeds, the Iowa Soybean Association CEO.
But, he added, King's controversial statements "have certainly impacted his ability to represent Iowa's interests."
Tim Hagle, a University of Iowa political science professor, said King's power to push state interests will be diminished.
"He's become so toxic, he couldn't go out and advocate for any particular ag issue," Hagle said. "Instead of talking about the agricultural issue, people will be talking about things he's said on immigration or race."
King's constituents might have believed he's been "picked on and misunderstood" in the past, but that might change with Republican leaders removing him from the ag committee, Hagle said.
King can only argue that journalists have "taken him out of context so many times," he said.
Lehman said King's past controversial statements already could have hurt Iowa farmers. The Iowa lawmaker was not part of the House and Senate conference committee that hammered out the new farm bill, which passed last year.
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, was on the conference committee and is a member of the Senate ag committee.
Lehman said he wished that King would have stayed focused on issues important to Iowa farmers, many of whom are struggling financially.
"We have farmers meeting with their landlords, their bankers, their suppliers, trying to find ways to make ends meet," he said.
King's comments about race are "not central to issues farmers are facing now. It's a distraction at best and at worst, they're embarrassments," Lehman said.
"I find very few farmers who agree with Steve King on these issues," he said.
Many Republicans have spoken out against King's remarks, including Grassley and Ernst. Both had previously campaigned with King.
The last time Iowa wasn't represented on the House Agriculture Committee was in the 55th Congress in 1897, according to the congressional directories. Iowa has had consistent membership, starting in the 56th Congress in 1899.
It's possible one of Iowa's new House representatives — Cindy Axne or Abby Finkenauer — could snag a Democratic seat on the ag committee. Not all freshmen assignments have yet been made.

As G.O.P. Rushes to Condemn King, Some Ask: Why Not Trump?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- After years of turning a blind eye to Representative Steve King's inflammatory statements and racist behavior, Republicans decided this week they had enough after Mr. King asked The New York Times when phrases like white supremacy and white nationalism had become offensive.
But even as they piled on their condemnation, President Trump had used Twitter to mock Senator Elizabeth Warren for not announcing her presidential exploratory committee at Wounded Knee or Little Bighorn, sacred ground for Native Americans whose ancestors fought and died there.
Now Mr. King -- a Republican from Iowa who once said that undocumented immigrants had "calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert" -- is persona non grata in his party, even as Mr. Trump continues to paint the same migrants as rapists, drug dealers and importers of mayhem. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, weighed in, calling Mr. King's comments "abhorrent."
That disconnect has provided fodder for Democrats, who are eager to paint Republicans as hypocritical, and for Republicans in the never-Trump camp who see the president as an existential threat to the party. It also exposes the challenge that Republicans face in the Trump era, as they try to court Latino voters while not running afoul of a president who has made demonizing immigrants a core component of his populist appeal.
"Look, it's been my practice for the last couple of years not to make random observations about the president's tweeting and other things," Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told reporters on Tuesday, shortly before the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution that cited Mr. King in condemning white supremacy. "Congressman King clearly uttered words that are unacceptable in America today."
Mr. McConnell, who has suggested that Mr. King find another line of work, was not the only party leader trying to separate Mr. Trump from Mr. King. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, who stripped Mr. King of his committee assignments, suggested it was not his place to rebuke Mr. Trump because the president is not a member of the House Republican Conference. (In fact, the House has the authority to rebuke or censure the president.)
Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, another member of the Republican leadership, said much the same: "I think this is about our language inside here. I don't think it's appropriate for us to be disciplining the president. He's in a different branch than we are."
Republicans are used to agonizing over how to handle the president's offensive comments and racially inflammatory remarks. His comments after the August 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., where he said there were "fine people on both sides," sent party leaders scurrying for cover, even as they took care not to criticize Mr. Trump directly.
"We must be clear," Paul D. Ryan, then the speaker of the House, wrote on Twitter at the time. "White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity."
And after the president's tweet on Sunday night about Wounded Knee infuriated Native American leaders in his state, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, issued a mild rebuke of the president.
"I wish he wouldn't tweet as much," Mr. Thune told reporters, adding, "That's obviously a very sensitive part of our state's history. So yeah, I wish he'd stay away from it."
But generally, elected Republicans have let the president slide.
"They know on some level that their defense of Trump is morally unsupportable, and so when they get a chance to speak out against Steve King, who doesn't have any power over them and doesn't pose a threat to them, a lot of them are falling over themselves to condemn him," said Peter Wehner, who advised President George W. Bush on domestic policy. "But you can't condemn Steve King and not condemn Donald Trump and pretend that you're doing the right moral and ethical thing."
In Mr. King, Republicans seem happy to have found an opportunity to condemn racism without attacking the president. After taking a beating in the 2018 midterm elections -- which produced a freshman Republican class that is almost entirely white and male and boosted the share of white men in the House Republican Conference to 90 percent -- Republicans are also well aware that the party needs to overhaul its image.
Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist, sounded the warning alarm about Mr. King even before the 2016 presidential election in his book, "2016 and Beyond: How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America." In it, he argued that demographic changes were threatening the party's survival, and he laid out the case for a platform of free markets, individual liberty and a strong defense that he believes will appeal to Americans of all races and ethnicities.
In an interview, Mr. Ayres noted that Mr. Bush won nearly 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004, while his brother Jeb Bush carried about 60 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1998 when he became governor of Florida. Mr. Trump won 28 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2016.
"I have a litany of Republicans who have done well," Mr. Ayres said, "but you can't do well running against brown people."
Then Mr. Trump won the White House, upending Mr. Ayres's argument, though he said that the case he made "won't be wrong in the long term." Now, Mr. Trump's critics within the party say that no overhaul can be complete without denouncing the president.
Michael Gerson, who was the top speechwriter for Mr. Bush, published an opinion article in The Washington Post this week that carried the headline, "Republicans Need to Condemn Trump's Brazen Bigotry."
Mr. Wehner agreed. After Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said Tuesday on television that Mr. King's comment's were "absolutely abhorrent" and "racist," Mr. Wehner took to Twitter: "I wonder if Liz Cheney would say the same thing about Donald Trump?" he wrote.
But some Republicans say they cannot be the word police, and they wrestle with where to draw the line when considering what sort of speech is offensive enough to be worthy of repudiation. "Does every statement made by a member of the House or an elected official warrant action on the floor?" asked Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida. "If it did, that's all we'd be doing."
While he said he found Mr. King's comments "unacceptable," Mr. Diaz-Balart noted that Democrats were in no rush to condemn Representative Rashida Tlaib, a freshman from Michigan, after she used a vulgarity to call for the impeachment of the president.
Others insisted that the president's comments have not been as offensive as those of Mr. King's.
"It's just very different -- the context of what is said, the way of what is said, it's very different," said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and a close ally of the president's. "I'm not going to go back and go through all of his quotes, but it's very different."
Photograph Republican leaders have been piling on in their condemnations of Representative Steve King, right, after his continued use of offensive and racially inflammatory remarks. But they have generally allowed the president to slide for making similar comments. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES; SARAH SILBIGER/THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: I am a 78-year old healthy woman facing a fourth surgery on my leg and am a bit depressed. Fortunately, I’ve recovered well from the previous three. Up until now I have been very active, hiking, traveling, dancing and continuing to work in my career. Several friends who have had recent surgeries tell me I need to get used to doing less and that’s just what I should expect given my age. Their negative outlook is distressing to me. Can you offer a little hope? T.S.
Dear T.S.
Yes, hope is on its way. Let’s look at the reality. We know with age we will experience changes at some point in time. Some might be disease related, others more mechanical such as a joint replacement. We may need more sleep and slow down a bit. Our immune system may not be as efficient. And then there are changes in our vision and hearing. Add to that the loss of muscle mass and flexibility. Many of these normal changes can be postponed with healthy lifestyles.
And part of that healthy lifestyle is our attitude. Here is what we know:
Becca Levy and colleagues from Yale found that those who are optimistic about their age and reject aging stereotypes can extend their life by 7.5 years. This powerful finding takes into account age, gender, wealth and self-reported health and loneliness. This research is based on a study of 660 men and women in Ohio who were followed for over 20 years. Levy found the years they gained from having a positive attitude was more than the years gained from low blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking and regular exercise.
In today’s world, it can be difficult to maintain a positive view of aging as we live in a youth-centric society, particularly in Southern California. On our sunny days we are surrounded by sleek bodies in their beach, running and biking attire. In addition to our culture, preferences for youth over older age are evident in employment, movies, the advertising industry, marketing and more. But the times are slowly changing.
A recent New York Times story (January 9, 2019) headlined “Older and in Power, Unwilling to Remain Unseen” referred to four older women in positions of power: Susan Zirinksy at 66 will take over CBS News in March and is the first woman to do so. Then there is Nancy Pelosi who at 78 was re-elected to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. Representative Maxine Waters at 79 will lead the Financial Services Committee. And Glenn Close at 71 beat out four younger women to win the Golden Globe award for best actress.
Yes, these all are women, which makes their position noteworthy because in general age works against women a little bit more than it does for men. You’ve heard the expression – gray hair on a man is distinguished; on a woman it’s old age. Additionally, women confront two biases: age and gender.
Let’s continue to look at reality. Those who have an illness, particularly chronic ones, may have a hard time being optimistic. Illness is scary, forcing people to deal with uncertainty, lack of control and turning themselves over to doctors. For many there is a realization their life is finite. Being positive all of the time may be unrealistic.
Older adults are resilient. They have lived through wars, divorces, losing a job, relocating, financial concerns, illness and then spring back. Jonathan Rauch, author of “The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50” writes that older people feel less stress and regret; they dwell less on negative information and are better able to regulate their emotions. As a result, older adults are reported to be happier in their later years. Clearly difficult events continue to occur; it’s their response to the events that changes over time.
Although I am in no position to judge your current situation, it sounds as though your problem is likely fixable, given you have recovered well from your previous leg surgeries. Yet there is always uncertainty.
There is hope. Your ongoing positive outlook and resilience should serve you well. As to your friends, you might mention that everyone is a case of one – and in your case you are planning for a full recovery and resuming your active life. I feel confident that you will do everything possible to make that happen.

It's reefer gladness in Illinois

Texto completo: In the lightning round of a mayoral candidate forum Thursday at Steinmetz College Prep, all 13 hopefuls on the sprawling stage gave the green light to legalizing recreational marijuana. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, a major candidate not in attendance, also is on record as being in favor of such a change in the law.
During his inauguration speech Monday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker pledged to "work with the legislature to legalize, tax and regulate the sale of recreational cannabis in Illinois," and was greeted with a cheer and 10 seconds of applause.
Last year, a nationwide Gallup Poll and a statewide Paul Simon Public Policy Institute poll both found 66 percent support for legalizing pot.
So the deal is all but done.
Next topic!
Not so fast. While I'm not among the 34 percent -- and shrinking -- of those who oppose legalization, I am in that unknown portion of the population that's deeply ambivalent about it.
Yes, I believe in personal freedom and of course I abhor busybody drug laws that penalize adults -- disproportionately adults of color -- for their choice of mood-altering substances. I was on board in 2016 when Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a measure decriminalizing possession of 10 grams or less of marijuana, making it merely a ticketable offense. And I think it's obscene that puritanical sentiments about pot have hampered the availability of medical marijuana and prevented robust scientific research into its long-term effects.
Nearly all my lefty fellow travelers are uncritically enthusiastic about legalization, and I do hate the idea of being on the wrong side of history.
Still. I see a difference between a culture that grudgingly allows the use of cannabis and a culture that encourages it, which is the inevitable outcome when legalization is motivated primarily by a desire for tax revenue.
It's a powerful drug -- far stronger in conventionally available forms than when I was a collegiate dabbler in the 1970s -- and one that tends to promote indolence and sap motivation when used habitually. Enthusiasts compare it to coffee or wine, which is probably fair enough when it comes to moderate or occasional indulgence, but I'm not sold on the idea that marijuana is charmingly benign.
In 2017, a panel of medical experts analyzed available scientific research for the National Academy of Medicine and generated a 468-page report that said "cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of schizophrenia and other psychoses." The report concluded that use of pot increases the likelihood of automobile fatalities and negatively impacts employment prospects and academic achievement, but noted that our ignorance about marijuana remains vast.
A new book by former New York Times investigative reporter Alex Berenson, "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence," cites that report and other research in sounding an alarm about the swift and radical change that has seen recreational marijuana legalized in 10 states, the District of Columbia and Canada since 2012.
"Anyone who raises ... concerns may be mocked as a modern-day believer in 'Reefer Madness,' the notorious 1936 movie that portrays young people descending into insanity and violence after smoking marijuana," Berenson wrote in a Times op-ed. "States that allow recreational marijuana have found that legalization doesn't end the black market in unregulated cannabis. But it does lower prices, increase availability and acceptability, and drive up use."
Berenson's book has received positive coverage in such publications as The New Yorker and Mother Jones. But it's also taken critical fire from many sources, including Reason magazine, where senior editor Jacob Sullum accused Berenson of misrepresenting some of the data, ignoring research that doesn't fit his thesis, confusing cause and effect and, in general, exhibiting "a tendency to favor scaremongering over a judicious weighing of the evidence."
To the squishes like me who are inclined to support the middle ground position of salutary decriminalization, Sullum makes the excellent point that "reducing penalties for marijuana use while maintaining a ban on commercial production and distribution is morally incoherent ... (and) tends to make drug use more dangerous and unpredictable."
Life hasn't gone to hell in Oregon and Colorado, the states with the longest experience with legal weed. That's a good sign, but outcomes are mixed and as the National Academy of Medicine and other experts note, it's too early to measure the broad, long-term social and physiological impacts of lifting the prohibition.
I'd like to think it's possible to call for more evidence and more skepticism without seeming to be in league with the blue-nosed moralists who object on principle to the unearned artificially induced pleasures and who never thought Cheech and Chong were funny.
So I'll give it a try. Our governor and next mayor need to get this right. Turn that green light into a flashing yellow.

Business &amp; Technology: New York Magazine Chief Steps Aside

Texto completo: New York magazine editor Adam Moss said he would step down at the end of March, capping a 15-year tenure during which he helped broaden the publication's reach and online presence.
In a memo to staffers, Mr. Moss, 61 years old, said, "Experience is good, but after a while every institution needs a blood transfusion." Mr. Moss said he would continue to serve as an adviser.
Mr. Moss helped make New York magazine more national in scope and develop five digital sister publications -- Vulture, an entertainment website; Grub Street, a food and restaurant blog; the Cut, a women's site; the Strategist, an e-commerce guide; and Intelligencer, a politics website -- according to parent company New York Media LLC.
"Adam showed the world that a legacy print publisher could lead invention in digital products, that a brand with local origins could own national conversations, that a diversified premium media business can be constructed around an original editorial voice," said Pam Wasserstein, New York Media's chief executive, in a written statement on Tuesday.
A successor is expected to be announced shortly, said a New York Media spokeswoman. New York Media is controlled by the heirs of the late financier Bruce Wasserstein. Last summer, The Wall Street Journal reported that New York Media was exploring a possible sale of the company. The spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment regarding a possible sale.
The magazine industry has continued to struggle with declining print advertising and newsstand revenue, leading to consolidation.
Significant industry deals that closed last year included Meredith Corp. buying Time Inc. and Hearst purchasing Rodale Inc.
Before joining New York magazine in 2004, Mr. Moss served as the editor of the New York Times Magazine, as well as assistant managing editor of the paper, overseeing the magazine, Book Review, culture and style, New York Media said.
The magazine and its digital publications won 40 National Magazine Awards during Mr. Moss's stewardship, according to the company.

Texto completo: NATIONAL
An article on Tuesday about a teachers' strike in Los Angeles overstated the scale of the demonstration. The strike was the largest in a single district in the past year, not the largest in the United States.
SCIENCE TIMES
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about new biometric data on American men miscalculated the height of someone who is 69.4 inches tall. He is about 5 feet 9 inches, not 5 feet 8 inches. In addition, the article misstated the average height of Mexican-American men in 2016. The figure was 66.5 inches, not 61.5 inches.
OBITUARIES
An obituary on Sunday about Lamin Sanneh, a world-renowned scholar of Christianity and Islam, referred incorrectly to Rowan Williams, who was quoted as calling Dr. Sanneh "probably the most significant theologian of mission in the English-speaking world today." While he was the archbishop of Canterbury when he made that statement, he has not held that position since 2012.
An obituary on Tuesday about the author Francine du Plessix Gray misspelled the surname of an author who reviewed her novel "Lovers and Tyrants" for The New York Times. He was Julian Moynahan, not Moynihan.

Texto completo: Zaps of pain, like tiny shocks, bombarded her head. Susann Davis assumed it was a migraine, a seemingly minor annoyance when stacked against the crises she already faced.
In 2016, Ms. Davis lost her job in the hospitality industry. Soon after, she was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Then she learned she was being evicted from her apartment.
Luckily, Ms. Davis said in a recent interview, while early into unemployment she had consulted a friend, Katherine Earle, a Community Health Advocates counselor. Ms. Earle had helped her sign up for Medicaid.
"It was sort of like the universe intercepting," said Ms. Davis, 46.
Community Health Advocates is operated by Community Service Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. It helps clients traverse the complicated health care system, helping them access low-cost or free care, resolve medical billing issues and understand their health care rights.

Medicaid covered all of Ms. Davis's cancer treatments at Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital from May to December 2016. She was also able to extend her time in her apartment.
During that time, Ms. Davis learned that the lightning sensations in her head were a result of damaged nerves from a botched root canal years earlier. To fix the damaged tooth, she required a dental implant, which cost $1,718.63. Because it was considered a cosmetic procedure, it was not covered by her dental plan.
"Any sort of cosmetic when it comes to dental work should be included in your insurance," Ms. Davis said. "It should be considered vital."
Once more, Ms. Earle was able to help her friend, securing a grant from the Neediest Cases Fund so Ms. Davis could afford the dental procedure.
"I don't think I could have done it on my own," she said. "At my lowest period, they were there to help me."
Of the money raised in the previous Neediest Cases Fund campaign, $50,000 went to the Community Health Advocates program and helped people like Ms. Davis with health concerns.
"Access to dental service is our top need, the No. 1 service people call us for," said Diane Spicer, supervising attorney of the Community Health Advocates program.
Many health insurance policies in New York State do not cover a wide array of dental services, or they will cover services only if a patient is in extreme need. Benefits are often capped at $1,000 or $2,000 each year, but fairly common procedures, such as root canals, crowns and dental implants, cost upward of $5,000. So many people who cannot afford these costs neglect problems with their teeth, only to wind up in terrible pain or with missing teeth, leading to shame and stigma.
"If you're missing a tooth, it doesn't even matter if your job is in the hospitality service industry," Ms. Davis said. "If you're working where you have to meet people or anything that has to do with presentation, you still have to have teeth."
Ms. Davis's cancer has been in remission since 2016, and she has a new job in Atlanta.
For Robert Walker, a retired truck driver in the Bronx, an urbane appearance was less important than pain relief once he began having an issue with his teeth. Mr. Walker, 73, has diabetes, asthma and a heart condition, and he is on Medicaid.
In 2017, he required new dentures, specifically a bottom partial plate. The teeth underneath it had grown loose.
"Every time I'd bite down on my food, it would hurt my gums," he said. "I had to eat nothing but soft foods, soups and stuff like that, mashed potatoes."
Mr. Walker would need to have his teeth extracted and a full bottom plate put in to relieve the pain. His medical coverage would not cover the expenses. The cost of the dentures was more than $2,000. Mr. Walker receives $1,010 in Social Security Insurance each month.
"If it wasn't for food stamps, I'd really be up a creek," he said.
A dental clinic discount was given to him, but Mr. Walker was still $500 short. In late 2017, Community Health Advocates intervened with money from a Neediest grant to pay for the dentures.
"I'm eating peanuts now," Mr. Walker said, adding, "I call myself blessed because there are a lot of seniors in worse shape than what I'm in."
Those people, and countless others, are exactly why Community Health Advocates exists, Ms. Spicer said.
"This program helps real-life people every single day," she said. "It helps people who are sick, poor or just don't understand. We keep people out of bankruptcy. We help real-life people access care."

Texto completo: It didn't take long for John Kasich to land a new gig.

United Talent Agency announced Monday that it signed Mr. Kasich and will represent him in speaking engagements and media appearances - which the former governor makes frequently.

It is an incredible honor to represent one of the nation's most unifying and inspiring political voices, United Talent co-president Jay Sures said in a news release. We're thrilled to work with Governor Kasich as he looks to the future by bringing his unique experience, wisdom, and perspective to an even wider array of audiences.

United Talent represents news television anchors and hosts like Jim Acosta, Anderson Cooper, Jake Tapper, and Chuck Todd. Mr. Kasich is often a guest on Mr. Todd's Meet the Press.

Mr. Kasich hosted a show on Fox News, Heartland with John Kasich, for seven years before running for governor. He's also written four books, including two New York Times bestsellers, Every Other Monday and Courage is Contagious.

In his post-gubernatorial life, Mr. Kasich is also considering a third run for the presidency, either as a Republican or independent.

No one knows what the next six months will hold, Kasich ally and former state GOP chairman Matt Borges previously told The Blade for a profile about Mr. Kasich. Anyone who tells you they do is not telling the truth.

Mr. Kasich was on TV Monday, but the appearance wasn't all about him. He attended the inauguration ceremony for his successor, Gov. Mike DeWine.

I'm excited to work with UTA to keep my voice active across the world and share my experiences and observations to help improve the lives of others, Mr. Kasich said in a news release.

Texto completo: New York magazine editor Adam Moss said he would step down at the end of March, capping a 15-year tenure during which he helped broaden the publication's reach and online presence.
In a memo to staffers, Mr. Moss, 61 years old, said, "Experience is good, but after a while every institution needs a blood transfusion." Mr. Moss said he would continue to serve as an adviser.
Mr. Moss helped make New York magazine more national in scope and develop five digital sister publications--Vulture, an entertainment website; Grub Street, a food and restaurant blog; the Cut, a women's site; the Strategist, an e-commerce guide; and Intelligencer, a politics website--according to parent company New York Media.

"Adam showed the world that a legacy print publisher could lead invention in digital products, that a brand with local origins could own national conversations, that a diversified premium media business can be constructed around an original editorial voice," said Pam Wasserstein, New York Media's chief executive, in a statement Tuesday.
A successor is expected to be announced shortly, said a New York Media spokeswoman. New York Media is controlled by the heirs of the late financier Bruce Wasserstein. Last summer, The Wall Street Journal reported that New York Media was exploring a possible sale of the company. The spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment on a possible sale.
The magazine industry has continued to struggle with declining print advertising and newsstand revenue, leading to consolidation. Major deals that closed last year included Meredith Corp. buying Time Inc. and Hearst purchasing Rodale Inc.
Before joining New York magazine in 2004, Mr. Moss was the editor of the New York Times Magazine, as well as assistant managing editor of the paper, overseeing the magazine, Book Review, culture and style, New York Media said.
The magazine and its digital publications won 40 National Magazine Awards during Mr. Moss's stewardship, the company said.

Digital First value on Gannett too low, cost-cutting hopes likely unrealistic: Analysts

Autor: Snider, Mike.

Resumen: Alden Global Capital may view Gannett as a company it can prune like it has other media companies, but Gannett already runs lean, analysts say.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Digital+First+value+on+Gannett+too+low%2C+cost-cutting+hopes+likely+unrealistic%3A+Analysts&amp;author=Snider%2C+Mike&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-01-15&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: A hedge fund-backed chain that is aiming for a hostile takeover of Gannett, which owns USA TODAY and 109 local media properties that include USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, placed too low of a value on the company and is betting on a level of cost cutting that may be unrealistic, analysts said Monday.
Michael Kupinski, director of research at Noble Capital Markets in Boca Raton, Florida, said most newspapers, after years of staff reductions across the industry, "are running pretty lean. "
He predicted that Gannett's board will decline the offer.
MNG Enterprises, which also operates as Digital First Media, is proposing to buy Gannett for $12 a share. That would be a 23 percent premium above Friday's closing price of $9. 75 a share. Gannett (GCI) shares on Monday closed up 21 percent, or $2. 07, at $11. 82.
MNG, majority owned by hedge fund Alden Global Capital, owns about 200 publications, including newspapers such as The Denver Post, The Mercury News of San Jose, California, the Los Angeles Daily News and the Boston Herald. The company has also gained a reputation for deep cost cuts and extensive layoffs in newsrooms.
A plan to prune Gannett for additional return on investment may be faulty, Kupinski said.
“I guess this particular firm is notorious for going in and slashing costs," he said. "I really don’t view Gannett as being one of the companies that has bloated staffing or anything like that. There might be an opportunity to consolidate maybe some facilities but they were moving along that direction anyway. ”
Paul Caminiti, a spokesperson for MNG, said it "has extensive operational experience and a successful track record in the newspaper industry, enabling us to run newspapers profitability and sustainable so that they can continue to serve their local communities. ”
Subsequent bidders could surpass the MNG/Digital First offer because "it would be below what I would expect the company to achieve," Kupinski said. "We have a $15 price target" on Gannett stock.
Huber Research analysts Douglas Arthur and Craig Huber, in a note to clients Monday, said any offer for Gannett should be at least $14 a share.
The two analysts described the takeover attempt as "opportunistic given the stock was battered during the market’s December sell-off and the CEO as well as head of digital sales have both announced they are leaving (CEO is retiring). Our bottom line is that the proposed price is not high enough. "
Gannett CEO Robert Dickey announced his retirement in December. Sharon Rowlands, who led USA TODAY Network Marketing Solutions, is leaving the company to become CEO of web. com.
Gannett said MNG/Digital First did not approach the company prior to Monday. That is an unusual strategy and one that would not only be more costly, but would be less likely to be effective, said Morton Pierce, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer with the firm of White & Case in New York City.
“If I approach you and punch you in the mouth and then say, ‘Let’s be friends,’ it’s less likely to work than if I just come up and talk to you,” Pierce said.
This first bid may not be the last and shareholders could be wooed, he said.
“If someone’s paying you cash, whether they’re the nicest people in the world or the worst SOBs, their cash is the same,” Pierce said.
Since MNG/Digital First is privately held, financial details are hard to collect. But the chain achieved a 17 percent operating margin for fiscal 2017, the highest among publishing chains, said Ken Doctor, an analyst who writes about the media business on his website, Newsonomics. com.
Other major publishers such as The New York Times Co. and Gannett posted margins of less than 10 percent, according to Doctor. He said company financials obtained confidentially found that much of Digital First's profit was driven by its Colorado newspapers and its Bay Area News Group.
Two months ago, Gannett reduced its full-year 2018 revenue forecast after digital advertising and marketing services revenue growth slowed, resulting in a 4 percent dip in total operating revenue for the third quarter. The company revised its full-year revenue forecast to a range of $2. 9 billion to $2. 94 billion, compared to the previous range of $2. 95 billion to $3 billion. Wall Street analysts now expect Gannett to post full year-revenue of $2. 9 billion, down 6. 5 percent from $3. 1 billion a year ago, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Declining print circulation and advertising revenue has led newspaper groups to seek protection through consolidation. Gannett itself has bolstered its size in 2016 by adding the Journal Media Group. Its 15 media properties included the Journal Sentinel in Milwaukee, The Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Tennessee, and The Record in Bergen County, N. J.
"Alden has a controversial reputation in the newspaper business and is known for aggressively slashing staff (media sources refer to the strategy as strip-mining), selling off real estate and otherwise attempting to seemingly run papers until the very last iota of cash flow has been squeezed from it," the Huber Research analysts wrote. "We believe, while Underweight, (Gannett) is on the right path with its digital growth push and legacy cost cuts. "

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets.

Texto completo: On Monday morning, President Donald J. Trump finally got around to definitively declaring that he didn't work for Russia. With every other president we've ever had - including the bad ones - this was already baked into the expectations of the citizens.
Not with this guy. It is not reasonable to assume our current president doesn't have divided loyalties. That's not to say that that his kowtowing to Vladimir Putin has anything to do with an ideological commitment to communism over capitalism. These days, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to find a bigger swamp of crony capitalism than the Kremlin.
No, Mr. Trump's divided loyalties are caused by being forced to choose between his economic self-interest and the inconvenient obligations of democratic governance. It's supposed to be difficult to make a dishonest buck playing footsies with Russian oligarchs when you're the president of the United States.
When Mr. Trump phoned into his pal Judge Jeanine Pirro's Fox News show on Saturday night, she gave him every opportunity to set the record straight about The New York Times' bombshell from the previous day.
He either couldn't or wouldn't dispute the substance of the story other than to say how "disgraceful" the paper's coverage of him has been and how insulting the question of whether he was "working for Russia" was. He never directly answered Ms. Pirro's offer to state unequivocally that he "didn't work for Russia."
Mr. Trump's non-denial denial on Fox was noted on the Sunday talk shows where political scribes and legal analysts debated the implications of a sitting president being the subject of an FBI counterintelligence investigation to figure out whether he was a willing Russian asset or merely a useful idiot.
Critics of the president have to admit that "are you a Russian asset" is the ultimate loaded question that Mr. Trump is particularly ill-equipped to answer honestly without incriminating himself. Every utterance and every tweet he's generated as president has already revealed him to be guilty of something.
Still, on Monday morning, Mr. Trump finally figured out that being coy only increased his guilt in the eyes of most Americans. "I never worked for Russia and you know that answer better than anyone," he said tearing into a reporter. "Not only did I never work for Russia, but I think it's a disgrace that you even asked the question. Because it's a whole, big fat hoax. It's just a hoax."
Mr. Trump said this on the heels of a Washington Post story that reports he confiscated the notes from the interpreter who accompanied him to his meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki and ordered the linguist not to brief the American national security staff on what transpired between the two leaders.
No, that doesn't look suspicious, at all.
There is no doubt that the WaPo story is true and that Mr. Trump looks guilty for refusing to allow an honest account of that meeting to become a part of the official narrative. Mr. Trump is supposed to represent the interests of the American people, yet he consistently operates like an independent contractor on the international stage. We know he's hiding something, but we don't know what it is.
Let that sink in. It is indisputable that Mr. Trump is keeping secrets from the American people about our relationship with Russia despite the fact he ostensibly works for us and not the other way around.
So we're forced to ask a loaded question again and again: why does Mr. Trump consistently act as if he has something to hide when it comes to the Russians?
Why is the first instinct of every Trump official or campaign worker who hasn't made a plea deal with Robert Mueller's office to lie about the nature of Trump World's contacts with the Russians? Why does the appearance of guilt attach itself to this president the way iron filaments stick to magnets?
I would go so far as to say we're long past the point where we can reasonably give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Russians. It is unreasonable to expect the American people not to strongly suspect Mr. Trump of hiding something that he obviously believes would imperil his presidency.
There's a halo of guilt around this president that won't go away with lame complaints about a "deep state conspiracy" or "lynching by a lying, liberal media." Mr. Trump lies, and in a demonstrable way, way too often for there not to be something rotten in Denmark (or Helsinki).
On Fox News, where many of the hosts play defense on behalf of Mr. Trump's presidency, they've given up trying to present a coherent theory or alibi for his actions and words they know wouldn't survive a news cycle without being shredded by the latest damning revelation. On Fox, they simply allow the president unfiltered access to his base and let him do his own lying to the people most inclined to support him no matter what.
At this point, I would gladly consider even one innocent, non-sinister explanation for Donald Trump's ongoing dance with the Russians that doesn't insult our collective intelligence, if only to give our imaginations a vigorous workout in the other direction.

Fire Destroys a Shakespeare Theater

Texto completo: A Connecticut theater that was known for its Shakespearean productions and where Oscar-winning actors once took their bows was reduced to a smoldering mound of mangled steel after a fire early on Sunday morning, officials said.
The 1,500-seat venue, which was modeled after the Globe Theatre in England, opened in 1955 as the American Shakespeare Festival Theater, with teakwood donated by the French government and brass drinking fountains.
But while the stage once featured performances by the likes of Katharine Hepburn, Helen Hayes and Christopher Walken, the Stratford, Conn., theater struggled with its identity over the years and has been closed since the late 1980s.
In recent years, a group of supporters was working to revitalize the site, which sits on a wooded plot on the banks of the Housatonic River, where theatergoers once picnicked and children explored a garden with 81 species of plants mentioned in Shakespeare's works.
"It was a national asset," said Beth Daponte, the chairwoman of a group that envisioned reviving summertime festivals and stage productions.
Throughout the day on Sunday, tributes streamed in online. On Twitter, the playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda called it "heartbreaking."
Like many who grew up in Stratford, a town of 50,000, Ms. Daponte got her first job at the theater as a teenager and remembers watching the actress Lynn Redgrave in "Twelfth Night."
For Ms. Daponte and the community members who worked to convince skeptics that the theater could be a useful tool for economic development, the fire was a "tremendous loss."
To the dismay of some, the town has long been tethered to its English cousins.
In 1927, the mayor of Stratford-upon-Avon, England, visited the Connecticut town in a gesture of "friendship between one of England's old historical, towns associated with the name of its greatest poet, William Shakespeare, and the town of its namesake in the new world," according to a letter from the English town to its American counterpart.
The idea for an American Shakespeare theater was credited to the playwright and producer Lawrence Langner, who enlisted the help of Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the New York City Ballet, and the philanthropist Joseph Verner Reed.
The theater was barely completed in time for its first performances of "Julius Caesar" in 1955. Christopher Plummer, Raymond Massey and Jack Palance (who later became host of the television show "Ripley's Believe It or Not!" and an Academy Award winner for the 1991 movie "City Slickers") took the stage for performances that The New York Times called "routine and uneven."
Nevertheless, the theater became central to the production of Shakespearean plays in America.
By 1982, the theater had run out of money and benefactors, and the state took ownership. In 2005, the town reclaimed the deed and struggled to figure out what to do with it.
"You've got half the townspeople thinking it's our legacy, it's our heritage, it's our privilege and responsibility to maintain this," said Wendy Canfield, whose grandmother ran the theater's costume museum and whose mother and two aunts had summer jobs there, told The Times in 2009. "And you've got a lot of other people who think of it as an arsonist's dream, an albatross. It had its time, it had its place. All great things come to an end."
A "ShakesBeer Festival" fund-raiser was organized as part of an effort to revive the theater. In 2017, Ms. Deponte's group hired an architectural firm to mothball the site -- which required cleaning out layers of mold and trash, and protecting it from squatters, including raccoons -- so that a plan could be created for its future use. Supporters unsuccessfully sought state funding to install a fire suppression system.
No one was injured in the fire, which was reported around 1 a.m. Its cause was under investigation.
Howard Sherman, an arts administrator and advocate who worked at the theater in 1989, worried about its fate.
On Facebook, he wrote, "I fear that someone has now had their way and cleared the land for other use, but even if this was somehow accidental, it seems to assure that this site will never be used for theater again -- unless by luck proper insurance will allow a new, modern theater to be built in its place."

For Trump, a denial is sometimes anything but

Texto completo: Twice in just a few hours Saturday, President Trump and his representatives offered textbook examples of the fog-making rhetorical response known as the non-denial denial.
Asked during a Fox News interview whether he was a Russian agent (as the FBI suspected, according to a blockbuster New York Times story), Trump harrumphed, "I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing." (Trump gave a more direct denial on Monday).
A few hours earlier, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had this reply to a Washington Post article that found that Trump had concealed notes of his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin from even his closest advisers: "The Washington Post story is so outrageously inaccurate it doesn't even warrant a response. The liberal media has wasted two years trying to manufacture a fake collusion scandal instead of reporting the fact that unlike President Barack Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
Like all non-denial denials, both responses were forceful, even emotional in tone. But neither really answered the question.
That's exactly how a non-denial denial (or NDD, if you will) is supposed to work. It suggests the speaker is responding forthrightly, without really confirming or rejecting the claim.
NDDs aren't technically lies, but they are evasive and obfuscating. By seeming to dispute a statement without actually doing so, an NDD can raise doubts about the veracity of a damning statement. They have the added benefit of letting the non-denial denier off the hook if and when more facts emerge that confirm the original report. The denier, after all, never actually said the initial report was wrong, so he or she can't be called on a blatant lie later.
In addition to their many inaccurate, misleading and baseless statements, Trump and his representatives have been frequent practitioners of the NDD:
• When The Post reported that Trump had told lawmakers in a private meeting last January that he opposed admitting more immigrants from "shithole countries," White House spokesman Raj Shah issued a statement that neither denied nor confirmed the comment. "Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation," Shah said.
• Following news reports that Trump intended to replace national security adviser H.R. McMaster with John Bolton in March, Sanders tweeted, "Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster - contrary to reports, they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC." There weren't then; Bolton replaced McMaster four days later.
• McMaster himself provided non-denial cover for the White House after The Post reported last year that Trump had leaked details of a classified operation against the Islamic State during an Oval Office meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. "The story that came out tonight, as reported, is false," he said, adding, "At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed. And the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known." But the story never said Trump disclosed nonpublic military operations or discussed "intelligence sources or methods." McMaster's statement never cited anything specific in the story that was false.
The "non-denial denial" phrase itself appears to have entered the lexicon during the Watergate era of the mid-1970s.
Several sources credit the late Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee with coining it in reaction to statements made by President Nixon and his spokesman about The Post's reporting.
"As best as I can recall, Bradlee was the first to use the 'non-denial denial' language," said Bob Woodward, who along with Carl Bernstein reported those stories.
At one point, Woodward said, the White House said The Post's sources were a "fountain of misinformation," but did not specifically challenge the reported facts. "I recall when I first heard [the phrase], I thought, 'Ah, Bradlee was giving language to precisely what was happening.' "
Woodward said the most artful NDDs are issued with "such force, language and outrage that it sounds like a real denial." What's more, as with Trump, the Nixon White House mixed non-denials with outright denials, creating the impression that his administration was actually denying everything.
The Trump White House pushed back on Woodward's most recent book, "Fear," with its own nonspecific NDD regarding the book's many anecdotes about infighting and chaos among Trump's top officials. In a statement upon the book's release in September, Sanders said, "This book is nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the President look bad." (Trump and former White House chief of staff John F. Kelly did, however, issue more specific denials).
As a rhetorical device, NDDs are an updated version of the "red herring" fallacy, the notion that an irrelevant topic is introduced in an argument to divert attention from the original issue, said Edward Schiappa, a professor of comparative media studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In other words, he said, "it's just another in a long line of strategies of evasion."
Trump isn't unique in this, said Dana L. Cloud, a communication and rhetorical studies professor at Syracuse University. "One need only think of Bill Clinton's reductionist use of a definitional argument when claiming that he did not have sex with Monica Lewinsky," she said. "It is not a set of tactics unique to Trump or any particular political party."
But Trump's NDD's tend to fit a pattern, said Jennifer Mercieca, a professor at Texas A&M who specializes in American political discourse. His strategy typically involves a combination of denying knowledge of an accusation; denying associating with the people allegedly involved; asking what the victim did to deserve his or her fate; and accusing his accusers, "which is an appeal to hypocrisy."
As such, Trump's non-denial denials are different in kind and manner than earlier presidents, according to Rosa A. Eberly, a rhetoric professor at Penn State, because they assert "de facto negative evaluations" of most democratic institutions. "I don't see [rhetoric of this kind] as an effective strategy for the long game of democracy," she said.
Trump, Woodward said, "has taken the old Nixon strategy of making the issue the conduct of the press, not the conduct of the president, to new strategic heights. And some of it is working."

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE, R.I. — On the field, as long as you discount Sunday’s boat race against the Patriots, the 2018 season was an unqualified success for the Chargers. A 12-4 regular season, one playoff win, and a core of young, talented players suggest a bright future.
On the streets and in the boardrooms and living rooms of L.A., do people care?
The overnight TV ratings for Sunday’s Divisional Round playoff game in Foxborough were down slightly nationally (19.2), despite huge numbers in the Boston market. In L.A., the game drew a 17.2 rating. In San Diego it drew a 29.7, underlining the fact that it remains the home of the only group of football fans who still truly care about this franchise.
(I mean, hating is caring, right?)
This is, as we have been constantly told, a long-term play for the Chargers in Los Angeles. Playing in the recently renamed 28,000-seat soccer stadium in Carson was meant to transition the franchise into the market while building an audience and selling seat licenses for their tenancy in the stadium that Rams owner Stan Kroenke is building in Inglewood.
We are now two years into this adventure and there’s no going back. Dean Spanos told the New York Times last week, “There’s no doubt we are the Los Angeles Chargers. Los Angeles is our home.”
They’ve sold some seat licenses for the StanleyDome, shrewdly offering them for as little as $100 with the idea of ultimately positioning themselves as the people’s team.
Anecdotal evidence, though, suggests few people are buying it. How often do you see people wearing Chargers gear in public, for instance, compared to the number of people wearing Rams gear?
L.A. is an incredibly competitive sports market, and it takes time to create a niche. The Chargers had the misfortune of coming in a year after the Rams and their pre-existing history and legacy in L.A. They may still be digging out from the 0-4 start in their inaugural L.A. season, in terms of public perception.
Yes, winning does matter. But the Chargers’ success came the same season that the Rams were just a little bit hotter. And with the Chargers done, guess who has the L.A. football stage all to itself this week?
Whether the Spanos family likes it or not, this is still perceived in many quarters as a franchise that belongs to, and in, San Diego. Even now, two years in, the Lyft driver in Baltimore, the radio/podcast commentator in Cleveland, the occasional referee announcing a penalty and observers throughout the country still refer to the team as “San Diego.”
(Then again, during the wild card game in Baltimore last week referee Clete Blakeman slipped and declared that “San Francisco is charged with its first timeout” after an unsuccessful Chargers challenge. Yeah, we know, all those California teams are interchangeable.)
Consider this, going back to TV ratings: For much of the season, the Chargers’ L.A. ratings were in single digits and significantly trailed those in its former home. The Baltimore game last Sunday drew an 18.0 rating and 43 share in Los Angeles, a significant improvement … but in San Diego, split between those who still love the team and those who despise Spanos, the game drew a 30.7 rating and 60 share. Sunday against the Patriots was pretty much more of the same.
The ratings figure is deceptive, of course, because of the difference between a point in No. 29 market San Diego (10,028 homes, as measured by Nielsen) and No. 2 L.A. (53,186). Translated, 914,799 households in L.A. had the Patriots-Chargers game on, compared to 297,832 in San Diego.
Numbers can be crunched. Passion is harder to measure.
The San Diego Union-Tribune sent a reporter to New England this past weekend. San Diego TV people show up at home games and midweek availability in Costa Mesa. And there seems to be a constant debate in San Diego over how much that city’s media should pay attention to the city’s former team. Meanwhile, in L.A. it is one team among many and simply fighting for attention.
That shouldn’t be surprising at all. When this team played in San Diego, I had always maintained that with its low national profile, the only people who really, really cared about the Chargers resided in San Diego County, plus parts of Orange and Riverside counties. Even now, I’m convinced that the majority of those who are Charger fans are holdovers from the San Diego era.
The guy in the middle of all of this? Philip Rivers, who is still a San Diego resident and commutes to practices in Costa Mesa in a chauffeured SUV that has been converted into a rolling film room.
“San Diego will always be special for me and for many of us,” the quarterback said last week. “I’m not out and about very much this time of year, but I think … I don’t know the best way to say it. You hope that some of those fans can be happy and excited for the team they cheered for. And I know many others may not.
“And, you know, that’s a hard decision and position to be in. But certainly, you know, the people I run into have always been very supportive.”
Meanwhile, we know it’s a long-term project in a tough market. But at some point the audience size has to grow significantly, right?

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it encourages a glass of red wine every now and then.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: New York Daily News
If you follow Serena Williams on social media, you’ve probably heard of Qai Qai. Her year-old daughter Olympia’s doll has her own Twitter and Instagram accounts and even hosted a QQQ&A from Down Under, where the Australian Open is set to begin today.
It’s fun for Williams’ fans to see Qai Qai in a director’s chair courtside for practice or being hugged by Olympia, but it’s also a calculated strategy of engagement. From her own accounts, Williams posts video of intimate family moments and allows fans to see the dynamic of her marriage with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. The lighthearted part of it is just the tip of the iceberg for a woman with some very serious things to accomplish.
The annual Grand Slam campaign is about to begin and, for the millionth time in living memory, Williams has a realistic shot at all four when the Australian Open begins.
How she is doing it is nothing short of revolutionary. Last year, Williams missed the Australian but reached the final at the U.S. Open and Wimbledon and the fourth round at the French. Through all of it, she has made motherhood a core part of the process.
“Some people believe that women go quietly and have their babies, and the story is on the back end when they come back and they win and they win at the highest level,” former WNBA and UConn star Swin Cash said. “She’s taking the people who may only want to cover the comeback and forces them to cover the journey.”
Cash, who had a little boy at about the same time Williams had Olympia, has related to Williams at every step in this story. In the way Williams presents it, having a baby isn’t the obstacle in a comeback story; it’s just part of the journey. Last week, when Olympia wanted to be held while Williams was getting ready for a match, Williams posted photos of her getting her stretching done with Olympia in her arms.
Williams wasn’t always so accessible. There were points in her career where she avoided the media or sat for post-match press conferences like she’d been issued detention after a loss. In the last few years, that has changed. Even after difficult losses in the final at the U.S. Open and Wimbledon last year, she was available and engaged. Her opening remarks at Wimbledon were some of the most candid I’d ever heard.
In London, she discussed in emotional detail the decision to stop nursing as part of her training process.
“Once I got to six months, I felt good about it,” Williams said. “Then it was just emotionally letting go. That was a different thing. I literally sat Olympia in my arms, I talked to her, we prayed about it. I told her, ‘Look, I’m going to stop. Mommy has to do this.’ I cried a little bit, not as much as I thought I was. She was fine. She was totally fine. It was the strangest thing. I just learned from that experience: Every physical body is different.”
It wasn’t your usual pre-tournament press conference, and it was incredibly relatable for many of the women who have followed her career and try to navigate between obligations.
“Serena being a woman, and a woman of color, all the crap that she’s been through and still, ‘I’m persevering, I’m keeping it moving,’ that’s amazing,” Cash said. “Having to think of career and all of that — granted, I think she has resources that a lot of people don’t — but the intimacy of what she shares and what she is responsible for, even how she trains to come back, it’s so vital and important for the times that we’re in right now.”
Sheryl Swoopes, Kim Clijsters, Kara Goucher, Christie Rampone, Kerri Walsh Jennings and many others have been champions with children. Few, however, have the platform that Williams does or are doing it in an era when athletes can control such a large part of their media presence.
I’d wager, though, that Williams would still be on the Forbes list of richest athletes even if she didn’t publicly embrace her role as a new mom. Perhaps even more so, and here’s why.
As much as we love to beatify motherhood in Western culture, we don’t actually treat mothers very well. We don’t give them much time off work after having a baby or create affordable childcare solutions. Many parents can’t take off time to care for a sick child without guilt, and all the costs that go with raising an educated, healthy kid are going up.
Even in media, mothering itself is considered soft news. This was brilliantly explained in a recent New York Times opinion piece from Hillary Frank, who has a parenting podcast called The Longest Shortest Time. When pitching ideas on topics related to motherhood to NPR, she’d get responses like, “This is just too … small.” Meanwhile, repeated stories on erectile dysfunction were A-OK.
Frank called it a special kind of misogyny reserved for mothers.
But more than that, when it comes to women in the workforce, there is little about becoming a mother that creates the sense that you’ll be better at your job. The mommy-track is still a thing, and this assumption goes double for women who are athletes.
Your body changes, and when your body is your instrument of employment, there is a chance it will not be as efficient afterwards.
And into this arena comes Serena Williams, whose excellence is incontrovertible. Who is wearing her motherhood like a badge of honor. Whose blood clots after a harrowing birth nearly made her another example of how black women are more likely to die in the process. Who faced repeated setbacks as she started her professional comeback, including withdrawing from the fourth round of the French Open against Maria Sharapova due to a pectoral injury.
Branding is one thing, but Williams’ family is modeling what could be a future for working parents. Ohanian has actively called for paid parental leave and took time after the birth of their daughter to be home. He’s made time to support her in person at many events in conjunction with his own work and has made parenting as much a part of his public face as she has.
And all of it would be lovely even if Williams had retired two years ago. But she emphatically did not. In full view, she has brought her fans along for the good days and bad as she started training again, stopped nursing sooner than she’d hoped in order to drop weight, won her first WTA matches in March and kept going until the dramatic U.S. Open final loss to Naomi Osaka.
Even in that moment, on the blue Flushing courts against a player who was clearly better on the day, Williams let us see everything that was happening; the unwinding of her composure after a chair umpire’s strict interpretation of the rules, the emotion as a record 24 Grand Slam victories remained just out of grasp, rising to make Osaka’s first Grand Slam title the centerpiece it deserved.
And here she stands, strengths, scars, heart, challenges and mistakes all exposed to the air. Ready to do it again.
Yes, we are entertained, but we are also enlightened. Williams’ excellence is unbounded by her sport, and still she plays on.
Advantage, Williams.

Texto completo: Leo P. Ribuffo, a scholar of American political history who specialized in examining the rise of the far right, arguing that mainstream historians had underestimated and misunderstood its influence, died Nov. 27 at his home in Washington. He was 73.
The cause was hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, said a friend, Bruce Rich.
Dr. Ribuffo, a professor at George Washington University, was widely known among academic historians for his 1983 book, "The Old Christian Right: The Protestant Far Right From the Great Depression to the Cold War." It won the Merle Curti Award from the Organization of American Historians for the best book of the year in American social or intellectual history.
Writing in the New York Times in 2017, historian and journalist Rick Perlstein called Dr. Ribuffo foremost among a handful of historians to counter long-prevailing views in academia about the far right and its appeal.
"Irascible, brilliant and deeply learned," Perlstein wrote, "Ribuffo argued that America's anti-liberal traditions were far more deeply rooted in the past, and far angrier than most historians would acknowledge, citing a long list of examples from 'regional suspicions of various metropolitan centers and the snobs who lived there' to 'white racism institutionalized in slavery and segregation.' "
Dr. Ribuffo, wrote Perlstein, avoided the "psychologizing condescension" of describing far-right groups as "paranoid," which was popularized in academic circles by Columbia University professor Richard Hofstadter in the 1950s and 1960s.
He told Perlstein that, after Donald Trump's election in 2016, he would have written a response to disbelieving fellow citizens called "Why Is There So Much Scholarship on Conservatism and Why Has It Left the Historical Profession So Obtuse About Trumpism?"
Elizabeth Tandy Shermer, an associate history professor at Loyola University at Chicago, wrote in an online essay for the Society for U.S. Intellectual History that Dr. Ribuffo "never relegated . . . the Far Right to a paranoid few. He instead showed their ideas and organizational initiatives to be pivotal to understanding the entirety of American politics.
Leo Paul Ribuffo, whose father was a school janitor, was born in Paterson, N.J., on Sept. 23, 1945. He graduated from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., in 1966 and received a master's degree in 1969 and a doctorate in 1976, both in history, from Yale University. He joined the George Washington University faculty in 1973.
"The Old Christian Right" grew out his doctoral thesis. The book focused on three agitators of the 1930s and the 1940s, William Dudley Pelley of the fascist underground Silver Legion, Gerald B. Winrod of the pro-Nazi Defenders of the Christian Faith and Gerald L.K. Smith, a clergyman who ran for president on the America First Party ticket. All three publicly acknowledged their racial bigotry and anti-Semitism.
At his death, Dr. Ribuffo was working on a social and cultural study of Jimmy Carter's presidency. The planned book "is not in obvious ways related to 'The Old Christian Right,' " Dr. Ribuffo told the reference guide Contemporary Authors. "But, as a historian, I must acknowledge continuity as well as change. My knowledge of religion, acquired while writing my first book, will help me to understand Jimmy Carter, the most devout Protestant president since William McKinley."

Race shouldn’t matter, but it does

Texto completo: A member of Congress, in an interview with The New York Times, demands to know when the term “white supremacist” became offensive.
In the sports world, the NFL season winds down with eight coaches losing their jobs, five of whom are black, leaving a league dominated by black athletes with only two black head coaches.
Close to home, the incoming Florida governor suspends the Broward County sheriff for his office’s response during the Parkland shootings and replaces him with the county’s first black sheriff, a man who once was a walk-on football player at Florida State.
It is within this head-spinning and emotionally charged time of race relations — one step forward, two steps backward — that the Dolphins are preparing to name New England Patriots assistant Brian Flores as their head coach.
Excluding interim coaches, Flores, 37, will become the Dolphins’ first head coach who is black, working alongside Chris Grier, the league’s only general manager who is black.
Having already ventured into treacherous territory, there’s no turning back. So I won’t.
What I also won’t do is applaud or pan this hire on either level — in a football or
social sense — because to do the former is laughably pretentious and premature. To do the latter comes across as either pandering or as racist as that delirious lawmaker in Washington.
Can he coach?
That’s really all that matters, and neither you nor I nor Grier nor Ross can answer that one until roughly 2022.
Devoid of any hard evidence on the subject — Flores has, after all, a 0-0 record as an NFL head coach — it would be naive in the current social climate to contend skin color won’t be a concern for some, at least until Flores can prove it shouldn’t be.
Flores is, for those who must know, the son of Honduran immigrants who grew up in Brooklyn’s projects. He thus might identify himself more Afro-Latino than African-American, if any label need be attached at all.
Besides accepting a job in the South, in a red state, he’s joining the NFL team that has confronted racial issues perhaps more than any other, starting of course with seven players who at various times over the past three seasons protested social injustice during the national anthem. They include three men on the current roster.
At least publicly, there was no subject former coach Adam Gase cared to entertain less. Behind closed doors, perhaps the dynamics of such player-coach discussions might now take a different overtone.
It goes higher than that. Remember RISE? That’s the Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality, a nonprofit the owner launched in 2015 to promote equality following the infamous Bullygate scandal involving Richie Incognito, who is white, and Jonathan Martin, who is not.
Unless proven otherwise, I prefer to believe Ross and Grier selected Flores for skill, not show, a sentence that in and of itself is certain to inspire a certain segment of the population to spew venom in the “comments” section online. Just the other day, Joe Schad, my colleague on the Dolphins beat, received a text from a fan complaining about how Grier will “turn the whole team black.” Since the fan proudly declared himself a racist, Joe tweeted out the text, digitally ripping off the man’s hood by including his name in the tweet. I applauded Joe for that. This same fan has repeatedly written me complaining why the Dolphins have it in for Tim Tebow, the obvious solution to all their quarterbacking woes.
Welcome to Miami, Brian.
Me? I remember covering a Super Bowl between the Indianapolis Colts and Chicago Bears at what is now Hard Rock Stadium. Historic, that was, featuring Tony Dungy vs. Lovie Smith. It was the first Super Bowl matchup of two black head coaches, and since by then we’d moved on from the question of whether black men could play quarterback, it surely was the last racial hurdle the NFL would have to confront, right?
That was a dozen years ago, and here we are, with NFL owners just recently having to put more teeth in the Rooney Rule so that minority candidates might get a fair shake for head coaching and other front-office roles. The 16-year-old rule was modified to say at least one minority candidate must come from outside the organization or be on a list compiled by the NFL’s advisory board.
“Don’t say that there aren’t any blacks who aren’t qualified,” Dungy said. “Just say that there are no owners who want to hire a black as head coach. Don’t say it’s not the right time or the right place.”
That quote is courtesy of a Washington Post story from 1985, as black coaches were waiting to break through and owners such as the Cleveland Browns’ Art Modell was blindly insisting, “There have been strides made.”
In Miami, actually, that was true. A few long-forgotten gems from Dolphins history involve the climate under which Don Shula stepped into in 1970. It was the year of the merger in more ways than one. Dolphins who once showered and dressed in separate areas of the locker room, according to the color of their skin, were immediately integrated. Quarterback Bob Griese’s roommate on the road became receiver Paul Warfield. Shula saw to it that the locker room was supplied with black hair-care products.
Before players knew what to expect from the new coach, running back Mercury Morris made some sort of reference about race, to which Shula shot back, “Hey, you know I’m not like that.”
Just like that, aqua and orange were the only colors that mattered.
And look where it got that team.

Carl Bernstein: Draft of Mueller's final report says Trump helped Putin 'destabilize' the US

Texto completo: Veteran investigative journalist Carl Bernstein called it first.

Days before bombshell reports that an FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether President Trump has acted as a Russian asset, Bernstein told a CNN panel that he believed that one of the questions special counsel Robert Mueller was trying to answer was whether any obstruction by the president furthered the interests of the Russians.

Now the reporter of Watergate fame is indiacting that he knows where the Mueller investigation is going to end up, and it's not looking good for Trump.

"You teed up the point that the Washington Post and Times are now making," CNN's media reporter Brian Stelter told Bernstein on Sunday's episode of "Reliable Sources" before airing the clip from Wednesday.

"Bingo. You said the obstruction is not separate from the collusion question," Stelter added after. "These investigations are linked. These exactly what these newspapers are signaling this weekend."

On Friday, the New York Times reported that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey in the spring of 2017. The counterintelligence inquiry was wrapped into the FBI's broader Russia investigation, which special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to lead after Comey's ouster. In a follow-up, the Washington Post reported the president took steps to try to protect his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, including pressuring a translator to withhold information on discussions between the two leaders from administration officials.

Bernstein was asked how he knew ahead of time.

"First of all, the New York Times and the Washington Post were more advanced on this story than I was," he began. "But I did know something."

He said Trump's "lies" are all about Russia and suggested lawyers working with the White House told him they believe he hasn't told the truth on a number of matters related to Russia.

"Part of what I know comes from lawyers of some of the other defendants in this matter who have appeared before Mueller, including members of the joint defense team which collaborates with the White House and those lawyers believe the president has been lying at every turn about his relationship with Russia, about those of his aides," Bernstein said. "Look, let us look at all of the lies, follow the money, follow the lies. They are all mostly and most vehemently about Russia. Whether we are talking about [Michael] Flynn, Trump, his son, [Jared] Kushner, back to lying about questions having to do with Russia, about what happened at the Trump Tower meeting. The president of the United States drafts a totally false statement about what happened at that meeting that his son was at."

Bernstein also said he has been told that the draft of Mueller's final report shows Trump helped Putin "destabilize" the U.S.

"Look, Trump keeps going back to the idea we need better relations with Russia. Could be. He could well be right," Bernstein said. "But from a point of view of strength and what everybody can see is that he has not acted with Russia from the United States having a strength advantage with Russia. Rather he has done what appears to be Putin’s goals. He has helped Putin destabilize the United States and interfere in the election, no matter whether it was purposeful or not, and that is part of what the draft of Mueller’s report, I’m told, is to be about.”

Trump's top spokeswoman, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, called the Times report "absurd." Asked about whether he has ever worked for the Russians during an interview with Fox News' Jeanine Pirro late Saturday, Trump said it was "The most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked."

Bernstein, best known for his investigative reporting that shed light on the Watergate scandal leading to former President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974, suggested that not even Nixon lied as much as Trump does. "Nixon lied to further the cover-up -- he was a criminal president, but throughout his presidency Nixon did not lie about virtually everything of importance ... we have a president of the United States who lies," he said.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

In this Cleveland hall, classical music is king; In a city renowned for rock, a grand symphonic venue

Texto completo: CLEVELAND - Above, the ceiling was done up in silver, beige and blue like frosting on a wedding cake. Below, at the lip of the stage, a tall man in a black suit and white bow tie leaned forward with a tip.
"This is going to be something," said Mark Jackobs, one of the Cleveland Orchestra's viola players. "This is a freight train."
Jackobs, who has played in the room for 25 years, knew just how the sound would flood Severance Hall, one of North America's most admired classical music venues.
This was my first concert in the hall, so I had plenty of questions. But before I could ask more, the lights dimmed in the 1,920-seat auditorium, and we rushed to our seats.
Conductor Franz Welser-Most raised his baton. A hundred musicians, including Jackobs, snapped to attention. The train, also known as Prokofiev's Symphony No. 3, was leaving the station.
Inside the hall
When the orchestra's leaders launched the campaign to build Severance Hall in 1928, Cleveland was on a roll. As America built skyscrapers, Cleveland's steel mills were shipping vast tonnage on Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River.
The city's population was about to hit 900,000. The orchestra, founded in 1918, had already played New York, made its recording debut and started on the path to worldwide acclaim.
Since then, Cleveland has shrunk, suffered and been smirked at like few other American cities. But it also has reinvented itself and begun to bloom again.
As I explored the auditorium and roamed the city for four days in September, I was amazed that in the middle of a city so changed, the orchestra and its hall have never stopped doing what they set out to do.
A day before I heard the orchestra, Andria Hoy, its archivist, gave me a tour of the hall, which didn't quicken my pulse right away. In fact, if architecture is frozen music, Severance Hall's Georgian neoclassical exterior is "Pomp and Circumstance" at 23 beats a minute.
But inside, it's "Rhapsody in Blue" meets "King Tut." Once you step into the grand foyer, you're swallowed by a mashup of art deco swoops and Egyptian Revival details.
It was 1928, Hoy told me, when philanthropists John and Elisabeth Severance pledged $1 million for a project to be designed by Walker & Weeks, a local architecture firm. Then Elisabeth died at the family winter home in California, followed by the stock market crash in late 1929.
Yet John didn't hesitate. Construction began a month after the crash, and he took every opportunity to stamp the concert hall with Elisabeth's personality, ultimately spending more than $2 million in Great Depression dollars, about $29 million today. It opened in 1931.
The intricate, lacelike aluminum leaf pattern on the ceiling is said to match Elisabeth's wedding dress.
"He really turned this building into a memorial to her, which is where a lot of the opulence comes from," Hoy told me.
The grand foyer, a double-height oval space outfitted with marble from Italy and Indiana, is surrounded by two dozen columns, a series of Egyptian Revival murals and two sets of stately stairs.
As for Cleveland's orchestra, the musicians never relinquished the reputation that spread globally under the exacting George Szell, music director from 1946 to 1970.
New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles may be bigger cities, but in January last year a New York Times headline proclaimed that "At 100, the Cleveland Orchestra May (Quietly) Be America's Best." (A later article in October noted that the orchestra had fired its concertmaster and principal trombonist for sexual misconduct and harassment.)
Bela Bartok, Leonard Bernstein, Benny Goodman, Wynton Marsalis, Yehudi Menuhin, Leontyne Price, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Mstislav Rostropovich - all have stood on the Severance Hall stage.
It remains the orchestra's home for about 100 performances a year in fall, winter and spring. (Concerts move to the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls in the summer.) The hall also hosts graduations, weddings, Cleveland Pops Orchestra concerts and other events.
The legacy
On concert night, I arrived early so I could start with a meal at Severance, the venue's fine-dining restaurant. Solicitous service, tasty sea bass special. Good omens.
The music began with Prokofiev's Symphony No. 1, a sprightly, sunny work despite being composed while Russia and the rest of Europe were a mess. I'm no music critic, but it sounded seamless and precise to me, and the rest of the room seemed to agree.
The hall was about two-thirds occupied, the crowd mostly 50 and older and white, although one or two sections were dominated by students. Eager to woo young and varied listeners, the orchestra offers free admission to those 18 and younger for many performances.
The next piece was Bartok's Piano Concerto No. 2 from 1931 - a challenging, dense work featuring ferocious guest pianist Yefim Bronfman. In one passage he seemed to conjure the sound of mist rising from a pond. In another, Bronfman played with such force and speed that his whole body shuddered.
After intermission was the sonic assault that Jackobs had warned me about, Prokofiev's Symphony No. 3, composed in 1928.
Before beginning, Welser-Most addressed the audience, suggesting that Sigmund Freud must have influenced this piece. He also asked us "to listen for not just the melody but what is happening underneath."
Then, from the first note: shrieking strings and brass, booming timpani, curious three-note clusters ascending and descending - a beginning as dark and alarming as the night's first Prokofiev piece had been bright and frisky.
From there, things calmed a bit, with plenty of delicate passages. I could relax and look around a little. But this is a symphony that began its life as an opera about demonic possession, so chaos was bound to return.
At the close of the fourth movement, Prokofiev dispatched us with a pair of booming, dissonant full-orchestra chords. Utter doom, under a twinkling aluminum ceiling.
At Cleveland's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the amps are turned to 11 to get effects like this. In Severance Hall, they do it without amplifiers, in a suit and bow tie, just as they have for 87 years.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Saturday angrily rejected a New York Times report that said the FBI opened an investigation in 2017 to determine whether he worked, knowingly or unknowingly, on behalf of Russia.
The report said that in the days after Trump fired Comey as FBI director in May 2017, the agency began investigating whether the president had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests.
The newspaper cited unidentified law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
U.S. counterintelligence investigators attempted to assess whether Trump's actions constituted a possible threat to national security, and agents also tried to determine whether Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unknowingly come under Moscow's influence, the Times reported.
Trump has repeatedly denounced the FBI and Justice Department.
"The corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!" the president tweeted. "My firing of James B. Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop."
The president also criticized familiar targets including special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Trump concluded Saturday by asserting that he'd been tougher on Russia than former U.S. presidents.
S. Korea balks at Trump's push over more funds for U.S. troops
WASHINGTON - South Korea is resisting a Trump administration demand for sharply higher payments to defray the cost of basing U.S. forces on its territory, raising fears that President Donald Trump might threaten a troop drawdown at a time of sensitive diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula.
U.S. negotiators have sought a 50 percent increase in Seoul's annual payment, which last year was about $830 million, or about half of the estimated cost of hosting 28,500 U.S. troops, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions.
South Korea is expected to make a counteroffer this month.
The standoff is straining the alliance as Trump plans a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to renew the U.S. push for elimination of Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal.
Former Obama housing chief Castro enters 2020 campaign
SAN ANTONIO - Assailing President Donald Trump for "a crisis of leadership," former Obama Cabinet member Julian Castro joined the 2020 presidential race Saturday as a rush of Democrats accelerates.
Castro, 44, could end up being the only Latino in a crowded Democratic field. He was San Antonio's mayor for five year and U.S. housing secretary in President Barack Obama's second term. He became the second Democrat to formally enter the race, after former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have formed exploratory committees. Casto's first trip as a candidate comes Monday to Puerto Rico, where an outcry has begun as the White House considers diverting disaster funding to pay for a border wall.
U.S. calls for the formation of new government in Venezuela
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates - The U.S. stepped up its criticism of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday with an explicit call for the formation of a new government in the South American country.
The State Department said in a statement that it stood behind the head of Venezuela's opposition-run congress, Juan Guaido, who said Friday that he was prepared to step into the presidency temporarily. The statement was the latest in a series of Trump administration attacks on Maduro, whose inauguration to a new term as president Thursday has been widely denounced as illegitimate.
"The people of Venezuela deserve to live in freedom in a democratic society governed by the rule of law," State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said.
Pompeo upbeat on deal with Turkey over Kurds
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates - Despite Turkey's vows to the contrary, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday he was confident the two nations can agree on a way to protect U.S.-allied Kurdish rebels in Syria after American troops withdraw from the country.
After speaking to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Pompeo said an agreement was a work in progress but can be achieved in a way that allows the Turks to defend their country while leaving alone Kurds who do not pose a threat.
The top U.S. diplomat said he was "optimistic" that Kurds who fought alongside U.S. forces against the Islamic State group in Syria are not threatened by pledges from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to launch military operations against what he terms Kurdish "terrorists."
Hamas probe: Israel tried to wiretap group in Gaza Strip
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip - Gaza's ruling Hamas said Saturday that Israeli undercover forces had attempted to install equipment to monitor the Islamic militant group's landline communications network during a botched mission in November.
The findings of an investigation were announced by the Hamas military wing, Qassam Brigades, in a prerecorded TV statement.
Hamas presented surveillance footage and photos to back up its claims.
Hamas thwarted an attempt to "plant spying devices in the Gaza Strip," a Qassam spokesman said in the statement.
Israel's military has not released details about the operation, which went awry Nov. 11, leading to the heaviest round of cross-border fire, including Hamas rockets and Israeli airstrikes, since a 2014 war between the two sides.
Still missing: Police arrested 12 people alleged to have been involved in the kidnapping of an American in Costa Rica. Police say a joint operation caught nine Costa Rican suspects Friday; three others were arrested in Spain. William Sean Creighton Kopko was abducted Sept. 24, 2018, in Costa Rica. He is still missing.
In Congo: Presidential runner-up Martin Fayulu has asked a constitutional court to order a recount. He has accused the winner, Felix Tshisekedi, of a deal with President Joseph Kabila. An official said Fayulu has two options: accept the vote or it is annulled, which would keep Kabila in power until another election.

In this Cleveland hall, classical music is king; In a city renowned for rock, a grand symphonic venue

Texto completo: CLEVELAND - Above, the ceiling was done up in silver, beige and blue like frosting on a wedding cake. Below, at the lip of the stage, a tall man in a black suit and white bow tie leaned forward with a tip.
"This is going to be something," said Mark Jackobs, one of the Cleveland Orchestra's viola players. "This is a freight train."
Jackobs, who has played in the room for 25 years, knew just how the sound would flood Severance Hall, one of North America's most admired classical music venues.
This was my first concert in the hall, so I had plenty of questions. But before I could ask more, the lights dimmed in the 1,920-seat auditorium, and we rushed to our seats.
Conductor Franz Welser-Most raised his baton. A hundred musicians, including Jackobs, snapped to attention. The train, also known as Prokofiev's Symphony No. 3, was leaving the station.
Inside the hall
When the orchestra's leaders launched the campaign to build Severance Hall in 1928, Cleveland was on a roll. As America built skyscrapers, Cleveland's steel mills were shipping vast tonnage on Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River.
The city's population was about to hit 900,000. The orchestra, founded in 1918, had already played New York, made its recording debut and started on the path to worldwide acclaim.
Since then, Cleveland has shrunk, suffered and been smirked at like few other American cities. But it also has reinvented itself and begun to bloom again.
As I explored the auditorium and roamed the city for four days in September, I was amazed that in the middle of a city so changed, the orchestra and its hall have never stopped doing what they set out to do.
A day before I heard the orchestra, Andria Hoy, its archivist, gave me a tour of the hall, which didn't quicken my pulse right away. In fact, if architecture is frozen music, Severance Hall's Georgian neoclassical exterior is "Pomp and Circumstance" at 23 beats a minute.
But inside, it's "Rhapsody in Blue" meets "King Tut." Once you step into the grand foyer, you're swallowed by a mashup of art deco swoops and Egyptian Revival details.
It was 1928, Hoy told me, when philanthropists John and Elisabeth Severance pledged $1 million for a project to be designed by Walker & Weeks, a local architecture firm. Then Elisabeth died at the family winter home in California, followed by the stock market crash in late 1929.
Yet John didn't hesitate. Construction began a month after the crash, and he took every opportunity to stamp the concert hall with Elisabeth's personality, ultimately spending more than $2 million in Great Depression dollars, about $29 million today. It opened in 1931.
The intricate, lacelike aluminum leaf pattern on the ceiling is said to match Elisabeth's wedding dress.
"He really turned this building into a memorial to her, which is where a lot of the opulence comes from," Hoy told me.
The grand foyer, a double-height oval space outfitted with marble from Italy and Indiana, is surrounded by two dozen columns, a series of Egyptian Revival murals and two sets of stately stairs.
As for Cleveland's orchestra, the musicians never relinquished the reputation that spread globally under the exacting George Szell, music director from 1946 to 1970.
New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles may be bigger cities, but in January last year a New York Times headline proclaimed that "At 100, the Cleveland Orchestra May (Quietly) Be America's Best." (A later article in October noted that the orchestra had fired its concertmaster and principal trombonist for sexual misconduct and harassment.)
Bela Bartok, Leonard Bernstein, Benny Goodman, Wynton Marsalis, Yehudi Menuhin, Leontyne Price, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Mstislav Rostropovich - all have stood on the Severance Hall stage.
It remains the orchestra's home for about 100 performances a year in fall, winter and spring. (Concerts move to the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls in the summer.) The hall also hosts graduations, weddings, Cleveland Pops Orchestra concerts and other events.
The legacy
On concert night, I arrived early so I could start with a meal at Severance, the venue's fine-dining restaurant. Solicitous service, tasty sea bass special. Good omens.
The music began with Prokofiev's Symphony No. 1, a sprightly, sunny work despite being composed while Russia and the rest of Europe were a mess. I'm no music critic, but it sounded seamless and precise to me, and the rest of the room seemed to agree.
The hall was about two-thirds occupied, the crowd mostly 50 and older and white, although one or two sections were dominated by students. Eager to woo young and varied listeners, the orchestra offers free admission to those 18 and younger for many performances.
The next piece was Bartok's Piano Concerto No. 2 from 1931 - a challenging, dense work featuring ferocious guest pianist Yefim Bronfman. In one passage he seemed to conjure the sound of mist rising from a pond. In another, Bronfman played with such force and speed that his whole body shuddered.
After intermission was the sonic assault that Jackobs had warned me about, Prokofiev's Symphony No. 3, composed in 1928.
Before beginning, Welser-Most addressed the audience, suggesting that Sigmund Freud must have influenced this piece. He also asked us "to listen for not just the melody but what is happening underneath."
Then, from the first note: shrieking strings and brass, booming timpani, curious three-note clusters ascending and descending - a beginning as dark and alarming as the night's first Prokofiev piece had been bright and frisky.
From there, things calmed a bit, with plenty of delicate passages. I could relax and look around a little. But this is a symphony that began its life as an opera about demonic possession, so chaos was bound to return.
At the close of the fourth movement, Prokofiev dispatched us with a pair of booming, dissonant full-orchestra chords. Utter doom, under a twinkling aluminum ceiling.

Who is Michael Cohen's father-in-law? Trump says he should be investigated

Texto completo: President Trump invoked a different figure Saturday when talking about the ongoing Russia investigation: his former attorney Michael Cohen's father-in-law.

In order for Cohen to get his sentence reduced, he thought "I have an idea, I'll give you some information on the president. Well, there is no information," Trump said during his more than 20-minute, often rambling call to Fox News' Jeanine Pirro on Saturday night. "He should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at."

Cohen, Trump's longtime personal attorney, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in November and to eight counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud in August, in part related to hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal over their alleged affairs with Trump. Cohen has been cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, despite once saying he would take a bullet for the president.

When Pirro asked the name of Cohen's father-in-law, Trump came up empty-handed.

"I don't know, but you'll find out, and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there," he said, an unusual statement by a president regarding a private citizen.

Cohen's father-in-law Fima Shusterman reportedly loaned millions to a Chicago cab company owner, who was was mentioned in the FBI warrants used to raid Cohen's home and office. In the interview, Trump described the raid as a break-in.

"I was a client. He has a law firm. They broke into his law firm sometime early in the morning," Trump said of Cohen.

Shusterman loaned an estimated $20 million to Yasya Shtayner, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Shtayner, along with her husband Semyon Shtayner, manage more than 350 Chicago cabs, including 20 owned by Cohen.

Trump previously mentioned Cohen's father-in-law, though not by name, in a December tweet.

Shusterman, who pleaded guilty to income tax fraud in 1993, owns a condo in Trump World Tower in New York. He and Shtayner both own condos outside Miami in another Trump development, which Shtayner used as the collateral for the loans from Shusterman.

"He's on trouble on some loans and fraud and taxi cabs and stuff that I know nothing about," Trump said of Cohen in the interview.

Trump, who responded to a New York Times report revealing an FBI counterintelligence investigation into him after his firing of former FBI director James Comey and a Washington Post report saying he concealed details of his interactions with Russia President Vladimir Putin, maintained the investigation is a "hoax" or "witch hunt."

"Here's the bottom line, there was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no anything," he said.

LAUSD teachers went on strike in 1989. But are the stakes higher in 2019?

Texto completo: Whether they were stuck in an auditorium or playing long-term hooky, many a school kid old enough to remember the 1989 Los Angeles teachers strike recalls the period as nine days of good old-fashioned lawlessness.
Quoted in a New York Times article at the time, LAPD Lieut. Frank Valdez expressed his concern about “little predators” roaming LA’s downtown streets. “The problem kids are not going to go to school and it’s going to create problems all over, not just on campus,” he said during the strike.
Jamie Todd Rubin, an 11th-grader at Cleveland High School at the time, wistfully remembers weekday ventures to the beach, Valley bowling alleys and movie theatres while his teachers fought for better pay as his personal “golden age.”
Triumphantly, he recalled that “teachers ended up getting what they were looking for too.” In many respects, they did.
By all accounts, teachers succeeded in gleaning higher wages, more administrative control and greater stature for their union from the Los Angeles Unified School District after thousands walked off the job in the spring of 1989.
It was the second teachers strike since the founding of United Teachers Los Angeles in 1970, ushering angst into the city and turmoil to the nation’s second largest school system.
In 1989, the major win for teachers after the walkout that lasted nine days was getting school-based management and shared decision-making into a contract. Around 80 percent of members participated in the strike, and half of LAUSD K-12 students stayed home.

As an army of 30,000 teachers stand ready to form new picket lines on Monday, their demands ring markedly familiar: higher pay, relief from ballooning class sizes, and more nurses, librarians and counselors trained to address the medical and psychological needs of today’s students.
Has much really changed?
Former UTLA President John Perez, who was on the picket lines both as a teacher in 1970, said it this way:
“To be perfectly honest, very little has changed. In 1970 we felt disrespected. In 1989 we felt disrespected. And in 2018 teachers feel disrespected.”
Undercurrents of teacher empowerment were also at the crux of the 1970 strike, UTLA’s first, when around half of the young union’s members went off the job for nearly five weeks.
Then, as now, district officials threatened that acceding to their calls for salary increases would spell financial ruin.
Parallels between ’89 and today run as deep as rhetorical strategy, like the union’s relentless critiques of LA Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner.
“Oh yeah it was a big war in ’89 and the union made superintendent [Leonard] Britton the bad guy,” Perez said. Picketing teachers wore buttons with his face over a lemon, or with a slash over his face. “We called him Lenny the lemon.”
Some have argued all this recurrence is evidence that the lasting effects of earlier strikes have been mixed at best, and that securing lasting public funding for education has proven elusive over the decades.
Former LAUSD elementary school teacher Michael Romo lamented the lack of progress since 1989.
“Back in my day we had nurses, smaller class sizes and maybe even better stocked libraries,” said Romo, director of the California Teachers Association in Burbank and Glendale.
He went on strike in 1989, his first year of bilingual teaching at Norwood Street Elementary School. “For 30 years to come back to the same issue, it’s like we’ve made no progress.”
Of course, things do change in 30 years. Along with overarching economic differences and a friendlier face in the governor’s mansion, a key factor in this looming walkout that appears to have been absent from previous strikes is competing visions for the future of public education.
UCLA Professor John Rogers, director of the university’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, interpreted the current impasse between the district and the union as a reflection of opposite reactions LAUSD’s current financial and enrollment woes.
“The district is thinking about how they can contain costs and deal with a growing charter school sector by devolving the district over time as a portfolio of schools,” he said. “While teachers think the way forward is to more broadly improve the quality of its own educational program, only sometimes acknowledging how much spending that requires.”
The emergence of charter schools in Los Angeles, which are privately managed but publicly funded, have been central to the standoff between district and union leadership.
Perez seems to think this is uncharted territory, particularly what he said was superintendent Beutner’s goals to break up and “privatize” the a time-honored and democratic institution like L.A. Unified.
“The existential threat to public education as we know it is real. That wasn’t there in 1989,” he said. The district’s financial woes this time around also have some experts worried about a state takeover.
“My understanding is after the strike it will appear to be a win for teachers and then the layoffs will come soon after,” said UCLA Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies Pedro Noguera.
Noting LA County’s recent appointment of a fiscal team to the district, he said “That’s my fear, that they’re at risk of being taken over.”
Carmen Romero, special education teacher at South Gate High School, remembers those long days in auditoriums, in the gym and on the football field as a 10th-grader at Bell High School during the 1989 strike.
“We didn’t feel valued as students,” she said about the nine days of boredom. More of a rule-follower, she was on campus every day of the strike.
“But it made me appreciate school more, and feel like I deserve things like desks and respect.” Now that she’s gearing up to get on the picket line as a teacher, “It’s the same feeling.”

Texto completo: Has legal pot ushered in a more violent era in Washington?
This is the possibility put forth in a new book and New Yorker article that used our state's recent rise in the rate of murder and aggravated assault to hint at potential links between violent behavior and marijuana use.
The New Yorker piece was written by Malcolm Gladwell - the popular science writer and lightning rod who frequently draws criticism for elevating the hints and possibilities of scientific research into absolute natural laws. It was based in part on a new book by former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, "Tell Your Children."
"Between 2013 and 2017, the state's murder and aggravated assault rates rose forty per cent - twice the national homicide increase and four times the national aggravated assault increase," Gladwell writes.
"We don't know that an increase in cannabis use was responsible for that surge in violence. Berenson, though, finds it strange that, at a time when Washington may have exposed its population to higher levels of what is widely assumed to be a calming substance, its citizens began turning on one another with increased aggression."
Talk about your drive-by caveat. That "we don't know" deserves a whole lot more weight. Maybe all the weight. Because, while there have been increases in violent crime here in recent years, there is not yet any reason to draw a connection to legal weed.
Further, the statistics on violent crime in Washington - as reported by local law enforcement agencies to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program - simply do not align with Gladwell's assertions.
Washington's murder rate has long been well below the national average. If you look at a chart over the past 20 years, what you see is a wave bumping up and down between 2.3 and 3.3 murders per 100,000 people.
In the years Gladwell cites, our murder rate increased by a margin of 0.8 murders per 100,000 residents, to an overall rate of 3.1, according to UCR-based Crime Data Explorer online.
That's a 35 percent increase.
The national murder rate rose in those years by a margin of 0.8 murders per 100,000 residents, to an overall rate of 5.3.
That's an 18 percent increase.
Must be the marijuana.
Meanwhile, aggravated assaults have followed the same pattern here that they have nationally - rising slightly in recent years after long, steady decline. The national rate rose by a margin of 19.3 per 100,000 between 2013 and 2017; Washington's rose by 17.9 per 100,000.
Again, because Washington has long had a significantly lower crime rate to begin with, the percentage change is higher here - 11 percent in Washington, compared to 8 percent nationally.
That's a pretty sharp discrepancy with Gladwell's characterization of 40 percent increases that are four times larger than the national rise. In an email, Berenson said that he used the same figures and percentage increases in his book that I'm using here; he said he wasn't sure why Gladwell reported larger increases. I tried to contact Gladwell via social media Thursday without immediate success.
Berenson's book argues, as does Gladwell's article, that we need to know more about potential links between mental illness, violence and marijuana use, and lays out some of the suggestive case that such links are plausible. They also argue that we have - in our widespread cultural acceptance of marijuana as essentially harmless - failed to take potential problems seriously.
All of which may well be true. But dragooning Washington's murder rate into the argument is pulling a Stretch Armstrong on the facts, twisting correlation into causation. Changes in crime rates are complex and difficult to explain simply, and this particular explanation is, at this point at least, far too simple.
One might just as easily select another set of statistics to prove the opposite point: The overall rate of violent crime in Washington state - including all crimes against people, and not just murder and aggravated assault - increased 5 percent between 2013 and 2017, compared to 7 percent nationwide.
In other words, since marijuana was legalized, violent crime across the nation has risen 40 percent more than violent crime in Washington state.
Should we credit marijuana?

Texto completo: Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyo., the No. 3-ranking House Republican, on Thursday took aim at Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, over published remarks in which he wondered when terms like “white supremicist” became offensive.

“These comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse,” Cheney said in a tweet Thursday afternoon.

The latest King remarks came in an interview with The New York Times, in which he claimed not to be racist.

“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King told the outlet. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”

On Wednesday Randy Feenstra, an Iowa state senator, announced a primary challenge to King, saying the incumbent lacks influence in Washington due to his outrageous comments.

Texto completo: Sandra Bullock is leading the terror to Netflix, donning a blindfold for the dystopian survival drama "Bird Box" that began streaming Friday. How did the thriller go down with critics?
Pretty mixed, falling to the negative side, for director Susanne Bier's effort that has a 65% positive critical score on the review site RottenTomatoes. com.
Here are the most revealing critical comments for "Bird Box," which also stars Sarah Paulson and John Malkovich.
The New York Times' Aisha Harris called the movie "riveting. sometimes. "
"Too often 'Bird Box' walks right up to the edge of pure suspense and disappoints," Harris wrote. "The squelching of promise is not my worst (cinematic) fear, per se. But it’s still disappointing. "
New York Magazine/Vulture's Emily Yoshida lost the plot watching the drama.
"Perhaps 'Bird Box' will work for someone less burnt out on the contemporary glut of post-apocalyptic survival narratives," Yoshida wrote. "But I care as much about the people who ran around in its fiction now as I did before I watched them for two hours, which is to say, not at all. "
Variety's Peter Debruge says the filmmakers "have served up an inexplicably bland ensemble that even a talented cast can’t render interesting. "
The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy called the film "a wannabe shocker with a clever premise that doesn't really get down and dirty" and is "not all that it might have been. " He deemed the project "deep-dish popular material that feels shortchanged in terms of suspense, scares and thrills. "
Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson called Bullock "brilliant" in the "bad B-movie. " He then backed into a recommendation of sorts: "All that said, given that it's on Netflix and won't cost subscribers any more than they've already paid for the service, I can't really say that 'Bird Box' isn't worth a look. "
In another review that damns "Bird Box" with faint praise, Los Angeles Times' critic Justin Chang wrote:
"The scares keep getting more and more desperate, cranking up the volume with gale-force winds and eerie voices, en route to an ending that’s silly verging on offensive. . . You’ve seen this all many times before, which doesn’t mean you’ll mind seeing it again. "
The Guardian's Amy Nicholson went there with the pun, calling it "a bird-brained mess. "
"(The movie's) pieces feel forcibly screwed together, a movie marionetted by strings of data code," wrote Nicholson. "There’s good scenes and smart ideas, but overall, the movie mostly clomps. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: No one in Vernessa Perez's small family could understand the behavior she began to exhibit as a teenager.
In high school, she began feeling overwhelmed and uninterested in her studies. After dropping out, she began withdrawing from other parts of life. Her days were spent inside, in solitude.
"You want to get away from everyone," Ms. Perez, now 30, said of her mental state at the time. "You want to be in a hole by yourself. You don't want to bring out ideas or brighten up everyone. You just want to stay in a corner."
She said she knew something was deeply wrong, but denial was easier than trying to comprehend the unknown specter of depression. Amid her loneliness, her mother, the lone caregiver in the home, worked long stretches as a home health aide to provide for her children, a job with a salary that barely covered rent. The family moved frequently.
Ms. Perez, who immigrated to the United States from Trinidad at age 9, lived with family and her friends on and off. When she was 18, her instability grew more severe. Ms. Perez stopped grooming herself. Then she stopped eating.
Her mother admitted her to Kingsboro Psychiatric Center, where she was placed on a feeding tube because she had lost a significant amount of weight. Ms. Perez's mother then moved her into the hospital's Family Care program, a residential service sponsored by the Office of Mental Health.
Family Care places people with serious mental illnesses into homes with people specially trained and certified to provide residential care. Clients also receive training and other support from the program. Ms. Perez spent almost all of her 20s under its care.
"Family Care provides a life for people who aren't documented and don't have anywhere to go, but they have an illness," said Bill Lampert, the employment coordinator at East New York Clubhouse, which helps adults who have mental illnesses.
In 2013, Family Care connected Ms. Perez to the East New York Clubhouse. The support from outside of her family was important to Ms. Perez, who said relatives, some of whom had also immigrated from Trinidad, had a hard time understanding mental illness.
"It's not something we're used to," Ms. Perez said in an interview last month. "It's something new to us. It was new to me, too."
The Clubhouse is run by Brooklyn Community Services, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"We did so many things with her," said Katrina Grant, the Clubhouse's program director. "She's met a lot of goals."
One of Ms. Perez's first goals was to attain her high school equivalency diploma. It took a few years and repeated failures, but Ms. Grant said that Ms. Perez never became discouraged. She succeeded in 2017.
"No matter what trials and tribulations she experienced, she always maintained her positive way of looking at things," Ms. Grant said. "I think that keeps her going."
Another of Ms. Perez's aspirations was qualifying for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, which she also did in 2017. At last, she was able to work in a legitimate capacity. Ms. Perez completed a training program to become a school-bus attendant, with $450 in Neediest Cases Funds used to pay for the Empire State School matron certificate program.
When the school year ended, Ms. Perez got a job at a department store. She has taken a leave to start a family of her own.
In May, she married Kishan Perez, 42, whom she met at a Dunkin' Donuts in 2016. The union allowed Ms. Perez to exit Family Care, and the couple have established their own household in Brooklyn.
On Dec. 4, Ms. Perez gave birth to a daughter, Sarai Sue. An additional $271 in Neediest Funds was used to pay for baby items and gift cards.
Ms. Perez is excited to tackle the challenge of motherhood and has made it a mission to spare her daughter from loneliness and alienation. "I wouldn't want her going through the same things I've gone through," she said.
Her gregarious disposition has endeared Ms. Perez to many at the Clubhouse, fostering a community of support.
"She always looks for the good in everybody. She had an incredible heart," Mr. Lampert said. "That's one of the reasons so many people root for her."

Texto completo: MELBOURNE, Australia -- For the first point she played at a Grand Slam event in six years, Rebecca Marino hit an ace.
She celebrated with a subtle fist pump, determined to have the best next act she could after a lengthy intermission during which she became the face of depression among athletes.
"It's easy to get caught up in the moment, just going from tournament to tournament now," Marino said. "But if I stop and think about it, then that's when I see that it's pretty cool that I was able to do this, and to get this far, from no ranking to suddenly in the qualies of a Slam."
Marino lost, 6-2, 6-2, to Caroline Dolehide on Tuesday in the first round of Australian Open qualifying, limited by a back injury, which curtailed her off-season training. Despite her stiffness, Marino, 28, showed flashes of the power and clean ball-striking that sent her into the upper echelons of tennis seven years ago.
With a percussive forehand and a booming serve that topped out at 120 miles per hour, Marino surged to a high of 38th in the rankings in the summer of 2011, when she was 20. Not a highly touted junior prospect, she had planned to enroll in college before her tennis successes mounted, catapulting her faster and further than she was prepared to handle.
"Not expecting it, I felt like I was thrown into this machine, and I didn't understand how it worked," she said.
Marino stepped back from the sport for the first time in 2012, taking seven months off. After returning for several months, she retired in February 2013 at age 22.
In a conference call announcing her decision, Marino revealed her struggles with depression; days earlier, she had discussed her social media abuse in an interview with The New York Times. Her leaving the sport was often attributed to one of those factors, or both of them, which Marino said was inaccurate in retrospect.
"When I look back, I wouldn't necessarily say it was depression," she said of her decision to stop playing. "It was burnout, and it was expectations put on my shoulders by myself and others, and I just wasn't able to cope. It kind of all came to a head in a big, giant burnout, I guess."
Though her absence was longer than most, Marino is not the only player to have stepped away from the sport because of burnout. Most notably, the top Australian Ash Barty took off nearly two years early in her career. Barty has become a top player in her return, and she defeated No. 1 Simona Halep in Sydney this week.
For Marino, stepping away from tennis made her "able to become superhappy and enjoy my life," she said.
Marino's retirement at 22 generated considerable attention, particularly in her native Canada, where she was one of the brightest tennis prospects in generations.
Her story resonated with others, but she felt uneasy being a touchstone for athletes struggling with depression.
"It wasn't something I was prepared for, and it's still something I'm kind of grappling with," Marino said. "I'm still a really private person, and so for people to come up to me and tell me all of the things they've dealt with, or how I've affected them, it's difficult sometimes, because I don't really know what to say. Even though I'm happy that I've helped people, it can be overwhelming because I'm not professionally trained to help people."
After retiring from tennis, Marino worked one summer for her family's construction business, pouring cement and digging through clay. She later began teaching tennis lessons and enrolled at the University of British Columbia, where she studied English literature. The works she enjoyed most, she said, were ones from the Victorian era that grappled with the effects of industrialization on society.
In her second year, the university's rowing coach recruited her to join the team, knowing her athletic background and her family's extensive history in the sport. (Her uncle George Hungerford was an Olympic gold medalist in 1964.) Rowing improved Marino's fitness and helped expand her sense of identity.
"To have a competitive outlet through a team like that was superfun," she said. "It made me feel like I was a part of the university community. People didn't look at me for my tennis anymore; they just looked at me as a student-athlete."
Marino was shaken in February 2017 when her father, Joe, received a prostate cancer diagnosis.
"After he finished chemo, I kind of took a step back and wanted to look at what was important in my life," she said. "I didn't want to live with any regrets, and I thought that tennis was the one thing in my life that I kind of wish I had a do-over for."
She also wanted her father to see her play again. Marino weighed the idea of a return for months and gained confidence after serving as a hitting partner at a tournament in Vancouver, her hometown, in August 2017.
A week before her next semester was to begin, Marino pulled out of her classes, quit her coaching job and moved to Montreal to begin working toward a full-fledged comeback at Tennis Canada's training center.
After a false start because she did not re-enter tennis's antidoping program in time, Marino returned to the sport at its lowest rung last January, at a series of small tournaments in Turkey. She won her first 19 matches, including her first 30 sets. She worked throughout the year to bring her ranking to its current spot of 216th, which was enough to reach her goal of entering the Australian Open qualifying draw.
Marino plans a long stay in the sport this time, and is working to ensure it is more pleasant and sustainable. She stays in better contact with friends, including more trips home to Vancouver, to help her keep one foot outside the sometimes suffocating tennis bubble.
"My friends don't play tennis, so they don't care if I win or lose," she said. "They're just concerned about how I'm doing as a person, if I'm enjoying myself, and when I'll be back so we can hang out. My whole structure this time around is a little bit different, and I have a lot of things outside of tennis that keep me grounded."
She added: "Previously, I felt like my identity was just 'tennis player.' But now I have many things that form my identity, and I feel like I'm very whole and very balanced."
Marino hopes her triumphs off and on the court gain the same amount of attention as her rough times did. She wants people to see her as a real person instead of a headline.
"I have no doubts in my mind that I'm able to compete and be here," Marino said. "I'm not going to ever go back to that place again because I know who I am now, and I know what I need to do."

Here to Help; How to Start a Running Routine That Lasts

Texto completo: Welcome to the Running newsletter! Every Saturday morning, we email runners with news, advice and some motivation to help you get up and running. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.
It is a new day in a New Year and we are all here for it!
Or, well, at least I am. If I sound a little chipper, it's because I broke into 2019 by crushing a 10K (which ended up being more like 5.6 miles because of a last-minute course change, but still!).
Whether you're an experienced runner ready for a change in the new year or you want to become a runner but don't know where to start, welcome!
Starting a running routine, or getting back to running after a long break, can be daunting. It may feel weird and awkward and you might end up a bit sore afterward.
Here are a few things you can do to get over that initial "what am I doing?" hump and build a running routine that lasts so you too can crush a 5K or 10K next New Year's Day.
1. You don't need a bunch of special stuff.
Really. There are a lot of running products out there -- just ask my inbox, which is full of emails from brands telling me why I should write about their latest $300 doodad. But to start, you don't need any of it. While I think getting properly fitted for running shoes is important as you build your mileage (and buying them can give you an incentive to stick to running), you don't need them for your first few forays out. You might want to ditch the cotton T-shirts for something sweat wicking or even toy with a GPS watch down the road, but you're probably set for right now with what you have.
The comedian Bob Einstein, who died this week, mocked the running gear market back in 1981 when he played a pushy sporting goods salesman in "Modern Romance" (alongside his brother Albert Brooks). In this clip the scene starts at the 55-second mark. It's just as true now as it was then: You don't need all that stuff to start out.
(If and when you decide to buy something, you might look at Wirecutter's reviews of running gear.)
2. Set a realistic goal.
I would like to run a 100K ultramarathon in 2019. That is realistic for me given my past training. It would not be realistic for a new or born-again runner. A 5K is perfect for you if you're one of these runners. It's a challenge, but not one that will eat up your life or put too much stress on your body as it gets used to running.
3. Check out Couch 2 5k.
It's a free, nine-week training program to help people go from no running to that 5K finish line, and then maybe beyond. It's a great way to start.
4. Sign up for your goal race.
I have a hard time getting out the door if I don't have a race on the docket. Fortunately for you, spring is a popular 5K time, so you most likely can find one on a weekend nine weeks out from when you start.
5. Keep track of your training.
You want to be able to look back and see how you've progressed. It'll keep you moving forward. This can be in a spreadsheet, a journal, your calendar or something like Dailymile, which I use, along with a Google Sheet that I share with my coach. While running apps will keep these statistics for you, you'll want to make sure to also record how you feel about each run. This will help you identify what other things affect your training. The log I share with my coach helped me identify that I felt fatigued at a certain point in my menstrual cycle, which is not surprising, but I couldn't identify it until I saw the pattern written out.
6. Brace yourself.
Forming any new routine is difficult, especially such a physical one. It's easier to know that this challenge is going to take some work, so that you can prepare for it (maybe that means scheduling a nap on the weekend, or finding a fellow runner to gripe with when the going gets tough).
7. You haven't failed if it doesn't work.
It just means you get a chance to learn from what didn't go right, and adjust for the future. No one said you must start a running routine on Jan. 1. Your birthday works, or Presidents' Day, or next Saturday. And don't beat yourself up if it takes a few tries. Running is hard. Sticking with it until it's a routine is harder. But I believe in you. I really do.
If you'd like to know more about the science of sticking to a New Year's resolution, I wrote a feature on it last year. It includes a lot of tricks and tips for setting and meeting any kind of goal. And here is a New York Times guide on How to Start Running.
One common fear I hear from new runners is that they're worried they'll finish last in their first race. That's incredibly common -- I worried about it. My mom finished last in her first race ever, and she's now entered in the New York City Marathon drawing (which I'll write more about next week). If you too are worried about being in last place, check out this Runner's World feature about people who finished last, and lived to tell the tale. It's not as bad as you think.
We're also running a 30-Day Well Challenge. Every morning for 30 days, you'll be emailed a daily challenge that will help you build healthy habits, one day at a time. Sign up here.
As always, I'm on Twitter @byjenamiller for your questions or tips you want to offer to the new runners out there.

City Pauses Sign Laws After Flurry of Complaints

Texto completo: The New York City Council voted on Wednesday to institute a two-year moratorium on violations related to store signs and awnings after a mysterious spike in 311 complaints that led to costly penalties for small businesses.
The bill, which Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to sign, would also create an interagency task force to study the issue, waive or return fines for some past violations, and require the city to provide education and training to help small businesses ensure their signs comply with the law.
"Businesses will not have to feel the burden of these unjust fines while we work on comprehensive reform," said Councilman Rafael L. Espinal Jr., the Brooklyn Democrat who sponsored the bill.
Two years ago, businesses in his district, which includes Cypress Hills and East New York, were hit with a wave of sign violations, whose fines start at $6,000. More recently, businesses in Sunset Park, Bensonhurst and other Brooklyn neighborhoods were targeted for inspection.
City records show that many of the inspections were spurred by anonymous 311 calls reporting that shops lacked the special permits required for signs or awnings larger than six square feet. There have been about 2,000 such calls citywide over the last year, more than double the usual number.
The 311 system forwards such complaints to the Department of Buildings, which is required by law to send inspectors to look into the claims.
Laws requiring permits for store signs have been on the books for decades and are intended to ensure public safety. But many small-business owners interviewed by The New York Times were unfamiliar with the rules, or how to navigate the city's bureaucracy to figure them out.
The violations -- sometimes for signs that had been up for decades -- left many small-business owners outraged, and owing thousands of dollars in fines and fees to replace the signs. As word of a crackdown spread, many other store owners took down signs pre-emptively, lending a ghost town feeling to busy commercial corridors.
Store owners and elected officials suspected an orchestrated campaign was behind the calls, which often targeted many businesses on a commercial strip on a single day. Fingers quickly pointed to local sign-hanging businesses, which had the most to gain.
Councilman Espinal endorsed those theories at a news conference on Wednesday, but his office later clarified that he did not know for certain who was behind the calls.
The task force that would be created by the law would investigate the issue. The bill also requires the Department of Buildings to draft a report on the violations for the City Council.
"The safety of New Yorkers is important, but so is balancing the needs of small businesses," Marcy Miranda, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said. "We are reviewing this bill and look forward to working with the City Council on this issue."
The bill's co-sponsors, who included Carlos Menchaca and Justin L. Brannan, both Democrats of Brooklyn, applauded its passage.
"Frankly, unless a business is making people sick, endangering the public or treating people unfairly, I don't see why the city should be fining them at all," Councilman Brannan said in a statement.
"This bill will help small businesses with signs they thought were perfectly legal but have suddenly been targeted with exorbitant fines."
Councilman Menchaca is also arguing for a permanent change in how the city adjudicates violations related to signs and awnings. In a statement, he said businesses should get a citation or warning, not a civil penalty, if a violation is found.
"We need to address the root cause, and change the regulations from the bottom up so this doesn't happen again," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Within a few blocks are the headquarters of the Internal Revenue Service and the Commerce and Justice Departments, which furloughed tens of thousands of federal employees or required many to work without pay.
At Nordstrom Rack on E Street, 10 or more customers are typically lined up at the checkout register around midday as federal workers stop in during their lunch hour. There was no line Tuesday, and manager Mary Alvarez said a drop in sales of roughly 25 percent during the closure has forced the layoff of five or six workers.
“January is normally a slow month, but with the shutdown it’s double,” Alvarez said. “We’re struggling to hold onto our employees. ”
Several blocks away, the Eye Street Grill shares a building with the Federal Aviation Administration, which has furloughed about 18,000 nonessential employees since Dec. 22. Restaurant owners Yang Soon Kim and husband Il hawn Kim were already reeling from the usual holiday slowdown, but the minimal traffic at the usually bustling buffet line for breakfast and lunch heightened their concerns.
More: I lost my job because of the government shutdown, and my family isn't the only one at risk
They’re thankful the Department of Veterans Affairs across the street remains open.
“If the VA closed, we’d be almost dead," she said.
Outside the nation’s capital, the shutdown’s most obvious impact has come in the form of trash pileups and overflowing toilets at national parks, where bathrooms have been closed and garbage is not getting picked up. Tuesday, Joshua Tree National Park in California said it would close down Thursday morning to address maintenance issues.
Security lines are getting longer at airports hampered by record numbers of Transportation Security Administration employees calling in sick.
Averting a massive outcry, the Trump administration announced Monday that tax refunds would be issued even if the shutdown lasts into the filing season, which begins Jan. 28 this year.
Federal employees are scheduled to begin missing paychecks this week. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. , said of the closure, “In another context, we would call that an act of kidnapping or terrorism. … This is devastating to morale and devastating to efficiency. ’’
Americans feel the impact in a number of ways as the Departments of Agriculture, Homeland Security, Transportation, Justice, Interior, State, Commerce and Housing and Urban Development have temporarily closed their doors.
•Accidents such as last week’s horrific crash in Florida that killed seven people – five of them children on the way to Disney World – are not being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board, whose employees are mostly on furlough.
Accident investigators rely on the NTSB’s reconstruction efforts to pinpoint the cause, and those findings are used to recommend safety improvements on the nation’s highways.
•The U. S. Department of Agriculture will delay the release of crucial crop reports that investors and farmers rely on to get a sense for what the agricultural market will look like in the upcoming season.
The USDA runs the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and there was concern the benefit commonly known as food stamps would be affected by the shutdown, but the agency announced Tuesday that the 44 million recipients could count on them at least through February.
•Members of Native American tribes may have their health care and education programs threatened by the shutdown. Those services were guaranteed by the federal government as part of treaties in exchange for large extensions of land, but The New York Times reported that the Bureau of Indian Affairs furloughed 2,295 of its 4,057 employees, curtailing service.
•The Smithsonian Institution, which welcomed 30 million visitors in 2017 and includes the National Zoo in Washington, has temporarily closed. The Smithsonian – a cultural treasure with free admission – is composed of 19 museums and the zoo, mostly in the nation’s capital but including two in New York.
•The courts that review the cases of undocumented immigrants will see their backlog increase because more than 300 judges have been furloughed. Current cases of detained immigrants will continue as scheduled, but future ones will be delayed, possibly for years.
•While access to national parks is curtailed, dozens of weddings planned for those sites had to be relocated or rescheduled.
•Fans of creative craft beers will have to settle for their current choices for a while, because the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has ceased operations during the shutdown, meaning no new labels will get approved until the folks in Washington reach a deal.
Could a new beer summit be in the offing? Don’t hold your breath.

High Tax Rates Aren't Optimal; Nobody really thinks a top rate of 70% or 80% is a good idea in the real world.

Texto completo: Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner, wears his learning lightly in his New York Times column, all the better apparently to focus on his real purpose: characterizing anyone associated with "the right" as an evil idiot.
This week he leapt to the defense of Democratic freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's idea of paying for a "Green New Deal" with a 70% marginal tax rate on the incomes of top earners.
Now your intuition might be that neurosurgeons and other highly paid folk would work less if the government took 70% of the proceeds. Or that lobbyists and politicians would find it remunerative to arrange loopholes on behalf of these taxpayers, which would also negate the hoped-for revenues.
But Mr. Krugman cites studies that suggest these effects are negligible. The superfluous earnings of these taxpayers aren't really so valued by themselves or by society. A 2011 paper by Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez, based on a variety of extrapolations, calculates that the "optimal" top tax rate is 73%. A paper the same year by Christina and David Romer finds an even higher "revenue maximizing" top tax rate of 84%.
Case closed? Not even slightly. Messrs. Saez and Diamond are describing a world in which the wealthy have no opportunity to shield or hide their incomes. Look closely and the authors' "optimal" top federal rate quickly becomes 48% in a tax code like America's when state taxes are included.
And not even the Romers are convinced by their 84% top rate. Their study looks only at interwar tax returns, when the tiny number of relevant taxpayers received mostly partnership and dividend income. Their work tells us nothing about an 84% rate's impact on labor effort in an economy like today's.
They also point out that some of their data are "imperfect" and the results "perverse." To wit, did the rich in the 1920s and '30s really spend more on machinery and equipment even as the tax hit went up, yet at the same time form fewer new businesses?
Their findings, they add, may be "confounded by the enormous shocks affecting the economy over this period" (war, inflation, deflation, depression). And their results fly in the face of "comparable postwar studies" that find significant detrimental effects from high marginal tax rates. On second thought, their own study may find such effects too if their discovery of reduced business incorporations in the 1920s and '30s "holds up under further scrutiny."
You would hardly call this a strong basis for junking the well-established principle that 80 is more than 20, and prospective earners and taxpayers treat it as such.
In fact, the Romers are right: A large and growing literature continues to support the claim that high marginal tax rates and big tax hikes are harmful to economic well-being. See the work of the Dallas Fed's Karel Mertens and colleagues, or the Romers' own 2010 work finding a "highly contractionary" effect from postwar tax hikes.
The theoretical cases for towering "optimal" tax rates that Mr. Krugman cites always tend to trip up over political realities if nothing else. Politicians may find it politically handy to be seen dinging the rich, but they also find it useful to placate the rich by dishing out loopholes. The net result isn't more revenue. It's more efficiency-inhibiting economic distortions.
We would also appeal to a simple, real-world intuition. Take Mr. Krugman's suggested 70% rate on incomes over $1 million. If it were really possible to fatten government spending annually by as much as $650 billion (to use 2016 tax data) without killing the golden goose, we have to believe U.S. politicians would be doing so already.
Ditto Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's proposal to tax only income above $10 million at 70%, which might theoretically yield $224 billion. Except all evidence suggests that the richest taxpayers are the most diligent about mobilizing lobbyists and politicians to finagle the tax code on their behalf.
The new congresswoman from Queens is to be admired for a plan that would hit her party's own blue-state voters hardest. But let's remember why we're having this discussion. Even $224 billion falls short of the estimated $1 trillion to $2 trillion in annual spending necessary to stabilize atmospheric CO2 by midcentury.
Her defenders will hasten to point out that she speaks only of zeroing out U.S. emissions, albeit by 2030. But U.S. emissions are only a 15% share (and shrinking) of the global total. Unless she has a plan for the rest of the world, her Green New Deal is self-refuting. She'd have the U.S. spending $224 billion annually to have no meaningful effect on climate.
But we digress. The real purpose of revisiting the alleged optimality of high marginal tax rates right now lies elsewhere. The goal is to make the spending plans of the ultraliberals sound plausible enough to lure millennial voters off the couch and into the voting booth. Like the young everywhere, they are excited by radical proposals as long as somebody else is paying.

Barber: All eyes on Boogie Cousins' return for Warriors

Texto completo: OAKLAND — The man who dominated the news for the Warriors on Tuesday night didn’t even play in their 122-95 win against the hapless New York Knicks at Oracle Arena. He sat at the end of the bench in a dark suit with high-rise cuffs, white socks and black sneakers.
That has been the usual spot for DeMarcus “Boogie” Cousins this season. He hasn’t played a real basketball game since Jan. 26, 2018, the night he tore his Achilles tendon while playing for the New Orleans Pelicans. Tuesday, multiple reports surfaced (the first I saw was from Marc Stein of the New York Times) saying that the Warriors are targeting Jan. 18, a game against the Clippers in Los Angeles, for the center’s much-anticipated return.
“I think it will happen around that time,” coach Steve Kerr confirmed. “It’s not as simple as ‘that’s the game.’ It’s somewhere in that neighborhood.”
This would be news under any circumstances, because Cousins was the Warriors’ splashy free-agent signing of 2018. His was one of the more intriguing moves of the entire NBA offseason. A four-time All-Star, one of the craftiest and most skilled and most tempestuous players in basketball, had elected to sign a one-year deal with the two-time defending NBA champions for the shockingly low price of $5.3 million.
The addition of Cousins was a sensation, but mostly as a curiosity, because the Warriors looked practically invincible heading into the 2018-19 season. They didn’t need a fifth All-Star, but yeah, we’d be happy to feast our eyes on one for a few months, whenever he was able to run on two legs again.
As it turns out, Cousins’ arrival looms much larger than that, at least in the short term. He might be exactly what it takes to shake the Warriors out of the doldrums that have beset them this season.
Boogie Cousins isn’t a novelty, or a mere luxury item right now. He is a necessity.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this. The Warriors had said goodbye to three veteran centers in the summer — Zaza Pachulia, David West and JaVale McGee — but they felt good about starting the season with a triumvirate of young centers whom they expected to grow into the position.
Unfortunately for the Warriors, the replacements have fallen far short of expectations. Kevon Looney is a smart and reliable player, and a versatile defender, but he is neither big for the position (at 6-foot-9, he’s more of a power forward) nor particularly athletic. He can’t hang with true centers like Denver’s Nikola Jokic or Oklahoma City’s Steven Adams. The inconsistent Jordan Bell has been a major disappointment, and is out of favor. Just once in the past 10 games has he played more than 10 minutes; he didn’t enter Tuesday’s game until 5:33 remained in a Golden State blowout.
Damian Jones had the most promise as a post player, but he’s out with a significant injury, a torn pectoral muscle in his left arm.
So yes, the Warriors need DeMarcus Cousins. They need his scoring punch. They need his savvy and his size. They need his spark.
The Cousins Watch has been in effect all season, but now it’s getting real. He has been practicing with the team for several weeks, his workload increasing, his agility improving.

Texto completo: This article was reported and written in collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization.
Dr. José Baselga, who resigned his position as the top doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center after failing to disclose millions of dollars in payments from drug companies, is now going to work for one of them.
AstraZeneca, the British-Swedish drug maker, announced on Monday that it had hired Dr. Baselga as its head of research and development in oncology, a newly created unit that reflects the company's shift toward cancer treatments, one of the hottest areas in the drug industry.
In a statement, AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, described Dr. Baselga as "an outstanding scientific leader." "José's research and clinical achievements have led to the development of several innovative medicines, and he is an international thought leader in cancer care and clinical research," he said.
Dr. Baselga stepped down in September from his role as chief medical officer at the cancer center after The New York Times and ProPublica reported that he had failed to accurately disclose his conflicts of interest in dozens of articles in medical journals. He later resigned from the boards of the drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb and the radiation equipment manufacturer Varian Medical Systems.
Although Memorial Sloan Kettering has said that Dr. Baselga was not fired, hospital leaders have indicated that he was forced out. In October, Douglas A. Warner III, then the chairman of the cancer center's board, told the staff that Dr. Baselga's actions "left us no choice."
In December, the American Association for Cancer Research said that Dr. Baselga, at its request, had resigned his post as one of two editors in chief of its medical journal Cancer Discovery because he did "not adhere to the high standards" of conflict-of-interest disclosures that the group expects of its leaders. Some of his omissions involved articles that were published in Cancer Discovery while he was an editor in chief.
A spokesman for AstraZeneca said Dr. Baselga was not available for comment, but the doctor told Reuters on Monday that he took responsibility for his disclosure lapses. He also said the cancer association had concluded his failures were "inadvertent," and said many of his company relationships were publicly available on a federal database of physician payments by drug and device manufacturers. However, some of the relationships that Dr. Baselga failed to disclose were with small biotech start-ups that are not required to report to the federal government.
"Dr. Baselga is one of the best scientists in the field of oncology," said the spokesman, Gonzalo Viña. "We evaluated the series of inadvertent omissions, which have since been addressed and it is not for us to comment about the previous roles he held."
AstraZeneca paid Dr. Baselga $28,750 for consulting work in 2013 and 2014 related to unspecified drugs, according to the federal database. He failed to disclose any relationships with companies, including AstraZeneca, in dozens of articles in recent years.
Dr. Baselga, 59, is an expert in breast cancer research and played a key role in the development of Herceptin by Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche. He came to Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2013 after serving as chief of hematology and oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Before that, he was a leader at the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain.
Since September, Dr. Baselga has corrected his conflict-of-interest disclosures in several journals, including in The New England Journal of Medicine and in Cancer Discovery. In a note that accompanied Dr. Baselga's correction in The New England Journal of Medicine, editors described his failure as a "breach of trust."
AstraZeneca's decision to hire Dr. Baselga is part of an effort by the drug maker to focus more directly on cancer research, which has generated extensive interest from investors and companies in recent years amid a series of breakthroughs. The company sells several cancer drugs, including the lung cancer drug Tagrisso and Lynparza, which treats a number of cancers. It has suffered some recent setbacks, such as a failed trial of its lung cancer drug Imfinzi.
Under the company's new structure, Dr. Baselga will oversee the development of cancer drugs from early research to late-stage clinical trials, and a separate research unit will focus on other disease areas. Each unit will have its own commercial team to promote the products.
"This new structure will support growth and sharpen the focus on our main therapy areas, speeding up decisions and making us more productive in our mission to bring innovative medicines to patients," Mr. Soriot said in the statement.
In the same statement, Dr. Baselga described his new role as a "dream job" and said the reorganization will "accelerate our work to bring transformative medicines to patients."
Charles Ornstein is a senior editor at ProPublica.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Like lots of Americans, Robert Frese is not shy about expressing his views on the internet. Last year, in a comment on a newspaper's Facebook page, he said a New Hampshire police officer who had given him a traffic citation was "a dirty cop." The police chief, Mr. Frese added, was a coward who had covered up the matter.
The police officers might have looked the other way. They might have responded, explaining their positions and letting readers decide who was right. They might have filed a civil suit for libel, seeking money from Mr. Frese.
Instead, they did a fourth thing, one that seems at odds with the American commitment to free expression, particularly where criticism of government officials is concerned. They arrested Mr. Frese, saying he had committed criminal libel.
About half of states have laws making libel a crime, and prosecutions are not uncommon. About 25 people were charged with violating New Hampshire's law from 2009 to 2017, according to a lawsuit filed last month on behalf of Mr. Frese by the American Civil Liberties Union. Nationwide, according to a preliminary count by Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, "it appears that they happen about 20 times per year, and often lead to convictions."
Mr. Frese himself has faced two prosecutions. The first, in Hudson, N.H., was prompted by his negative statements about a life coaching business. It ended in a guilty plea and a $1,488 fine, with $1,116 of it suspended.
The second, in Exeter, N.H., concerned his recent statements about the police there. It was dismissed after the state attorney general's office expressed doubts about the constitutionality of the prosecution.
The New Hampshire law is fairly typical. It makes it a misdemeanor for anyone to say or write something "he knows to be false and knows will tend to expose any other living person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule."
Brian Hauss, an A.C.L.U. lawyer, said the New Hampshire law and others like it violated the First Amendment.
"The fundamental defect of criminal libel statutes is that they're unconstitutionally vague," he said. "The practical result of that is that police departments, like the police department in Exeter, get to choose when they want to go after speech that is arguably defamatory."
The defendant in the case is Gordon MacDonald, New Hampshire's attorney general. A spokeswoman for his office declined to comment, but a memorandum on Mr. Frese's case from a lawyer in his office appears to set out his basic position.
The lawyer, Elizabeth A. Lahey, said the state's criminal libel law was constitutional, as it required prosecutors to prove that Mr. Frese knew he was saying something false in criticizing the police chief. (That is an even higher bar than the one required in civil libel cases brought by public officials. Under the Supreme Court's 1964 decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, they must prove "actual malice" -- that the defendant knew what he said was false or acted with reckless disregard as to the statement's truth.)
The problem with the prosecution of Mr. Frese, Ms. Lahey wrote, was that the authorities had no reason to think he believed his statements were false. The Exeter Police Department dropped the prosecution after getting Ms. Lahey's memo.
Letting government officials prosecute their critics for supposed misstatements is a dangerous business. But not every criminal libel prosecution concerns official conduct, and people who have studied the matter say criminal libel prosecutions may have a role to play in vindicating damaged reputations.
Professor Volokh, an authority on the First Amendment, said narrowly written criminal libel laws were constitutional. A 1964 Supreme Court decision, Garrison v. Louisiana, struck down a state criminal libel law, but only because it did not require proof of actual malice in cases concerning public officials. The majority opinion, from Justice William J. Brennan Jr., suggested that criminal laws that included an actual malice requirement were permissible.
Mr. Hauss, the A.C.L.U. lawyer, said the Garrison decision did not address the argument that criminal libel laws are unconstitutionally vague.
I asked Professor Volokh whether criminal libel laws were good policy.
"That's hard to tell," he said. "On one hand, they can certainly be abused for political purposes, and they can deter even true statements, if the speaker is worried that a prosecutor and a jury will think the statements are false."
On the other hand, he said, civil lawsuits seeking money may do nothing to deter or punish someone who has no money. "Without the possibility of criminal libel law," he said, "there may be no real protection against many libels, especially now that the internet has substantially democratized mass communication -- both for good and for ill."
Mr. Hauss said the nature of internet discourse was a reason to do away with criminal libel laws. "Every day, there are millions of posts that are arguably defamatory online," he said. "But disproportionately, when criminal libel prosecutions are brought, they're brought by law enforcement and public officials to go after their critics."
The fact that some people are too poor to pay civil libel awards is not a reason to allow prosecutions, Mr. Hauss added. "If someone cannot afford to pay a civil judgment, they also probably lack the resources to hire a criminal defense lawyer," he said. "Without the aid of counsel, a criminal defendant will almost certainly plead guilty or be convicted at trial, regardless of whether their speech was actually defamatory."

Gender, Likability and Opportunity; Are reporters too busy telling tales about female politicians to notice female non-politicians?

Texto completo: Did you notice Friday's news that the American jobs boom is proving especially beneficial to U.S. females? For some reason media folk seem focused only on two particular job seekers who tend to look for work in Washington, D.C.
Nationwide, conditions are highly encouraging. "Women have been driving this year's improvements in labor force participation," notes the Journal's Lev Borodovsky. "Participation among women aged 25-34 years hit a multi-year high."
Whether young or old, U.S. women are not just entering the labor market; they are gaining jobs. In the last 12 months, the number of employed U.S. women age 20 years and older has increased by more than 1.6 million, according to the Department of Labor's household survey.
Labor's separate establishment survey of employers shows more good news for female job seekers, with women rising as a percentage of the U.S. workforce. At the margin, as America approached the end of year two of the Trump era, it appears the U.S. economy was becoming more hospitable to women relative to men. This doesn't easily fit into the popular media narrative about our times, so it may soon be lost in a flood of politicized analysis.
Money isn't everything and not every new job represents a happy story. Some new hires are working by necessity more than by choice. But the overall picture is one of expanding opportunity and the robust job market for women surely exerts a positive impact on many more lives than most politicians will.
Though the latest economic news is particularly good for the gals, the guys also have a lot to celebrate given what can only be considered a blowout month of job creation and rising wages . Outside of government, both sexes seem to be waging a war on the post-2008 new normal.
But of course it's what happens inside government that fascinates most of the press corps. Therefore many reporters have lately been most concerned about the opportunities available to two particular members of the U.S. labor force who, respectively, attended Yale's law school and taught at Harvard's.
Despite their expensive skills, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) are, in a popular media telling, not well liked because of sexism. Annie Linskey and David Weigel recently wrote in the Washington Post:
Just hours after Elizabeth Warren announced her plans to run for president, a question began surfacing about a possible weakness. It wasn't derived from opposition research into some facet of her life. It had nothing to do with her policy ideas.
It was the question often asked of female candidates and rarely of men: Is she "likable" enough to be president? Others put it another, potentially more devastating, way: Is she too much like Hillary Clinton to be the nominee?
In response, this column's most celebrated alumnus took to Twitter on Friday to post a series of dispatches demonstrating that not only had the question often been asked of men, and not only had the Washington Post often been the outlet doing the asking , but that a Post writer had actually deemed Mrs. Clinton's 2016 opponent--now-President Donald Trump--less likable than Mrs. Clinton.
The Post and other media outlets have been writing about male candidates' likability for decades and to their credit have at least been bipartisan if perhaps a little mean-spirited in raising such questions about presidential aspirants from Michael Dukakis to Ted Cruz.
Current claims of sexism may be bogus but that doesn't mean they can't be lucrative for some 2020 candidates. Karol Markowicz writes in the New York Post that Sen. Warren has been raising money by griping about a recent Politico piece by Natasha Korecki entitled, "Warren battles the ghosts of Hillary," which raised the likability question. Ms. Markowicz adds:
Korecki even quoted sources pushing back against the "unlikable" charge. "They say that about women," one Dem operative told Korecki. "As you go up the political ladder and go up in the polls, you will get that criticism. First it was Hillary Clinton. Then it was Nancy Pelosi. Now it's Elizabeth Warren. Who knows who is behind her."
Yes, they say "that" about three very similar women with very similar public personas. They don't say "that" about Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or even Kirsten Gillibrand. Harris and Gillibrand, two possible 2020 contenders, won't have their "likability" become a story, because whatever their flaws, likability isn't one of them.
With her foot-stomping about how likable she is, Warren merely exposed the modern use of identity to protect certain people from criticism. Fact is, Warren comes off as stern, abrasive and unfriendly.
Likability judgments are of course highly subjective. But if former Secretary of State Clinton and Sen. Warren don't like the reaction they're getting from voters, they could always consider jobs outside of politics.
Such jobs are plentiful thanks in part to a President who may not be likable but has enacted an economic program with very likable results for both genders.

Texto completo: Midsentence, Tyree Scott breaks off and bolts across the room.
He has noticed a subtle change in his son's breathing.
Mr. Scott's hearing is finely tuned to the rhythms of his 4-year-old son, Zahir, who has hypotonia and lacks the muscle tone to sit up on his own. So Mr. Scott adjusts his son's posture, adding another pillow to the couch.
"I was dealt the cards I was dealt," Mr. Scott said. "I don't know why, but God gave them to me."
Zahir also has epilepsy, difficulty swallowing and problems with his intestines. Cognitively, he has the ability of a 1- to 3-month old, and his motor skills are on par with a 2-month-old's, according to an assessment by the New York City Education Department. Food and water are fed directly to his stomach through a gastrostomy tube.
He is expected to rely on a wheelchair throughout his life, but he spends much of his time in his father's arms.
Zahir began living with his father full time when he was about a year old. When he was born, Mr. Scott, now 27, and Zahir's mother were separated but tried to raise their son together.
When the baby was 6 months old but could not lift his head, Mr. Scott grew concerned. A trip to the doctor for a chest cold started the cascade of Zahir's diagnoses, and Mr. Scott decided to push for custody. At the time, he was working nights at the Macy's on 34th Street. The demands of Zahir's care forced him to quit in 2016.
That year and the next, Mr. Scott found himself homeless, passing through shelters with his son in the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens. Taking Zahir on public transportation was hard, and there were stretches when he didn't have a working phone number. Mr. Scott said the start of Zahir's nursing care was delayed by six months because they moved around so much. Missed doctor appointments led to a case with the Administration for Children's Services.
"I used to sit down and cry sometimes," Mr. Scott said. "I cried and prayed."
He was desperate to provide for his son. He had no relationship with his own father, and his mother died when Mr. Scott was 2 years old, leading to a tumultuous time in foster care.
A doctor of Zahir's vouched for Mr. Scott's care to officials, and he was able to keep his son.
The inquiry opened the door for Mr. Scott to receive help and create a more stable environment. A doctor recommended to city officials that the two be placed in housing in the Bronx, close to Zahir's appointments at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore. Returning to the borough where Mr. Scott had spent much of his life proved to be a turning point.
Last year, Zahir began attending prekindergarten classes and receiving regular nursing care and physical therapy.
Mr. Scott took the requisite courses to become a licensed security guard and hopes to find a position this year. Right now, the Scotts live on $750 a month in Supplemental Security Income and $514 in monthly food stamps.
In October, they found stability with the help of a Living in Communities housing voucher, and Mr. Scott pays $177.53 a month out of pocket in rent for a new apartment in the Bronx. They sleep in the same bed and start their daily routine at 5 a.m.
But the walls were bare, the living room just a tile floor that stared back. So with the help of New Alternatives for Children, an agency supported by FPWA, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Mr. Scott received $1,000 for furniture. He purchased a sofa, table and TV stand.
Mr. Scott said he wants to push forward; he is focused on the next move for himself and his son.
"That is the heart of the story to young fathers: Just be there for your kids," Mr. Scott said. "Don't give up. It's not going to be hard forever if you stay focused."
Donations to the Neediest Cases may be made online, or with a check or over the phone.

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet. "Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Trump workers: They're illegal; Ex-staffer says the golf club management kept her off the Secret Service radar

Texto completo: A former kitchen employee at one of President Donald Trump's golf clubs in New Jersey said her superiors kept her name and those of other undocumented workers off a list of people to be vetted by the Secret Service before a Trump visit to the club in 2016.
Emma Torres, 43, an immigrant from Ecuador, said she informed a human resources official at the club that she did not have papers to live legally in the United States when she was asked to submit her information for a clearance check. She said the names of undocumented workers were then excised from a list turned over to the Secret Service.
Torres could not recall the name of the person who modified the list or the exact date of the incident.
But she said she continued in her job at the club and was later working in the kitchen when Trump visited the club under Secret Service protection.
Torres' account, first reported by The New York Times, suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.
Trump Organization officials and White House officials declined to comment.
The presence of undocumented workers at one of the president's signature golf clubs stands in sharp juxtaposition to his rhetoric against illegal immigration.
Since launching his White House bid, Trump has vowed to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out migrants, accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the country. His demand for more than $5 billion to build the wall has led to the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.
During his presidential campaign, Trump touted his company's hiring practices. In fall 2016, when he opened a new Trump hotel in Washington, he told the assembled audience: "We didn't have one illegal immigrant on the job. Everybody knows it."
Anibal Romero, a Newark-based immigration attorney, said he now represents five immigrants who say they had worked at Trump's Bedminster club without legal status in recent years.
Investigators with the FBI and the New Jersey attorney general's office have collected employment documents on his clients in recent months, he said, an indication that the agencies may be scrutinizing the hiring practices of the president's club.
Torres' experience and that of another worker suggest that the Secret Service may not have had a full picture of who was in proximity to Trump and his guests when they visited the Bedminster club.
Victorina Morales, 45, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who said she worked as a housekeeper in a different part of the club, cleaning Trump's villa, said Secret Service agents gave her a pin to wear every time Trump visited.
"I had to wear the pin to get into the golf club," Morales said in an interview Thursday. Morales said she recalls one pin having an American flag and another with a design that she did not recall.
Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said a Secret Service pin bearing the U.S. flag is a novelty item and "is not used by the Secret Service as a means of identification, verification or access control."
She declined to discuss what kind of pins agents may have provided Morales.
Official pins indicating that someone has permission to enter secure areas have other designs; they are provided to venue staffers by the Secret Service only after a background check, according to former officials.
It is unclear whether Morales received such a screening. She said she did not recall being asked to submit her information in advance but said she assumed her supervisor provided it.
Milhoan said the agency "does not comment on our protective operations, including the administration of our name-check program." She declined to say whether officials ever screened Morales or Torres for a Trump visit to the Bedminster club.
The revelations about undocumented workers at Bedminster surfaced publicly last month, when Morales and Sandra Diaz, a 46-year-old Costa Rican native, said they were hired by the New Jersey club despite their lack of legal immigration status.
Morales said Thursday that she told a Bedminster supervisor when she applied for the housekeeping job in 2013 that she did not have proper immigration papers to work legally in the United States. She recalled being told: "It's no problem here. You don't need papers."
"They knew I didn't have good papers," said Morales, who worked at the club until last month. Romero, her attorney, provided The Washington Post with payroll and tax documents from recent years that list her employment at the Bedminster golf course.
Trump Organization officials have repeatedly declined to address the specific allegations by the workers.
Last month, spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement: "We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately."
A person close to the organization said an internal investigation of claims made by former workers at Bedminster produced no credible information to support a range of allegations they made, including that managers were aware of employees without legal status.
Torres said she began working at the club in early 2015, doing housekeeping, then she moved to the kitchen staff, first as a dishwasher and later in food preparation, earning $14.50 per hour. She said she got the job with a fake Social Security number.
Morales said she worked with Torres in housekeeping and said she recalled her transferring to the kitchen staff.
Trump visited Bedminster at least six times during the 2016 campaign, according to news coverage of his travel. Around the time he became the Republican nominee, Torres said, security got tighter at the golf club, particularly when he was visiting.
Torres said she was later working at the club on occasions when Trump visited.
At times, Secret Service agents who accompanied him were Hispanic, Torres said, and the kitchen staffers would chat with them in Spanish.
Torres said she left her job in Bedminster in 2017 because she felt uncomfortable as a woman in a mostly male kitchen.
She also said she did not like Trump's comments about immigrants.

The sinking of the side wheel steamship Mistletoe

Texto completo: Built in 1852 along the Delaware River in Chester, PA, a 153' wood hulled side wheel ship was called Mistletoe. The builder and owner are not known. Nor is the bizarre name Mistletoe. Who might have given her such a name? Could it have had anything to do with the mistletoe plant or Christmas?
Mistletoe, with a beam of 26.7', displaced 362 gross tons and was powered by a 370 horsepower engine. The ship started out as a lighthouse tender with the official number of 222226, taking supplies to and from lighthouses in the New York area. But she soon became dated – that is too slow – and was sold as a fishing boat (what we today call a head boat; people signed up and paid individually for a day of fishing). The New York Times succinctly wrote "Younger and smarter craft long ago crowded the lumbering side-wheeler out of her job."
A paddlewheel moves a steamboat. With low drafts, paddlewheelers could go far up shallow rivers, exploring and supplying areas which were just being settled. Two kinds of paddlewheelers were used: a sternwheel was more effective, but was hard to design and build. They tended to be heavy. A sidewheeler was lighter and easier to construct. They were supply boats, and could clear trees from river beds in addition to acting as railroad ferries.
The Mistletoe took people fishing off Sandy Hook and areas where fish were plentiful. On the morning of May 5, 1924, she left the Battery at 8:15am under the command of Captain Dan Gully. There were 76 people aboard, including 15 women and 6 children. By 11:30am the ship had reached her destination and enthusiastic fishermen were fishing for whiting and ling. At 12:45 according to the New York Times, "A man went down into the aft cabin to change his coat and saw smoke coming from the hold."
All passengers were ordered to the bow by Captain Gully while the crew tried to fight the flames. Buckets and hoses were used, but the ship continued to burn. A nearby steamship, Hamilton, saw the burning Mistletoe, and radioed to the police which sent out Police Boat #3. Miraculously, within a half hour, all the passengers except the crew and those who fought the fire, were rescued by nearby fishing boats.
The New York Times article headlines were emphatic:
"76 rescued in bay from blazing boat. 50 year old
Mistletoe burns to water's edge off Ambrose Light.
Small craft rush to aid. Landing party, including
15 women, at Battery and Sheepshead Bay."
They credited "fishermen who quickly mobilized their little boats into a rescue squadron" near Sandy Hook for saving everyone aboard.
The New York Times article ended with a rather tacky observation:
"William Holmes said that the only incident in
getting off the burning craft was when a woman
weighing about 300lbs, who was a passenger, fell
into his arms and nearly carried them both over
the side. With the aid of two other passengers,
she was lowered safely into the fishing boat along
side."
Still trying to fight the fire, Captain Gully almost lost his life when he was engulfed by smoke and collapsed. He was taken aboard Police Boat #3. By the time Fire Boat William Gaynor reached the Mistletoe, she had burned completely to the waterline. The loss was estimated at $50,000 by Captain Gully which, in retrospect, seems a bit high. Cause of the fire was never determined.
Today, the Mistletoe sits on the bottom in about 42' of water off East Rockaway Inlet in the area well known as Wreck Valley. It is a popular diving site, 42' deep, where divers can still see parts of the paddlewheels, the boiler, and copper sheeting which once covered the hull. The area is still an excellent place to fish, and divers can spear fish near the Mistletoe. Dan Berg, owner of Wreck Valley Charters, has seen old pictures showing passengers waiting to be rescued on the upper deck.
The Mistletoe's American flag was flying upside down. This is a distress signal.

Marijuana Is More Dangerous Than You Think; As legalization spreads, more Americans are becoming heavy users of cannabis, despite its links to violence and mental illness

Over the past 30 years, a shrewd and expensive lobbying campaign has made Americans more tolerant of marijuana. In November 2018, Michigan became the 10th state to legalize recreational cannabis use; New Jersey and others may soon follow. Already, more than 200 million Americans live in states that have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. Yet even as marijuana use has become more socially acceptable, psychiatrists and epidemiologists have reached a consensus that it presents more serious risks than most people realize.
Contrary to the predictions of both advocates and opponents, legalization hasn't led to a huge increase in people using the drug casually. About 15% of Americans used cannabis at least once in 2017, up from 10% in 2006, according to the federal government's National Survey on Drug Use and Health. By contrast, almost 70% of Americans had an alcoholic drink in the past year.
But the number of Americans who use cannabis heavily is soaring. In 2006, about 3 million Americans reported using the drug at least 300 times a year, the standard for daily use. By 2017, that number had increased to 8 million--approaching the 12 million Americans who drank every day. Put another way, only one in 15 drinkers consumed alcohol daily; about one in five marijuana users used cannabis that often.
And they are consuming cannabis that is far more potent than ever before, as measured by the amount of THC it contains. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical responsible for the drug's psychoactive effects. In the 1970s, most marijuana contained less than 2% THC. Today, marijuana routinely contains 20-25% THC, thanks to sophisticated farming and cloning techniques and to the demand of users to get a stronger high more quickly. In states where cannabis is legal, many users prefer extracts that are nearly pure THC.
Cannabis advocates often argue that the drug can't be as neurotoxic as studies suggest because otherwise Western countries would have seen population-wide increases in psychosis alongside rising marijuana use. In reality, accurately tracking psychosis cases is impossible in the U.S. The government carefully tracks diseases such as cancer with central registries, but no such system exists for schizophrenia or other severe mental illnesses.
Some population-level data does exist, though. Research from Finland and Denmark, two countries that track mental illness more accurately, shows a significant increase in psychosis since 2000, following an increase in cannabis use. And last September, a large survey found a rise in serious mental illness in the U.S. too. In 2017, 7.5% of young adults met the criteria for serious mental illness, double the rate in 2008.
None of these studies prove that rising cannabis use has caused population-wide increases in psychosis or other mental illness, although they do offer suggestive evidence of a link. What is clear is that, in individual cases, marijuana can cause psychosis, and psychosis is a high risk factor for violence. What's more, much of that violence occurs when psychotic people are using drugs. As long as people with schizophrenia are avoiding recreational drugs, they are only moderately more likely to become violent than healthy people. But when they use drugs, their risk of violence skyrockets. The drug they are most likely to use is cannabis.
The most obvious way that cannabis fuels violence in psychotic people is through its tendency to cause paranoia. Even marijuana advocates acknowledge that the drug can cause paranoia; the risk is so obvious that users joke about it, and dispensaries advertise certain strains as less likely to do so. But for people with psychotic disorders, paranoia can fuel extreme violence. A 2007 paper in the Medical Journal of Australia looked at 88 defendants who had committed homicide during psychotic episodes. It found that most of the killers believed they were in danger from the victim, and almost two-thirds reported misusing cannabis--more than alcohol and amphetamines combined.
The link between marijuana and violence doesn't appear limited to people with pre-existing psychosis. Researchers have studied alcohol and violence for generations, proving that alcohol is a risk factor for domestic abuse, assault and even murder. Far less work has been done on marijuana, in part because advocates have stigmatized anyone who raises the issue. Still, there are studies showing that marijuana use is a significant risk factor for violence.
A 2012 paper in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, examining a federal survey of more than 9,000 adolescents, found that marijuana use was associated with a doubling of domestic violence in the U.S. A 2017 paper in the journal Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, examining drivers of violence among 6,000 British and Chinese men, found that drug use was linked to a fivefold increase in violence, and the drug used was nearly always cannabis.
Before states legalized recreational cannabis, advocates predicted that legalization would let police focus on hardened criminals rather than on marijuana smokers and thus reduce violent crime. Some advocates even claim that legalization has reduced violent crime: In a 2017 speech calling for federal legalization, Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) said that "these states are seeing decreases in violent crime."
But Mr. Booker is wrong. The first four states to legalize marijuana for recreational use were Colorado and Washington in 2014 and Alaska and Oregon in 2015. Combined, those four states had about 450 murders and 30,300 aggravated assaults in 2013. In 2017, they had almost 620 murders and 38,000 aggravated assaults--an increase far greater than the national average.
Knowing exactly how much of that increase is related to cannabis is impossible without researching every crime. But for centuries, people all over the world have understood that cannabis causes mental illness and violence--just as they've known that opiates cause addiction and overdose. Hard data on the relationship between marijuana and madness dates back 150 years, to British asylum registers in India.
Yet 20 years ago, the U.S. moved to encourage wider use of cannabis and opiates. In both cases, we decided we could outsmart these drugs--enjoying their benefits without their costs. And in both cases, we were wrong. Opiates are riskier than cannabis, and the overdose deaths they cause are a more imminent crisis, so public and government attention have focused on them. Soon, the mental illness and violence that follow cannabis use also may be too widespread to ignore.

Texto completo: TALLAHASSEE -- Filling top jobs at two of the most-scrutinized agencies in state government, incoming Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Thursday new secretaries of the Florida Department of Corrections and the Florida Department of Children and Families.

DeSantis named Mark Inch, a retired U.S. Army major general who also worked as director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, to serve as secretary of the Department of Corrections.

DeSantis also announced that Chad Poppell will head the mammoth Department of Children and Families. He served in outgoing Gov. Rick Scott's administration as secretary of the Department of Management Services before resigning in March 2017.

With DeSantis set to take the oath of office Tuesday, his transition team has gradually announced appointments to top administration positions.

The new secretaries of the Department of Corrections and the Department of Children and Families will take over agencies that in recent years have drawn scrutiny -- and litigation -- because of issues such as the treatment of inmates and tragedies involving abused children.

Inch will replace Julie Jones, who has served as corrections secretary since January 2015. In Thursday's announcement, DeSantis called Inch "one of the foremost experts on criminal justice."

"I look forward to working with him to strengthen Florida's Department of Corrections and ensure efficiency and accountability at such an important agency," DeSantis said.

Before being named to run the Federal Bureau of Prisons in September 2017, Inch's Army career specialized in military incarceration. Inch left the federal prisons position last year after what The New York Times called a "turf" battle between presidential adviser Jared Kushner and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

While Inch's career has been focused on the military and federal system, DeSantis' appointment of Poppell continued moves to bring back some current and former members of Scott's administration.

Prior to serving as secretary of the Department of Management Services, which oversees issues such as state human resources, procurement and real estate, Poppell worked as chief of staff at the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity.

"Chad Poppell is a dedicated public servant with a proven track record of achievement within the public sector," DeSantis said in a statement. "From this service at the Department of Economic Opportunity to his leadership at the Department of Management Services, Chad is the kind of leader who will be committed to strengthening Florida's families and fighting for Florida's children."

Since leaving state government, Poppell has worked as an IBM industry client leader for Florida's public sector.

The Department of Children and Families has been led since September by interim Secretary Rebecca Kapusta. She replaced longtime Secretary Mike Carroll, who resigned last year.

Along with the choice of Poppell to run the Department of Children and Families, DeSantis' decisions to hire people with ties to the Scott administration have included appointing Visit Florida chief Ken Lawson to serve as executive director of the Department of Economic Opportunity.

Also, DeSantis has kept Agency for Persons with Disabilities Director Barbara Palmer and Florida Lottery Secretary Jim Poppell and has retained Scott's budget director, Cynthia Kelly.

Texto completo: In a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times Magazine, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called President Donald Trump "without question the worst president we’ve ever had. "
"We’ve had some bad ones, and there’s not even a close second to him," the Nevada Democrat told the Times in an article that covered Reid's time as Senate majority leader, his relationship with his Democratic successor, Chuck Schumer, and his view on Trump's former Cabinet members.
Reid, who now lives in the suburbs of Las Vegas, the Times reported, also called Trump "an interesting person" but stopped short of calling him immoral.
"He is not immoral but is amoral. Amoral is when you shoot someone in the head, it doesn’t make a difference. No conscience," Reid told the Times. He also described Trump not as someone with a pessimistic worldview but rather, "a person who is oblivious to the real world. "
More: President Trump says government shutdown, now in 12th day, could last a 'long time'
From April 2018: Harry Reid says impeaching President Trump isn't the answer: 'I say to everybody, stop it'
Reid served as majority leader from 2007 to 2015, during which he was instrumental in passing former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act.
In the interview, Reid also defended on his decision to do away with filibusters in judicial appointments – a move that, as the Times notes, cleared the way for Republicans and Trump to land two conservatives justices on the Supreme Court.
"They can say what they want," Reid told the newspaper. "We had over 100 judges that we couldn’t get approved, so I had no choice. Either Obama’s presidency would be a joke or Obama’s presidency would be one of fruition. "
Reid left the Senate after deciding not to seek re-election in the November 2016 elections. The decision came shortly after he was injured in an exercise accident. Then, in 2018, the Democrat had surgery to remove a tumor in his pancreas.
More: Trump jokes about exercise band that blinded Harry Reid in one eye
More: Harry Reid body shames Donald Trump: 'He's not slim and trim'
His former chief off staff, David Krone, told the Times he thought the decision to leave Washington saved Reid.
"He wouldn’t be alive today if he had pancreatic cancer and he was still the Senate leader," Krone said. "He would not have made it. "
Krone also said he thinks Reid misses his time as a legislator. Reid told the Times he still speaks with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi often.
"I love Nancy Pelosi. We did so many good things, and we still talk about that," Reid told the newspaper.
As for the Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, Reid was more reserved when speaking with the Times, saying they rarely speak.
"'My personal feeling should have nothing to do with it,' he said. But clearly Reid has more than a few of those personal feelings," Times reporter Mark Leibovich wrote. Leibovich reported that Reid has been critical of Schumer in private.
Reid also addressed others he worked with in the Senate, namely Jeff Sessions, the former Alabama senator and attorney general.
"Why in the hell didn’t Sessions leave?" he wondered, saying the same of former White House chief of staff John Kelly.
"I’d say, 'Go screw yourself. ' I could not look my children in the eye," Reid told the Times.

Trump scenarios for new year

Texto completo: In this dark time of the year, usually a pretty slow period for politics, I like to write a column cataloging my errors of analysis and prognostication from the previous 365 days (or sometimes further back) of columnizing. This year, though, the pace of news makes that exercise feel a little self-indulgent, so I thought I'd just consider what has changed in the Trump presidency since last February, when I wrote a column describing our demagogic chief executive as "tamed."
Back then the Trump tamers were his fellow Republicans - the mix of senators and Cabinet officials who had steered his actual administration (not the Twitter version) into the channels of a semi-normal GOP presidency. Back then you could make a list of the wilder Trump campaign promises (or threats) and note how few of them had actually been implemented or pursued. Back then you could look at Donald Trump's economic agenda and his foreign policy and see something influenced more by Paul Ryan and James Mattis than by the president's distinctive impulses.
That was 10 months ago, and since then the Trump-administration world that I described has been deconstructed, piece by piece. The normalizing figures have departed or been unceremoniously dumped - whisk, H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn; goodbye, Jeff Sessions; time's up, John Kelly - and their provisional replacements have more of the island-of-misfit-toys feel that characterized Trump's inner circle in the 2016 campaign.
Meanwhile all year there has been more and more overt Trumpishness in the administration's policy moves - the trade warring, the end of the Iran deal, the performative cruelty and performative militarization at the border, the made-for-reality-TV dealmaking with North Korea, the president's strange fanboy encounter with Vladimir Putin.
And both trends, the personnel and the political, have reached a crescendo this Christmas season, with the sudden pullout from Syria, the equally sudden departure of James Mattis, the president's war with the Federal Reserve amid a tumbling stock market, and now a government shutdown over the Trumpiest sticking point of all, the fabled border wall. When NeverTrumpers envisioned the Trump presidency, it was basically the last couple weeks of headlines extended over four long years - Defense secretary quits while accusing Trump of being soft on Russia  Stock market tumbles as Trump denies plan to fire Fed Chair  Trump welcomes government shutdown over immigration  Trump pulls out of Syria after conversation with Turkish dictator 
So here we are, with Trump finally unbound, just as everyone who once opposed him had feared. Except that Trump unbound is also Trump hemmed in - no longer steered by the departing Mattis or guided by the unlamented Speaker Paul Ryan, but opposed directly by a Democratic House armed with subpoena power and prepared for political war. And Trump unbound is also Trump alone, his electoral mystique gone with the midterms and Senate Republicans more inclined to distance themselves the further off the policy reservation he goes and not even Chris Christie willing to take the job of managing his White House.
So the president is at once more dangerous and less so, more unconstrained and yet easier to balk, more liberated and more isolated - a strange state of affairs even by the strange standards of this administration. And to save myself the embarrassment of future mea culpas, I won't make predictions but just offer scenarios for how this combination might shape the next exciting year of Trump.
The first possibility, and to my mind the least likely, is a return to (relative) normalcy. In this scenario Trump reacts to indicators he understands, the jittery stock market above all, by containing his impulses a little more, finding (somewhere) a new set of establishment hands to guide him, making the necessary deals with House Democrats, and hunkering down to survive what the Mueller investigation has to throw at him. D.C. politics becomes, by this presidency's standards, strangely boring; there is a grind of subpoenas and scandals but Republicans stick with Trump; there is zero policy progress and a basic Democratic advantage but no dramatic change.
The second possibility is one Elizabeth Drew, the chronicler of Watergate, sketched in a column on Thursday - a march to impeachment and perhaps Trump's resignation, in which the president's erratic behavior, the chaos it sows in markets and American alliances, and Republican self-interest end up in a mutually reinforcing dynamic, and after a devastating Mueller report, perhaps, key Senate Republicans finally deem the president "too great a burden to the party or too great a danger to the country" to continue in his office.
I find this scenario less likely than does Drew, but more likely than the return to normalcy. However it coexists with a third possibility that might be termed the Trump Vindicated scenario (or, for true Trump haters, the LOL Nothing Matters scenario), in which Trump unbound turns out to be no more unpopular than the tamed-by-the-establishment version, his preferred policies prove less destabilizing than all the wise men fear, and we get a 2019 in which Trump flails around but his approval ratings actually go  up?
This possibility is, I think, a somewhat underrated one, because some (not all!) of Trump's Trumpiest ideas are either more sensible or more popular than the establishment alternative. Ryan's agenda dragged down Trump's approval ratings, not the other way around, and the Kim Jong Un summit was as popular as anything he's done. Even in the chaotic controversies of the last few weeks there is at least a case for pulling out of Syria, perhaps a stronger one for pulling out of Afghanistan, certainly a case that the Fed's interest rate policies are hurting both stocks and workers  and little evidence that swing voters will be furious with Trump for ending poorly understood military missions or picking fights with central bankers.
But for Trump to be vindicated this way, by which I mean for him to retain a low-40s approval rating and avoid impeachment even as his administration is reduced (to swipe a joke from MSNBC's Chris Hayes) to his family, Stephen Miller and Mick Mulvaney roaming the White House like the Torrances in the Overlook Hotel, he would need his erratic governing style to avoid meeting a crisis large enough to make White House incompetence matter on a catastrophic scale.
And of course the man and the crisis might meet. So the final possibility worth considering as 2019 dawns is the same one that informed my opposition to Trump two years ago, which is that we should fear most from an unbound Trump isn't bad policy or sleaze or norm violations. It's that with Mattis gone and McMaster gone and Cohn gone and Kelly going and only Mulvaney and Jared and Steve "All is well!" Mnuchin at battle stations, the equivalent of 9/11 or the financial crisis will come along and things will get very, very dark before there's even time to read the full text of the 25th Amendment.
On that note, Happy New Year, America. And stay frosty out there, Mike Pence.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
Letitia James, the incoming New York attorney general, has made no secret of how she feels about President Trump.
She calls him an "illegitimate president." She says her decision to run for attorney general was largely "about that man in the White House who can't go a day without threatening our fundamental rights."
She has suggested that Mr. Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice, and implied that foreign governments channeled money to Mr. Trump's family's real estate holdings, which she characterized as a "pattern and practice of money laundering."
Democratic attorneys general across the country, including Ms. James's predecessors in New York, have repeatedly used their offices to confront Mr. Trump. But since her election, Ms. James has opened herself up to criticism that she has gone too far in allowing politics to shape her agenda.
Her strident attacks on the president could potentially threaten the legal standing of cases that her office brings against Mr. Trump, his family members or their business interests, legal experts said.
Mr. Trump recently accused Ms. James of winning her election on a "GET TRUMP agenda," and of doing "little else but rant, rave & politic against me."
Ms. James has signaled that she will be as aggressive as New York's current attorney general, Barbara D. Underwood, and her predecessor, Eric T. Schneiderman, both Democrats, in pursuing Mr. Trump in his home state.
She will continue a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that was filed by Ms. Underwood and may also examine whether Mr. Trump is in violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts, or emoluments, from foreign powers without congressional approval.
After an investigation by The New York Times showed that Mr. Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his parents, most of it by helping them dodge taxes, Ms. James issued a statement calling for "a full examination of these claims" by the state, including the attorney general's office.
"Donald Trump's days of defrauding Americans are coming to an end," Ms. James said.
Daniel S. Goldman, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and a former assistant United States attorney in Manhattan, said that it was unlikely that Ms. James's remarks could directly lead to a dismissal of charges against Mr. Trump, but that they could put cases in jeopardy because of an appearance of "an individualized political vendetta."
"If there were to be a motion to dismiss because of bias, the attorney general's office would have to show a stronger factual basis for the legal issue," Mr. Goldman said. "If there is a close call along the way, it could have an impact on the way a judge rules."
A similar issue arose in 2015 when Judge Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court in Manhattan chided Preet Bharara for publicly criticizing Sheldon Silver, the former New York Assembly speaker, after he was charged with corruption. Mr. Bharara, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, had suggested to reporters that Mr. Silver had "sold his office to line his pockets."
Mr. Silver asked for the charges to be dismissed. Judge Caproni declined, but said she was "troubled" that Mr. Bharara's remarks appeared to "bundle together unproven allegations" about Mr. Silver. She warned his office to try the case "in the courtroom and not in the press."
Mr. Goldman characterized Mr. Trump's criticism of Ms. James as the right message from the wrong messenger, given how Mr. Trump has used public remarks on Twitter to discredit criminal and civil investigations involving himself, his family and associates.
"Donald Trump is desperately trying to turn everything into a hyperpartisan issue, including criminal justice," Mr. Goldman said. "It's essential that prosecutors maintain their neutrality and an objective view of the facts and the evidence, no matter the politics involved."
In an interview, Ms. James defended her remarks about the president, adding that she believed that her race and gender were shaping what she characterized as assumptions and misconceptions about how she would perform as attorney general.
Ms. James is the first woman in New York to be elected as attorney general, the first African-American woman to be elected to statewide office, and the first African-American to serve as attorney general. Before winning election, she was the New York City public advocate.
"This is similar to when I was about to take office as public advocate, and individuals expressed concerns," Ms. James said. "What I have done repeatedly throughout my life is I have been underestimated and have continued to perform."
Ms. James's role could take on heightened significance should Mr. Trump decide to issue pardons for anyone implicated in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Convictions under state law, however, are not covered by federal pardons. Ms. James has championed a change in state law that would allow the prosecution of those who have been pardoned by the president.
The importance of Ms. James's position was underscored when Ms. Underwood's office announced on Dec. 18 that Mr. Trump and his lawyers had agreed to shut down the Donald J. Trump Foundation.
That agreement emerged from an investigation that began under Mr. Schneiderman, and from a lawsuit filed by Ms. Underwood.
The lawsuit, which seeks restitution and penalties and could result in Mr. Trump and his three oldest children being barred from the boards of other New York charities, will proceed under Ms. James's watch.
Mr. Trump's lawyers had argued that the case should be dismissed because it was politically motivated. A state judge ruled in November that the case could proceed.
Ms. James began her legal career as a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society, eventually becoming head of the New York attorney general's Brooklyn regional office. In 2003, she was elected to the New York City Council; she was elected as the New York City public advocate a decade later.
As public advocate, Ms. James sought to redefine the position: She filed 12 lawsuits on behalf of city residents, more than all of her predecessors combined, but to mixed results. A small handful of cases were thrown out because judges ruled that she lacked standing to file the lawsuits.
Even inside the attorney general's office, some shared concerns that Ms. James's outspoken approach toward Mr. Trump may undermine her efforts.
Eric Soufer, who served as senior counsel for policy for Mr. Schneiderman, said Ms. James's bluntness had caused "apprehension and uneasiness" among some high-level officials who have left the office after her election.
"You've got to let the cases do the talking," said Mr. Soufer, now a managing director at Tusk Strategies, a political consulting group. "She doesn't need to expose what she thinks about Donald Trump. What people want are results."
Ms. James acknowledged that her words and promises would carry more weight as attorney general.
"I recognize that this is the premier law office in this nation," Ms. James said in the interview. "I recognize that as the face of this office, one must be circumspect."
Days later, Ms. James was back in attack mode, telling NBC News that she would use "every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family."
